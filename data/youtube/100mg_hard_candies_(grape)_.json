{"KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of cup of and turn it on medium heat medium-high heat and you keep it there stirring until it starts to boil and then you stop stirring it till all the sugar dissolves in Sirte candy thermometer in [Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "cYKLWo_G95A": "hey everybody how you doing welcome back to sweet freaks candy thanks for checking out our youtube channel i'm here today doing a little video on a hard candy i'm making for a halloween mix and we are starting with a grape so this has already been um the flavor is already in the pot as well as the color and this one is grape i'm going to add some citric acid to it to give it a nice little sour taste so we'll have a sour grape music in the background i hope that doesn't [Music] so what i do first is now that i've poured it onto the candy cooling table i'm going to let it sit for just a minute to cool off just a bit because if i add the citric acid now there's a good chance that it could burn and give it a little bit of a funky flavor so i like to wait a little bit and then um can go from there so uh once the edges start getting a little bit um harder see how i'm able to kind of pull that off the cooling table so it's starting to cool down a little bit and like i said i'm using a grate today this is from uh lorann oils so we're using a grape flavoring and corn syrup pretty much the main ingredients there sugar obviously so we boil it to 310 degrees drop it on here it's probably cooling off enough now that i'm gonna add some citric acid and this is what gives it that nice little sour flavor and it kind of looks like a lot you're thinking oh man but uh actually kind of dissolves into the candy a little bit as well and and uh isn't too bad so once i do that i like to fold it in so i kind of make this little pocket here i'm going to trap all that citric acid into there and then this is the part where you actually let the candy do the work i fold it in and as you can tell it's starting to harden up a little bit already this is probably make about a two and a half pound batch but as i fold it in and do this and it starts to uh the citric acid will dissolve into the candy and once i get it to a consistency that i like we'll take it over to the heating table where we can um pull and cut it so this will be for a handout that i'm doing for a farmer's market um on halloween so i'm actually gonna be hanging out my own candy so let's be a little mix for all the kids to come and get it back for me and this is the part where i just kind of let the candy do the work [Music] you still see some of that citric acid in there we're also going to pull it a little bit to give it that uh what it does is it traps air bubbles inside of it and gives the candy a little bit more uh volume to it and also it won't be as hard even though it's a hard candy um we're gonna pull it enough to where it's got some air into it so it's not going to just uh be completely solid and break a tooth if you bite into it so it'll kind of crumble it also distributes the flavor and the acid evenly so as you can tell now i'm starting to get kind of a little bit more consistency to it almost like a play-doh and at this point it's still very hot um but i can kind of manipulate it this is where i'll pull it a little bit and i don't want to pull it too much because trapping the air bubbles inside of this candy what it does is it also reflects light so the more that you pull it the lighter and more pastel the candy's going to get and for a halloween candy i want this purple to be pretty dark i have done some other ones where i've pulled the candy and made it very light and added black um coloring to it and like a stripe to kind of do that but this just being a small little free handout i'm just going to kind of make it i want to pull it a little bit you can kind of see here as i pulled a little bit it's gonna trap those air bubbles and it's gonna reflect some light and as you can already tell it's a little bit lighter than it was see that there so once i get it to about exactly where i want it which this is probably pretty good we're going to take it over to our cooling table or to our heating table i'm sorry so let's head on over there this is our little setup here for our heating table let me set this up for you guys so i've already got two pans set up for when i cut there we go for when i'm cutting it to get it just right for you guys there so you can get a good idea of what i'm doing let me see if i add some light there if that helps let me know if that helps this being my first video i'm kind of testing some of the uh lighting and different things that i'm using so um what i have here is just a oversized griddle with some silpats on it to get it nice and i don't need it hot because the candy will melt so what i'm doing is just keeping it from completely cooling down and getting too hard so that i can still manipulate it pull it and cut it i like to use ten and a half inch scissors so i like to make kind of this little design like this and what that does is it kind of keeps it hotter up here because it is um a little bit thicker but as i pull it i pull it from this end and i get the consistency that i want coming out of that so as you can see it's still a little bit too soft because if i tried to pull this right now it would just kind of really thin out [Music] and i'll show you what it does when that happens i'll pull from the other side and this is just kind of a test run on the consistency so i'm not too worried about it you could actually put this back into the candy if you wanted to and what this does is the way that i cut them it makes these nice little pillows nice little bite-sized pillows and just from doing it for for as long as i have and as many times as i have i kind of have an idea of the consistency that i want as far as the size and thickness of the candy and the reason i have two pans is that i still pull it when it's a little bit hot and so if you do them all together they can stick together um obviously once they cool down you just drop them in there but for me it's just easier and like i said you'll get these nice little pillows when you're done i call them little candy pillows um it's just from pinching each side with the scissors and it's kind of uh really gives it that homemade look and feel to it um you know that people really know that i've done all this by hand people are kind of surprised sometimes when i say that i've cut and make each each piece by hand instead of at a machine and i'm not worried about having every piece exactly the same size i mean i like to have a good consistency and i think you know those look great um sometimes i do get a bigger piece or a smaller piece but i do it by weight when i when i do them so that uh uh you're gonna get the same amount of candy every time there might be a couple bigger or smaller pieces but um that's you know you'll get the same amount every time then i just keep flipping it making sure i get the same amount same consistency pulled off every time make nice little so just starting out this channel you guys let me know comment down below let me know what colors you'd like to see what flavors um any questions you might have i can also make i will be doing some videos that are multi-colored to kind of show you how to uh put more than one one color together and how i build them and and get it a nice looking piece of candy so i will be doing a couple videos on that and obviously if you guys would like to try any of this candy um you can go to my website at sweetfreakscandy.com and check out any of our i think right now i've got about 36 flavors in stock you can check them out have them shipped to you and if you see any flavors that you like on any of these videos let me know and we'll be doing a discount code the discount code will be uh youtube and if you put that in it will give you 20 off of your order so that's another reason to uh watch it so on these um on this heating unit this griddle i never really go past warmth because then that will get it too hot to where the candy will start to melt but as i go and it gets smaller and smaller it gets a little bit harder so i turn it up just a bit to keep it going i'm going to start doing a little bit longer pieces [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and that's all there is to it guys so like i said if you'd like to check out any of this candy go to sweetfreakscandy.com comment down below let me know what uh you guys want to see if you guys like the video it is my first one doing it this way so i'll figure out the lighting and kind of the angles and everything to make sure that it's okay but for now that's what we have to work with and there's your finished product pretty cool so if you guys have any questions comment down below please like subscribe appreciate all the uh love and support that we could get on this channel it's brand new so like i said i will be putting in a youtube um promo code code will be youtube and that will be good at sweetfreakscandy.com thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you in the next video bye", "OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "vl1OacI9rXw": "okay welcome back you two today we're going to be doing candy grapes crack grapes candy grapes I've been extra light about it so we're gonna do them

we'll do it [Music] lazy", "Le6Ox7avobQ": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm gonna show you so I have these three that I got from Canada's mom that's grape flavored hundreds milligrams of THC this is the green apple same thing 100 grand 100 milligrams of THC and then this one is blue raspberry and 100 milligrams of THC so I'm gonna be doing a review today I'm gonna pick one and then I'll review that flavor and whatever and then so on I'll pick another day and I'll do you know grape and then the green apple so today I've decided to go with the the blue raspberry you get all of these a flavor at Canada's mo and I had a feeling that because it's summer and because it's hot I think all the cubes have stuck together so there's the top piece there's this yeah yeah doesn't have a smell but that's how they look so you get four cubes so I'm just gonna put it all in my mouth that's all because I can't even like it would be too hard to even try to break so if you're going to eat these individually they're 25 milligrams of THC per cube let's try I'm not really tasting the blue raspberry yet I'm tasting THC mm-hmm I could teach something but I don't know if it's the blue raspberry just like a little bit of a sweetness but um it's trying to cover the THC but it's not doing a very good job the THC I just coming out I just read in the back here they're from can occur concentrate so that's maybe that's who makes them and Canada does know sells them or I don't know I know that you get these at Ken abysmal they're slowly starting to break off the cubes but yeah I'm not uh not really I'm not really tasting the roster I taste something a little bit sweet but then like the THC is very overpowering I guess you could say so next five o'clock right now I'll come back when these kick in let you know what they're like once it's like usually they're pretty good I've never had a problem never ever had a problem with anything from Canada smell okay so I'm gonna let these dissolve come back when this is kicked in here it is again the medic medicated hard candies Canada's no I'll be back my kicks in okay so I'm back and this is kicked in [Music] what happened was okay so it started to kick in maybe a little bit after 6:00 and I thought well maybe like it's just like this is gonna be it type of thing so what happened was I rolled a joint and smoked it and if you want to see that part you'll have to see watch the video before this one because ed and I are but with making videos like on at the same time so that wasn't a very smart decision for me to smoke the joint but it's it's done stop it I can do now just like sit and wait it out so this is very good stuff I don't really feel like doing anything though like yeah I don't know we just don't feel like doing anything I'm very thirsty and there's no need to smoke a joint just maybe wait the extra five minutes cuz that's what I should have that's what I would have that's what I should have done is wait um maybe the extra five minutes and then I would have been like oh you know what I'm not gonna smoke this drink is here it comes but no there's another don't do what Donna does I'm just drinking coffee because it tastes good right now like it always tastes good but right now it tastes really good and um yeah go ahead go to cannabis mom and get those the hard candies all the packages over there darn it I should have grabbed it maybe I still will keep we'll hang on grab it and go back over there and show the I put my coffee down I don't think that's in the same place but okay this medicated hard candies getting my cannabis no they're good they're very good if you're just starting out then just try the one cube I don't I don't know don't do like more than one but one kit would be good um any any any um like any pains or anything I that I don't feel anything right now it feels good feels good and then at the same time like you don't feel like do anything either so you're not really enjoying it but you are in another way [Music] like I can talk about a lot of things but it probably has nothing to do like I fit you know what today was like the type of day that that like it's like and sort of like in the middle of August and [Music] it wasn't like too hot nor was it like to hold it was just like it was just right and I was just like I don't know like it reminded me of like when I was a kid and stuff that like those days those summer days like that like they were you know you'd be riding your bike or doing whatever like it was just uh it was just like a good day I can't remember those type of days and it was a good day and then at the same time I think like sometimes you get a couple like hot days in August and but then after that cuz like September's coming right and sometimes in September you get really really nice warm days which are okay but um the days like how today was like you know Falls coming and I love fall like I think it's like the best the best season out of all of them I just really love fall so that's what today and I don't know why I'm telling you this but yeah that's what that's what today was like it was like a perfect like temperature-wise day like at the same time like it when you're doing this it's very like real axing and stuff mm-hmm I'm not really hungry at all like it I'm not saying that I won't get hungry but uh hungry at all like so it doesn't really give you the munchies not not Radia way like it's um it's just about seven o'clock so yeah I'd say like the Munchie partly good I don't I don't feel hungry so my eyes feel very heavy though and yours you need a drink always cuz it really dries you out and what else I don't know I like the I like the edibles and then I like joints bonds are okay but like I think edibles are beta bowls and the joints so just are my thing I like to do that stuff because well the edibles like you just eat it and it it's a longer high so whatever reason that you're taking it for you you'll be good for a couple hours which why not and the joints well I just find those easier to inhale yeah I like to just smoke a joint it's okay and to do a bong thing like you're a bong toke I don't know what just I can't get it all in so like that's why they like I like the joints but like if I have to I can do the bong toes it just takes a little bit more or longer to the whole process type thing [Music] know what to say I can't know what to talk about I just don't know what to tell you guys like should I say this and I can probably know it's open I feel really good though this is this is a nice side this is a nice feeling I'm [Music] like I'm not paranoid like if somebody knocked on the door then I would be like oh [ __ ] even though there's nothing even to smell I would just be paranoid because how am I going to say to somebody like how am I even gonna talk to somebody because like my eyes you could just [ __ ] tell but you know you just know like I couldn't say oh no I have somebody's I don't want you I and I'd be like oh no like [ __ ] you can't even I can't even say that so yes if somebody was knocking at the door I I would get a little bit worried about that but otherwise it'll is like I wasn't that or whatever like I'm I'm okay I I just feel really good and relaxed and um it's just stuff that like if it makes you feel that relaxed that you kind of wish that you were sitting on a dock and just looking out there onto the water like you were just looking that's what or if you're like sitting on a dog and it was like either you know you were watching the Sun Rise or you know if you're watching inside today it's that kind of relaxing relaxed feeling and it goes well with coffee this this is what you feel and it feels like it feels like that except I'm not sitting on the dock watching the Sun set or rise up so but anyways that's what it makes you you feel like well sons like Hannah over there but it's not setting yet this I'll already be done this before it even said so those annoys I don't know if you can hear them you know those buzzing noises I think it's crickets or something or some type of insect you know that highlight noise that you hear but I remember I was a kid I don't know if you can hear her anyways as a kid because um like Killarney is not that big of a place so there's like lots of bush and stuff and and there's like little trails and stuff like that so like if you're out playing with your friends and then you guys decided to go on this trail and or go whatever into the long grass or whatever like stuff like that ain't always you'd get further out there and you can hear those buzzing those I don't know what insect that is and often sit like a cricket or oh I don't know what it is but so anyways when I hear that stuff that reminds you know I was a kid it's funny how like I don't know if it's like a 40 thing or it's gotta be maybe like 40 high and in your 40s or something and like when you think of like certain uh sound not yeah like sounds are like just certain things and you think like way but like when you were a kid and it seems like it was a long freaking time ago like it's not like you know when you know when you're 20 and you go yeah when I was a kid well when you that wasn't you know you're still kind of our kid at 20 but if 40s yeah it makes things seem a long time ago when maybe because if it is a long time ago or maybe because you just feel like that cuz like 40 years though that's that's pretty long I'm going to have to go make another coffee soon because I'm just about done this one and I need to like this bad has to be he liked me because I took everything off and washed it and [ __ ] I just don't feel like doing it no but it has to be done just like it just seems like it's gonna be a like a Wyatt like a couple minute job ooh yeah I was gonna turn into like this you know Ted minitor probably like 10 to 15 minutes to make this bad like that's I should have made it before or like while I was eating the edibles I should have made it then because they would have been done in a couple minutes now the only thing I have done is like I put the pillowcases on the on the pillows like the sheets and stuff are here but like the what is it like the mattress protector thing like I wash side and that's dried and everything else but hmm after you'll get that on the line on the clothesline so I was like go down and get that come back put that on and then put the sheets on and like and you gotta put like the blanket and comforter part so I'm really not looking forward to that but you know why I think um I I think I just need some more coffee and they need to just go sit down and you just think a little um I think that's it like I think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna enjoy it that's time I was you know worries about anything unless somebody knows so let's that's my review on it skid here's the package and get it at can abismo that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "qi6yG8bo5is": "[Music] what's up YouTube so today I'm gonna be showing you guys how I get these perfect looking candy grapes and can't crack grapes whatever you want to call them but stay tuned on how I make my candy grapes so right here I've already pre-mixed the mixture which is a half a cup of water half a cup of Cairo sir light Cairo serve and two cups of granulated sugar and I've already put it on the stove and brought it to a bowl here's my candy thermometer you can't see it but you bring it to about 295 to almost 300 degrees and you just let it sit on the stove and boil you do stir it up beforehand before you apply it on the stove you just stir to make sure it's mix very well and then you just let it cook and let it mix all together so now I'm gonna be adding my flavoring which is the watermelon flavor by Laura and all's and I'm just going to be adding one DRAM a full journal of this which is the whole bottle and I'll just go ahead and add it in and then I'm just going to go ahead and give it a stir [Music] so I'm just showing you how I'm stirring it up so you just want to make sure you start in all of the candy flavoring make sure it's all mixed in very well and I do use a silicone spatula so now I'm going to be taking my white food colouring and I'm going to be adding that in first you do want to use white just so it can be a thicker color or more vibrant color versus a transparent color with you just using a certain food color and I'm just any more white and then I'm going to go ahead and get that a stir and as you start itself you do want to make sure it's started up very good and big stand very well [Music] so now I'm going to be taking my green food coloring and this is my Loraine as well and I'm going to be adding that to the pot and then you just want to go ahead and give that a good stir is with them and you just want to make sure all of the color is makes them very nice and good if the color is too dark so you're liking all you have to do is just add in more white food coloring if you want it more darker then you're just adding more of the actual food color and I'm just going to continue to stir it all up make sure all of the color is mixed in well and I'm adding in more white because I don't like the actual color it is I'm trying to get like an olive green so I'm just adding in more white and then I add more green later and then I just completely stirred up [Music] so now I'm gonna go ahead and start the different process once I've stirred everything together and I do have my pot propped up so you just want to make sure you got you have all of your own grapes cleaned and prepped I did watch him I did drive them individually with the paper towel and I did um stick a toothpick and each grape so as you see me here I'm just dipping it straight down and then I make sure as I bring it up slowly I swirl it in a circular motion just make sure all of it is dripping down evenly and then I turn it right-side up and let it drip on down so it can you have an even coat so now I'm just dipping all of the grapes in the candy first [Music] so now I'm just going to be taking my Jolly Rancher mix which I have already previously unwrapped each individual Jolly Rancher and put them in the blender and as you see now I'm showing you the consistency a lot of people don't break up their Jolly Ranchers in the fine consistency which I don't like but hey you can do it to your preference I just make sure I'm covering coding all of the candy grape after I have dipped it in the candy so I'm just going to be showing you this process of me dipping the grape inside the candy and then immediately going in and coating it with the Jolly Rancher topping as you see me doing here and you do want to make sure you work fast with this because the candy does some hard and quick on both in the pot and on the grape so you do want to make sure you're going ed uh you know consistent speedy pace but you don't want to go too fast because you can't burn yourself [Music] [Music] so now they're I'm I'm finishing up I will be showing you guys how I remove the toothpicks and how I come the pot in the next own steps so right now I'm just cleaning the pipe all you have to do is just take a little water put it in the pie into this bring it to a boil [Music] and now I'll be showing you how I remove the toothpicks and which is the easier step you just removed the toothpicks and then I'll be showing you how the final product look this was a very easy process you guys candy grapes so easy so easy to make a lot of people make it hard but they are so easy to make once you get the hang of it is the really very easy process and it's just trial and error with the own candy grapes you do want to always be careful but I'm showing you guys two grapes and this is the finished product if you have any questions make sure you call me don't forget to like coming and subscribe and hit that Bell to get notified [Music]", "7sbBD0UQ7BQ": "was weird how your life changed but it's all right man started smoking weed so i thought about my life man [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome to my [ __ ] channel if you guys are new this is a great video for you guys to start with we are making as you guys seen from the title thc infused firecracker grapes i think they came out pretty good if you guys want to see them you have to stay tuned before we get this video started stop what you're doing make sure you subscribe make sure you turn on your post notifications so you're notified every single time another video like this uploads also just let me know down below if you guys want another video like this because i do have one other in mind and i think that i might just start doing cannabis infused foods and videos like that so let me know down below if that's something that you guys would like to see again without further ado let's get straight into the video but first it wouldn't be a video of mine if we weren't smoking all right all right all right welcome to my [ __ ] show and tell y'all okay so we're just gonna get the voiceover started bear with me i've never done a voiceover before but we're just going to hop straight into this so basically this part is optional we just wanted to take all the jolly ranchers out in one session so we could just throw them in the baggies that i'm about to put them in so that's what we're doing here damn okay so once you're done unwrapping all the jolly ranchers you want to throw them in a baggie if you don't have a food processor i'm just ratchet as [ __ ] and i didn't have a food processor so i decided to throw them in a baggie um double bag it triple back it and then use a hammer to basically hammer the hard candies down into a fine powder you really want the powder to be as fine as possible and have less bigger chunks of the jolly ranchers because it's a hard candy and it's not going to be really enjoyable to eat if there's really big hard crystals on the grapes yeah i'm saying it just doesn't make sense so crush those [ __ ] down make a little powder out of it or whatever now the powder is what it should look like those hard crystals i actually went back in and actually crushed them up finer here's the pot i'm gonna put half a cup of water half a cup of this cornstarch right here also sorry for the mess you know and just ignore that anyways so yeah so equal parts water and equal parts corn syrup and then you want to do two cups yes [ __ ] i know that's a lot of [ __ ] sugar two cups of sugar you want to mix that around i didn't turn the heat on until after so i can get all the ingredients in the pot and it won't start boiling i do recommend starting on like a medium heat and don't get into the hot heat yet here i am putting a lemon in the pot just because the recipe that i said the recipe that i listened to needs it said to put in some kind of citrus so i added this lemon here is the wax that i'm gonna put in each of these containers is 620 milligrams i believe and i basically put a little bit more than one and a half so it should be a pretty potent this is my regular ass broke ass thermometer your girl didn't buy no candy thermometer because [ __ ] it i was just gonna eye it so i was done with the thermometer it was not working now you see it start to boil it starts coming together you're gonna leave it boiling for a while i'm just mixing it up so it doesn't settle at the bottom and to make sure that all the sugar that's in the mixture is getting dissolved now you want to add some food coloring you want to add some food coloring when it hits about 250 to 260 degrees if you guys have a candy thermometer you don't need to stir the food coloring in because the bubbling itself is actually going to make the red color go throughout the pot you should see a red orange kind of color like this if you're doing it right [ __ ] if you're doing it right also you can use any food color you want damn [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] is taking so long my mom wanted to try a grape without the thc so that's just me digging my little fingers up in the syrup so i can get her grape before i add the wax into it god damn i'm taking another hit so here i'm scooping the wax out of the container and just throwing it straight into the pot you can use waxy i think you can use shatter i think you can use distillate honestly the mixture that is boiling is going to be so hot that is going to melt the wax just remember to use a dab tool to get all the wax out of there put it in the pot stir it around so it's mixed in there nice and good and it gets evenly distributed oh guess i have to cross it oh a little bit more oh oh that was a big chunk yep we're just stirring stirring stirring so because i don't have a candy thermometer you're supposed to be done at about 300 degrees you're supposed to let it start to cool a trick is if you don't have a candy thermometer get ice cold water and take some of the mixture and put it in the cold water and if it hardens then your candy is done this was difficult for me i think i ended up messing up on this part so don't listen to your girlfriend go get yourself a candy thermometer i swear but it didn't turn out too bad so i actually turned the heat off which is why you're seeing the bubbles start to go down we are almost done with our [ __ ] firecracker grapes y'all so i just took a um a skewer you can find these like where you barbecue or anything like that um i poked the grape put it in the syrup and now i'm just dipping it all in the jolly ranchers you do like such the jolly rancher mixture might get hard just continuously mix it with like a fork um and you maybe want to do like two different bowls or something when you do the jolly ranchers because it does get really hard especially once the candy syrup gets within the jolly ranchers it was quite difficult but you manage you manage you'll get there so just get a lot of syrup on there and start throwing all the powder all over your grapes and it should stick they should taste very very yummy oh yeah also you guys see the napkin because when you take the grapes and you wash the grapes you want to pat them dry before you take them you put them into the sugar mixture so that the sugar mixture sticks to the grapes that is very very important they will stick to the grapes without you doing it but it's gonna stick a whole lot better if you just dry them off first damn look how [ __ ] bomb these look i've been watching this like damn these look real good i better go in the house and have me some and that is it you guys thank you so much for watching this i can't wait to try these grapes and let you guys know how they tasted and if i got high or not i guess that's the question of the night since we did almost put i think we put about a thousand milligrams so we'll see how high they get us i will definitely let you guys know in the next video so make sure you subscribe make sure you hit the bell until you post notifications and i'll talk to you guys in the next one thank you for watching my video bye guys", "FW3Pi3C-32I": "hey

dress party just like I was checking out comments comment coming up Concord comment gonna make comments comment ok CC b9 Clare [Music] [Music]", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing because it looks so fun oh so good were the beers oh goodness she's looking at her little feet my bestie mary came and of course she brings your girl drink so this is what i'm drinking and she is drinking and OG mother law because she's just straight oh gee and my mom got wet mom Wow a white cloth so she has the white claw and then yeah we kept it more than lonely here so we are on our way out because girls like these shouldn't be kept at home yeah yeah okay so we're gonna go out and drink our beers mom we're gonna go out and drink our beers somewhere else because that's how we do things here but I hope that you guys liked the video you guys comment and subscribe please don't make me beg you guys but yeah the edible wasn't a big hit you guys like I said before in the last clip chance to say bye you guys Nuala by my okay yeah so bye see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands

for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "JUHxpsohsrI": "[Music] welcome to my channel I thank you for watching now let's make some candy grapes so let's go over the ingredients for the candy grades now I am gonna give you three recipes they're gonna be in the description box so just check that out one recipe is for a small really tiny badge and that's the one I'm gonna be doing now and then I'll give you two other recipes that are for like a little bit more grapes and one for a lot of grapes so the first thing you are going to need of course grapes I like to use the green grapes you don't have to use green you can use the red grace if you want but me personally I go with green grapes so I just picked these off in the grocery store I have some water back here and this bowl some light corn syrup I have some granulated sugar vanilla and here is a bottle of watermelon flavoring you can use a flavoring if you want to but you do not have to you can just use a vanilla only I have some blue Wilton full coloring this is a gel colors there is some white food coloring any kind of white food coloring that you have if you don't want your candy to be a certain color then you can just go ahead and dip them in clear candy meaning you will not use the white you will not use the blue but if you absolutely want a certain color you want your colors to pop you are gonna have to make sure you use the white and make sure you use the colored food coloring the next thing that I have is I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher flavored candy grapes I'm also gonna be making some a warhead flavored if you do not want the warhead you can use whatever you want like the fun dip you don't have to use any candy at all so if you want to make your own sour flavoring and then that way you can control how sour it is you can always just purchase some citric acid from Amazon and then you will just mix that citric acid with a little sanding sugar this is just a red Betty Crocker sugar it's just colored red and then you will just take pour some of this in a cup or a bowl and then you will add a little bit of the citric acid to that that's another option you can put nerds on here just do whatever you want so that's it for the ingredients right here as far as food now we're gonna go over the supplies you are gonna need a blender and that's my ninja blender if you are going to be using like the hard candy you need to use a blender and just make sure that your blender is dry your blender is not completely dry your Candy's gonna stick and then that will just cause another problem so just let your blender dry out completely before you chop up this candy the next thing you're gonna need are the sticks now for me I like to use these long sticks I got these sticks from the Dollar Tree you don't have to use those long sticks you can purchase you some regular old toothpicks toothpicks are fine I would suggest if this is like your first time you should get two picks that are at least six inches long that way that would give you some room to stay away from that heat and the reason why I use these long sticks is I was in the fire so I really don't like to get too close to that heat so even though I do make candy apples and stuff and I know everything is hot I still try my best to stay away from getting burned again so the next thing besides the sticks you are going to need a spatula that's my spatula their candy thermometer you can purchase this candy thermometer at Walmart they have different kinds or you can purchase this on Amazon this one in particular I ordered from Amazon but I have actually seen it at Walmart so this is the candy thermometer the same one you're using for your candy apples and then you are gonna need just any kind of pot to cook it and it doesn't have to be any special products and then you are going to need something to place the grapes on when you dip them so here I have a silicone baking mat if you don't have one that's fine you can just use some parchment paper I would suggest spray your parchment paper down with a little bit of cooking spray but you do not have to do that either okay do whatever you feel comfortable doing this is what I always tell you guys so the first thing you are gonna do is you're gonna take your grapes and just take each one off of the vine put it into your bowl and just don't use the ones that are broken like the ones that might have a slit in them just check your grapes and make sure you don't get any of those and you slimy ones and you are gonna clean your grapes the same way you've been cleaning your grapes for years he's just gonna run them under some water if you have some Veggie wash you can just use that veggie wash whatever way you've been cleaning your grapes just keep doing it like that so once you rinse these great all you are gonna use either like a colander or a strainer to just flush out all of that dirt that are on the grates and then leave your grapes sitting you're gonna pour your grapes onto a pay a plate lined with paper towels you're gonna need something that will help you drain all of that water out because the object is to get all the water off as much water as possible so at least let your grapes sit for two hours before you start and I know you might think that's a lot of time so maybe you can go one hour even just don't start dipping your grapes immediately please don't you don't want to have cold grapes don't dip your grapes straight out the fridge don't dip your grapes straight from being washed let them dry and let them become room temperature so that the candy will stick and also you will have less juices drooping out after you make them if it's not so cold and so wet okay so let's say these have been sitting out for two hours so now we are gonna put the sticks onto the grapes so of course it's pretty simple just take your stick place your stick into the side that's smooth you'll see that little tiny dot now you are gonna chop up your candy I am gonna chop up the Jolly Ranchers first so I just got a couple mixed flavors go right into the blender and just chop them up whatever way you like to chop them up there is no wrong or right way some people like I'm very fine almost like a powder and some people like them to be have little bits showing so just do it whichever way you prefer it to be and again like I said make sure your blender is not wet at all you're gonna give it a couple pulses and then I'm gonna check it so right now it's looking like that I'm gonna put them back in a couple more I don't like my finely diced up I like my - order like this it looks so pretty to me so I'm gonna be leaving mine like that and then of course at the bottom you are gonna have a lot of more finer shredded Jolly Ranchers done let's get these warheads so here is the warheads are done I got some green blue and yellow in here I'm just gonna dump this right into so the candy is all finished and I also have two packs of some colossal sour warheads that so I'm gonna be whatever leftover grapes I'll use this for but I only had two packs so I just went ahead and crushed it up using my mallet inside the package now let's get started making this candy this recipe right here is only gonna give you about 35 grapes so if you want to make way more than 35 you're gonna use the second recipe that I posted in the description box if you want to make about 80 or 90 you are gonna want to use like 90 to 100 you're gonna use the third recipe in the description box so first thing you are gonna put in is 1/2 cup of sugar just dump that right in there this just pot didn't have anything in it so just the sugar and then 1/4 cup of corn syrup and 1/4 cup of water then you're gonna start that um I normally like to start mine on medium and I have an electric stove so medium for me is about seven B twenty seven and eight I'll go eight just to speed it up a little more so once you add those three ingredients you just wanna mix it really fast it doesn't have to be fully mixed together just give it a couple of stir it'll mix itself not the bubble start going now for me I normally don't add my thermometer right now I add my thermometer once I hear the bubbles slowing down a little but if this is your first time I do suggest you add the thermometer right away just so that you'll be able to keep a better eye on it and make sure you don't go over the temperature which is 285 degrees Fahrenheit so that's what you're going for so here those bubbles that's the fast bubbles that's not what you're listening for you're listening for the slower about this when they're popping so quick like that that means it definitely is not ready yet you know you hear the bubbles they are slowing down and right now we are at about 200 won seats 110 degrees Fahrenheit and like I say we're going for it to 85 you notice how slow those bubbles are and that's how you know we are at 280 almost to 85 and it's time to take the candy off of the ice so you're gonna turn it off and take it completely off the ice once you take that off of the eye you are gonna add at your full coloring and I like to add just a few drops of white like I said if you aren't gonna be making this special color you can just go ahead and dip this clear do not have to add the white if you want your candy to be clear but if you don't want it to have that translucent candy you absolutely are going to need the white so that's my wife food coloring and now I'm going to add some of this blue here and I use popsicle sticks to get the food coloring out just dip it in there and then you're gonna put that right into our candy mixture and just make everything turn boo now we're gonna add the flavoring and normally I just add vanilla but you can add whatever flavor you want so if you have some flavoring oil you can use the pineapple watermelon they have pina colada they got tutti frutti strawberry whichever they have cotton candy to whatever flavor you would like your grapes to be I am NOT going to be using this today but if you are I suggest you use just a few drops of this are you gonna take and I drop her a brand new eyedropper and you're gonna put in or you can even use a medicine dropper put in about five or six drops of flavoring oil but I'm just gonna be using the vanilla now for the flavoring I'm just adding a few drops of vanilla just right on into my gut and just mix it up and be careful because those vanilla does make it pop a little so just watch your hands and just stir that up now if you are gonna be using vanilla you want a certain specific color you are gonna have to use clear vanilla extract like certain colors you can't use that brown vanilla extract because it will alter the color that you are going for candy is already too dupe so let's get started with this dipping yeah you're gonna take your grape on the stick and just drop it in pull it out and just let it drip for a couple of seconds let that extra candy drip off and then you want to twirl it a little that way you will get rid of that extra ring yeah then you're just gonna take your candy mixture I got my Jolly Ranchers right here and just drop it in there now you can have way coded how some people do it or you can fully code it I like to fully coat mine and as much candy as possible so we got one great here we're gonna keep on going so again I'm gonna take another grape and I am going to cover this one with Jolly Ranchers again like I said let that excess candy drip off and then you're just gonna turn it you'll get it off we're gonna take our Jolly Rancher mix here and just dip and place it on your silicon mat so we're just gonna move right along here nothing just keep it going you move this spatula out the way and get to different if it falls off of your stick because every once in a while you will get a great that falls off the stick just hurry up and grab it out of there it's okay it's no big deal just grab it out of there and I'm just alternating and then I will real quick do some in the powdered water head mixture like I said sometimes that's gonna happen but it's no big deal make sure you fully culture grape all the way to the end of the stick get that extra candy off and then this is going to be the powdered warhead mixture it's gonna be that yeah if for any reason your candy starts to get a little thick on you and starts hardening just pop it right back onto the stove and let it warm up for about 30 seconds however long it takes for your oven or your stove to get it back to this runny liquid farm just be careful and keep an eye on it because you do not want it to start burning if you leave it on too long just keep an eye on it and you might have to rerun your candy a bunch of times but there's no problem with that you can even save this candy and use it a few weeks later you don't have to use it all at once you can pour it onto your parchment paper or you can pour it onto your silicone baking mat and then break it up into pieces once it becomes hard put it in a ziplock baggie and just store it in your cabin until it's time to when you're ready to use it again see like now starting to get a little thick and that's what I'm gonna pop this back onto the stove you see that thickness I put it right back on to the eye just for a few seconds my daughters are gonna eat these grapes for sure by tomorrow afternoon they'll be all gone so on that we all warmed up and ready to start dipping again comes off the stick get it right back on there so that's pretty much it you guys if you have any questions you can always just let me know and I will for sure get back to you guys so that's it y'all and once they are done you're gonna let them try for a few minutes and then they should just fall right off the stick they should pop right off the stick just like that but that that candy match my nails I just know this thing yeah but they'll pop right off the stick and then you can just put these in a container and put them in the refrigerator until you're ready to eat them like I said they're gonna last that long but they should last 24 hours going into two days at the most and these are the grapes now and if you guys have any questions just leave them right in the comment section and I will get back to you thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you next time", "jtlJqBuXuzk": "alright hey y'all get ready to make some candy grapes alright the first thing you'll need is a bag of Jolly Ranchers I got the bag that was I think 248 at Walmart and first thing you gonna toss up I wrapped with the Jolly Ranchers and I'm using my blender to chop them up and I end up pressing post and it chopped it up to fine some people that have this like what kind of bigger pieces in my I was like powder kinda alright and right here you can see that how fine I made it the only thing with a jolly wrench day it's gonna get back you get hard so I end up putting it back in a blender later on alright next you're gonna need 2 cups of sugar I can get another cup of sugar [Music] there's a second cup of shirt alright next is a half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the Cairo sir when you put all of it into your partner and I just use a small pot because it's not gonna make them rich all right and this thing make sure you mix it up pretty good before you get ready to put it on the stove so you don't try to mix it up while it's cooking and with the heat on the stove this temperature saying I put it between four or five or so [Music] alright next one get ready to cook it alright you have to let the temperature reach between two hundred and eighty degrees and two hundred and ninety degrees under cooking thermometer so make sure you watching it cuz you don't want to burn it and be careful you don't want to burn yourself all right this is parchment paper not wax paper make sure you use parchment paper alright then I have my bowl of grits I've washed and dried those all right and then I have two pieces if you have any longer sticks you want to use you can use those because to me it's the kind of dangerous because you can burn yourself with it so small do not put the soup in the hole that's our baton the great with the grapes tin came from you make your own hole on the opposite cuz it'll stick better the hole on the other side is kind of big already I'll have my line that already [Music] all right it's cooking here makes you glad to get it two hundred and eighty degrees all right here's I just took it off the stove this is outlook right with it also all right next thing is you gonna need some flavor and the flavoring I use is the Lawrence flavor I use cheering and it's the bottle synthesizes a dream I only use half a bottle since I didn't make that much and it's gonna turn it red that's in the brain in it all right Mitchell see me add in another drop of the flavor just get a little flavor but after that you weigh if you have the liquid white food coloring in the jail that's when you add that you don't see me use it because I went to last minute trying to find some but using the liquid white learn it would give your stuff a brighter color so I want to be see through my stuff you'll see it's let me see - have a seat - color eye whatever but I didn't care cuz kids I know they was still eating but so give it that deep coloring you need the white liquid gel color and then we use your color that you wanted to be but now you're gonna see me and then I have just regular gel food cuz I'm using the colored seal and again it's gonna be basically almost air clear when I put it on the grades because I didn't have the whitener so again make sure if you want the bright colors that you see everybody else using use the white liquid gel color the whitener and then you're gonna use like a few drops to everything I didn't you see me just scooping some till your food coloring my Chi mix it up that my sister she started dipping already and you gotta make sure you working fastest and starting heart and hard and fast and I still ting to pot to the side so I can make sure lit all around to the side all right you start dipping it but then you see my candy and hey got heart the Jolly Rancher candy and I end up later on putting it back inside the blender to chop it up again good say the thing with the Jolly Rancher is it says for some reason because it's so sticky I know hardest but you go ahead and just make sure you working fast cuz the candy that you made will get hard fast and the Jolly Rancher soon so just dip it and I don't want to do have I didn't some people that I dip the whole thing I only did half of it great and we end up doing strawberry so we didn't record record ourselves on the strawberries and when you dip it just hurry up and sprinkle a pot on before it gets hard and they're just laid on a parchment paper all right here you can kind of see it better what a good grapes doesn't see just really missing again you see my stuff is fired it's pretty fine like a little powder some people have bigger chunks with Jolly Ranchers than theirs but it all stays the same all right this is finished product it came out pretty good for the first time if you want to see my kids do the taste test check out her Channel say whatcha Larry thanks for watching", "4WMFBMHtsTY": "crunching hey guys welcome to my channel my name is Jessica today I'm gonna show you guys how I make something called a crack grapes basically like you know like candied apples that basically reminds me of candied apples I saw these on Pinterest and they look pretty interesting and I thought I'd be able to chop myself if you have any questions let me know down in the comments below I'll make sure to get back to you guys yeah I'm excited let's get started Jolly Ranchers you will need Jolly Ranchers I used a mallet to crush mine up but I would recommend highly recommend using a food processor because this was so tedious and I had to take the extra steps of course to like cover the mallet and stuff but this is the result that I got the next thing you're going to need to do is you're going to need to prep your grapes you're gonna want to put the toothpick into the grape you can put it in the hole or without the hole but I chose to put mine in the hole because I found that it was more resistance going in and so you know for me it felt more stable now here you need 2 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of water and then a half a cup of corn starch no no no I got a half a cup of Caro syrup mix that all up on high heat and I put in some white food coloring and then I also mixed in some green you can choose whatever color I wanted purple by didn't have the little liquid purple so I just used green make sure your temperature reaches at least 140 degrees Celsius what it look like straight off the stove I let it cool down slightly and I just started dipping my grapes in and scraping it off the side and then dipping it straight into my powder so I had a powder I sift out the powder and then I had like the bigger chunks that I thought were pretty I separated those two because I thought they're pretty and kind of wanted something different texture wise - this is the end result they honestly kind of look like dinosaur eggs to me that's so weird but they tasted really good by the time I finish this video I finished about half of the grapes thank you guys for watching make sure to subscribe if there's anything else you want to see me make let me know down in the comments below bye you guys", "BQX3yflCKGU": "[Music] [Music] you should other than the back another video in today's video i'm gonna be showing you guys how to make candy grips or as y'all say Craig great Sadiq um I have anyways let's get right back to the video you know using email [Music] [Music] the toothpick on this side with alcohol so you can create your own hole on the other side and don't put it too far now [Music] [Music] this 1/2 1/2 cup of sugar next we need 1/4 cup of water wonderful thing on the half a cup okay so that's gonna be right here [Music] so when I'm put into that zoo once it makes really good now we're gonna put it on the stove now differently slow down and just slow steady pace [Music]", "ajoa5U9ymOI": "[Music] hello today I'll be making a small batch of hard candy using Lauren's super strength oils if you're new to our channel would like to see more recipes please like subscribe and don't forget to click the notification button [Music] I'm specifically highlighting Loran oils because I tend to get the most compliments when I use their flavors it's very important to set everything up in advance on the stovetop I keep a cup with warm or hot water to keep my brush in and it'll be where I place my thermometer when I remove it you'll need a brush or a tool to remove sugar crystals from your pot we purchase these cute silicone bear molds which will provide a link to in the description however if you don't have a mold you can use a small lightly oiled sheet pan for your candy on medium heat add your sugar corn syrup and water and stir until it comes to a small boil [Music] periodically you want to take your brush and remove the crystals that form around your pot now that your mixture is boiling stop stirring but continue to brush the sugar crystals that form around your pot your candy will be ready when it reaches the hard crack line on your candy thermometer as you get closer to 300 you want to make sure that your oil and food coloring if you're using it are ready because once you reach hard crack stage your candy mixture becomes time sensitive now that your mixture is reached hard crack stage remove your thermometer add your food coloring if you're using it and your one dream of Lorien oils stirring continuously some oils because they're super strength have strong scents so be sure to keep your oven or your stove fan on after you remove your mixture from the heat quickly but carefully because it's very hot transfer into your molds or onto a sheet pan my husband isn't a professional videographer and I'm not a professional candy maker so this shot is a little shaky and a little sloppy however this little tool I'm using is perfect to fix my mistake so we'll be sure to add a link to this silicone spatula below whether using molds or a sheet pan let your candy cool completely before removing once your candy is cooled if you're using a sheet pan gently break your candy into bite-sized pieces and you can also sift powdered sugar over them I personally prefer molds because they don't have as many sharp edges and as you can see even with arthritic hands they easily pop out [Music] sometimes I accidentally have fill some of the molds and we end up with a bowl full of accidents which my husband is happy to dispose of there are many recipes for hard candy as you can see I have a variation including rock candy but for more candy ideas we'll put a link to Lauren's website in the description this is a great homemade gift for any occasion or any season please share your candy ideas with me in the comments below and maybe

always share it's one of those things it's just i don't know something we've done forever so it's kind of fun and we've been doing a lot of hot and purple gaps lately so um just to try to get through some of these days like today when the home nurse left i was at 179 over 129 so blood pressure was so i mean it's up and it's down when something is down because i can't control the pain right now i don't know if the cystitis is pissed off or if the the left kidney is now ready to start going bad because now the pain has gone over and i'm still on antibiotics so i shouldn't be having this problem at all so we're kind of concerned about that so yeah we don't know if i will be off of the antibiotics when i get back from the hospital or not it is very possible that i will be on antibiotics for another month after um the surgery so sorry i don't know why my comment my live chat's not coming up it's so weird it's coming up the other day now i can't even see oh we'll try this i haven't had

going to show you how to create infuse crack grapes if you are new to my channel hit that subscribe button that notification bail and leave a comment in the comment section below letting me know how you enjoyed this video here I have my grapes you're gonna need a half cup of water a half cup of light corn serve 2 cups a granulated sugar full coloring of your choice some flavoring to go into your mixture this is a lime flavor to go along with the Absolut lime liqueur right into your mixture you're gonna need some sticks for your grapes and you can't forget the Jolly Ranchers you're gonna need some paper towel along with a candy thermometer a food processor or blender to blend your Jolly Ranchers now let's get into the video here I have my grapes into a bowl you want to soak your grapes and too with the liquor you can use a shot or two shots long as you soak your grapes and once you do that make sure you cover them up and taking some gloves and you just want to swivel and swish around your grapes into that liquor so that it can be completely coated and then put away to sit for two to three hours alright now you're going to take our grapes and make sure you dry them completely they need to be completely dry and you can insert your sticks right into your grapes and let them sit out until your mixture is complete [Music] you want to make sure you use long sticks so that you'll be able to dip them into your mixture and not have your fingers burnt off so make sure your sticks are long you guys so you don't have any burns on your fingertips that's important so here we have our Jolly Ranchers you want to unwrap them and make sure that your Jolly Ranchers stay dry and not wet it will be difficult to blend your Jolly Ranchers into your blender if they are wet so I'm using between 30 to 36 of these Jolly Ranchers and they're going to go right into my little food processor that I have here which you can find on Amazon a great fine and great for these Jolly Ranchers so we're going to go ahead and take our top off and put our Jolly Ranchers right into the blender here now we're going to put our top on and you want to do a few pulsating spins with these Jolly Ranchers and get to mixing them up so they can break down evenly [Music] now we got to remove our top and check out our mix here now see here you have your Jolly Ranchers they're a little bit thick and a little bit large in size but you don't want that you want to break them down to a much finer crumble so that they'll be able to coach your golly rant of crack grapes your grapes evenly all right so here we have the crumble of your candy mixture or Jolly Ranchers not mixture and this is the end result of how you want your Jolly Ranchers to turn out to be now let's make our mixture let's add our 1/2 cup of water our 1/2 cup a light corn syrup [Music] now we're going to add our two cups of granulated sugar and we got a mix and combine this well this particular recipe will it cover at least fifty to sixty grapes so we're going to insert our candy thermometer make sure you clip it on the side don't let it touch the bottom of the pot or it will give off a false reading you guys so make sure that you just insert your candy thermometer right into the mixture so that you can get and receive a good reading as your mixture cook you want to then add in your liqueur and add in your flavor you want to let this cook to 280 to 80 degrees and you want to add in about two tablespoons of your liquor being that you're adding in this liquid you want to let your mixture cook and remove at 300 degrees now I'm adding in the flavor and you want to add in the full dram to this recipe okay once that has cooked to 300 degrees remove your thermometer and you want to place it in a cup so that you can get that candy mixture off of there and now we're going to add our color add in four drops of white gel food coloring and you want to mix that in adding in the white will help give you a lighter tone color so the color I'm trying to achieve is a teal color with using this sky blue I want to add in three to four drops of the blue to create the light teal color that I'm looking for and you want to mix that very well until all of the gel food colour is equally combined [Music] now here we have our teal color the color I was looking for taking your grape and dipping it right in scraping off a little bit and add it right into your jolly mix your Jolly Rancher mix and dip and add it right to your jolly mixture dip I like to cover my grape I like to coat it fully or you can cover halfway it's totally up to you whatever you prefer but make sure that is coated well and then you can dip right into your Jolly Rancher mix now once your mix is in the bowl if it sits a little while and it gets hard just break it up either with a spoon or run your hand through it or you can put it back into your mixer and break it up just a little bit so that it can break up that hard hardness as it sits and there you have you guys are infused crack or candied grapes if you have enjoyed this video give this video a thumbs up leave a comment in the comment section below letting me know how you enjoyed this

shower um yeah I don't taste strawberry Kiwi I just don't but never a problem with cannabis Mo's any of anything of their stuff anything it's all been good so suck on these take a shower come back when this kicks in let you guys know how long it takes to kick in when I'm feeling and everything else okay so it's 953 right now and I took it at 836 so a little over an hour I started feeling this like a couple minutes ago it's it's good there's nothing wrong with it they could take a shower and whatever and that was but you're more like I'm not sleepy and I'm not hungry it's more like relaxed like it's just like such a it's such a good feeling like it's just and I even worried about anything like if you have stuff that you're worried about you wouldn't be worrying about right now cuz it just it's not there to worry about I feel happy but I feel happy cuz I'm relaxed um and I feel that really am i I don't know I'll come closer can you see now if you can see anything my eyes they feel really heavy and like like if a cop came up to me right now he would know by just like putting that yeah yeah the flashlight in my eyes um my hair is driving me like really bad because I don't like I don't like it down but it's still a little damp and that's a whole other story that nobody needs to hear about um okay so it was the medicated candies from Ken abysmal the cubes the taste it said was strawberry Kiwi but it tasted like weed to me like THC like you right the whole time okay so eating cuz I did eat today and I do and drink right it wasn't like the other time yesterday when I did that review when I had nothing in me so even with like had supper and all that stuff so it took a little bit over an hour to kick in I took two cubes so it's 60 milligrams you feel relaxed feel good no anxiety or paranoia you feel it like really heavy in the eyes so that's why I said if a cop stopped me he would know right away that like if he's Sean Sean if he but Dad the flashlight like in my eye whatever eyes he would know just by looking at the eyes no munchies or anything like this is like what I would like to do right now is like if somebody were to tell me like some stories just like if somebody I would just like to listen cuz that's what I feel like doing that's how that's how relax do you feel I was gonna oh I was going to do um the bong toe but that I thought well I should maybe just roll a joint but then like it's this start to kick in so now and the more I'm talking for whatever stupid reason it's kicking in more like it's you know I still feel relaxed though but now I'm still thinking I should roll the joint because why not I think that's what I'll do any of you girls out there that are watching this this would be like a good time to really like like pamper yourself like either do it at home and you know get some really good body cream and whatever or like have somebody drive you to the beauty salon place and get them to you know do your feet and your nails and everything else it would probably feel really good I would imagine so I don't have the patience for that so I'll just use the body cream that's that's good enough but and the guys I think um I think you guys should probably either get your spouse to give you a really good back rub or get your feet massaged if you don't have a spouse or your spouse's no they're not doing it because maybe they just don't want to then go to like one of those massage places and get somebody over there to give you a back massage or a foot massage and it would feel good I'm not doing stages but it's like way too long my mouth that was getting really dry ik and I should have brought up some some water and I didn't so look well I'm not really in a lot bit right now okay so I'm gonna go and feel relaxed some more and then I roll a joint and then come back and just say whatever tell you tell you guys when I'm feeling or when I'm not feeling or maybe I'm still feeling the same who knows okay I'll be back after I do the joint or whatever whatever I say because I don't remember okay so I finished that joint like 10-15 minutes ago so um there was not a need to smoke smoke it because I just feel great but just feel that much better I got the munchies vibe so let's chip cookies and you can't see it but it's milk and that tastes pretty damn good I would say recommend these cubes from can abysmal the hard candies um maybe not for the like the long time smokers that you may need to take like a couple bags but like the average person and like the thirty just the one would like kind of calm you down a bit just sixty would I took um like I can really feel it that's why I didn't want to take more than 60 cuz I did the hundred whining oh that was like it was some strong [ __ ] so 60 is good you feel it food tastes like really good I also can side my back was a little bit sore earlier I don't feel that the foot that's [ __ ] up I got these like I said it's nerve pain I haven't felt that and I was getting like real bad today you feel like pretty good almost like a shirt brought up another cookie but it's okay ouch um I was gonna say if those kind of pains were stopping you from like saying working out or just going for a blocker um going to the gym or whatever I say that if you took one of these cubes you wouldn't be feeling whatever pain it was that you're having I'm working out wasn't gonna make it any worse either like let's just put it that way I would say to do this because you could probably you know you've been getting out going for a walk or something like did I think this is like the stuff you'd want to do that on it's like an abysmal so anyways but [Music] I still feel relaxed but more like you want to get into like clean bed and hair like new sheets put on or whatever it is or and just get comfortable and you can just think about stuff I don't know what stuff but just think or if you didn't want to think thank Charlie's outside the door then close your eyes and go to sleep because that's what the next thing is is closing closing my eyes and going to sleep I think I I don't know what I love it like they look a little red here or something I don't really like looking at my eyes cuz are just oh my god you probably hear something that's just Justin oh yeah look a little bit like a little puffy there I'm not puffy but like well maybe yeah like here they look not puffy but like hi I guess you could say that you could tell it's all in the eyes okay so how do the match hey it's good get it it's like an abysmal it's the medicated hard candies the 30 milligram ones if you feel really good so and pretty soon I'm going to be going to bed so um I think that's everything I think I covered it all I may get something else to eat though cuz everything just tastes good why shouldn't say everything gets all I had was no good cookies in those tasted really good so um my I feel I can barely [ __ ] open them I don't know do they look do they look good I feel like I feel like Michael Madsen Hey oh jeez okay hang on like Michael Madsen they're all squinty anyways [Music] that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "7KjihoRsDHE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this huckleberry hard candy by Bill ferns hard candy company so they actually reached out to me like two days ago and since I'm Sony with this I'm gonna just basically accommodate most most people who do reach out and ask me if I can review so the way I'm doing this as I had the blue raspberry one last night and that was kind of like on me so I don't like blue raspberry or like I don't like raspberry in general like at all so I don't know why I got blue raspberry but if you like raspberry the flavors really good if you don't don't buy it's not you're not gonna like it it's just got that like the raspberry sourness to it and I just like I said it's a personal it's a choice on the taste the hi itself though it was really like it if I was a new if I was a new smoker and I was just getting started this is a perfect way to like get your intro into edibles because one piece is going to be just enough to give you like the feeling that you're after the feeling that most people like associate with edibles but in a mild enough dose that you're still gonna be full control you're not gonna like pass out fall asleep you're not gonna you're not gonna have like a crazy freak out because you had one piece this is a 10 milligram piece of candy so it's not that big if you're more like if you're more of a daily like you smoke every day after works I think then you can go ahead and have two two or two three and then if you really really want to make sure that you're not gonna wake up at all then you brought out four to five but you know like I said it's everyone's personal choice with that I'm going to go ahead and pop this guy open they don't have this score marks which I don't like because I have to like cut it beforehand otherwise I don't like doing that so there's that when you open it at first Wow so here's my package and it's already open I was cool I don't know how that oh yeah it just wasn't sealed all the way that's awesome so yeah this is a huckleberry candy that's really good oh yeah so yeah I definitely shouldn't I got the blue raspberry if I would have got the huckleberry one I probably would eat both last night this is really really good you don't taste any of the marijuana at all yeah Naruto you get a little bit of the tickle that you get in the back of the throat whenever you have like a candy farm edible but that just comes with any of these really good like really really good oh my god yeah definitely if you go with this one the huckleberry if you're gonna buy them this is hands-down you're not gonna have no complaints yeah anyway man I'm really enjoying it so I got a bunch of stuff to finish I gotta go do a bunch of like cooking and a bunch of other stuff for the rest of the day alright so that was the huckleberry bill affords hard candy and yeah like I said this thing's delicious so if you guys get a chance definitely go pick some up and go", "yxS3K2KIeVw": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds [Music] Boop I had to candid visible boxes coming the little one got here the big ones still missing because Canada Post don't know how to do their [ __ ] jobs hey so let's open up

and that one's missing right now this is just a little one I kick ass in that already so you're probably not gonna see much come over here and don't think well I guess I was wrong there's a little bit of stuff a little bit more than I thought but the other box is bigger still so yeah when the other box gets here to be a little bit of a better unboxing but let's get in here and see what we got bag after bag a box seats so we got 28 grams of blue cheese looks like that and yeah pretty nice-looking Bloods hey so we'll stick that to the side we got some filters and the back says this [ __ ] pause your screen if you want to read them and then we got some stickers these are different anyway moving on we've got two pre-rolled joints daughter loves pre-rolled joints oh yeah hopefully you guys can read everything here I think they've got one upside down well they both see the same thing one gram and we bring it up to the board maybe you can see it a little better there you go can't a visible one gram cold indica [ __ ] writes hey I love free weeds anyway those to the side and we got medicated hard candies this one here is grape flavor 100 milligrams of THC just the way Donna likes it hey [ __ ] sakes hey I don't want to see Donna loves those edibles got some papers filters and a lanyard in there what is this I do not know what this is Donna is the expert on these things that aren't weeds it looks like it's just a container though I think it's a container yep I thought it was gonna be something else but it looks like a container we'll put that to the side and right here we have one gram of amnesia haze never heard of it that's gonna be a review video I think I've got to do a review video still on the blue cheese I don't think I did wanton blue cheese from Canada bismil yet so yeah and then four-star general that's another review video right there because I've never heard of that one either bloods look like that and this one here the amnesia haze the buds look like that and yeah so I thought it was only gonna be a little order it's not too bad though I'm not a little order a little box a little you know you know what I'm talking about you know what I [ __ ] mean hey so let's take a look at what we got again we got 14 grams of blue cheese we'll have to do a review on that we got 100 milligram THC hard candies medicated hard candies grape flavor Donna loves them [ __ ] things we got to pre-rolled joints we've got a container it looks like to hold a joint maybe to contain the smell hey maybe it's a smell proof one we got a couple stickers we thought a gram of a Bonita Haze we've got a gram of four star general we got a baggie with filters papers and a lanyard we've got some other filters right there and um yeah that's that Hey that concludes this week's can abysmal and boxing and yeah let me just adjust my camera I'm not sure where we were exactly I think maybe around there right now I'm smoking this stuff here I got from some dickweed here in Timmins Ontario in dirty old Timmins Ontario I'll show you a bud I'm not sure if the strain is called he doesn't even know the strain it's just some dirty old Tim and Street weed hey let's take it up to the board and have a look it doesn't look as good as the can abysmal weeds but it's not too bad you know it does the trick it does the job hey anyway I hope you guys had a good enough look because times up I am we found some more seeds we're up to five seeds now mm-hmm [ __ ] rights hey [ __ ] rights we're gonna grow a field hey we're gonna grow a [ __ ] field I'm just kidding we're not gonna grow a field Oh yeah so when the other box shows up we'll do another unboxing maybe tomorrow I don't know it's hard to say because Canada Post are a bunch of [ __ ] lying thieves ain't so can abysmal baby send it and we might have to wait a little while longer I don't know or maybe the box that's missing will turn up it's hard to say I'm in Timmins Ontario [ __ ] things happen here all the time hey [ __ ] anyway I'm gonna get in a bomb Tok and I'm not going to open any of the can of Bismil weeds today because I have to do a review on every strain here because I haven't done one yet and I can't do a good review if I'm [ __ ] smoking this stuff hey I won't be able to tell so tomorrow morning I think we're gonna go with probably some blue cheese hey poochie's it hurts really good I had it from another place before it was pretty good but I heard from Canada Bismil it's extra good hey so we'll probably try that out tomorrow wait could break an early morning wake and bake featuring blue cheese from can abismo anyway enough about that [ __ ] I'm gonna do a bong talk and then I don't know yeah I'm gonna fill my bowl back up and I'll be back with you in a second hey [Music] we got some toppers pizza with all kinds of [ __ ] [ __ ] on there Hey look at that [ __ ] rights Hey hey Donna where yet I got something better away we got some of this [ __ ] why does it say Caesar I don't know they gave us the wrong [ __ ] stuff [ __ ] only in Timmins Ontario they can [ __ ] up things like that eh if that didn't make sense [ __ ] I don't know my words are making sense but yeah only in Timmins Ontario can they [ __ ] up a simple little thing can you send us some ranch dip and they said your Caesar dressing hook suckers anyway you're gonna rip us up some pizza there Donna rip us off some slabs I'm gonna set this up over here that way I don't know you guys can hang out with us when we eat or something hey I'm guessing a poke there should be good they're here they're here they're Hey here they're here they're let me slide that over a little bit you gonna bring some pizza over it on ya wait me some [ __ ] pizza you know you what you gotta get your sweater talk about what you want me to talk about one wait for the right reason up I'm just kidding I got lots of stuff to talk about like starting with how Canada Post likes to steal my [ __ ] mail [ __ ] and why just make sure there's a [ __ ] dude at Canada Post he told Donna yesterday that if any men two days ago he told Donna if any mail comes in for us with our name on it any packages or anything you hold it at his [ __ ] desk and he'll give us a call and we can come and pick it up in that way he he knows we got it we know we got it everybody's happy right package goes up for delivery today it was also beyond the guy's [ __ ] desk the guy's not even paying attention he's a liar he's a liar it's not a very big lie but it's still a lie [ __ ] liar lying [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] [ __ ] you want in there oh I don't know what else to talk about all I can think about is how Canada Post he was [ __ ] with my [ __ ] mail pricks and then to find out I'm gonna get him my supper toke up oh go ahead I'm just gonna say she just smoked one of those one gram pre-rolled joints from can abysmal only half she'll get to the other half after and I'm still smoking the dirty old Timmons Street weed [ __ ] hey I don't want to open the other stuff until I can do a review you know the rules it's gotta be fresh under you Hey and I think when I'm doing the unboxing I'm going to say we have 14 grams of blue cheese it's 28 grams it's 214 bag 14 bag [ __ ] I can't even say my [ __ ] words it's 214 grand banks I don't even know if what I said he didn't he [ __ ] said did it make sense yes I'm so I was gonna say to find out today cuz it's like the one person said the thing that would hold all male he would keep a log of whatever you know see the package before it goes out cuz like the [ __ ] gets dumped on when he comes here and whatever to find out today right what does the lady say well that's not his job he doesn't do that job oh my [ __ ] is dead good yeah I asked the boat there's you guys seen a head anything was yesterday's video I had a knife that was all crushed and stomped on [ __ ] and the dude said that everything every package that goes into that building he knows the boat and this and that whatever and the lady today says they have no clue what packages come into the [ __ ] building and stuff was too hard to keep up there's too many she says so and why am I talking about that because I was telling them he said whatever to find out today that he was just seeing what he wanted to see cuz he's a [ __ ] makes you wonder who stole the package yeah hey mm-hmm it is good pizza the only thing that sucks about it is I got Caesar [ __ ] dressing to [ __ ] dip my feets in done case is good as ranch don't want to talk about hopefully the other box comes in soon so we could do a another unboxing video the other one has 314 grand bags of cheese this was blue cheese today the other one I know has did you what am i listening for he was like the wait but it was okay it's not the [ __ ] joy to organ it's got to be the weeds hey what was I saying oh yeah this box here had to 14 grand bags of blue cheese the other box has three 14 grand bags of cheese regular old cheese and a bunch of other stuff I'm not sure exactly what but it's a little bit of a bigger yeah so if that happened to come in tomorrow or whatever we'll do another boxing video but I don't know if can abysmal has to resend it because Canada Post is [ __ ] then we might have to wait an extra week or something there's a reason why I'm talking about that was I'm leading up to something because I don't know what I'm what I'm getting at you're talking about it because I was chewy you said is there anything else and I was trying to chew faster then you just start telling them yeah I don't know why the yes pika the people remember his telling you yesterday know about the lady in the parking lot I'm going through checking the people's uh yeah car doors and whatever and then other people are like I know wiggle it like I don't know her name but I know who she is I mean you've seen her around you don't know who she is you never hung around with her well make yourself sound bad now I know who she is no no I said I don't know we're being him like I don't know I know whereas like she goes into parking lots and and checks checks vehicles and then if you're coming out of the store she'll follow you to your vehicle to ask you for some change she's been like what is it what is it when you like can you ban somebody from your parking somebody she don't care she just played so come back she'll still come back and she always tells people that she's homeless but she's always that she goes maybe she's homeless no that's a liquor store she's she's like says she has no food and she goes to a liquor store why she yeah she's a homeless person that mooch his money off of people all day long so she can go to the liquor store have you ever thought that listen this is a single eye I've seen her in action she will actually like if you're a person to dona perversions the real person yeah I wouldn't know um I said I've seen her in action like say if there's like there was a guy walking and he's like he has longer stripes and he's going that much more quicker yeah and because she doesn't want to to lose them right hmm she actually starts jogging up until like she's right there and she'll like just come around and be like excuse me sir do you have any change she goes to people inside vehicle vehicles are just sitting there maybe waiting for like somebody to come out she don't care and I'm just filling up my ball for anybody was wondering oh there was a big drug bust a what sir yeah like 733 grams of coke and there was like meth tabs and these other things I know is here in Timmons yep three people and I recognize one of them always see it whenever I haven't seen that girl she always look like box what do you drink from when you used to work in the grocery store mm-hmm hose that label look like you probably slap a real hard in the face and she wouldn't feel it like anyway so they got yeah they get caught it was like with all this [ __ ] yeah I stuck my [ __ ] [ __ ] again and they're just out until their court date just don't [ __ ] you know what I think happened is these people get caught and they say and the cops say if you give me some names I'll put I'll let you go out on until your first appearance so I everybody I don't know you're dumb that's probably what it is [Laughter] so dust we got other than thieves and stuff anything different you kinda need a fork to eat this it's a fork yeah - no it's better wet like the name the name of what the pizza I don't know I just thought it was a pizza Lulu if you publish it a 10 topper oh well there you go it's a tenth offering it's like they put eight of the eight of them on there and then you get to pick I'm actually gonna bring it closer for us things are the way here I don't know what you're saying oh there's eight toppings that come on it and then you get to pick an extra - eight toppings with come on it yeah is that what you said no oh so what else we got mrs. Mel supper is usually around here we just sit around and talk about random [ __ ] the people I play a [ __ ] story there you go throw us a story let's not like it but beat of a story but I was coming home today I got on to this road over here DubLi I guess or I don't know when it hits to believe the corner of pine and Jubilee so I just get there right and there's a cop ahead of me and this white car on this side on the right side so we're driving whenever then the cops switches into the right lane but he's not even I don't know what he's doing he's just driving anyways okay so I put on my heats they know right because I'm in I gotta get into another white car which there was plenty of room David I swear that guy as soon as he's seen my mind blinker go on okay so he speeds up okay just so I saw Mike rounded up the cup no though guy in the white card and the corpus in front of that guy but not right there because I couldn't there was enough room in the beginning so anyways and then I can't slow down now because there's other cars that are coming behind me and this white car is just being a [ __ ] [ __ ] so what happened was I had to give the car some gas because he was driving an older white car and ours is a newer car no I mean I have more of like I can go speed up quicker so I did that okay but as soon as I start doing that okay the guy still strike like he's still trying to give her a right least really trying to not make me get that back meanwhile like I see cuz I'm like I get I can get into the lane now like even if you put your all the way no anyways I didn't laid in the [ __ ] listen the cop isn't looking in his rearview mirror at us are you listening that's that isn't Hey look the paper towels are my clock bells everywhere this is life in your forties is it no I'm not 40 so what else we're talking about good start can you stole the good story mm-hmm that's another good one you gotta rest those pizzas thanks I ate too many I mean no we're going to love it's just a medium you still have those two he'll get pretty full [Music] yeah I don't really I'm trying to remember if anything I encountered anything else today Oh remember -

Nadia Bernstein she did her doctoral thesis on the history of artificial grape flavoring and she was nice enough to sit down with me for a few moments and tell me about it so far with this batch of candy we got the sugar up to 310 degrees we poured it on our candy cooling table and once it got down to a reasonable temperature we added citric acid and the citric acid will make the candy tastes more like a fruit as all fruits including grapes have some citric acid and for those of you who don't like us adding citric acid well I think that's just a case of sour grapes so I met up with dr. Bernstein and she talked to me about the history of grapes themselves it didn't occur to me that the need for a grape flavor is driven by the desire for grape flavoring or things that taste like grapes and I'm really glad she talked to me about this because this would have been a missing part of the story and it really would have left me in a jam to understand the history of grape flavor I think the first thing we have to do is is figure out why people were drinking grape juice in particular in the 19th century it was uncommon for Americans probably people in most places in the world to be drinking fruit juice if people were making juices they were usually in the 19th century especially the beginning of the 19th century they were usually making juice as a first step to making hooch Thomas Welch develops a method for making essentially what he calls unfermented wine which is which ends up being the drink that we all know now as Welch's grape juice this grape juice which is a kind of mass-produced product kind of rides into popularity on the coattails of the temperance movement and you start kind of seeing it as advertised as a wholesome and sound beverage people start drinking this on fermented wine and grape juice so Thomas Welch a name that we all know because it adorns grape juice and jams here in the United States was a temperance movement member in other words he was part of the movement that later led to the American prohibition on alcohol and he created something to compete with wine that was non-alcoholic grape juice this juice was associated with health and healthy and fresh things and he created a popular movement that created a demand for grape juice and in turn and grape flavoring if you want to try this candy for yourself please go to our website www.theatrefolk.com patreon we now have a patreon page if this grape drink is grape juice why doesn't it taste like grapes to people outside the United States Venice Larissa grapes which are the kind of grapes that are native to the United States so some of these varieties are concord grapes in the South Scuppernong Delaware Catawba essentially they they differ from what we think of as European grieved European wine grapes or the kind of California red and green seedless that are most common now in that they have this particular flavor which the technical term for it is boxiness so next time you try a Concord grape or a grape Jolly Rancher the technical way of describing its flavor is foxiness so that's a boxy Jolly Rancher you got there or other kind of grape flavor candy so the reason why this doesn't seem like a familiar grape flavoring to people in Europe is the grape that it's based on does not grow in Europe it's an American original and concord grapes which you grow up in upstate New York are not available across the United States but a couple of weeks a year and they're not just used for jellies and juices but here in the United States because back then they couldn't get any other grapes they've used these grapes for wines so now that we understand why the demand exists and why the flavor is different the next question is how did they get around to developing an artificial version of this flavor so how did this foxie flavor make its way from legitimate grape juice legitimate legitimate grapes to artificially flavored grape soda and grape candies what I found in my research was a kind of incredible story of a young man with a degree in chemistry he lived in the Annapolis his name was Gilbert hurty and he had founded a carbonated water company that also made flavorings of various sorts so he's writing the Indianapolis streetcar sometime between 1909 and 1912 and there's a woman standing next to him on this crowded streetcar and she smells exactly like grape the compound that's being used in this perfume would be the perfect chemical compound to to use in in a new grape flavoring which is which he'll produce right at this moment when grape juice is starting to have its heyday and he finds what the chemical is it's called methyl and framily and he uses it as the basis of a grape flavouring mecklen translate what's that why is it in this catalog well it turns out that in the late 19th century in the 1890s in europe and germany wears perfume companies are trying to do research to to figure out how to make artificial versions or synthetic versions of some of the most popular floral perfumes of the day their chemical analysis reveals that methyl and Thranduil it is the key component of neroli oil neroli scent they market it as artificial neroli and that is how the hurdy comes across it in a catalog and makes the connection and realizes this is the thing that smells like grape it didn't smell like grape to people in germany why because they didn't have the Venice lovers degrade it kind of took this material that entered the marketplace as a precious synthetic floral perfume in the United States kind of finds its new identity as a great flavoring and now we have our sheets of grape candy out here and we have to break them up into individual drops and I may not surprise you that the reason they're called drops is because we drop them [Music] so the artificial grape flavoring that we all know came about because the gentleman was on a trolley and he saw to hurt it to the grapevine from this lady that neroli oil or synthetic neroli oil smelled and eventually he discovered tasted like grapes in Rowley oil if it wasn't clear is the oil that comes out of orange blossoms and since I like grapes a bunch I thought I'd make some that we're actually a bunch of grapes kids sometimes playing with your food can be fun I want to thank Nadia Bernstein for her help with this video and thank you for watching us if you want to try this candy for yourself you can get it on our website at www.airsofthero.com Ville Road exit of i-10 and we're open 7 days a week most days were open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. we don't make

interview thank you for getting for watching and we'll see you in the next video", "5TKh0yvW4Hw": "hello my name is Debra Brahmaji and I'm a registered dietician nutritionist welcome to nkf kidney talks for this edition I will be talking about dietary management of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease there are many ideologies for acute and chronic hyperkalemia but they basically fall into two categories one is an excess of potassium released from cells and the second is acute intake of potassium this program will focus on dietary intake of potassium let's begin with a study that looked at dietary potassium intake and mortality in hemodialysis patients in this study food frequency questionnaire used to determine the potassium intake of 224 patients on hemodialysis after adjustments for serum potassium and intakes of energy protein and phosphorus dietary potassium intake was associated with greater mortality risk this means that the higher the dietary potassium content the higher the mortality the quartile with the highest mortality an average dietary intake of three thousand four hundred and forty milligrams of potassium per day this study looked at serum and dialysate potassium concentrations and survival in hemodialysis patients it was a three year study of over eighty one thousand patients on hemodialysis the study also looked at protein intake as you can see on this graph patients with estimated higher protein intake at higher serum potassium levels a pre dialysis serum potassium a four point six to five point three millions per liter was associated with the greatest survival the recommended dietary protein intake for dialysis patients is 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram per day which in this study was associated with a serum potassium of five point one millions per liter this can be achieved with a dietary intake of about 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams of potassium per day a thorough nutrition assessment includes evaluation of potassium status the assessment should include a review of serum potassium and glucose the reference range for serum potassium is three point five to five millions per liter elevated serum glucose may cause potassium to move out of the cells and into the blood circulation this potassium shift causes hyperkalemia a review of prescribed and over-the-counter medications is also important when assessing potassium status since many medications such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause hyperkalemia for patients on dialysis the dialysate potassium concentration should be evaluated for example a new dialysis patient on a higher potassium dialysate who starts feeling better and is eating more protein may exhibit higher levels of serum potassium the dialysate potassium concentration should be adjusted accordingly a quantitative assessment of dietary potassium intake is also essential this should include a three-day diet record and a food frequency questionnaire these methods will reveal intake of high potassium content foods and or supplements Dietary analysis software can also be used to further quantify dietary potassium intake potassium is a mineral found in most foods so limiting dietary potassium can be a challenge for patients patients with chronic kidney disease often have multiple dietary restrictions such as potassium sodium and phosphorus so they're left with very limited food choices the typical American diet which is rich in animal protein and dairy products provides approximately 3,500 to 4,500 milligrams of potassium per day whereas a potassium restricted diet is approximately 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams of potassium per day clinicians should base the dietary potassium prescription on the serum potassium level so which foods are high in potassium the foods with more than 200 milligrams of potassium per serving or considered high potassium several fruits and vegetables such as orange banana and potato have a high potassium content dairy products nuts beans and chocolate are also potassium rich foods oftentimes patients on a potassium restricted diet are also trying to restrict sodium they may start using a salt substitute or low sodium spice mix that contains potassium chloride which causes a spike in their serum potassium herbal preparations such as noni juice and others may be another problematic source of potassium in my clinical experience two of the most common dietary causes of hyperkalemia are related to seasonal foods and cultural or ethnic food preferences in the summer for example there are more potassium rich fruits and vegetables available such as garden tomatoes or cantaloupe and honeydew melons patients are tempted to indulge in seasonal foods that have a high potassium content since their availability is limited year-round culturally diverse food preferences are also important considerations the dietary potassium intake some cultures eat more fruits and vegetables and Dietary staples such as legumes tubers plantains and tomatoes are high in potassium patients need intensive education on how to reduce dietary potassium portion size is important in reducing dietary potassium since a large serving of a low potassium food can result in a high potassium intake this is a difficult concept for some patients to understand since they may be eating the right foods but they're just having too much food lists can also help patients choose lower potassium content fruits and vegetables this information can be found on the National Kidney Foundation website at www.investmentpitch.com food which is called sensible cheating this allows patients to have a favourite food without overdoing it it's also possible to reduce the potassium content of many fruits and vegetables for example peeling fruits such as peaches lowers potassium content since a high concentration of potassium is in the fruit skin the juice that canned fruits are packed in is also high in potassium since the fruit is cooked in this juice and the potassium reaches out into the liquid therefore patients should drain and rinse canned fruits to reduce potassium content leaching is another way to reduce potassium leaching is a process of soaking sliced raw vegetables in water for at least 2 hours before cooking to leach some of the potassium out of the food and into the water patients on a sodium restriction should use seasonings that do not contain potassium chloride patients should also limit the use of milk and milk products for example using milk for cereal or coffee only or using milk substitute to reduce dietary potassium and finally dining out takes careful planning to maintain low to moderate potassium intake for example patients can order a half portion of an entree and choose rice instead of potato so what does treating hypoglycemia have to do with dietary management of hyperkalemia one of the most common treatments for hypoglycemia is orange juice but since orange juice is high in potassium this is contraindicated when restricting dietary potassium instead patients should choose low potassium content beverages and foods that contain 15 grams of carbohydrate some examples listed here are lower potassium content juices such as apple grape or cranberry regular lemonade and clear sodas regular hard candy glucose tablets or glucose gel these low potassium choices can prevent unwanted spikes in serum potassium while treating hypoglycemia in conclusion many potassium rich foods such as fruits and vegetables are also heart-healthy the for a low potassium diet has the potential to fall short of a heart-healthy diet and according to several studies may contribute to the burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease it's important to educate patients regarding the different sources of potassium and empower them to make the best choices a balanced and realistic approach would mean choosing the most beneficial sources of potassium which is only possible through intensive education by a registered dietician nutritionist thank you for participating in this program", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "yB1UnVyXoNk": "[Music] hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on that's good okay I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies these ones are orange I've never had the orange one from a can abismo that was early orange and there are 30 milligrams each and usually I do the this doesn't fall me a second here I have this balancing and okay that's better hey I'm just trying to hopefully that's good okay so they're the medicated hard candies from cannabis melt this flavor is orange the reason I'm doing this is because like I really need a good night's sleep I think that is the cure to this cold that I have or I don't know and it always is worse you know later on like one after supper time so I really think that sleep is the key for me and I didn't take a nap at all today so I'm just taking these out they look like clothes they look like that just a little orange cube full of goodness and I have my taste and stuff back so that's that's a good thing I'm not tasting orange I'm tasting the the THC but I'm not tasting the orange and the weather today is not helping either it's been it was raining earlier and then it was it was just so damp and whose a yuck day so I'm really hoping that this helps me a lot and on top of that to like I'm also wondering how much of this is even cold because I do have allergies really bad and fall in spring and there's a lot of leaves and stuff right now so yeah I'm not tasting the orange I don't taste the THC or whatever it is I can was a little bit wobbly so I've usually been waiting like an hour and a half sometimes in average 45 minutes when like for this to fully kick in like usually I'll feel it like within the hour maybe a little bit past but then I've been waiting right so I'll do the same thing with with like this when I when I when it kicks in and then I'll just wait a bit and then I will come back and let you know if it helped with anything that I'm feeling and it's hot about something I don't know usually I have good stuff to chat about I think ok so we'll be back on this kicks in okay so I thought come out here and smoke some of this joint talk a little bit out out here and then go back in and talk more inside it's um if you're like if your body's overtired or whatever like this stuff really kicks in hard and like you do get the like the munchies but like you really don't want to do anything like any if you had any plans you could just probably you wouldn't be doing it this is so the the Lindsay og that I'm smoking and now that stuff's like pretty good um what else I really feel this in my eyes yeah you feel like relaxed and happy and just not really wanting to do too much of anything and then if you wait till like I don't know how long it's been I would say probably like an hour and a half an hour maybe longer and then you smoke like adjoint it just kind of makes everything like really really bad bad but good and it's really chilly out here so I'm just gonna wait for Charlie to do his business but this out smoke at all and I don't know yet and then anyways well I'll meet you like we'll go back inside that's where we will be next um I really don't feel like great um they came a little bit hungry so that's why I'm having yeah the peach flavored oatmeal I bet that and like I just want to go to sleep cuz I don't cuz that's how I feel I really don't like that bad feeling but aces like I'm oh I'm already tired and I don't know my nose isn't that stuffy right now either it's it's doing better yeah I really should I don't want to finish my oatmeal coz feel like I'll get sick but that's my favorite my favorite kind oatmeal is a peach baked flavored I made toast and I really don't feel like eating that now either yeah I didn't expect to feel like this cuz I don't know usually I don't but tonight I do so I think it's just I think I just need some sleep oh if I had all my rest then I wouldn't feel like this I should make sure like I drink lots of water she probably sleep for a long time I've already told and to like not to wake me up and just let me sleep because this is like how you want to feel that going to sleep as you could think about your legs on the sheets I don't want us to talk about [Music] I've had this this stupid stupid cold for four days now that's like a record this tastes good the jam toast I hate I hate the crust I don't know why I just do I think it's just the way it's like is like hard and in [Music] I don't know more bunched up I guess only because after the crushes all softness Oh I don't know it just doesn't taste good not really uh a crust person if you're like in need of sleep you should get some of this the medicated hard candies from cannabis my one that will help you go to sleep and sleep for a long time you'd probably wake up feeling really good oh that hostess is really good Oh what else to say about it the owners doesn't taste I can't taste any orange at all great it in oh my [ __ ] number 10 I just fell really high and you want to go to sleep I don't know what else I don't know what else to say I think I want to say goodbye to you guys because I need to get some sleep and the there I Canada's of all the medicated of hard candies there's lots of different flavors [Music] they're a good sleep aid it's a good like you don't want to do anything thing type of thing no matter what like you just you just keep on thinking that you want to go to sleep so that's it that's all bye", "TGHWwV_CI58": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review of the medicated hard candies I've done reviews on this before I've just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "eH_jmUD6H3M": "load up me to back out here with another review another edible review so this time I got some gummies this stuff is from Aurora Aurora drift these ones are their raspberry gummies I personally fan of indica I only get indica either a gummies concentrates flower hash anything like that I normally go for indigo this stuff is sativa I don't know sounds like we're all stuck together they're five per container two milligrams each which is hilarious but again not everybody has a tolerance that in every day user does so they're trying to keep for people freaking out and overdoing it overdosing and other people call it which technically you're giving not that you can die from it as people know I don't know I don't know why I'm buying all this stuff one this at the animals don't this low of milligrams I can eat the whole pack not feel anything again they are sativa so hopefully I feel a bit of a buzz they are nano emulsified so they're supposed to hit your bloodstream faster um this isn't sealed pack so these guys are just getting held on the shelves these guys had them for two days now I'm the fifth person to try these apparently so bust the seal I don't know right off the bat they don't it is a smelling raspberry I don't know it's a very very synthetic smelling this one is not coated in sugar it seems like they're the same type of consistency as the grapefruit gummies that I just reviewed again smell I probably get it give it a hundred I'll look at two out of a five they don't smell very good obviously they've been sprayed with something that's what it smells like to me yeah I don't know they're just they just don't smell good I'm gonna bring the clip the camera up so you guys can get some close-ups of what they look like and then we're gonna eat one we're gonna eat all five okay honestly I'm not really looking forward to eating I ate cookies so far I've eaten the grapefruit gummies and they're both lower than my expectations so that's saying quite a bit with these I'm not expecting much I can they're probably gonna taste terrible the consistency I'm probably not gonna like the bus is the main issue that I have with these gummies is they're they're also low THC that for me personally I need something higher these are high enough let's go ahead and try our first raspberry gummy from Aurora drift okay first gummy has the same consistency basically as the grape fruit gummies actually prefer this consist like they're basically the same but these ones are a little bit more gummy than the other ones I like that these ones aren't sugar coated the flavor they're their raspberry gummies like what do you expect I can taste the raspberry can't really taste the oil but again at two milligrams of pop and kill when you expect these were eight dollars by the way my kind of girl mommy it's too bad and they come in packs of five eight bucks ten milligrams for me personally I don't think it's worth it for someone out there who has a low tolerance that may be worth it for them again to me I don't think I'm gonna be buying them to enjoy because again 10 milligrams that isn't gonna do much to me I am buying this out of my own money to do my reviews hopefully you guys like my reviews I'm trying to be as honest as I can I don't know I still get a little bit of flavor after you know a minute or two of not eating them so I don't mind the gummies I would buy them again not for pleasure I would probably buy them with someone else's money or if someone else gave them to me how to eat them again I don't think I would actually buy them again personally not for eight dollars not for ten milligrams I have some BC pinkish and I'm gonna bust into pretty quick here I may do a review for that stuff this is from flower don't know if it will either way I hope you guys enjoyed this video look for my other cannabis to reuse because every animal that comes out and then I'm gonna buy them in regular review them hopefully I guess subscribe like this video I don't know like the content Cheers let me off", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can go back and you should have all the information if you have any questions for me please comment I don't really know how to oh alright it has showing life but I don't have I only have one of you whoever you are so if you have any questions and this is no longer live please leave a comment please subscribe I will get back to you and as for now have a good day Cheers oh I don't know how to shut it off let's seal it like that", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "QTUJSmCMK_0": "[Laughter] [Laughter] today we are with talasha and malaysia and today we are going to be making candied grapes so as you see we have the jolly ranchers the grapes the pot rocks and we have the repetitive also we have food coloring so we are going to be and we are going to be using the ingredients to make it so be right back when we have we're back and see you as we have the job yeah and we're going to what we're going to be doing doing we're going to take this i know i look a little blender we're going to take this blender take the jogging wrenches and pour it in here we're not going to put the pop rocks in the blender though but we just want to do this okay we're done my shirt is the red one and the green one my favorite is the um really i like all junior wrenches but my favorite is the blue one and green and i like the grape one too i don't like the purple because it's just like grapefruit and i don't really like perfect so yeah you guys we are i guess you could say we are back now back then we are better you know oh this looks pretty yeah let me show you guys if y'all how you guys been since quarantine for us has been it's been okay it's just you know it's different it took us out of school we got to do home school gotta do home school got new stuff on the computer i don't i can't say that i don't really like home school i like real school way better this whole school is like right i just wish they hurry up everybody get better this whole thing go away so we can go back to school go back to our normal life i mean it's getting kind of bad regular but you know you still gotta walk around with a mess and whatnot okay yeah um i mean like real school like we've got schools in real life it don't like take that long but at home school would take so long at home it is so i don't know about you guys like comment down below if you guys have to do home school or you guys are back to school where you guys stay but down here where we live we are in we got to do home school and like for me home school is very it's difficult it's a lot of different things i'm not used to yeah i would prefer you know the regular way the wet school but it looks like that's what it's going to be like hopefully it's not for the rest of the year just for this quarter right especially when we get a parent okay okay mix it up cause it's like stuck in the world or whatever i like this i like the smell of the jelly brush it smells so good so yeah guys we will be back after we're finished for all of this yeah it's a lot all right guys we are back we got most of the candy out we got enough what we think is enough see we have it in the blender now and now we're gonna warn it this is gonna be very loud so yes not cool [Music] did i see that oh yeah okay guys she's gonna take the top off so we can show you guys the inside [Music] whoa like i said i'm just eyeballing it okay i think that's enough and now we're going to add a little bit of water okay guys i added a little bit of water now i'm stirring it um i like i like the one how i look in person let me see if i can try to show it because i think it's the light that's way too dark yeah but it's really like pinkish type of violating person you know now we're going to come back after we let this cook for a minute all right you guys i can hear the pop rocks here y'all hear it it's actually you see if you see like that no food one that's not orange it's red because you probably don't care myself it's the color red it's not orange it's red all right so i'm coming to you guys later okay but guys we are back okay so we had a little mess up you guys i don't know what happened but we blended the the johnny manchester see this is how it turned out i don't know what happened but we can still make this out of something because at the end of the day still um it's still jolly ranchers so we can still dip it in there we're going to use our grapes let's see right here once i got grapes i'm going to take some toothpicks put them on this toothpick and dip it in the corn syrup did a jolly rancher and then we're going to see our pop rocks right here we're going to dip it in there really really low it didn't take that long she probably just [Music] so this is what we're going to do we're going to take this stick it in castle do it yeah [Music] actually dropped in it and we're gonna stick it in the hot rocks i didn't really get the whole whatever i'm gonna take it and put it in this pan over here with the rest of the grapes there is it guys look how pretty that look if i want to make it if you gotta move just come watch this video yeah just gonna watch this video you know learn from miles and snakes you don't have to know we made a few mistakes but we still could make it let's just show you guys what and what not to do and still have fun with it oh this didn't feel high i could really feel it [Music] oh what is it dip then what is that it's corn syrup and jolly ranching pop rocks [Music] go ahead let me see honest opinion [Music] i miss opinion what it's good it's not nice it's good that'd be creative for like birthday parties it's just coming over yeah it's like a good juice to it like gum i love fruit love sugar have fun on both sides they're healthy versus the sugar sweet too which i give it from 1 to 10 which i give it give it eight see they had big m in here the mama for mmt you know i could have been here decorating and showing off but next time probably be in the video and show y'all how to really decorate and do your thing you know what i'm saying well y'all did good i'm very proud of y'all round of applause everybody really likes at home make sure you like comment and subscribe oh yeah that to like comment and subscribe there you go bye", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "tUESRJzL6_4": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds you might hear some noise

real quick ooh looking fancy this one here though is it who's gonna say it looks like something roughed up that flower but Donna says it's the end of the season and yeah probably mid-september well I thought it was all [ __ ] up because I seen the well looked like something was running through there any like a little critter and maybe he maybe he or she [ __ ] him up that's what I was thinking and you know but you say it's the end of the season and that's what it is that's what it is I don't know what's been playing in there though the lower branch there uh-huh and it was making a noise and I didn't it was dark I couldn't see but whatever it was was like it it moved right you must have ran or something but it was enough to make the branch like a wobble like that what do you think that would be to make the branch mmm chipmunk squirrel chipmunk maybe it's not Charlie Charlie would have made a bigger mess than that hmm who knows maybe he's a [ __ ] bird hey maybe it was a bird it could be a bird daughter I don't I don't think so she doesn't think so there's the Sun [ __ ] off for the day and [ __ ] off until tomorrow come on I think he was going oh we want to go and try those Pizza chips and you're slowing us down I'm gonna try the brownie and what see what else do you got to try she brought a bunch of stuff today oh yeah we tried the cinnamon roll with the icing before

there you go ahead you smoke faster Donna the cops are coming come here so let's go and try some chips or something hang on let me set this up properly I'm gonna need to put the camera over here I guess about there I don't know hopefully that's the right spot grab my bomb I already got it load it up I got my bomb loaded it's pre loaded ain't a pre-loaded bomb let me just move some [ __ ] out of the way here make some room we don't need this brownie box anymore that can [ __ ] the [ __ ] off and when it's done doing that it can keep on [ __ ] off hey yeah don't I come and stand in this like the manicures in the right spot cuz you're kind of tall eh oh yeah maybe both there yeah you're you're tall we want to make sure that you're okay so grab those Pizza chips and hopefully I explained this right earlier all three of these bags are limited time only and all three of these bags well not all three of them but these first two bags taste like [ __ ] so because those ones tasted like [ __ ] we decided to go with the third bag them probably [ __ ] yeah pizza please something these Pizza flavored chips just because the other two were so awesome they have some color smells like some cheap pizza that's like the crab dinner cheese all by itself that's bad oh my walk who the [ __ ] is your taste tester Oh [ __ ] tastes like pizza that's bad three bags of chips [ __ ] well just add a waste and let's try something different here okay before we so let's take one onion ring one and one of the cheesy garlic bread and one of the pizza stick them together I wanna see what that tastes like Hey No hahaha it still tastes like [ __ ] actually it's a little bit of an improvement I still wouldn't buy that flavor either but if you're stuck with all three bags and you can't stand them just like us eat them all together it's still bad but it's not as bad even Charlie's down here hacking from the [ __ ] smell see ruffles learn something from lays yeah don't don't go and make like like it she's a garlic bread you know how companies do that look coffee each other yeah like you know how the lace has ketchup okay so she's saying don't copy this stuff they have something on your if you're not [ __ ] satisfied get fresh I go by the you know if you're not satisfied give them to your son model hey that's the model I live by yeah Justin's gonna get three bags of chips he'll like these 17 grams of fine why must be from the cheese I don't know okay anyway while we're here let's try something else you got a brownie you made cut a brownie or do you want to try this this Tim Hortons thing what do you want to try it yeah Donna's gonna make it some jumbo dogs for supper oh well maybe she won't be then I don't know I forgot no we didn't eat I had a granola bar for breakfast and apple juice drink box try that cuz by the feel of it yeah I bet it tastes like an apple fritter doughnut and a cruller I bet you it's not even bread like it's a doughnut what do you cinnamony but does it it tastes like a doughnut mm-hmm yeah see it doesn't taste like a diamond no it's not like you know it's not like a cinnamon roll that you'd make at home like a homemade one it's more about no one that rolled up with cinnamon glaze on it yeah it's okay if you like doughnuts I'm not a big donut fan I wanted to [ __ ] what do you call it I don't know but Tim Hortons makes them like that so why is it like today lays no Tim Burton's bad munchies whose fault is that who bottom [ __ ] off you picked the mode anyway what else don't try there's just brownie that's it this came from Hollander host bakery and deli it's called what you call haystack a haystack we've never had this before this might tease better than the other stuff chop me off a piece chop me off a piece woman don't hit me it smells really okay you caught what that was my knees why is it yours yes it's smaller well you get the bigger piece we're gonna try a stack of hey don't use it was Hey haystack it's okay there you go like coconut and I didn't know there was that much coconut merit and to me it tastes god-awful I think that's what it means my haystack I mean I think they mean it's a stack of coconut as the hey coconuts in the in the place of the hey dog did you want release oh I don't want that anyway we'll try the brownie later I love you me a good brownie anyway anyway Donna's gonna throw on some jumbo hotdogs I still thrown under jumbo hotdogs yeah Donna's gonna throw on some jumbo hotdogs and when they're done I will meet you [ __ ] at the table hey as you can tell Donna's edibles are kicking in back to what I was gonna do [ __ ] sakes here's a jumbo hotdog with some ketchup mustard and relish and I'm gonna wash that down with a cold can of coca-cola you feel a little better over there you good that don't seem good that's gotta be some strong edibles if you want to be laughing like Donna at absolutely nothing head over to can abismo and get yourself some medicated hard candies 100 milligrams of THC and yeah go shopping on that hmm anyway I'm gonna get in my supper toke that's better hey obviously not as good as Donna's feeling no I don't feel as good as her I thought I did but I'm not laughing at nothing good yeah anyway on my [ __ ] tastes like a jumbo hotdog I thought something creepy to show you guys the first the sounds that's my fridge and kicked daughter and it's [ __ ] it just kicked on out of the blue and it's [ __ ] out of it [ __ ] man it's just [ __ ] so if you hear it just ignore it hey and Donna's in the shower because she felt like she needed to go in the shower so she's gone into the shower you might hear the water going just ignore that - hey but before she went in the shower she sent me this creepy picture now in Sudbury Ontario I don't know what it's called now but it used to be called the General Hospital I don't know if they're still calling it that or if it has another name or whatever anyway they're painting at all these [ __ ] colors I don't know why and they got a picture of a dude on there and I don't know why so when I show you guys this picture those use that don't know Sudbury Ontario and about this [ __ ] building I forget what I was just saying but anyway the painted [ __ ] I don't know why they're doing that but yeah I'm gonna show you guys something that Donna sent me and I don't know if it's real or not somebody claims that they pulled over in Sudbury and took a picture of this building the new paint job that they got going on here and here's what their picture shows I hope I explained that all right black [ __ ] hey [ __ ] [ __ ] anyway it's supposed to look the way that you see it but this is an old hospital and there's nobody inside the building anymore and it's just an old [ __ ] building and I don't remember what they said they're using it for now but anyway if you look carefully and I don't know this is all edited or if some you know altered edited whatever you want to call it but there's a person up in the [ __ ] window right there look at that I'll try to get the picture bigger well that doesn't look like a person and then there was another one somewhere right up there look at that now I don't know somebody [ __ ] around and just did this or you know what's that probably nothing anyway I don't know if somebody [ __ ] altered the picture there and whatever but apparently that's supposed to be real and I don't know maybe it is maybe it isn't whatever hey whatever but that's in Sudbury Ontario go look it up if you want to find out more information on that [ __ ] cuz that's all I have is what Donna told me somebody pulled over took a picture when they checked out the picture later on that's what they seem whoo anyway most has probably already seen that unless you're not from here around here Hey but if you're from here you probably know if you're not you don't know and I don't know what I'm saying [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't remember what I said my mind's all over the place I did a lot of long talks it's hard it's hard to concentrate on what I'm saying anyway if you want to find out more details I don't know it is taping like Sudbury Ontario and whatever you want I guess I don't know how Donna found the picture but yeah she sent it to me and yeah there you go hey anyway I'm gonna get another bong toke I see we've got some new subscribers cigarette holder to use [ __ ] yeah I don't know what else there is for tonight a spooky picture hey it would have been better if it was a spooky video if anybody knows of a video of that or more information you know something you know you got a creepier picture of it or something let me know send it to me or tell me where I could see this or something hey I like looking at stuff like that but I don't know if it's real it could be fake I don't know it's not my picture all my pictures are real when I show you a picture of my buns of weeds the real it's not a fake bud I don't know about the ghost pictures it might be a fake ghost might be real though I don't know I've never seen it ghost before I don't think no I don't think so anyway Rockstar from Canada's Bowl I hope my story made sense that I think what I'm saying there about the picture and stuff but that's all I know about it I'm telling you guys a secondhand story you might even be third hand I don't know butts not from my hand bang I didn't know if that made sense ah hey [ __ ] [ __ ] I thought I heard tickling me I don't know what the [ __ ] I've got lots of hairs but it's not one of the ones on my head hey I got a hair sticking on my shirt somewhere it's tickling my arm and pissing me off [ __ ] hey [ __ ] [ __ ] who is it doing I don't remember what the [ __ ] I was doing long talks I might have a second hand talk what I say second hand toke I mean a bonus toke second hand toke I was telling you guys a second hand story or something and I said second and talk after I've done too many bong talks today I can't even keep my words straight hey pretty soon I'll just be making [ __ ] up there is my bullying a stoke not a secondhand hope mmm anyway I got a brownie here the Donna made it's a little [ __ ] looking but you know whatever or my [ __ ] that's a good [ __ ] brownie um I don't know what else to talk about remember the other day when I had some Jack Link's beef jerky from the Dollarama crossbow 250 well the Dollar Tree has the same stuff for a buck and a quarter so if you like Jack Link's beef jerky you can get a cheap little [ __ ] bag over at the Dollar Tree for a buck and a quarter that's a tough little [ __ ] bag hey good quality sounds like dollars done the shower hey my [ __ ] I love beef jerky I got a mood to hear charlie wishes he can have some buddies no loud you said give him some but he's been throwing up today I don't know what he was digging in he must have ate something outside I don't know what he's always putting something in his [ __ ] mouth hey now he's not feeling good and he thinks I'm gonna give him some beef jerky but I can't Donna says I'm not allowed so he has to wait until she says he's allowed to have something apparently you got to make them wait when they're throwing up for a while I guess I don't know it's a dog thing I guess hey I don't know I'm not a dog I don't think anyway yeah it almost didn't want to come out and then when it did come on it was foam hey hey listen real for me one anyway I don't got much more to talk about I'm probably boring the [ __ ] out of you guys tomorrow morning I still got three bags of hang on let me get it I'll show you guys

watch some YouTube videos and um keep on smoking weed Hey so until tomorrow like subscribe and [ __ ] off", "FYppuGvTvNU": "[Music] hey what's up YouTube but I just want to do a quick review of a local edible maker I asked my co-op where these came out of and again they did said the day how they I don't know they always say there's probably bad thing about living in the small town you do get a lot of stuff that is just kind of fancy name thrown on it and how we get our stuff from the bay when in reality they get right here in this area and they don't want to it's it's dumb but it's a justify 60 and 8 type stuff so anyways this is a group called candy care this is stuff was called sweet and sour this is 400 milligram these are gummy bears are not gummy bears but it's like you know like the sour patch kids that when I was a kid when my grandma or one of them I get a quarter or whatever I know I'm probably showing my age but why not get a quarter I'd run down to the penny candy store and to pick up sour patch kids or sweetest fish or you know that cost if I select the dots you know the ones that came on the piece of paper she could rip off that kind of stuff anyways this right here these DS of this little off they got the leg game warning on them but in the back it gives you the main ingredients so the way the ingredients work is the most ingredient that's in it is supposed to be number one ingredient so the number one ingredient is to sugar invert sugar which you know I'll look that up in my next review I'll explain it what that even is corn syrup which is well not good for you but high fructose is worse so this is the third ingredient so but probably to keep the sweetness in it and then the next is cannabis extract my friend corns probably tartaric acid citric acid by the natural and artificial flavoring yelling number six red number 14 number five number one so this is supposed to contain about 10 to 12 milligrams per candy and I was okay so I the most I've ever ate of these is five and it was a very good relaxing a few hours well if I probably ate more I couldn't even got more medicinal up I'm sure of course duh but as far as again as far as taste goes these are very sour which is awesome there's been a couple ones I've gotten in from larger companies who this this sour was there so much so that's why show you looking get it real close you could see it's got those crystals all over it so I'm sure that's why the sugar and the invert sugar if sure that's probably what the invert sugars but very sweet very sour and they also have you can vary in certain pieces you can really really taste the cannabis enema so this is for sure something that I've wanted to pass along if you're a cup if you can by chance get these than I would for sure get these because the medicinal effect is pretty good so this is something to check out for yourself the candy care sweet and sour 400 milligram candies please be sure share and subscribe and all that other good stuff love peace and chicken grease", "21JMBlc-5M0": "well hello this is Darnell I'm 19 coming at you from my kitchen oh yes I am mm-hmm how the [ __ ] he doing I'm doing well I went back to the drawing board and I'm gonna bring you guys some Jolly Ranchers hard candy and suckers I've done these three times now and they've come out perfect each time so first let me just apologize that I'm not doing the demonstration live with you I will do one though I promise so this is what you're gonna need you ready 1 and 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup Caro syrup 1/2 cup water citric acid your flavor and color and a gel paste food corn okay candy molds sticks a candy thermometer a knife or a vegetable cutter an 8 by 9 pan or an 8 by 8 panel all of these products can be purchased at Walmart or Target or anywhere like that with the exception of the citric acid you probably will have to get the citric acid online at Amazon I didn't find it in any grocery store around the food coloring gel that I used there's a Wilson brand and I didn't really care for it because the colors work that vibrant so I went with a generic brand that's called great value that I bought here for 2 bucks and I use the tiny bit of the red ok this flavoring they sell at Walmart there's two in a pack they're considered a dram you used one DRAM per Sippi so you will need one of these in the flavor that you like punched in paper and a saucepan and that is it my friend that is it okay so this is what you do I'm gonna pick a rib first like always tell ya this channel is for eighteen and older you know this right cannabis and cannabis enthusiast and if you are not going my friend get the [ __ ] off my channel would you subscribe up there comment down there hit that Bell if you want to know how I'm gonna go why I put up any videos like this you never know what a girl's gonna put up you just don't know give me a flavor hit that thumbs up on your way up oh it takes a second if you love this recipe I thought about going back old school I was raised on a farm and we homesteaded and I remember Carol syrup water and sugar and flavoring and you had candy so when I brought you the recipe for the gelatin I thought it was gonna be a little bit easier and I've had a couple people that are having some problems with their butter floating on the top and I bet it's probably because the temperature is off one or two degrees now a couple things I want to tell you fYI when you're making candy have everything ready to go prepared ready to go eyeing your pan with parchment paper have your thermometer out your molds out sticks out your knife and everything okay so now what you're going to do is we're gonna take a rib you're gonna put down in the comments what you're ripping on and now I'm going to tell you how to make it choose that just makes everything perfect alright grab a medium-sized saucepan take it and put it on the stove on a medium heat and you're going to add 3/4 cup of your Karo syrup and your 1/2 cup of water you're going to let that dissolve until your Caro syrup is completely dissolved then you're going to add your 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar keep stirring it mixing it up once that's all dissolved stick your candy thermometer on the side of your pan make sure that the bottoms not touching your pan or you'll get it false reading have your parchment paper in your pan lined your mold ready to go and your knife ready to go sometimes when you score you want to keep a little cooking oil on hand so have that out as well and we're going to talk about that once you get your sugar and your corn syrup and all that's incorporating it's boiling really nicely you continue stirring that so your sugars don't burn until you reach about a 250 degrees when your candy thermometer at that point I stopped stirring and I just watched my boil I don't walk away from my candy and then tell my candy thermometer reads 310 and when it reaches 310 I'll remove it from the stove place it on my cookie sheet I'm going to add my 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid my one dram of watermelon my gel red food coloring a slight amount because I did watermelon candies I infused my candies and also used two tablespoons of gorilla glue tincture and 6 grams of teeth by no means do you need to any of that in your candies and you can have that as an option if you are adding cannabis or tinctures to your candies please do that after you've removed it off the stove incorporate it when you incorporate your citric acid your flavoring and your gel mix it up really well Labe pour it in your pan and just set it on your cookie sheet okay at this point now you're just going to watch your solution it's going to begin to cool and as it cools you want to come by and grease your knife or your vegetable cover and you're just going to take your product that you pick off the stove and that's in your pan and if you look at my Instagram you'll see how I scored it now we're just going to imagine that this is our candy for a second if you will grease your knife or your vegetable cutter and just score right here in the center I worked Center out and then I turned it and worked Center out and just kept turning that now just a couple points if your candy won't score it's probably because it's too hot if your knife is sticking to it it's probably because you don't have enough oil on it so come back and try it again if you score it and it didn't work your candy will just wine itself back out again just periodically go back and do it depending on where you live and the altitude of where you live is how long it'll take and it's generally around 8 to 10 sometimes 12 minutes and you'll be able to score it then just set it take it out of your pan set it on your cookie sheet because you're scoring it let it sit on your counter for an hour and you can come back and you can break them into pieces now I made suckers and I made Jolly Rancher candies wat kaminin and puts him in a pretty jar for me and I did six seconds and these are what the candies look like they're perfect and then I made up a little package of ten and I usually do like though giveaways and gifts and things like that with some suckers and some granola bars or whatever these are very perfect size they're just like the Jolly Ranchers they're amazing hard hard hard this will make about I'd say 35 to 45 pieces of candy depending on how big you cut your candy pieces up so if you have any questions let me know once your candy is all cooled and you've broken it up and you want to make some suckers I made square ones Walmart also has round ones like this what you do is take some of your broken pieces of candy mine are stuck because I'm videoing take and stick them in the molds and what I do is I really shove them down in the malls to well sometimes the mold looks deformed I turn my oven on at 275 I place this on a cookie sheet and I leave it in the oven for 15 to 17 minutes until the candy becomes a gel again then I take it out and I place my six in it a couple minutes after that to make sure they don't fall over and you think you've got candy now because I make these in blueberry in fire watermelon and an apple I sometimes have a lot of variety pieces left over and I take them and break them up in a baggie and I stick them in the mold so that my suckers come out all different kinds apple cherry strawberry so that's what I did with these so those end up being like that posh posh if you will medicated candies that I make sucker southern they're amazing I do apologize that people had issues with that recipe I did go back to the drawing board and I thought shizzle man homesteading sugar corn syrup and water and play-doh you got candy so star go back to homestead you're not good you guys are going to love them these you can store up to a year in your freezer on your counter for a good month or longer if they last that long these tastes exactly like Jolly Ranchers this is a must citric acid and the reason is is because citric acid gives candy its pop gives it its flavor gives Jolly Ranchers they're their sharpness their sourness and if you don't use this you won't get that Jolly Rancher flavor so make sure you get your flavoring of yours whatever one you like watermelon out or whatever use a little bit of paste they have the typical colors for Jolly Ranchers and use your citric acid you can use as much as a teaspoon of this the more you use I've used it it's better just don't go over a teaspoon and your sticks check your thrift stores go over and then I don't know where they have all the paperwork and all the books and coloring books and things like that they always have craft step-over they're not even open yet you can find your sticks with my duties since they're pretty cheap these molds Walmart everything here you can get at Walmart I will leave a description at the recipe below under this video and the only thing that you'll need to purchase online is probably your citric acid because I couldn't find it in grocery store unless you have a candy store near you I hope you guys love the recipe again any questions please let me know yes someone asked me for a how to clean glass bomb so I'm gonna bring that to you as well I have not forgotten about that she's been really really busy with the holidays and everything coming up orders are coming in so if you guys want your holiday orders get him in because miss Deb does get busy I'd love to fulfill your orders I hope you're having an amazing night I love you guys so so much

a [ __ ] in the head and I'll go back to the drawing board and bring you another one click one letter one tree right you", "yQlPMFGdOHw": "[Music] hello everyone well via weights the net one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about carrot candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much

guys out on the next video", "wehYpugGkiA": "[Music] [Music] you [Music]", "i-C006ckDu4": "that of faith channel checking in on this episode of the supplement review i am going over the top three intra workout products of 2021. i'm going to talk about what an intro workout is and who should be taking an intra-workout product but if this is your first time to the channel do me a huge favor hit that subscribe button down below on this supplement series i typically review a supplement on every episode to help you decide if it's right for your fitness goals your health needs and most importantly your hard earned money but full disclosure i'm not a supplement expert i'm not a supplement snoop i'm not a supplement engineer i don't have a degree in biology i don't have a degree in medicine all my degrees have nothing to do with ingredients that you might see in the products behind me i am just a person that does honest reviews i reviewed over 400 supplements on this series and i just do honest reviews to help you figure out what's going to be best for your needs and frankly and most importantly for your hard-earned money so let's get into an intra-workout product so many people have heard about pre-workouts that you'll see a lot of them behind me but the reality is pre-workouts are not as important as intra workouts during your workouts you're just frankly beating up your body you know you're breaking down muscle you are sweating out tons of vital vital minerals and you're doing everything you can to just kind of put yourself through the paces the purpose of an intra-workout product is to replenish those minerals and to give your body the ingredients it needs to rebound as quick as possible oftentimes during our workouts we're fine like all the way up to almost the very end we've got those endorphins we get the adrenaline we can take ourselves all the way to the very end and then towards the end we kind of get a little lethargic and especially after our workout we bonk right you kind of hit that wall so to speak the purpose of an intra-workout product is to help us not hit that wall it's to help push you towards the end of your workout and more importantly to help you recover quicker after your workout so that you're not going to just hit that wall and crash and oftentimes we don't see it coming we don't see that wall coming until we hit it square in the face [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am a big fan of intra-workout products because when i don't take them at that 45 minutes post-workout that's usually when i crash and i crash hard i happen to think that these have the best benefit for me more so than all the pre-workouts you see behind me and i am a big fan of just making sure that your body has everything it needs to recover as quickly as it can how do i use intra-workout products i typically start drinking them probably a quarter of the way through my workout and i make sure that by the end of the workout i still have about half left so at the end of the workout when i'm done time to wrap it up throw in the towel i just guzzle the rest of it and that's just how i take it everyone has their own preferences on how they drink their intra-workout products but that is the way that i found to help kind of fight off that post-workout bonk before i get started i want to know from you what your favorite intra-workout product is drop it down below and let's see if yours made my list on this channel i do honest reviews and i don't play favorites and typically when i do top three videos i will do like three two one and will pick a favorite however these intro workouts are so close i mean less than a hair gap between them and a lot of the differences is really small nuances that depending on what you're looking for might put one above the other so i'm gonna give you all three of these and i'm gonna tell you what i think our standouts for each individual one to help you best pick what's right for you but rest assured if you have any of these three you've got a winner the first of the three intro workouts that i'm gonna mention in no particular order is from apollon nutrition their enigma they've had a number of uh versions of them and they've all just kept getting better and better i've reviewed their latest version i'll put that video link in the description of this video and frankly they outdo themselves with regards to their ingredients panel the one flavor that i tried was pineapple and omg that tastes like a fresh ripe pineapple they know how to put ingredients panels together and they make sure that they always over deliver on all of their ingredients next on deck from nutrabio.com is intra blast and if you've been a long time subscriber to this channel you know i am a nutribio fanboy and i only tell you that for complete honesty and transparency i've been a long time fan of their intra blast and frankly it still makes the top of the charts because they do everything right they've got third party testing they've got transparent labels they make their own supplements not a lot of supplement companies can say that one serving is going to be 24 grams that's a massive intra-workout scoop and lately i've been a fan of their new york punch which has a beautiful coconut finish um but yeah man i cannot say enough great things about nutrabio and their intrablast definitely is the top of the charts when it comes to intra-workout products i have one more intra-workout product that i want to discuss and then i'm going to do an honorable mention but as i talked about at the beginning of this video any of these three intro workout products is an absolute winner it's an absolute banger it's an absolute top shelf and a field that is cluttered with supplements near the top of the top here we go from alphalion.com i have their superhuman intra they just rebranded a lot of their supplements to be under this superhuman moniker but they've had our intra-workout product in the past that was amazing and this one is identical it just has a different bottle and a different title same thing trade name ingredients fully stacked label and they always deliver 21 servings per bottle for some weird reason but it delivers everything that you would need and one of the things that they do absolutely probably better than anyone else as a as far as their entire lineup especially with their intro workout products is flavor they are really uh head and heels above a lot of other companies when it comes to delivering great flavors i know many of you don't care about what your products taste like what your supplements taste like you don't care about flavors i care about flavors right because i'm drinking it and i paid for it so i care about flavors superhuman intra another of the top three intra workout products for 20 21. now here is an honorable mention for those of you on a super strict budget when it comes to your supplements if you are looking for an intra workout that is going to cost you pennies then you should look no further than sea salt specifically himalayan sea salt you can buy a bottle like this for like five or ten bucks and you only need to sprinkle a little bit of it in your water is it going to compare to the absolute monsters that i mentioned in today's video no but it certainly doesn't cost as much because you're only going to sprinkle a little bit every time into your water it will help replenish some of the minerals and some of the sodium that you've sweated out during those tough tough workouts if you came this far in the video i want to know in the comments below did i get the top three intra workout products of 20 21 right or am i way off let me know what your top three is in the comments below as usual thank you for watching and don't save anything for the trip back this channel is dedicated to my life as a father of two wonderful children and it centers around health fitness and all of the tricks and tribulations that i go through to try to be a great parent to my children and still accomplish my own personal goals", "zWERaIZJRos": "hey Andy and Dan cane Caruth macdanne cannabis review

that's what it looks like there let's open it up and see its what smell oh it smells really good this was the it smells like the stuff back in the day that's what it smells like so let me just take a drink of my coffee instead of me doing BOM toast with it I'm gonna do is I'm going to grind this up and I'm going to do it in joint form today why not let's take this out put it in there woody coffee and earthy effects are sleepy happy and relaxed well we will see so there it is all in there and it's it's a little bit sticky get this going yeah not the bud the bongs don't whatever but I usually get better effect from joints so I'll do this one in joint I'll show you this I'll show you what it's like grinded up my there you take this yeah get it all out okay put that there that's what it looks like grind it up it I'm smelling um [Music] I'll agree that it smells like the woody I'm not really smelling coffee I'm smelling garlic and the earthy while that just goes with the with the woody so yeah I smell like a little bit of um like garlic you know like wooden kept sauce simmering and you add the extra garlic so don't get my little roller my little it's called is it a tip maybe I don't know what it is it's nothing the filter the I don't know what it is I just know that you need it well you don't need it but you know like when you do it like that okay anyways let's fix this for a second okay yeah so Saturday it's quiet right now oh my goodness it's a good day to smoke a joint and then there's a like a lot of laundry that I got to do and what better way to do it if you're smoking a joint especially from cannabis no there's stuff as you you can just about do anything on it if you need to I'm just rolling there I like the I either use like I use these ones here those are I find these good papers some papers I find these ones are those ones are okay put it in look it up hmm that's a little bit looks like that it's a little bit uh it's a little bit chubby a little chubby joint there yeah but I'm still smelling that garlic I'm not really sure okay there it is I'm what I'm going to do is I got to clean this up wash my hands and then I will meet you guys outside and tell you all about it okay we're outside my joint it's a little bit windy so all I got to put this down here for a second I kind of tastes like it's smooth I'll give it that woody coffee an earthy okay definitely you could taste the the wood and the era thick the wood in the dirt I'm not tasting coffee I taste like a spice yeah whose peanut tasting coffee I have a copy here but okay it goes in but bet it makes you cough just ignore the dog cuz I don't know whose dog that is you know what they're probably gonna get up and walk around just because by the there's a lot of smoke coming off this joint so I'm gonna have to say it's smoky and out like gum I kind of like makes this part here it feels like it's smaller and in my nose a little bit bad everything everything's goin noses like leaky this feels like it's um smaller start to fill it in the eyes so that's good oh my let's see if I can come over here I think it smells like wooden we'd probably more we'd as I think about it I think it's best if I could just stay over here cuz maybe um I'm under like a see I'm under a tree so and there's another tree there if I just maybe sat back nobody could see you here so you get this this this pre 98 bubba is it's from canton abysmal go there you you won't be disappointed at all yeah it's good stuff I yeah I can how about that I'm this far in so would halfway I guess and it's it's doing the trick like um remember I said I had laundry and stuff to do whatever it like kind of makes you like I don't want to say it gives you energy but like you just want to get it done but always take pride in doing your laundry so maybe just at first it's a little it's a little harsh no it's me and then after everything kind of relaxes in you then it's um then it's not harsh like it's you're just really enjoying it I'm enjoying it especially sitting underneath this tree have you said this other one kind of like and then there's the car like his rate right over there so I don't think I have anything to be worried about I'm kind of like hidden except for lake well it's kind of windy too so you can't even tie the smoke to me could be somebody else smoking I doubt it though it makes you think in what what you want your balloons to be for the day that's what I'm thinking right now it's just laundry um yeah this is good [ __ ] I like this this is like like um I still not tasting the coffee though hang on don't you guys hear I guess I taste like a spice kind of like a I don't know trying to like like pumpkin spice like kind of like the nutmeg ish that's what I'm what I'm tasting so I can say with the pre Bubba what the heck is it pretty bubble pre Bubba 98 I agree that the woody and the earthy yes and the coffee is my spice and before I smoked it it's not like garlic to me and the effects are happy sleepy and relaxed I can see getting sleepy on this if you just needed something to to fall asleep like say if you just couldn't fall asleep just like a joint of this would do the trick for you happy yep and [Music] relaxed yes like it just maybe later on I could maybe see it like relaxing as you just don't want to do anything but like I still want to do stuff I just swing in the arms type you know like when you're the cartoons are walking or whatever and you're like just swinging your arms like that that's like the route the relaxed I'm feeling [Music] this was like this is like the stuff that sometimes you'd get in the in the nineties thing it's the stuff that when you sat in your apartment doing it you'd have just like a lamp on or sometimes if you would get really paranoid just sit in the dark and do it and you would watch TV but like you wouldn't know what they were saying because like you had the volume so low that's like this this is like that type of stuff not all the time it wasn't always like that but there was like when people would say oh yeah there's good this is good stuff um damn it all I need to puff more good talk less yeah this is the stuff that like wouldn't you just knew it was this stuff [Music] I'm just about done and the more you inhale the more it feels better so you just keep on keep on smokin paranoid it's cuz it's daytime and the stuff is good and um I don't know I just am so I'll go through the whole thing smell at first is like yeah you could smell the dirt and whatever and I smell garlic before it was guarding it up and then I after was grinded it wasn't like such a strong smell of garlic but I I didn't smell coffee I'm smoking it I'm not tasting the coffee part I taste a spice so that's that part smoke getting tired of doing this smoke yes I think it's it's smoky and it smells woody and weed more weed though the feeling yet relaxed happy and you just want to like think of some plans or decide what you're going to do for the day and I don't think you're gonna want to do too much later to me this is like it's just about an oh my [ __ ] that's what I'm giving it just about it on oh my [ __ ] with that and like my over all of it the everything is the same thing is just about an oh my [ __ ] it's in the decent but it's just about there I definitely couldn't have a conversation with anybody on this good no way like I think it's time to go in soon cuz it's almost like it's too quiet at Saturday but not everybody has something to do that's a little strange okay um so I'm just going to there's maybe like a puff left on here um I gotta get that the laundry done and I don't know what else maybe nothing maybe hell I'll not do anything today except laundry and nothing probably not though okay damn hang on okay 398 Bubba get it at can abismo it's good stuff I recommend it [Music] so that's it that's all bye", "-_hhZdGhF2Y": "okay today we are going to make cannabis lollipops first things you will need are tempered candy molds to absorb the heat of 350 degree molten hot sugar lollipop sticks also tempered candy molds for the diamond door Jolly Rancher shaped candies you'll also need sweet bags to put through their beautiful lollipops and once you are completed you also need flavoring each bottle is one dram you'll want to use one to two jams of flavoring for the recipes that I am using food coloring and some high-grade eh-oh to make it real tasty you will be putting all that into the pot you need a candy thermometer it goes up to 350 degrees for hard crack stage in the pot you'll want to put two cups of sugar one cup of corn syrup and one cup of water slowly bring it to a boil and then let it cook until it reaches the 350 degree hard crack stage then you will have to instantly pour in your cherry flavoring your food coloring and your pho and you will have about one minute to pour your candy into all these molds before it hardens so you will need to be quick and probably need help as the popsicle lollipop stitch will move around a little bit I'll update this next video after the candy is made", "xt9TmUHvmV8": "[Music] welcome everybody back to a new vlog guys um as i promised the last time to make a vlog about this kind of beast lollipop has everybody been asking so yeah it is um you know a lot of people have been asking me can you get high of a cannabis lollipop right hmm how about a little more i don't know so that's what we're about to find out today guys let's see if we can get high of cannabis lollipop but before i try i want to do some research on the internet and as you guys can see right here what it says about the cannabis lollipop and actually i bought this in the street sorry in amsterdam and what i found out here on the website it says that anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop here in the netherlands doesn't contain any thc so i don't think uh lollipop i cannot this lollipop can get you high to be honest guys but we about to find out today it's about to go down let's go guys first of all as you can see i act this is how it leaked with the amsterdam written on it and you have the lead logo on it let me open it and try this so we can [Music] see if you can really get high of cannabis lollipop or not but as we already know the answer guys you can get half cannabis lollipop though i'm gonna go ahead and try it anyway to show you guys so if anybody ever show you or you can hear how the cam is really about that that's [ __ ] actually as it says and let me open this it's just a little bit hot to open guys [Music] [Laughter] are you serious [Music] do a few moments later finally guys [Music] that's a whole lot of work to open the lollipop it wasn't i noticed so i opened it it was very sticky it's very sticky um [Music] actually it smells like weed to be honest okay [Music] oh hold on a minute guys [Music] i don't like the taste to be honest guys like i don't like the taste but for some people it might taste good it tastes like sweet actually and i haven't noticed any effect on i get how to feed anything like that just to say that's easy i want to do the research now anything that is bought outside of a coffee shop doesn't contain any thc and if you don't have thc in your canopies you can get high like so if anybody ever tells you how this that's [ __ ] because you can't get high off it cannot be lollipop it doesn't contain chc so it's just like our regular candy so if you have a key definitely don't recommend you to buy this for a kid guys because uh cannabis is drugs it's legal in some countries some countries not so i can't recommend any mother or family person to buy this for their kid no if you ever see this as i just ignore it but just so you know you can't get out of this i don't give that to my kids to be honest i won't give this to my kids but i'm just saying like it tastes pretty much okay but bruh oh if you make my thongs green right [Music] actually it doesn't taste that bad to be honest but for me i don't like these just like locris they you know so how do i recommend you guys to buy these yeah if you're 18 upwards i recommend easier to buy this you can actually find it in most of the shops in the upstate area most of the shops around upside you can find this here so you don't need to go to a coffee shop to buy a cannabis lollipop guys wait a minute you can buy a almost every shop here in amsterdam oh that says on the reset that i did you can only buy anything that contains thc in the cannabis shop so don't let anybody try to play you anybody trying to fool you or make you feel like oh i just take two of these or i just get half a cannabis lollipop because that's [Music] not me so here you have it guys you can get out of this [ __ ] so [Music] and the coffee shop is about to close in 10 minutes time so you know what's up guys my [ __ ] i gotta go born today see you next time guys and don't forget to subscribe like share my vlog have a nice day guys", "U_kOrUe-7ns": "[Music] hi everyone so today I'm going to be doing a review on the dark side dabs honey oil from cannabis mom we're gonna just do it where well I'm gonna do it enjoin form and I'll do like I looked it up but I'm gonna breakfast just to see him I'm gonna do the when you put the line across it on the weed so this is a little exciting I don't know like last time I did this it was a stuff that you put underneath here your tongue I've never had from cannabis nope I'm excited because this their stuff is very good so let me um grind up some wheat and then bring you guys back to show me rolling it up and smoke it and telling you guys what I think of dark side dabs honey oil from cannabis No okay so the joint is rolled it's not the best rolling job but it's not the worst either wait so there's the oil on it it smells like the 1990s so let's light this up it's strong I'm not even like I just started and but I'm telling you way way back in the day way back I remember smoking this Thank You years ago and oops I should probably keep you guys here it's it's the same same taste same smell it's a little smooth but a little harsh if that makes any sense look at that there's the smoke Jesus but I was gonna do this in the house that was like [ __ ] that but see this is not the this is the part where it's not smooth it's like a little tingly back there I feel like I'm like 20 years younger right now that's what this this yeah I guess oil never changes the smell of it anyways or the taste I'm right here on it still have a little ways to go I should have rings something up for what this had my uh my arms getting sore holy [ __ ] uh okay so I'm like this far through like halfway maybe ish maybe not even and I'm already starting to feel it um feeling my eyes I'll keep smoking though so everybody knows what it's like in joint form for somebody that doesn't do it because I don't do as much weed as like what Edie does or because he's just does lots of it and I'm still kind of like new I guess at this so I can tell you from kind of like a new person um holy crap yeah I'm liking it and this joint here is the the oil that I had showed you and it's Rockstar from Canada small also and Jesus good thing there's like nobody here but [ __ ] stinks out here any money see it's all dark over there and start behind but over there's just a street so you'll see light from there oh my god I don't know this is a little intense here I don't like this again [ __ ] that [ __ ] was I thinking okay maybe now is have I'm not sure what a [ __ ] wheel on that part to see wonder if I can my traces sitting for you guys to see it again mmm not really a maybe like that you can kind of see hmm yeah this is you would want it yeah I think I might have to stand up just I'm really not baking wait this looks there um see I'm pausing too long [ __ ] crap um well yeah this is like you would want to do this if you had a really shitty job and it was the most stressful fucked-up week ever do this you wouldn't have any worries this is good [ __ ] I can say with smoking this it's a lot of smoke it stinks like you know you know what like this is you can say it was something that it wasn't because I'm telling you [Music] don't smoke this it has to be a smoke it but in a you know well-ventilated area that's what I like don't don't smoke in your bedroom or don't smoke it in your house here people I [ __ ] don't even know where it is holy [ __ ] this takes a long time [ __ ] all right god I feel like [ __ ] just puffing away to get inside but somebody's gonna hear me soon but look holy I can't say you have any muscle aches and pains [ __ ] um anything like that this take it does take the pain away I'll tell you that somebody on bike that sees me why are they looking there's somebody else on a bike flashlight and I can't go to the side of the house to [ __ ] see because you'll be pitch black and you won't even be able to see me I can't even [ __ ] go anywhere I was like oh maybe I'll walk under the gazebo it's too dark you guys won't see me extend a great [ __ ] doorway what a stupid place to smoke a [ __ ] enjoyed with this oil stuff this shit's good goalie can abysmally get it [ __ ] is it good this really does remember remind me of the the nineties though mm-hmm I remember yep rolling up oil and put your weed on it and I didn't do it that was AG but yeah it was like you think back of it now and I was like like I think it's pretty neat and after we were done smoking it right you know I have a lot of laughs and get the [ __ ] munchies sometimes we just sit down on the floor and I'm just laughs and dog I keep hearing tinkling dingaling I need to get inside to do like a decent ring oh who says I don't like this at all the [ __ ] going on with this [ __ ] joint now um I do I will say though like a mind smoking the oil back then I don't mind it right now it's pretty good good stuff but um I'm not really into smoking it in the house cuz to me I find how could I make this sound right so like I will kinda like the smell of oil but at the same time it's like the next day when you wake up not high anymore um you feel like you don't wash everything it's like that smoke that probably really sticks to [ __ ] so that's my only like dilemma with it [ __ ] I wouldn't want to be walking somewhere I give I would just give up halfway there or whatever it'd be like [ __ ] this I'm not walking around but at least I'm not coughing as I know it everybody's heard me I remember sometimes having really really good um I don't know why it look at it's barely on fire um I mean really really good oil or whatever way way back like 20 years ago I'm just going to [ __ ] eat laughter because it just hits you that hard stuff it brings back a lot of like maybe if you had long-term memory problems this stuff may help you cuz I'm remembering a lot of stuff okay we're just about there and then we can go inside and I'm gonna do or sit down at the table cuz I kinda don't want to be um outside anymore holding this cuz I don't know I'm thinking it smells really bad yes makes your call flaw it's okay I'm just gonna put this on tonight you can maybe see me a bit have two little good jokes okay we're going inside okay so okay that's good okay we'll start at the beginning now that I'm inside and warming up the smell is of oil maybe a little bit of weed obviously oil it's a smell that you just know is oil the smoke there's lots of it like it just barrels into the air that's why you don't need to smoke this in your house go outside and do it the taste is oil and it makes like he coughed quite a bit sometimes you have like a little bit of a spell that you don't but then you start coffee again like the way it makes you feel is good makes you feel good like you wanna think about [ __ ] mmm getting a little bit nervous right now because I'm really high I don't know what to do so we'll just keep going on the review so this part is that oh my [ __ ] cuz it's really good and and the overall of this as a isn't oh my [ __ ] like yeah like it's like it's good you just you know in here like hi but then you're like a little too high and you just want to get back to where you were just regular high and you don't know what to do that's what I'm thinking right now like the best place for me would be in the living room in the dark or laying in bed in the dark I'm just thinking and [ __ ] so you get this I can abismo it's and what is this what is this called honey oil it's called honey oil you don't need a lot of it ya see Candace my house it's always good [ __ ] over there just go there um so yeah I like get it but I think it's called some dark side dabs honey oil I think so anyways just go there and get it you don't really like it and for like again five minutes like on your screen you'll see the light switch in the background great there I have been trying to figure out what the heck is on my screen until I realized it's the light switch so um anyways I think that's I think that's everything I need to go get a drink and now I'd like to have some soda crackers but there's nothing so just have a drink so that's it that's all bye", "yw-Ef5D6nOQ": "hi everyone so I'm back with another video and it's been a while but today I am going to make some candy grapes and oh they're trying to dry them off some candy grapes and some candied cherries so I'm gonna show you guys what you will need for that we're gonna put these back off to the side we're gonna need toothpicks and I'm getting low on to fix so I have some skiers here as well we're gonna need some color so we're gonna need some bright white and I'm gonna use the red red today the flavor that we're going to me cuz I only have a little bit left in this one and a little bit left in that one so we're gonna do tropical punch and tutti fruity flavored mix together and we're going to need some sugar once again don't judge my pot is then do some things some Cairo syrup and then I have some crushed up Jolly Ranchers that we're gonna dip some of our grapes into and you need water so I'm and a candy thermometer make sure you have a candy thermometer I'm gonna get mine now cuz I was not all the way prepared my candy thermometer alright so gonna open up my sugar okay hold on alright so you're gonna need two cups of sugar we're gonna use a half a cup of water oh just try not to make a mess and I still made a mess and we're gonna do 1/2 a cup of Cairo sir where's my spatula so we're gonna do this to make sure we get all of our Cairo syrup out all right and I'm gonna sit that to the side because I have to make a couple batches today all right so we're gonna stir make sure everything is combined before I put it on the stove and add about 250 degrees I'm gonna add my fragrance not my fragrance listen I make too much stuff y'all your flavor oil in and you can find the flavor oils on Amazon you can find them at Michael's Hobby Lobby you can go on the lorian's actual website and find them as well okay so now I'm gonna add in my white you said I just did one squirt and then you see how it's turning completely white I love this one so far I do know this on some colors it does leave specks which I don't like but so far I'm still learning and then we're just gonna add a little bit of the red alright and then I'm gonna put this on the stove and I'll be back once I have candy I'm gonna take it off the stove at 300 all right so once you clean your grapes and you want to make sure they're completely dry you're just gonna stick the toothpick in like so and get them ready to dip so our candy mixture is on the stove I'm gonna be making sure that these are completely dry and getting them ready to dip you do not want to put your toothpick in too far to piercing all right so I got my grapes with the toothpicks in I shouldn't talk for a second and I have my cherries dried if you do try this just be careful cuz I accidentally took one of the stems off and make sure to wear gloves because I burned myself last week and it is no fun people the sugar gets up to 300 degrees not fun but neosporin is a miracle worker I forgot to say also when I put my sugar mixture on the stove I'll put it on medium so right now - between 5 & 6 on the stove and that's why I keep it this is what our candy mixture is looking like we are still not at 300 yet but I have added my fragrance oil and it smells so good in here all right so our candy mixture is off of the stove and you have to work really really fast make sure you get it up to 300 degrees and I'm gonna sit it off here to the side and this is I took these outside these are Jolly Ranchers and I just bang them with a hammer because I don't have a blender at the moment so that's how I make mine and I just kind of mix it up a little bit I just want the bubbles to come down a little bit all right so we're just gonna dip and sit it on I have it this is a silk mat that I have so I'm going to dip and sit it off to the side and you have to work quick so okay you guys see it there we go we dip and I'm gonna let this excess drip off a little bit then we're gonna dip in the Jolly Ranchers just a little bit that's how that's gonna come out and then we're gonna set it to the side and I try to do quick so I don't do too many of the Jolly Rancher ones I just add those kind of in the mix you guys see me it's like a dip and sit down and dip and now see this one I'll let some of the excess come off and then we'll come over here and dip it in the Jolly Ranchers all right so I'm gonna finish dipping well let me do one cherry right click so you guys can see the cherry sorry so this is my cherry and I'm just gonna dip make sure it gets all the way in there and set it off to the side all right I'll be back once I'm done guys alright guys so my grapes and cherries are done I'm gonna pull up a cherry so you guys can see it you see that shine oh look at so pretty so I would just break those little pieces off and that's the cherries so for the grapes I have these containers here I get them at my local Oh hit the camera I get them to my local baking store but I'm pretty sure you can find them on Amazon they're reusable and microwavable but I put my grapes in here and I stick them into the freezer so that the sugar doesn't melt because this is a treat that you would have to eat really quickly or else put them in the freezer so what I do to take the sticks off is I just twist and pull out and drop them in the container so you just twist and pull out cuz you don't want to damage the candy and I sell mine twelve in a container and then I did some little fancy little little whatever we want to call it alright so that's what my great look like in the container very pretty I like to give a little bit of a variety and I stick these in the freezer and they are so yummy hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm gonna finish packing packaging these up then I'm gonna start on the next order bye guys", "vT0gL-50J4E": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds [Music] [ __ ] right I got some Tostitos hinted Jalapa no [ __ ] woody call chips and salsa and I was

understand what she was saying ten means it was good and one is not so good she said what number do you pick for the taste no just for the whole thing around Oh what are you gonna rate every little detail yeah I don't think anyway if you want no I don't know anybody wants you here nobody cares about the taste I think it's more about the hi I don't think when I buy my weeds I'm working so with

rtd beverages for the ghost brand uh this won't be the only one that will be joining the lineup i do know they are working on protein rtds to replicate some of their delicious protein flavors let's talk a little bit about ghost energy and why it separates itself from the pack and other energy drinks on the market so we have sour watermelon warhead we have sour patch kid um again the collaborations with the companies love how ghost does that i think this is what orange mango tropical mango sorry and then we have citrus feedback has been phenomenal on these and another thing you really have to appreciate with ghost is the transparency they put on the formulas so if that is hard to see i will also put it in the comment box and i'll give you a quick rundown on what we are getting in ghost energy right now so per can you get 200 milligrams of natural caffeine you get one gram of taurine which is an endurance booster one gram of all car which is right here acetyl l-carnitine so that's basically a cognitive enhancer and you're also going to see that with the other aspects that are in the formula with you get the 150 milligrams of alpha gpc again that and the neuro factor at 100 milligrams are all there for your brain health brain function and focus so it's not only just giving you clean natural caffeine there's also those enhancers in there to really smooth out the caffeine half-life and make it a really really long lasting you know amount of energy not something that's just going to spike your energy and make you crash totally different here the kicker here which i really like is the 25 milligrams of estrogen at the bottom that basically enhances everything that's in the beverage as far as uptake of the ingredients truly appreciate ghost putting that in an energy drink to make those ingredients a little bit more effective so now that we know a little bit more about ghost energy uh if you haven't really followed ghost youtube at all they have hinted at maybe 10 to 12 more flavors in the future and based off what we're seeing here with the sour patch kids warheads i'm going to guess that whatever's coming to their gamer line is going to carry over to the energy line because i know they are working on a collaboration with uh i think it's like expel or whatever that uh gaming corporation is for a limited edition flavor so we're going to go right down the line here and i'm going to start with citrus i'm going to guess this is going to be something similar to sprite i'm uncertain but let's give it a go cheers legends yeah i wasn't too far off with that one i think this is a really safe flavor um that people will really enjoy kind of get a little bit of lemon in the back end there a little bit of zest from the citrus pretty standard flavor to me it's not something that's going to knock your socks off and make me want to go out and you know just buy a 12 pack of you know citrus but good change of pace yeah i would say so but definitely not something that's uh you know off the top of my head that's a must get flavor just trying it so let's move here tropical mango chocolate mango right yep tropical mango that orange can throws me off thinking it's something orange so i love mango flavored things uh this one probably is definitely peaking my interest let's give it a whirl oh yeah that mango hits you hard in the back end in the aftertaste so the tropical is kind of like your initial fruit punch you know that array of flavors that really hits your taste buds that mangoes the density of the mango really kicks in in the back end you have to let this one kind of sit on your taste buds for a little bit but you will pick up that mango and it does hit hard so this is another good one um let's see how these other two are before i kind of make my consensus here so i have not had the sour patch red berry in legend or any of the other flavors this is my first experience with it i've heard nothing but great things so going into this one with an open mind hopefully it's a home run cheers damn wow i'll tell you what you guys that love your sour patch kids love that sweetness love that red berry home run this is wow this is up there when it comes to all-time energy drink flavors just off that initial taste dan ghost ryan adam rest of the team this right here phenomenal i can kind of see why for ghost gamer it's such a very popular flavor so let's get to the last one here sour watermelon warheads i have had this in pump really really like this flavor so super pumped to try it in the energy as well cheers yeah that's ooh wow the density of that watermelon oh so unique it's like the og extend like in the black labels that jolly rancher flavor but enhanced with the sweetness of the warhead now this one is definitely for those that got a nice sweet tooth and the carbonation really kicks up the amount of flavor in it between these two i could buy a 12 pack of those in a heartbeat and i would have no problem drinking them day in and day out these two flavors lights out now citrus i would say maybe a six out of ten seven out of ten i mean it's a good change of pace definitely not something top tier that i think is a must go get but if you want to try it out i would highly suggest it and i would say the tropical mango would be around like a seven seven and a half it's good i think it needs a little bit more on the initial taste the mango's really good in the back end but the tropical flavor is a little lackluster but overall i would kind of rank them very similar to this you know one and two right here very hard between that and then i would say three and four but overall really excited about these guys when you can get your hands on them right away i would go with these two um you can roll the dice with these but again they're not my preference they may be yours but whenever i buy ghost products i'm not associated with the brand all my pennies go to price plow i always support ben mike and heather you can always use their coupon code price plow at ghostlifestyle.com save 20 off your order they should be coming out really soon in multiple locations so keep your eyes out if you give them a try let me know what you think", "bUyodGwPv1Y": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on medicated sour worms from can abysmal they're 40 milligrams each so there's there's two worms eighty milligrams I don't know what the flavor is though uh-huh we'll find out I'll open it up and we'll try it I'm figuring the the dark one the purple I guess I'm gonna say it's great but I don't know how they are look like they look like um you know those things that you the fake worms that you put on hooks they look like that okay this one tastes like I yeah there's some sour to it and that they smell like grape at first they taste like grape and they taste like weed there's number one I don't know what the red one's gonna taste like maybe I don't know if it smells like something I don't know what though let's take a bite that one's really sour and it's like a berry I don't know what just tastes like I'm like a berry it's sour berry than weed so that red one is really sovereign huh yeah so I'll wait a bit released to kick in and then I before I used to like I've said this before um I used to do the review as soon as I felt something then I would continue on with it and then I realized that I'd be doing the review and then you know like half an hour later I was like it was more of a you felt more than what you like a stronger version of it so yeah so I usually wait like if say I start to feel this in an hour then I'm gonna wait like the extra three minutes or whatever just so I can tell I can give a good review on it I could say what I'm feeling and what to expect I guess yeah so they're medicated sour worms you that you get them at can abismo and they are they are sour but then you have the wheat taste so they're good so I'll be back when uh when it kicks in okay so um this stuff is very good sometimes when I'm doing like edible reviews I'm smoke a joint or what just - I don't need to smoke the joint but nope it's like really strong like you're you live up and then you look really concentrating and then you like then you feel like you want to throw a hub and and then you get like you feel like tired and then you feel like you want to throw up some more and yeah like I just play like I would just like to go sleep I said I wouldn't feel like I'm gonna throw up so yeah maybe like I should have just did one worm cuz 2 is a lot for me anyways and I find that like you get really dry fast and if you're wondering about the blanket it's just um I'm cold I feel cold you get like a little bit of the bun Chee's but not really bad cuz I feel like I'm gonna throw up so I wish I didn't feel like that I hate that feeling like this is something you want to do like close to bad time or I give you had a hard time sleeping for a few days see this would help you sleep um yeah I don't even know how long it's been oh happy I'm fighting that I can't like a little bit dizzy too so I don't know what's going on I like it ate supper first and then I ate that was so it wasn't like I ate them on a empty stomach so thank God thank God hated [Music] what else am i I was in um just bring up something I've been noticing lately and maybe like people my age or maybe even a little bit younger I don't know but so a couple well a few days ago I was putting together a movie like though anyways so and I was I had to make sure that they it went to get that the way it should I'm looking at myself alia I'm watching myself anyways it is really weird because like I this is something I always do but it was a weird because this time I'm looking at it I'm looking at it and I see like I see my mother so like I said it's me I know it's me but I see it like it was like holy crap like he don't ever look like my mom and then I thought now like maybe it was just that what maybe he's just but then I went way down and went up are on the movie and that I played it again and that's all I could see so that's like a little bit weird for me anyway so no but like if you ever thought that you don't look like any of like any of your parents and then something like that happens like so weird um also if you if you ate this make sure you you have a drink lots of drinks cuz you get so dry you get so dry like it's so dry my mouth but I can say like um you know that little pocket between you like you're the top of your gum and like on the side of the more hmm what that's about okay so yeah it's that like it's that dry I can even dry out there every um everyone snow I'll get a little bit of faint of heart type of feeling so yeah I if you're going to do this just you may cut the worm in half even and just do half the worm even maybe the house maybe that I should have done that forget just eating one eat half just to is obviously way too much and I don't know how to like you know get out of you faster or whatever it is I don't know like I don't even feel like I can't open up my eyes right now they're so happy and I just keep thinking I finished the video like I can't don't go to sleep so yeah so Charlie for a walk earlier it was a little bit cold outside and if you hear ed that's because he's doing his video so yeah that's why you you'd hear him he's finishing a video oh my god my eyes are so heavy I use okay like I can just close them like this and just talk like this and it would be it would still be okay because that's how heavy they are you know like sometimes when you take a really hot shower sometimes if you take a hot bath then you get out and you just feel so tired it feels like like I am seriously so tired and I just would like to go to bed I really would I I'm good just you know let me sleep it's just me I'll drink you know good amount before I go okay just leave because I probably won't you know sometimes you wake up every couple hours first I get simple water I don't think I will be doing that [Music] yeah I'm so tired I'm so sorry oh he's crap I'm tired okay okay I don't know what I need to do but I need to do something and like I don't think fresh air is gonna do it and I don't think like getting I hope is gonna do it and I don't think like I don't know what to do to get rid of this cuz this is like it's it's gotta calm down or something cuz I this is a little too much if I just didn't like I just needed to just not to be so high like yeah it's a little bit what's the word it's a little bit [ __ ] I can't remember that word [Music] you probably heard ed I'm so tired what else say it's just really good like it's just good if you want to get some good sleep in or you want like it's a good high get these but I'd say start off with like half of the worm because the hole might even be too much um it's supposed to snow tomorrow too I think like five centimeters but still I hate I really don't like this no I hate this no I hate the cold I'm not a big snow fan person um charlie loves the snow though yeah a little bit does he um yeah Charlie he just loves the snow I give me like minus 40 and my dog still wants to go for a walk um I think I told you guys everything that I can say about it go to can't abysmal it's in the edible section and I'm pretty sure it's in the candy part or maybe been the gummies if there's one that says gummies but it's really good and I'm pretty sure they're only five dollars and that's a good price it's very good price I hear sirens again ya expect like ago I really get high from these [Music] something bad must have happened nor what anyways don't forget to Like and subscribe so that's it that's all bye", "IeYVffYJWjQ": "okay i think we'll go ahead and get started because we have an awful lot to talk about in the next hour uh so welcome everyone really glad that you're with us this morning thank you for making the time for this very important topic my name is kim porter i'm the executive director of be a part of the conversation we're a non-profit in southeastern pennsylvania we serve five counties including montgomery county they are our hosts today and our partner in this and our funder and we are very grateful to them um today's program is funded as part of the youth marijuana prevention project this is a five-year initiative that started a year ago in july so we're just in the start of our second year and this is something we've been really looking forward to so really very grateful to have you all with us today thank you for being a change maker in the state of pennsylvania so i want to let you know that we are recording this presentation um we are you are all in just viewing mode only so we cannot see or hear you um we're only going to be recording the presentation portion of this we'll stop recording when we get to the q a section we don't want anyone to feel at all intimidated to ask questions but just so you know if you're asking questions throughout the program during valves or ben's presentations um you will we will not be the recording will not pick up those questions they will just be um you know within this this meeting so don't worry about that um the link uh to the recording will be available later today so we have this program scheduled to go until 9 30. but uh ben cord our featured presenter today has agreed to stay on with us um he originally talked about an hour maybe 30 minutes where his schedule's getting a little bit crazy today but if need be he'll stay on for at least a half an hour after this program if there are additional questions that aren't answered also um there's a page on our website that we've dedicated to this program and this topic our website is as you can see at the bottom of your screen conversation dot zone uh if you go to conversation dot zone slash lead as in taking the lead then you'll find the follow-up page which will have the recording of the presentation this morning it will also have loads of other information we have a q a section where we'll try to get to some of the topics that are or some of the questions that are coming up that we've already noticed in the advanced questions that many of you submitted that there are some themes and a lot of really great questions about the developing adolescent brain and all of that lots of information will be on our site about that and it's there right now but it's not there yet is of course the recording because we're live uh and also this is something that we're doing um separately from our our um agreement with the county but this is something we're presenting ben has graciously agreed because we know that we have a lot of questions out there he's graciously agreed to come back and visit us in october on the 15th we're calling it lessons learned from colorado because as you will find out ben court is a marijuana policy expert from the state of colorado so he certainly has a lot of lessons to share with us so we're grateful that he will be with us on that date at the same time at 8 30 we're going to make that at 8 30 to 10 a.m presentation so we'll have information about how to join that meeting uh soon that'll be on the follow-up page as well uh we also have a program coming up this is part of the youth marijuana prevention project uh this is at the end of october the 27th cannabis it's complicated especially for kids so we will be talking about the way marijuana cannabis impacts that developing teenage brain we will have someone in recovery from cannabis use disorder with us we'll have a clinician talking with us so i think that should be very interesting i just want to give you a very brief snapchat snapshot of what marijuana use is looking like in pennsylvania these days and i know that we have some prevention providers with us so you've seen this before but i think all of us need to just have a quick look at this past 30-day use um the pennsylvania youth survey is done every two years in grades sixth eighth tenth and twelfth so we're looking at 2015 2017 and 2019. so it's the same population being surveyed every other year and when we look at this in pennsylvania past 30-day use this is not lifetime or past year but past 30-day use of marijuana you can see you know 12th graders are up to about 20 percent of them are over the last six years have been using um cannabis if you look and vaping of course this is something that wasn't even measured before 2015 but you can see how it has increased um in the last three or the last three surveys that were taken you can see that the use has gone up in vaping when students who said that they were vaping were asked which products they're vaping um when we then when asked about marijuana or hash oil oil these are the numbers um of students who were vaping in the past year indicated that they were using marijuana or hash oil there's a lot of other data and we have the full pays report on our website on that follow-up page so we encourage you to check that out we also have the montgomery county results there as well so at the end of this program when we're finished you will have an opportunity that something will pop up on your screen inviting you to take our survey we really appreciate you doing that because it helps us to know we've been effective what else you might need to hear from us in the future um and we really encourage you to do that helps us tremendously in our future programming and just a reminder to follow up on that page on our website so it is my great pleasure to introduce you to dr val arkus she is the chair of the montgomery county board of commissioners so i will stop sharing my screen and say welcome to you dr urkush thank you so much for being here oh you're muted val all right let's try that again good morning everyone and kim it's so great to see you and i want to thank you and be a part of the conversation for putting this really important discussion together this morning be a part of the conversation is such a critical partner in the work that we're doing in montgomery county through our office of drug and alcohol around a number of issues around substance use disorder and other challenges across our community so just want to thank you for convening all of us and to thank all of you that are attending this morning at an early time on a friday morning i know there were close to 300 people registered and it looks like you know the vast majority of them have signed in and i'm particularly happy as i was scrolling through the attendee list to see so many members of our montgomery county community that i know individuals that work for the county across multiple different departments we've got members of law enforcement on this call members of and representatives of different community groups so i just want to thank all of you for participating i do believe this is an issue that affects all of us and is one that is something that is actually very complicated in a lot of different ways there are issues around youth use particularly as kim has already mentioned the developing brain but this also dovetails with issues of social justice and criminal justice in our communities and there's been we know historically very real impacts there as well so this is a complicated issue and i'm very grateful to hear ben court's perspective on this issue i have been as you all know i'm a very data driven individual i'm a physician by background for those of you who don't know me and i have been very interested in watching what has happened in colorado over the last several years so i'll be interested to hear the latest on october 15th and we'll definitely try to tune in for that but i think it's really important that we see what's happened in other places both good and also things that are cautionary notes and that if we do end up moving forward in in the state of pennsylvania with some sort of legalization of non-medicinal use of cannabis i think it's just very important that we look and see how that's gone in other states and what can we learn from that here so i'm very grateful to have this conversation very interested to hear the multiple perspectives on this issue and kim again just want to thank you for your leadership on this issue it's been so important to our community thank you so much dr kush really appreciate you being here and for your kind words um ben i'm not going to do a big introduction because i know people will learn about you on our website we have your bio there but ben has presented with us many times you can find other videos of his on our youtube page which i'll also be sharing but if you want to unmute and say hello to our guests and we'll let you get started thank you so much ben unmuting good morning everybody um thank you very much dr akush and kim of course thank you i'm sorry that uh this is virtual um i'm always excited when kim calls because uh my my little sister is in upper box and uh so every time i i do something with um kim and her amazing organization i get to go and stay there and make a little bit of trouble with uh my 11 year old nephew um so i'm going to see if i can share my screen here you would think that after all of this time doing um doing this i'd be better at it so kim just to clarify so um i know we're gonna go until uh 9 30 and then we're going to open to questions is that correct correct um well we were going to have you try to get to questions earlier than that if we can because we've we've told folks that we would have this program from 8 30 to 9 30. so if we can wrap up before 9 30 that would be great um and we're looking at your desktop right now yes ma'am okay 30 minutes to discuss this subject uh means that you gotta get ready to drink from a fire hose even if i'm going to be judicious and what i'm going to um share with you as we go through all of the questions and as uh i've had conversations with people in pennsylvania um it was my wife's from theirs uh where we met were married uh i know the state um i i tried to figure out a couple of things that might be of the most interest to you uh and as we were doing this even just getting into the uh a couple of points it might be just pulled kim there's just no way we can do any of the justice so um i'm asked i could come back uh i'll be back in a couple weeks to do more but i'm also going to give you some resources at the end because the reality is that um when we made this decision in colorado we did not have anyone uh who went ahead of us and that that means that we weren't able to look at and consider uh a real world application um you in pennsylvania are able to do that with multiple different states and and the trick is like anything that is politics i mean my goodness in a presidential election year uh this is a factor 10 like anything is politics uh a lot of the times the information gets drowned out by the the volume of the police that are yelling um so i have always attempted to stay apolitical in this kim did you have something yeah your audio is a little bit um choppy i don't know if there's anything you can do on your end i'm not sure if you're using you know i don't see earbuds but just so you know you're a little i'm not using okay i'm not using it um it's distracting enough that i should shut applications down and things i don't think so i would keep going all right i'm not gonna move except for to advance the screen so uh all of that time wasted to tell you i'm not gonna waste my time on this i'm going to try and go quickly um so listen the the bottom line is that um you absolutely have to make sure that we're looking at real and valid information because of the money involved in this and because the deep deep politics here a lot of what happens ends up being spun pretty hard by both sides of this and here were a couple of different decencys to start that i thought you might be interested in because um there's such solid uh data so real science is general publishing and peer-reviewed real science is is not a survey uh they have very little interest most days what's 32 percent of america believes because last time you checked a majority of this country thought that the bachelor was the best show on television kim am i having trouble here yeah a little bit and i also want to make sure that you're not showing a powerpoint right now correct because we're still looking at your your your fault your folders i don't know why your audio is still kind of choppy kim can you see this yes and any better on the audio well right now it is we'll see how it goes there you go all right i apologize everybody no i should have stopped you ah stupid internet all right so these are a couple of nice studies for you to consider at first um but again there are quite a few uh my um personal belief in this is that you should always give these things a little bit of time to breathe because what will happen a lot of times just a preliminary data summary will be monday and by tuesday you've got people writing articles about it saying that it was the silver bullet that i was waiting for um so i i kind of like to give the science a little while to breathe but these are a couple of really nice places to start the reason why i i so prefer um the metastatic entire volkov game here is that a summary of um all things known up until about 2014 uh about cannabis and i think the most important one that we have considered as one that's bold originally published february 2015 please please look into this one it's called the effects of hypocrisy cannabis and psychosis and that's published in lancet and there have been multiple follow-ups since so the most important thing that you have to understand uh and what happened in colorado was that cannabis changed fundamentally and this is the new school campus it's not what you spoke in the 70s i hope that you can see see this kim just give me a thumbs up making sure you can still see my screen now i'm all tech self-conscious here um what we did in colorado was not simply um here's just pure uh opinion on this i've always been somebody who's been comfortable with and and you've advocated for the decrimination of uh what we did was we opened up a full commercial market too and as you know uh this country commercial markets very very very well so fundamentally what happened uh in colorado was the advent of a new um really a new substance and it's based substance but uh our market is not made up of the plant anymore plant plays a role in it but it's um products that are based on the plants so uh let me explain to you a little bit what happened here so colorado voted in 2012 in 2014 january 1 2014 we opened up retail so these data are um absolutely beautiful and unfortunately we have not seen a continuation and it doesn't look like we will see a continuation uh because of some some poor decisions made at the federal level um but beginning in 1960 and ending in 2011 uh university of mississippi uh tracked a record to the symbol of all of cannabis confiscated inside of america as you'll see you see this red line right here is thc chc is the psychoactive ingredient inside of cannabis if you don't have thc you have hip you have a very interesting textile favorite juice and um used to make a boat and probably have a lot of uses than that but no thc no high more ta18 high oversimplified but that's all we got time for this one so as you'll see uh beginning in 1960 and steadily rising until 2011 we got more thc bred into our marijuana and the reason why is that we have a guy around here and uh this is a country that supersizes its big mac and if one is good two's definitely gotta be better so um the thing that i'd like to point out to you before i switch slides especially to those of you who are more interested in the science of this uh is that if you go back to 1960 here we're going to follow this line into perfect uh backwards to perpetuity we're we're to look at this um into you know crawling out of the ocean or coming down from trees or walking out of the garden or whatever like um that line would have stayed the same because naturally occurs inside of cannabis is somewhere between a point two and point five percent the agency um that's what humankind has been interacting with for millennium uh and what we started was of course there were exceptions to that particularly in certain religious traditions ben i'm going to interrupt you um we're getting some complaints about the sound so it's just very hard to hear so i'm wondering if you could try um signing in from your phone like keep your audio on mute yourself and then and then if you can join from your phone would you mind trying that not at all a couple of people have made that suggestion so perhaps they've experienced this as well you can continue to share your screen and all that it's just that the audio i apologize folks hang in there and you know when we talked with ben when we were getting started he sounded perfectly crystal clear and the three of these that i do a day all worked out great until now of course are you able to get signed in ben yeah but i've joined it as an attendee i i wonder if this has gotten any better at all than if i can try to keep it sounds okay right now go ahead go ahead so um cam maybe katie could you send me another link so it's at the top of my uh inbox and or kim sorry and if we have to switch back over we will okay all right keep on going for now okay if you can see everybody good on the slide kim you see it you go okay so what happened then uh was the introduction of the commercial market and again the continuation of these data looks highly highly unlikely as does the continuation with that from colorado which is um very frustrating so what you see here if you go back uh we were looking at increments of 2.5 over the course of 50 years and it's here to increment a five uh just to get that in the blue lines colorado and unfortunately we probably won't see a continuation of that past 2016 because those of you who are a little more cyber-minded public policy-minded um there has been a very very poor job actual data collection uh i don't think there's a ton of interest in determining um what's what's really happening inside of the substance we paid you know what's happening in the sales of it but not in the actual growth of the substance so um if you'll look at the green line beginning in 1860 the um the bottom line to this and what i'd like to tell folks is i think that what we did in colorado taught you how to turn a plant into a drawer because there is the difference between a point two percent two percent ten percent tc and a thirty four fifty sixty seventy percent uh is profound and part of the problem is that uh very very little was known about what concentrations that high we're doing inside of the human brain and body and the science still fairly emergent but we do know what it's doing from a mental health standpoint and it's very very concerning um so if for no other reason um i i show you this to show you that what most people perceive this to be which is a market about a plant is fairly benign the planet used to be pretty benign um and the the roots of why we criminalized it at the beginning uh were insidious they were racist to their core however we're not talking about that plant anymore uh we're now talking about a pretty well developed substance uh that there's huge commercial interest in here's what happens when we go from uh good farming to good chemistry when it goes from the street uh with a couple of acres to monsanto and there is not an interest in the interest part um sustained foreign practices for um moderate products there's an interest in some more that they they have so let me shift really quickly here to share with you is dr kushner any other physician uh knows well that the diagnosing of a chin is is not something that can be done uh subjectively uh one must meet diagnostic criteria there are eleven um so here are the eleven i'm afraid i'm not gonna take time to unpack this but when i need you to understand is that addiction the field in which i work um is not diagnosed arbitrarily like any other medical condition you have to meet objective criteria and when it comes to understanding uh addiction to thc campus um we should be saying thc not canada as a whole to thc bsm which is the manual that the physicians and mental health professionals find all of their uh criteria in uh four years ago the dsm-5 came out actually uh listed cannabis withdrawal as a diagnosis for the first time ever so that's the physical withdrawal for tv which i think like 10 years ago if somebody was talking about withdrawal from cam cannabis um we probably meant that they were eating way way less yes and goldfish and yani's music sucked again um they weren't physically withdrawing from anything but this fact that in the last couple of years we now have changed the substance to lunch um a person is can be physically dependent on is a really big deal which it makes all set up and the the side of this is just weed it's just when it's tweed um that's why i would challenge you that it was it was just a plan and for a long long time that argument was true but it simply isn't because the plant that humankind interacted with from millennium has been replaced by something pretty significant so uh going back to considering the addiction the addictive potential of this here's some simple numbers for you uh when colorado opened up retail in 2014 we had fewer than 300 uh licensed campus facilities in the state as of the last year we don't have any data for 20 to me yet as of last year that number went to 2709. um so that's a pretty significant factor it's a a factor of about nine uh but it's grown in five years and so the the reality to this is that the only way that we can continue to support this amount of growth is we have a market throws with it and there are only two ways market uh this is econ one um there's only two ways to go to market it's one you capture new users or two you prefer current users more frequent users now the problem is with an addictive substance or a substance with potential addictive properties which cannabis simply is um objectively you can't argue that without um throwing the science out of it less addictive than some things more addictive than others um the reason why this matters so much is that the majority of the market ends up being made up by the problem user so what we've already seen with alcohol and tobacco sales uh in about 60 years worth of tracking these data is that uh roughly 20 of the consumer population will consume about 80 of commercial sales of those um the alcohol industry is not interested at all if in her occasional that's going with dick they do however love the guy who found mad dog 2020 when he was 12 years old um but unfortunately i beat the game i got so in colorado the last ad that we have from 2017 shows us that 84 percent of the thc in colorado uh is being consumed 15 of the consumers so when you unpack who those consumers are that's why it's important to understand the addictive work is the the va majority of this market is not made up of despite what the advertisements would we would love to tell them show the world the it's not made up of people who look like me going home to work trying to decide between a nice bottle of merlot or an edible um it is made up of the problem user and the problem user uh as the one who drives that market you have to understand who they are because they are my people i work inside of a chemical dependency and i'm someone who has some long-standing mental health issues i've worked with were through myself depressive disorder as well as ptsd those of us with um mental health conditions the minority population both sexual minority as well as ethnic minority um and the lower income communities in colorado are the ones who make up that 20 percent now here's where i will um tell you that there's maybe an opportunity for collaboration kim uh between uh the world of the organization and uh if you guys should move forward with us in pennsylvania what might happen um is i i know how interested you guys are in preserving the the minds of the kids estate i know you guys love kids what we have found in colorado is so does the cannabis industry because when you are are considering the three factors that put somebody into this group of people consuming 84 to build the problemed user i.e the better consumer there are three factors well there's four but we can't control anything to do with genetic predisposition um those three factors for age of onset frequency of use and thc potency so the earlier summer starts the more frequently they use and the stronger the substance is the more likely they are to be from my perspective a problem user from the industry's perspective a reliable customer and it is the same as it has always been with addictive substances it's the same with um same tobacco it's the same with alcohol and uh the reality here is that we know better and so that's why i encourage everybody to be uh to familiarize themselves with the symptoms of substance use disorder so that you can get more used to asking the questions around the ac dependence so let me just show you a couple things that have happened in colorado is to work to capture more users that's actually cookie monster on the side of the dispensary down here with a plate full of dope by the way now they're not selling an invitational kid who's gonna walk in there of course not but what this is is long-term hearts and minds campaigns and this been one of the hardest things to challenge here in colorado is this generation who has grown up with this is the norm uh with with uh the the smell and the sights and everything as the norm and then when they actually get uh and you know they've got 10 11 uh symptoms for cannabis use disorder they're still not a big deal we have facsimiles of things that are clearly used with pardon me young people you know here's the emoji store um on that's all cannabis related not to targeted towards adults there's actual back to school special uh in colorado um this was the open house guide for high schools and junior highs that we had last year that they gave all the kids in boulder county where i live and as you'll see the first open enrollment community the the first page had a half page color app bringing dispensary that was coming to town that was branded to look like a starbucks um here's a moving special cu boulder so specifically targeting um uh freshmen and talks just comes out of the battle though messages tell me to smoke weed every day don't forget daily there's really no in this and then messaging that the kids have grown up with is stay high and um it's changed the way that we have to interact with people in our hour here because this has always been the norm form um so just a very brief tour through here so so here are consumption trends because the majority of the market from a thousand cents standpoint it's made up of concentrates and then after that it's edibles and and this is why i say that it's not the plant anymore that we're talking about uh sales of or green organic material that's dried out that yeah rolling and joining smoke they're there they're a much much smaller part of the market so uh beginning in 2014 marijuana enforcement division has released an annual update and for the first three years of it uh we didn't even consider concentrates in there so if you're not familiar with concentrates hang on a second because i'm gonna do what the market looks like um in 2017 support the first time they actually report um sales on it so we did our market into three right we have our market our market black market completely under the table gray market one that is either grown legally and sold illegally or grown illegally and so deeply and then our white market where everything above taxes so inside of our white market which is the smaller um in 2017 we taxed the sale of just about 28 000 pounds of concentrate and um in 2018 that number moved to 40 000 pounds of concentrate now the reason why that matters if you can see the antioxidant over here to the right it's um it says the top line says more is not better cannabis concentrates are potent start by consuming a small dose about half the size it's a pin head or less so in a recommended dosage of half the size of a pen head selling 40 000 pounds is a really really big deal and this isn't from juice this is what the young people are initiating on um multiple times a day this is how we've had to change the way that we um discuss recovery from abstinence to cannabis because to the younger generation cannabis is concentrate um and concentrates are up to 99.9 percent hd so the reason that lancet study i mentioned at the beginning the effects of high potency um cannabis psychosis is so important is it has given us uh um kind of a long-term glimpse of the cohort um using 16 thc and know what that's doing to their mental health and it's um uh not good uh the psychosis is associated with and the mental health issues are a big deal the reason why it's so important is we have very very limited information above 16 potency because this is all happening real quickly and if you consider that and then thrown around here um his 99 thc um be the uh humankind knows very very little about this substance except for we don't make it we know how to sell it we know how to market it we don't know a lot more about it um it's gone very quickly this is like sensors all the time not to consume i'm sober but to research um and these are this is called distillate these distillates are absolutely everywhere it's some you get um you get basically people purchased a lot of different places that's because this is something we're trying to move people forward so we're gonna skip our videos um i am going to show you some specific pictures of this commercial market and as i do i want you any of you i'm 41 years old maybe for me your mid-20s consider the maybe maybe what it is that we know and are going to attempt to regulate is an old model t maybe get going 30 miles an hour down when in reality um what we need to be considering and regulating and thinking about is you know the body that's ripping around at 140 miles an hour because when i was young if you could see this um can you see my cursor kim where i'm kind of highlighting it here was that okay so this that was weak that um bud this um grown uh thc leaf leafs trimmed off but today uh this is almost a forgotten market because the market looks more like butter and wax and shatter today the commercial market is growing so quickly to support the needs of those of of that small of people who are making the majority of the market that this is what we looks like today um here's something that we would probably call uh uh honey or honey well this will be in the 60 ish here's something called a live resin um this is 60 percent shares are what pushed the upper limits getting 90 this is percent live resin this is not fringe use this sort of thing is the majority of the market in colorado the market doesn't look like a plant the market looks like the glues so this is the distillate that i had mentioned before the 99 um and this is really what we see everywhere and where i challenge folks when they just plant it's just plentiful listen concentrates are to weed what crack is to the cocoa plant and it's it's simple uh this is not a plant this is a refined product from the plant here's what it looked like if you're going to the amount of scientific activity that has to go from a green organic material to this clear liquid this is the 99 and this is what's in every dispensary on every counter in colorado um the distillates are the beginning of our market uh here's a syringe infused here's a chapter honey oil i'm just wanting to give you an idea of what this actually looks like yet the um the narrative remains this that uh it's natural i just love this ad because i think it's a little bit more honest fueled by or powered by science fueled by nature based in something natural but really pretty scientifically advanced business and um no matter how hard you try uh and this is going to be a significant part of the market and i don't care where you live in the country this exists there uh and this is what a lot of the young people are are using and thinking about so just through a couple of definitions in from last year's best of guide uh two years ago as best of guide um shatter and and backs and uh live resin and sauce that's because i'm more than happy to share this presentation with anybody who wants it um but uh oh good here here you go here's the definition of a distillate i did let's create one of the pure canvas products on the market to spin cannabinoids down to molecular levels uh into delivering high tac content this is across this hospital that's certain cannabinoids api's generating different types of highs um so what we actually are doing is separating t to the sub molecular i split the building high in thc pull the disc bullet out it's very very advanced tough and we've got good at it here and these this is everywhere um first one's free [Laughter] uh this is just industry in america doing with industry in america that's not working or different than um the other ones they are just big business so vaping and quite a bit of information about this kim so uh go to the website learn more about picking the only thing i wanted to tell you about that is there's no smoke no smell no mess um so the majority of uh the pain that takes place is taking place because you can do it with impunity you don't smell anything um here there's a good ad amazing fun flavors no canvas smell and what people are vaping now that you know a tiny tiny little bit about kind of just concentrates i usually take it take about two hours to really teach about um but now you know a little bit you can look in here and see that that's clearly a concentrate oil so most of what's being vaped almost all of what's been invaded um is could be some form of concept and then our market supports these kind of incognito products uh the functional pan and the heat or that it's the 700 degrees that's great for the off um lighters and asthma inhalers and then just for fun there's your classic bubble gum clear that every intervention jumps up down about so edibles um the big issue with edibles is that we have not um we've not managed to shut down the putting multiple servings inside of one patch uh and and so what colorado decided on um the 10 milligrams would make up um a a legally appropriate serving of of edible the issue is we didn't really have anything to base that on um everybody has since based it on what we've done for some people in milligrams they don't even feel um for other people 10 milligrams is going to be enough to come on back for a day and a half well a day you just don't know there's so many factors involved in it but the problem is that the what colorado has done is um and what everybody who's on since this time because they keep asking of course politicians like we're awesome at this we're the best colorado is fantastic everything we do um everybody's based what they've done on on us um these ten milligrams are an issue because multiple servants inside of one package so before i show you that let me uh here's a challenge to you pennsylvania um anything that can be introduced into the human body it's being commercially produced in colorado with the hsp and in all the legal states because it's big corporations that are set up in all those states now so any way we can produce a human body is taking place with thc check this out here's a great example of that this is um a gummy in this size it's really little and it has a hundred milligrams so colorado law this has 10 legal servings inside of it so this package with a warning on it that says um power law separate each one into tenths so one nobody's doing this and then two the the problem is we continue to do it by weight even though we're not really considering potency with it because the difference between 10 milligrams of um organic material of bud and leads and stem seeds stuff like that and 10 milligrams of a distillate is profound and it's again we need new vernacular because it's not even the same thing um to consider the the plant in a distillate yet we haven't kept up with it so what were the problem is that people will ingest more than intended obviously uh because there's 10 servings inside of something you know the size of half your finger uh and it's conservative some really really potent stuff and once it's ingested this is where problems come from and this is uh nothing will solve it in the short term uh activated charcoal induced vomiting that will do what you've got to do and i i teach quite a bit on this and there are much better minds than mine that have written on it you can uh uh hide it intervening easily but you could short-term anti-psychotics for what we do and we just sort of keep the verse cool um and a lot of the times that means keeping cool inside of um a hospital environment because we don't want somebody having um a psychotic episode and going after hurting skulls or others because it processes very very differently the fact that this ends up going through your stomach and your liver and you can't stop it is very different than entering your blood or your lungs so here's another great example this is a thousand milligram graham cracker so this thing's the the size of a cracker and it has a hundred people servings in it i just uh found this advertisement this week um up to a thousand milligrams in cake pops and sodas and gummy bears and chocolates this is not a market focused on responsible adult use in the exact same way that the tobacco market isn't focused on responsible adult use and the opiate market wouldn't have done what it did if the the sacklers and all those other people didn't figure out amazing ways to market that substance to everyone this specifically look at it and targeted to people who will have issues with it just like every other addictive substance and for us to think that it's different that this one time we're going to do it magically different we're still thinking so here's some condiments barbecue sauce and ketchup and coffee and k-cup pop these are all phc infused products here's the thc infused lemonade and diffused hard candy granola bars wheat ice cream um cans uh nasal mist so you can just spray it and nobody will know anything there's no smell this is a really interesting new thing that's started in the last three years this is an intoxicating topical cream it's not the cbd that can you ever serve your medicine cabinet this is a thc based intoxicating um topical so you put it on it enter it goes to the layers and energy blood stream gti here's the dhc pill here thc lollipops particularly this one's at seven legal servings per lollipop and uh weed tea hc um gummy ac looks we have these things that are built to look like um other classic candies obviously this isn't a joke i think a lot of the times people write things that aren't true this this is real this is a pot box um if you see down here this is a pot box that can have up to 10 servings per so like pop rocks you know um sweet tarts and dc induced alcohol it's infused soda to me this is the scariest ones because these have between 80 and 120 milligrams of sugar in them and they clearly clearly are not made to appeal to the adult and these are very popular um keith cola tonight into youtube you see that they have 350 milligrams of 35 liters on the back of this container it says um for 135th which is gap and really i want you to watch this on youtube tonight because the young people and they're young people um aren't 35th if you keep up with culture at all there's thc syrup juices there you go there is a thc infused water to me this is kind of like the top of what we have accomplished um anyone anywhere anytime can be drinking tea i'm not all gonna be the wiser the new school resource officers um anything you pull somebody over they could pop in some thc gum just to get a good laugh out of it chai and mints and blah blah blah blah blah but i have time to go into all of these caffeine and dhc underarm applicators so thc deodorant spray sex lube suppositories um all of these remember that we have no fda oversight whatsoever because it's a schedule uncontrolled substance right wrong whatever it's the reality it's a schedule one controlled substance so fda and the decades of consumer protection laws fda do not apply so i'd like to read this to you this product this is the bag of the candy bar that i bought uh this product contains marijuana in its potential and allowable plus or minus 15 variants this product was produced without regulatory oversight for health safety or efficacy you're not gonna have the feds to help now with this uh you're gonna have to figure out how to keep this regulated well so listen the mental health consequences again much much better minds than i that have written on and thought of this so um i'll give you a couple of resources at the end but the bottom line is that um it used to be very benign and what we would see uh the case you would find in the literature um i i wrote a book on that i've written extensively this is my world um the cases that you would find in the literature where there were um psychosis associated with canada's use were great and they were people who had um probably some pretty significant condition prior to like that fire was burning already and that just got a little bit louder um what you think here is is there's actually some um good indications that some of these significant mental health issues um is purely causal it's not correlation that's causal all the citations are at the end if anybody's asking questions about that but um what we see with regular use of a 12 percent thc regular use being twice a week we see a two-fold increase risk exposed and you see a two half an increased risk in the diagnosis of schizophrenia um if you use before 18. see some very very alarming trends we see things like listen if i were to show you these numbers if i were to cut all of these numbers in half and and show that anybody uh at fda or one of these big governing government agencies and say hey you know we found this to be true in a chemical inside of water bottles tomorrow there will be a cold ban on all those water bottles until we got to the bottom of this because right now there's so many big um so many indicators that are scary from a scientific standpoint that we would love to have time to fully understand this however um that doesn't work with the inner employee which is well you did great last quarter what are you going to show me this order how much can i earn in 2020 versus 2019 that's why we've got this big bush and this money behind so there were quite a few questions about impairment in germany that so for law enforcement there um the biggest issues that we've gotten i know you're trained specifically in this i provide postcards i'd love to do this uh explain this to law enforcement compare motor coordination slowly increase singular focus um make it uh a challenge for people to drive the problem is that we have no 0.08 we do not have um a way to determine intoxication roadside other than what would call a tre drill recognition expert which is a long official specifically trained to recognize this occasion so the method of ingestion also makes uh testing very very very in and probably the world's thought leader a brilliant um uh woman by the name of maryland uh has told me that in all likelihood i will not see um a solid way to test intoxication uh in my lifetime because it's so complicated so colorado settled on uh five nanograms per milliliter in your blood as intoxicated however we have multiple examples of people with 15 milligrams stone colds over and an example actually right down the street from my old ass of a young man who was um two uh nanograms per milliliter who controlled a six-year-old crossing the street and drug her forever who was stoned out of his board and he was half of the legal limit so we have not figured out how to do a job of um actually testing this and we're quite a way a ways away from it so here are a few resources for you if you're interested in the politics of it there's sam the national institute for drug abuse is not um sansa smart colorado's group parents who attempt to track data and i would say that there are lots of other and use a critical eye with all of them because the politics of this are insane and what i will kind of leave you with is just because something has been politicized doesn't make application my opinion here is that this is a public health conversation and it's been it's been made into the political realm uh but it's really this is a conversation that should should be um taking place with more public health eye and if you're interested in a not so great book um but one that's maybe i think it's important it's not really well written um i wrote a book on this and it's a simon schuster brand so here are your things and i'm going to stop sharing an attempt to answer some questions take a breath and i really want to thank our attendees for hanging in we we really apologized for the audio i know it was consistently choppy ben i'm sorry to tell you um but but thank you all for hanging in there with us we do have a couple of questions that i want to get to quickly um and by the way dr arkoush has to jump off right about now so um thank you val i think you're still here with us right now but thank you so much for being here um we really appreciate it thanks kim and thanks ben really really interesting and eye-opening so appreciate your time and all your efforts take care everybody thank you doctor thanks so much all right so ben can you have decriminalization without legal first let me stop and say it is 9 30. if you have to leave us um i'm going to go ahead and put that link uh to the follow-up page in the chat boxer judy can you do that for me actually if you can put the chat to everyone um find the link send the the hyperlink out to everybody um for the lead page conversation dot zone i'll do that thank you uh so bad can you have decriminalization without legalization for recreational use yeah vermont did it dc did it um yeah for sure great uh can you remember well hang on before you do the next one let me just say that a lot of states have a de facto decriminalization colorado um possession of up to two ounces was uh a hundred dollar citable offense if anybody did it so yes you can absolutely have decrement without commercialization great great okay um can you repeat the name of the cannabis and psychosis study and and actually maybe what i we can say too is somebody else asked if we can share your powerpoint on that follow-up page and i know that your answer is going to be yes because you always say yes um so we can make sure but do you know the study that she's that they're referring to yes um the biggest and most interesting is called the effects of high potency cannabis on psychosis originally published in the lancet journal february 2015 volume two number three and it has been since updated annually got it you are crystal clear now i think it was the sharing for some reason yes okay um ben is the relationship to these mental health risks casual or causal it's both um it's it's both uh well one you'll never fully be able to isolate if it's um causation or correlation uh for all of them but there are several of them that we have absolutely isolated as causal um and the correlation is um something that's being worked out on on both of them um think about it this way what we have determined uh to be true in our world as a person uh this this tends to make these issues much louder um if they don't cause them it makes them louder but we have seen um in in the biggest study that was looked at in the last couple of years a quarter of all of the psychosis isolated was isolated as causal all right thank you someone has asked what they can do to affect the decision regarding legalization in the state of pennsylvania don't know talk to somebody who knows more about politics than me contacting elections obviously right okay um can you explain the dui requirements for marijuana i've heard that if any amount is in your system regardless of being from weeks ago you can still get a dui and i know we have some law enforcement folks on if anyone wants to reply to that not not in colorado so you actually have to um it was a uh five nanograms per milliliter was what we decided on in colorado but that's been so successfully fought in court so many times that now you got to be really impaired and realistically people just aren't um charging for that if there's anything else law enforcement can charge with they're they're doing that because um it's so hard to get a conviction for this um so no we we don't have a sound 0.08 okay great um pennsylvania is looking to allow legal thc to bring in tax money to help with loss of money due to covid what i've read in states that that uh the state of colorado is not making money off of thc less than one percent of the state income is from thc but they spend more money on police regulations and other expenses your thoughts please well um less than half of a percent actually and i i've written fairly extensively about this you cannot tax a vice substance you cannot tax any vice substance to a level that you will pay for the um societal costs associated with it we can't do it with booze we can't do it with tobacco with alcohol for every dollar we tax nationally we lose about nine with tobacco for every dollar we tax we lose about 11. you can't do it so this is this is where the politics of this get incredibly frustrating to me because it's people like well let's make money let's make money um you're stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime and it's not about making money in fact our governor uh governor hickenlooper former governor said multiple times no state ever should do this for the money because there's not actually money in it yes you will see more money coming into the coffers but it's going to cost you so much more to get this done and the percentages are tiny i mean we have a furlough on um teacher raises i'm sorry moratorium on teacher raises we are um cutting services inside of our law enforcement inside of our fire departments uh inside of social services all over denver because our budget shortfalls are so significant uh and here where the state grows and all of this huge weed money no that's just that's that's hype and the politics of that are very frustrating to me when people tell you that challenge them to justify it question what does dre stand for regarding the test a drug recognition expert so that's a member of law enforcement who's been specifically trained to recognize forms of intoxication of particular substances um are there efforts to make ads targeting children illegal as they did in the 90s um this writer is old enough to remember the joe camel commercials being a cartoon and i remember that as well um any efforts to curb that well sure yeah but every one of them is met with a uh freedom of speech argument and uh there's also okay so so here's the thing there's a lot of what i can show you i could show you illegal after illegal tactic like the the selling after 10 pm for example or drive-throughs or things like this however there is simply no bandwidth to police this it's not like we've got this task force of folks who are going around in policing these 2 700 uh facilities like we we've got a handful of people inside of the marijuana enforcement division taxed with doing this so there's a pretty big difference between saying you're not allowed to do that and actually stopping somebody from doing it like for example we can't have billboards in colorado i could show you a picture of two dozen billboards uh we can't have it on the sides of cars and buses like they do in vegas if you've been there um same thing i could show you dozens of pictures of buses uh and cars with advertising on them um there's this idea that um there's always been this idea that there's this um omnipresent they out there somewhere that's going to enforce it and um right now in colorado what they're getting done doing is uh going after the high level distributors and the um organized crime that's behind this certainly not the folks who are advertising using cartoon characters that's going to take a lot a lot a lot of torque in the same way it did with tobacco what is the colorado legislature done with this information of anything in other words commissioned studies etc also is there any industrial hemp being grown not for cbd in colorado uh last question first totally tons of industrial have been grown not for cbd um interesting stuff most of it takes place on our eastern plains um not where i am which again i'm all for i recognize the difficulty of that for law enforcement and a lot of my friends in this world get pissed when i say that um but the only issue is that it um it's really it looks like a it looks like a cousin that makes trouble for law enforcement so the fact that it looks so much like weed is an issue um as far as what the colorado legislature has done we we're continually trying to to chase the car on this and the problem is that the industry is better funded and a hundred times smarter on what these these products are so they can you know make in effect subtle little changes inside of the law that any person uh you know sitting in in the chamber in the legislature might say oh that's a nice idea um and they don't really understand the practical on the ground application to it so the issue that we have here is we have allowed them to get so far ahead of us both with money and with knowledge that we're having a heck of a hard time um actually regulating these things right and then the other thing that happens is you have somebody like um our don't don't worry if you if you wait for me to um if you get angry at a political statement i make don't worry because i'll make one about the other side any moment you have people like our senator cory gardner who at the beginning of this thing was this is terrible this is a bad idea no no no no no and after about 220 thousand dollars in donations from the cannabis industry in colorado he's like wheat is awesome colorado's doing great we know exactly what we're doing here so that's the nature a lot of the times of politics as well is where the money flows um the votes go of course not to you politicians on the call you guys are well well above that i'm sure uh and we are grateful that they're with us um is there any age requirement to purchase thc products 21. and you can purchase them online isn't that correct yeah not really you can order them online and then go up and pick them pick them up um but what we've done colorado talk or california taught the world how to do this we now have um delivery options which are pretty profound so if you want to see how that works um download an app called weed maps and um look at how the delivery works because that's pretty incredible so yeah you can order them online but you still got to go to the store and pick them up got it okay um but there are other you can order paraphernalia you can order vaping products i know for sure um which a lot of times are hijacked and used to put in the thc oil but not the cannabis product you're saying um are lawful are lawsuits starting to be filed against the industry for damages or injuries from marijuana use yes um there have been several wrongful deaths um there have been um property value losses um employment issues yeah for sure uh you know there's an old adage uh that sometimes you have to let the wolf kill the fox and um the wolf in this case i think would be um trial lawyers and lawsuits it's the way we got through to the tobacco attorney um the the fox here is the industry behind it so ultimately yes ultimately we have to end up squaring up with this in the same way that we did with tobacco but we're not going to get there any other way than lawsuits i don't think which is i guess the american way right yep um so we had one we had several advanced questions many of them you've covered um i you may have touched on this i apologize if i missed it how much thc is sold black market compared to shops that are taxed in colorado i'm afraid to ask an impossible question to answer because the nature of it is that it's it's black market and it's underground um so we we don't know that but we know that the black market in colorado is considerably larger larger than it was pre-legalization um pbs did a great study on it and npr did a great piece on it lots of people have done pieces on it it's easy to find um we don't know i think that uh i could make a guess on that but um i'm not going to do it in a public format right here's a really great question exactly how has the legalization affected youth use despite the age restriction in colorado recently a student tried to argue that if it were legal it would decrease the rebellion of youth use that seems like a um cute idealistic thing that a child would say i have three of them myself i could hear that argument coming from them uh and in reality the lower the perception of risk the higher the youth use i mean we have almost 100 years worth of um survey data that shows us that that uh that sounds that actually sounds like a kid that kind of wants to get high um the the issue always is the the less perceived harm the more they use and when you have dispensaries on every corner and when you have advertisements that you see everywhere i mean like the last broncos game i went through and went through with the kids and there literally was a plane flying over the stadium with uh uh weed advertisements behind it like yeah good luck convincing kids that it's um not a good idea then um you're no the youth use in colorado has uh is considerably higher than the rest of the country the youth use in colorado has gone up considerably since we legalized the last thing uh the the place i would direct you to would be the last monitoring the future survey um kim you're giving me some great ones but they're all kind of softballs isn't there anybody who's frustrated or has some like uh let's see they're challenged yes rebecca it's monitoring the future so right okay so can you provide a source for the increase in youth use you just mentioned monitoring the future but i'm wondering too um you know we've heard about studies that show that in states where it's legalized some studies are saying that youth use has gone down and other studies say that youth use has increased can you speak to that um yeah there's a pretty big difference between a study and a survey and between the okay so for example um one always has to look to the real science of this that's why i like to give them all a minute there was some um there was some talk at the beginning that the numbers had gone down in colorado uh the great david that's a wonderful resource to hide one um in reality the survey that they did in colorado that they showed fairly stagnant numbers of youth use had excluded all of metro denver as well as all of boulder um whereas the ones before hadn't done that so the parts of the um state with high obviously the highest use rates um so uh one of the things that we don't do a great job of in this country is reading the fine print you know we see ahead and we're like oh fantastic actually take a look at the methodology behind that is probably a good idea great um i just shared that hide a report with um all of the attendees so that's in the chat box could this become the new or will this become the new form of medication-assisted treatment um well no because matt's got science behind it uh and that is something that's actually prescribed by physicians we're saying matt we're talking about uh buprenorphine and vivitrol and things like this this is a a non-prescribed only recommended substance that we know very very little about now maybe to the core of your question is uh or at least from my perspective the core of it is are people substituting um the answer to that is yes for sure you've got a lot of folks who are um stepping down to thc if you will for those of us who work inside of chemical dependency though um we don't like seeing people transfer because it's not about the specific substance it's about the feeling and the escape and the dopamine and the etc um if you quit a drug and just start another one um a lot of times you miss the core right and i think too you know we one of our presenters uh in july was uh joe garberly who's the medical director at karen treatment center and he he was sharing with us that he does an entire presentation about how the fact that that marijuana use as a harm reduction for cannabis use sorry for opioid use disorder is is absolutely not effective in fact increases um opioid use in his in the studies that he's viewed so um it's it's very true and for those of you in the northeast in the mid-atlantic who've been hit harder than the rest of us with the opiate crisis um you gotta under like we we have macro level data that is valid and intense and um you actually uh at the individual level you actually prime opiate receptors towards misuse okay so um the more thc you invest the more you're sort of priming your opiate levels to do something wrong and when you when you look at it on a macro level like when you look at societal level data the more thc is used the higher the the abuse of opiates is so this isn't something and this is what's just triggered me out so much as everybody's doubling down on this like okay the opiates are getting worse that means we have to decriminalize legalize let these things out there that um whereas it really should be the other case um kim i saw a question pop up and i didn't read the whole thing but it was from a dare officer and if i could answer any questions for a law enforcement i'd love to do that yep it's uh where did it go i'm looking in my feed uh is dare still being taught in schools in colorado is le trying to use trying to still educate students the dangers of thcs law enforcement so educating students about the danger of thc use nope uh in boulder county dare hasn't been taught for two years and we actually three years and last year this was awesome i actually asked my daughter to um record her drug education classes because they've got their ipads and their everything and um we don't deliver an abstinence message for kids in my county anymore i can't speak to the specifics of others i go to a lot of different counties and do it but there is no um you shouldn't do drugs message in my county anymore which is uh because kids shouldn't do drugs period anything that's not uh anything that's going to alter that brain chemistry that's not a well understood medication prescribed and supervised by a physician should not be going into a pre-myelinated frontal lobe ben smoking is linked to the increase of relapse would you agree that this is the same with marijuana use yes okay issues that someone uh who knows you is running into in somerset county is the idea of you thinking marijuana is not dangerous it's a medicine you know and lots of times parents aren't educated in fact oftentimes parents are consumers and that's my ad add-in do you have the same attitudes in colorado making prevention work difficult as there are so many surveys in instead of science published and gaining attention yeah totally um totally and i i mean frankly listen i'm not trying to sell it because i think i make a dollar every time somebody buys one but that's a part of why i wrote the book is i've got some specific stuff in there on it um but yes we absolutely have to change the way that we discuss and engage with young people uh because they've gotten a different message right we're going to try to get through there we have some more in the q and a box here how has legalization impacted the use of other substances uh colorado has never recorded higher numbers than the last five years uh look at our overdose numbers look at our amphetamines but uh so this is one that causation or correlation nobody can answer that uh you know from an addiction standpoint poly substance abuse is a really really big thing but then again i've got pretty tremendous sample group bias working inside of a treatment facility it's been good for our business right can you discuss horizontal and vertical integration and if pennsylvania were to legalize which would you think would be best for pennsylvania given the current state of the industry within the commonwealth of pennsylvania so i don't know anything about the state of the industry inside of the commonwealth but um i'm not a big fan of seeing vertical integration horizontal on the other hand listen i like small tiny not well funded corporations behind these things and the more vertically or even horizontally integrated you get the more money you stockpile so like i'd mentioned before i would much prefer to see an environment that was purely mom-and-pop and purely inside of the communities in which they live if the people who owned the dispensaries in my communities lived here i think they would look and smell very differently so um i would be a fan of doing anything that you could to wake up something really just went you have another device on okay try that again try talking again sorry it just got really you're okay now yeah that was weird sorry okay i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you no not at all i was done i was just rambling okay you got really quiet now i wonder what's going on with your audio okay um all right here's a question is there an opportunity for pennsylvania implementation to have better outcomes because of first implementing medical marijuana and the use of the medical model as the starting point for recreational use or recreational model of course and and i mean colorado had medical first of course there is but the and what i wrote in my book uh is that if you're going to have a better outcome you have to build the infrastructure prior to this ex post facto law um cannot work so the the the fact that i i would guess that most people don't even understand what's inside of all of the legislation that will be voted on is a big issue like to do this right i i was over in new zealand last year um with with their uh um mps and their their lawmakers and things considering how they could do this well and responsibly and intelligently and it could be done but but you're sure not going to do it with the legislation that you got now because i've read it and it shouldn't be written by lobbyists in the industry there that's about as much politics as i like getting into okay got it are we able to prosecute for illegal use such as parents who allow children to use child and family services um didn't respond in regard to a 15 year old using yes of course you are you you can but um again it's a matter of bandwidth sure right um so i know that you have to be on another meeting at 10 o'clock so um and i know we still have some other questions so i'm going to ask folks to please join us on october 15th um submit any other questions you have that you would like ben to answer to me on the email that is on actually judy if you want to put my email in the chat box again that would be great um and uh and also the follow-up page you know we have a lot we're going to be we're going to and visit that frequently we're going to continue to build it we'll continue to add information um about other questions that come in so that we can share that with everyone and um and also please visit the section called who knew and our on our website we have a lot of data a lot of research that's gone into understanding this especially the impact on kids which what is what today's program is really and truly all about um so we really encourage you to visit that as well and i cannot thank you enough and and i apologize again to everyone for the confusion with the sound and technology you know we're trying um you're such a friend thank you so much for joining us again as always take your stomach", "PN4Aju8QUvM": "hello I'm Greg from lofty pursuits and I made hard candy and we're gonna test it out so let's start with some orange slices because we're talking about orange I think I mentioned I used to ship yo-yos these bags of candy are exactly the same size of the standard yo-yo package because I'd already got my shipping department optimized for you know you think you're supposed to be easy to open I guess so but I'm kinda having trouble getting just kind of it's all in the fingernails yeah yeah you know I trimmed them before I came here so I look good on video and just try to get a slice cuz you're gonna end up with a lot of candy so these are our em slices and an old iron slice roller that I dug up oh sorry you can take the whole bag yeah and I love the way it puts lines it was one of those rollers that were Kippy users anything you could use it for orange slices watermelon slices it was sort of generic they try to do as much with as little as they add and you can see the good citrus flavor you're tasting and this is actually gonna be lighter because I didn't put much acid in it because I wanted to keep it clear and we did this for a video which was about things that rhyme with orange because Tom Lehrer came up with an orange roller rhyme and I've been told endlessly by everybody on our YouTube channel that so did M&M which I find ironic because there was an M&M commercial saying nothing rhymes with orange you work that out okay so you started with citrus what do you think so this is a secret flavor that we got passed down from Elaine's candy store when we got the recipes or we've got the equipment that gave us the recipe for their nectar so if you hold it out you probably have to get groups there's one of those packs we talked about okay I need two or three of them here you go we see shell motif which isn't a roller from the malanez candy company want to get the the tradition the neat little shapes and it's one roller that makes all the shapes and what I love about some of these old rollers is how traditional they are because now you go to something like that video game candy crush saga and I literally have every shape from the video game in a roller from the 1800s which shows they did their research I've seen the candy crush saga but I don't know what it is really it's a little it's a little cell phone game it's addictive and silly and it's like anything else it's a derivative from a game that was called bejeweled which was one of the early games for our Palm Pilot and I'm delving into the history of video games instead of candy mm-hmm folks don't do this at home so what do you think about the nectar it's an interesting flavor the more you sucked on it it's kind of changes it's very good it's hard to place as a flavor yeah those are tasty okay then we're gonna go just to go around the block we're gonna go to these American flag candies that I made these are the ones that Craig was talking about and but because of the colors I would expect to be popular you know I thought it was more a decision of what is the flavor of an American flag and I felt they had a choice between canvas which I thought limited Marcus this is that a pretty pot that's these it's I did strawberry blueberry shortcake because that's you know yes exactly so I thought that was interesting yeah yeah I taste this is gonna go slower than yes something like the like wines oh yeah another one ray look blueberry strawberry shortcake if I did it right which I thought was good yeah oh yeah so you get a lot of flavor control you play around sorry there's a napkin over there I won't be insulted we're gonna be doing scandi spit take focus by the way I'd like to apologize here I left my hat in the car I don't know if you recognize me I'm Greg from lofty pursuits without the Hat you know who knows who I am you know what I'm going to give you a gift while we're getting stuff out I brought this stuff I know it's a little silly we serve breakfast also so I thought I'd get you a little lofty pursuits mug another thing we have to get these mugs yeah I'll talk to me about that later I'll give you my mud contact I feel like I'm the rolodex okay so let's try and did you try the flag candy mmm-hmm what's the word it should give you a good fruity taste did you bring me back taste yeah yeah so you should get that whipped cream feeling and maybe the cake feeling with a little almond in there yeah yeah and you should be able to get if I did if I balance it right should be able to get a clear strawberry and a clear blueberry depending on what you're doing okay you know it's like you think it was a joke with the with the everlasting gobstoppers and the original Willy Wonka no you can do this stuff with flavors you know this is why hard candies are hard because it's the flavor that counts and over soft candy is a lot of people say I don't like hard candies well when you're making a roll that has to retail for $0.50 and then wholesale at 25 cents and then be go to a distributor at 20 cents there's not much room for ingredients but if you can use the best ingredients in the world you can make absolutely amazing candy so tell me when you're ready for the next one rowdy you're ready okay so this is our peach candy and if I did it right you should get a little fuzz I don't mean that as a joke you got a whole bunch of them look at the artwork on it because that's an image candy and you can see the little peach chief Jen give me a spare one I'll pass along I don't need my readers very detailed and that's uh you hold it up to the light it'll even glow a little bit if you'd if I did it right oh I didn't get that one Jessica did she's getting really good peaches one of the harder ones but you can see how we are getting the flavors to contrast and a lot of that is with the balancing of the various ingredients great did you see I'm saying they'll loosen the peach fuzz gives you a soft back to the flavor is somebody's art you're right about that but it's out of a lot right people go I didn't want to buy it because I don't want to eat it God what am i madness score make one of the things I like about this art is a large early on that artists transitory in 1976 so I would have been eight years old my mother took me we lived in New York City my mother took me to the first big retrospective eff Alexandra called it who was a modern artist he did Mobile's he did stables but he made a lot of toys he made a circus that he played with and some of the objects were meant to be interacted with they were figures a Josephine Baker that were steel that were hung for the ceiling on Springs supposed to grab the hands and dance with them and they dated back to his his time in France and I think the 50s and there was a bunch of ceramic balls of different sizes that had a sponge ball hanging from the ceiling and would bounce around and chime and while I was there waiting to go play with the sponge ball thing that I never got to play with the word came down that Alexander had called her had died in the museum right while I was standing there now you know this was 76 so I was eight and that was a major it was like first thing I realized that an artist can be a toy maker and the second thing I realized is this is gonna be no more of this and I wanted a very long young age about the transitory nature of our art and I think that's one of the reasons I like the candy so much because the art is destroyed as you do it but you have to enjoy it in the moment you can't save it forever but you can also pass it on yeah you can but it has a finite time time you're teaching ethica oh yeah no no I'm teaching the skills the art itself isn't passed on it'll be her art and she's not the only one who'd gone through about 10 or 12 people he's done this over the years you know now the next one we're gonna do is apple the Apple should be a little bit harder I haven't tried this batch so I don't know if it was done right but it usually is it's got some good artists one a little flat it was made a little too hot they won't do it but you should get a real crisp flavor out of this one with your contrast with that peach which is a softer flavor and this is the interaction game that I'm playing with with the different things if you look at the artwork they're actually pretty similar mmm but they're not exactly similar you know one is a little dimple in it but one of the nice things about most fruits is they're round with bumps I like that this part Kenya gets it's not super hard that you want to bite into it like it's hot well that's because we pulled it so much we're actually pulling it a huge amount more than most people do and that does two things one it increases the flavor more surface area because while the bubbles makes the flavor dissolve faster so you get a more immediate shot of flavor and since we're cutting it it's not a drop it has all that exposed area in the middle actually if you suck on it the white will dissolve much faster than the other stuff so with things like the citrus it could really feel like a real piece of citrus with pith in it as the bits of the middle don't do it and or don't dissolve as fast and and because of that it'll connect the dots when you Biden it but I don't recommend anyone bites and hard candy please don't sue me if you chip your I am now officially telling you don't do it but you know it also means they're eating the candy too fast and I mean don't have as much time to enjoy so uh let's see what are we gonna do next I think I want to contrast this with banana I don't think I can get you to do any of them all by the way I bought you about a bag of madness this is our candy demonstration of the Stroop effect in other words they're all the same color but I can't tell you what flavors they are oh so because you taste with your eyes before you taste with your mouth and the mole object is to confuse you I try to keep the current list on the website but it changes faster they change them they go we change this what does this taste like and I go oh God yeah you try to do durian let's not put that in and we don't I'm still the boss okay you've had durian durian is delicious it's not what it tastes like it's what it smells like it smells like feet okay it tastes like it tastes like jackfruit which also smells like I've only had jackfruit as um barbecued uh you probably can't up here I have a friend who grows it in South Florida and brings it up once a year so I guess we do it up here Oh God yeah yeah it's like forty pound this much you can even a little top of it you get like a half pound of jackfruit a huge but most of its not edible yeah is it can you just cook it with barbecue sauce like in the slow cooker and pull up so it's like pulled pork that's interesting my a my friend my friend's father it makes jackfruit jerky every year but I've never enjoyed it he the jackfruit a few other things with us they also have he bought this farm that used to be an exotic fruit farm to put his bonsai plantation on it he grows trees this big and he doesn't need much room for that so you left the other trees going and he's a cat he has like a half acre Karen bolas you know I'm talking about star fruit and I've had star fruit but I've never had star fruit that ripened on the vine you know my friend John would go down there get two giant paper bags full drive it up when we eat it the next day oh my god it's the best thing I've ever tasted but the stuff you get in the supermarket is yeah I used to buy it occasionally just because I mean what are the other ones there's uh there's a wonderful they're wonderful varieties of bananas I can get in Florida that I've never seen anywhere else ice cream bananas but trying to get some seedlings because those will grow in my climate ah you can't peel it because it'll just mush you cut in half and eat it with a spoon is the consistency of ice cream Apple bananas which are just wonderful and my favorite is called the gold finger which is a red banana that is about this long the wonderful banana but unlike our commercial bananas it's only ripe a week a year so we're gonna give you some banana candy and this should come out softer and banana it's not as high in potassium I'm sorry that's good tell you you must like bananas a bunch to eat that many folks consumption that's bananas have ribs Oh God that scares me and feelings I thought I'd end this thing we have another one a drop I can go for that but I thought we'd do a citrus which is what we're doing tomorrow and I thought I'd do a different citrus we do this in wine tastings to folks we spit out well I'm trying to balance all these things out to give you a variety I got these specifically for it would you like to try a grapefruit lemon or lime you tried another orange before and I don't want you to do that until tomorrow wanna save the rest of this bags grapefruit absolutely I mean it certainly looks like gravy fruit a line okay hey I'll give you another country he their smell looks like you just kind of grapefruit and this is the pattern we're gonna do for our a so I'm gonna teach you to okay that's great yeah I love grapefruit but then again I got a grapefruit tree in my backyard just because it's Florida and I can get away with grapefruits next to me yeah but it was grown from a seed most aren't you know most grapefruit true so like six or eight feet or ten feet tall mine's forty I can get eight hundred grapefruits off in a season Wow there are wonderful and the neat thing that people don't know about grapefruits is the things called shine is if you live in on the tree they're gonna stay ripe for months so I got about four months to pick the grapefruits but when I didn't used to get him because I used to try to pick them all because they'd fall to the ground and the grapefruit tree because of its very nature keeps anything from growing under its canopy it's just ends up being sand well a rotten grapefruit is exactly the same shade of Tayna tan Assad and it still holds liquid that's now rotten in the inside and of course it goes flat too if you hit a rotten grapefruit with a lawnmower it is an experience you'll never want to repeat so the whole object is to get all the grapefruits off the tree so for years I'd end up with laundry baskets on the grapefruits in my store with little signs that said free to good home and I've learnt more ways to eat grapefruits I mean I 10 grapefruits will fill a gallon ziplock bag with a half gallon of grapefruit juice and I'll lay it on a cookie sheet in the freezer and freeze it and then I'll stack them up like records so I can defrost them later and but what I really learned to do that I love is I cut grapefruits in half and I sprinkle them with brown sugar and I put them under a broiler okay this next one is our berry mix and it should show you what the how the texture changes with the shape with the shape well actually no this is our madness I'm sorry but it's in the very rola this is the flavor we came up with for our our candy that should not be confused with a Procter & Gamble product we stopped making that logo but we did keep the flavor going because people liked it so much now this is air I thought I'd grabbed about thing of raspberries this is our raspberry drop roller but if you put it in your mouth you'll discover it gives you the it really does feel like a raspberry does that make sense yeah and it's an interesting shape no that's a flavor combination of multiple new fruit flavors Jessica mixes that and I've never asked her what she puts in it so I kinda like it but first she's a bunch of different ones and it's a great flavor combination because people got this joke candy that looked like a laundry detergent tablet and then they were shocked to find out how good it tasted he but you know so we made it for it we make a lot of our special candies for our week or two so if you want to get it you better get it now and I guess about four days into the video being up which is still on Facebook and not on YouTube we got an interesting call for the head of consumer safety from Procter & Gamble saying could you please take this down his name was Mark and it was really nice and it was like I'm gonna take it down on Sunday anyway only plan to put it up for a week and he went okay that's fine and we talked for a while and you know it boiled down to I was making a can't up candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison look like a candy never the twain shall meet no so he stopped making that design not to mention was annoying design to make I hate where I come up with a design I'm expecting to sell you know 50 bags of and then all of a sudden I saw 800 bags of it I'm spending a month making something that happened with the hurricane candy and with the madness candy some of these things are fun to make those two weren't though I make cotton candy when a hurricane MMO came I was a little concerned because was headed straight to Tallahassee it was a class-five it he's waving at the lights trying to they are the lights of that gun it was a class-five hurricane it could be a class-3 when I hit Tallahassee if it hit Tallahassee my power could go off I could have lost all my ice cream and food inventory I would have been down who knows how long I would have been down I thought I'd make a couple of batches of candy and ship it out before the hurricane hits I'd have some extra money and there was some I was sitting there actually that wasn't one thing I was just nervous talking with some customers we need some customers in the store who had come up from South Florida to avoid the storm they referred to themselves as immigrants and they were sitting there and said you should do hurricane candy it'll be great and we decided what come flavor it should be we started thinking about salt water so the thought the Hurricanes from the overhead videos look like the satellite photos look like cotton candy being made yes I did cotton candy flavor and people are going cotton candy flavor is Kim sugar already flavored like sugar and the answer is yes cotton candy has a flavor it's a variant of raspberry believe it or not and whether it's pink or blue it's still the same flavor and I made some candy and I did two batches and I put it aside and big buckets that are watertight in case anything came through the roof and I came back three days later because we were down for a bit and fortunately the eye of the hurricane hit 50 miles to the east of Tallahassee hurricanes are much more powerful on the east side so there are entire towns that were devastated I mean it was like the finger of God you'd go down the interstate there's just a section where there were no trees there were 20 miles wide and these old oak trees just went down and Tallahassee was spared we got some water we got some out I lost power at the house for four days because tree branches went down the store never lost power which was good Oh thankfully and uh it's a swamp it's Tallahassee we don't have snow we have our became snow so it came out pretty good I'm sorry I don't have any of that but I ran out of that ages ago so I think that's everything but the madness but since the madness is like a roulette wheel I think I'm gonna leave it to you and Craig to do that on your own with some beer or something honestly I don't want to do that it's a whole lot of fun and they're delicious but you know everything else I think you're all sugared up enough great thanks by the way I'm expecting to bring home chocolate tomorrow your thing is you do some shopping tomorrow [Music]", "-m4I_QriwBk": "when we think about caring for our skin we typically think of topicals lotions creams etc but our skin cells are made inside our bodies so today I want to share some ideas for having healthier hair skin and nails from the inside out I want to thank I herb comm for sponsoring this video and giving me this chance to share these tips with you so you can find links to all of these different products down in the description below and I also want to thank Abby for helping me research this video and really delving into the science of our skin so first off let's just remember that our skin is an organ it's actually our largest organ and it plays a lot of really important purposes in addition to just the aesthetic or appearance that people see from the outside most importantly our skin protects the entire body from external aggravators like bacteria pollution sun damage chemicals and this essential immune system role means that the skin has to maintain a perfect balance of permeability and protection so that it can keep the right things in and the wrong things out this delicate balance is achieved primarily by the stratum corneum or the outermost layer of our skin so this stratum corneum or outermost layer of the skin is about 15 to 20 layers of dead skin cells and it's primarily composed of a dense layer of protein primarily keratin that serves to create that perfect balance of permeability so when we think about our skin being dry are being moist this is largely due to how much water is able to be retained in that stratum corneum or top layer of the skin it's essentially serving like a waterproof seal to keep all of the moisture in our cells from just evaporating into the air and to also keep our cells from absorbing water and filling up like a balloon every time we go swimming or expose our skin to water so that brings us to hyaluronic acid which has been getting a lot of attention recently in the realm of skincare and beauty and the reason why is that it plays a really important role in helping to maintain this perfect amount of permeability and protection so our body produces hyaluronic acid and unfortunately as we age the body produces less and less hyaluronic acid this is part of the reason why we can think about a baby's skin which is so soft so supple and so healthy largely because as babies we have the highest amount of hyaluronic acid in the body hyaluronic acid is also present in our joints and our eye sockets so you can just kind of understand how it serves this lubricating role all throughout the body it helps us to retain collagen which is the protein that provides the elasticity that helps keep our skin youthful reducing the signs of wrinkles and aging and just helping to contribute to healthier more repaired skin hyaluronic acids ability to help retain moisture makes it really effective for wound healing so things like healing up scars healing up sun damage and just remember that the stratum corneum is constantly in flux as these 15 to 20 layers of dead skin cells are constantly being replaced so this means there's a lot of repair that's needed to keep that outermost layer of our skin healthy and it's one of the reasons that hyaluronic acid has become so popular in the realm of cosmetics and skincare another factor contributing to the appearance of our skin is free radical damage now we know that antioxidants can help to neutralize free radicals by giving up one of their electrons so these reactive aggressive free radicals can be neutralized but the thing about antioxidants is that there are tons of them and they all function in different specific ways so one of the things I love about this hyaluronic acid complex is that it contains two potent antioxidants French maritime pine bark extract and grapeseed extract pine bark extract has such strong antioxidant properties that it can actually be found in over 600 different supplements vitamins and other health care products so when it comes to our skin there are a couple of things that make it really beneficial number one it has been shown to have specific photo protective properties that means protecting your skin from damage from the Sun now again our skin the largest organ is constantly exposed to these different sources of free radicals and the Sun is one of the most harmful ones so these photo protective properties not only help to protect your skin cells from free radical damage before it occurs but has also been shown to even go in and repair damage that's already occurred we also have the grapeseed extract now the antioxidants in grapeseed are part of why we hear people talking about drinking red wine to get antioxidant benefits and in just a moment we'll actually look at a trans reservatrol supplement that again gives you these same benefits so grapeseed extract and French maritime pine bark extract are both high and a certain type of antioxidant known as bio flavonoids and more particularly Oleg Americ procyonids or oak pcs which have very strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties now the wonderful thing about antioxidants is that they are plentiful in a healthy diet of lots and fruits and vegetables but the thing about some of these particular ingredients is that it would be really difficult for you to eat enough of those healthy foods to get the amount to really give you benefit so for instance with grape seeds number one most people don't eat the grape seeds number two most of these polyphenols bio flavonoids and other antioxidants actually have a very bitter taste so even if you were to go and buy grape seeds or something like that you would probably find that the taste is not super favorable so I love that California gold has actually created this you know complex supplement anything that you take as a pill is just so easy so simple to add into your diet and it's just a great way to ensure that you're getting enough of these really valuable antioxidants that even in a really healthy diet may be hard to get and there's a similar situation with reservatrol so reservatrol comes from the skin of the grape and the reason that we typically think about reservatrol in association with red wine is that red wine will actually contain a pretty high concentration of that reservatrol and it's probably part of what adds to that bitter flavor but the thing to understand is that the body can only absorb so much of reservatrol in this particular instance of what you eat and they estimate that the body only absorbs about 25% of dietarily consumed reservatrol so this trans reservatrol again is just a wonderful way to ensure that you're getting enough so number one this is the trans variation of reservatrol which is the more bioavailable or easily absorbed variety and number two when you take a reservatrol supplement like this one you're not having to deal with all of the negative health effects that come with drinking red wine now I love wine just as much as the next person but it would be helpful to understand that if you're only drinking wine for the antioxidant benefits that it's really not the best source so to understand how reservatrol offers so much benefit it's helpful to understand why plants create it in the first place so reservatrol is something that a plant will create in response to injury infection or fungal attack so it has such protective properties for the plant it also has really protective properties for us now another thing I love about these California Gold supplements is that they're really clean so this one even says free of E Modan and pH PAHs essentially if you start looking at different supplements like this you'll start finding that there can be certain ingredients or byproducts with negative effects so I love that all of these products are formulated to make sure that you're only getting the good stuff and they're really careful to remove those things that can be potentially harmful so going back to that concept of the stratum corneum or very top layer of the skin and its important role of maintaining a homeostasis or balance of water retention and also water protection a big part of this whole chemical process involves fats and water so some antioxidants are water soluble and some antioxidants are fat soluble and this is just one of the things that contributes to the different actions of antioxidants so vitamin E is a fat soluble antioxidant and it plays a really important role in the stratum corneum helping to maintain that delicate homeostasis so that moisture can be retained in our skin but we're also being protected from everything we need protection from vitamin E has also been found to have very beneficial effects on the hair follicle so this means that as your hair is growing that healthier hair follicle is going to be able to create more deeply conditioned hair and just healthier hair overall it's known to accelerate healing so again when we think about repairing sun damage or any other type of damage that our skin encounters vitamin E is a very very important antioxidant that can accelerate that healing process so this is sunflower vitamin E and that's because sunflower seeds are one of the best dietary sources of this important vitamin but again the amount of sunflower seeds you would need to eat on a daily basis is not as easy as just taking it in a pill form so of course sunflower seeds are really healthy and I encourage you to eat a lot of them but I think that you know having a vitamin E supplements as photo protective properties so taking one of these sunflower vitamin e's before you go out in the Sun would be a really great way to help just protect your skin from all of that potential sun damage that could occur the Journal of clinical and experimental dermatology has also found that in people who are prone to acne there tends to be lower levels of vitamin A and vitamin E in those patients so even though it hasn't necessarily been proven that supplementing vitamin E could help with acne there's very strong evidence that people who are low in this vitamin will be more prone to acne than people who are getting plenty of it in their diet or maybe even supplementing vitamin E through a supplement like this another great way to care for our skin from the inside out is to simply help support the body's natural processes of healing and repair now the best way to do that is to try and focus on getting sleep getting more high-quality sleep and just reducing your overall stress levels so I know that there's no way to avoid stress in our lives so when we think about trying to reduce our stress levels what exactly does that mean well number one it's about trying to spend as much time as you can in a more restful and relaxed state than in that heightened fight-or-flight state so our nervous system has two different components the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with the rest and digest properties of the body so this is where our body is really able to heal and repair and do all of that little maintenance work that it can't typically do when we are distracted throughout our daily life and these stresses of daily life so that fight-or-flight part of the nervous system or sympathetic nervous system our body is kind of triaging so it's just putting all of its attention into adrenaline being ready to fight or flight and all of those things like digestion repairing damaged tissues immune system function all of those things just kind of get put on the back burner so the more time that you can spend in this rest and digest or parasympathetic nervous system the more your body is healing and repairing everything from your internal organs all the way to that stratum corneum or external layer of the skin one of the simplest ways to trigger the parasympathetic rest and digest nervous system is with slow relaxed breathing and that's because the body registers slow and relaxed breath as an environment where there are very few threats so when we're breathing really fast and we're breathing really shallow that signals to our brain that there's a potential danger and it triggers that fight-or-flight nervous system so something like taking a few slow deep breaths or doing a guided meditation where you focus on your breath or a practice like yoga which also has you really focus on taking these slow relaxed breath those are all really wonderful ways to help trigger that parasympathetic nervous system and trigger all of that healing and repair there are also a variety of different herbs that can also help to support this restful healing part of our nervous system so a couple that I want to show you in this video are lemon balm and passion flower now these are both very gentle sedatives they're not going to knock you out like a sleeping pill but they actually work with your body to support that natural inclination towards the parasympathetic healing part of our nervous system so passion flower is also known to help relax twitching muscles so when you think about laying down in bed and feeling any kind of muscular tension or twitching in the muscles a passionflower supplement like this one can be very very effective at just helping your body to both physically and mentally relax lemon balm is another wonderful herb for supporting relaxation supporting that healing part of our nervous system and these are just a couple of over a hundred and twenty different supplements and I just love I are calm because of this awesome variety you can find food supplements beauty products you name it and they ship to a hundred and sixty different countries so I love that they are really designed to help the world get healthy they even offer customer support in ten different languages so love I are calm I love that they are making it accessible and simple for you to get healthy no matter where you live my last tip for this video is to just remember that a healthy diet is going to help supply you with all of the different nutrients antioxidants healthy fats and other beneficial nutrients that the body needs now no matter how healthy we eat I think that it's safe to say that most of us are probably not always getting all the nutrients that we need so my last product for this video is a simple multivitamin this one is designed specifically for women and I think it's really fun cuz they actually make it in a gummy form and these gummies are so good it's like eating candy so this gummy includes vitamins A C D and E b6 folate iodine and it's just a wonderful kind of safety net to help make sure that you're getting some of those really essential nutrients that may or may not be coming from your diet every single day I also love that it's free of GMOs soy gluten and some of these other components that people may be sensitive to and that are really pretty rampant in a lot of the different supplements out there now not all of these things are necessarily harmful but just knowing that California gold has created a really pure really clean high quality multivitamin kind of gives me that comfort of knowing that each day no matter how healthy my diet is I'm making sure to get a couple of those basic essential nutrients in I hope that you've learned some valuable tips from this video and I hope you'll consider visiting

supplement reviews and lifestyle videos every single week if that is something yours today and make sure you hit that subscribe and belt for notifications now guys we are on day two of vlogmas and i'm just gonna call vlogging once i know this is not a vlog their reviews but basically we're gonna do a video guys every single day all the way up until you know what christmas and it's a very exciting month it's gonna be a very busy month fortunately I don't really have too much other work to do so I can really focus on bringing you guys as much content as I possibly can and I am gonna work my little heinie off on making sure that I get a video up every single day even if it's a short video at least bringing something to the table so today we are talking about a new supplement is called the TSN pre jacked pre-workout I found this pre-workout at the San Diego Fit Expo and if you guys are watching I appreciate you guys giving this to me I think it's really important to look at small companies that are on the rise and I know I got to talk with the owner Chris a little bit about the product and and kind of how he's been going around the u.s. and and trying to basically get this product out there and getting people to order it and so yeah we're gonna talk about state I will say this review is completely unbiased unpaid and I was not given any script so this is completely just me giving my honest opinion of this product I hope it's great if it's not I will tell you guys one other thing that I want to touch base on and it's my little plug talked about it before but if you guys haven't picked up your VW Fitness official shaker Cup make sure you head on over the website www.rinaldin.com like just kind of ending it there but you know what I decided to extend it an entire another seven days so this is gonna end on December 10th guys do not wait on this make sure you pick up those make sure you head on and over the website really appreciate you guys doing that I will those out as soon as possible also I will send out any samples you guys request make sure you hit me up let me know what you would like to try out so anyway let's get back to today's video now this is an interesting one it's gonna be a little bit different in terms of how I do the review now I'm still gonna break it down into three different parts I'm gonna talk about number one price I'm talking about the label and grading breakdown and then I'm gonna talk about the taste taste is just not the most important thing to me when it comes to pre workouts but I know for a lot of you guys it is kind of a deal breaker and you want it to taste at least good so obviously that's why I do talk about I am gonna go do a workout I'm not gonna film it with vlogmas and everything else going on guys and I'm not really too sure if you guys actually enjoy watching the workouts if you guys want to see those in there or not leave a comment below let me know what you guys think if you guys want me to keep shooting the workouts or if you would rather just see me post-workout and just kind of give you my overall thoughts of the pre but today like I said that's what we're gonna do we'll come back we'll talk about the effects kind of my overall thoughts on this pre-workout all right so let's start out with price guys this comes in at $45 that's right off their website TSN supplements calm and this is kind of a hard one like I said to find this is a brand new start up I believe and like I said Chris was at the San Diego food Expo when I was working with a threat extent kind of shooting some stuff for them and I briefly got to chat with him and so yeah I don't really know a ton about it I know that he's been traveling around and that sort of thing and trying to get this product out there honestly unfortunately the samples I will say this they do not have a label ingredient breakdown but I was able to snag a photo of the tub that they actually had at the expo so if you guys see me on my thumb when we go into the label grinning freak down that is why $45 does get you 30 full servings from the price per serving breaks down to a dollar 50 which is gonna land at a four out of five on my consistent scale when it comes to pricing I think that's a good price I mean it does include 30 full servings you know it's all gonna be subjective you know when it comes to the label and when we talk about the effects and how things kind of wet so with that being said let's jump right into the label guys like I said we'll start right here now there is no scoop size on this label you're gonna see the photo that I took it's up here on the side here but we start out with 500 milligrams of the choline but our trait 75 milligrams of niacin 10 milligrams of b12 40 milligrams of B 650 milligrams of green tea leaf extract 10 milligrams of the green coffee bean 100 milligrams of l-carnitine I think that's a look that's pretty under dosed I would have liked seen at least one full gram you're gonna put carnitine in there 100 milligrams of l-lysine 25 milligrams of Nair engine 98% 3.5 grams of the beta-alanine that's a great dose obviously I'm always looking for at least 3.2 or bare minimum 3 grams 350 milligrams of caffeine anhydrous that is a solid amount that's kind of what I like to see for me personally especially as I have not taken a stem break in quite a while and after we finish this vlogmas I will say this I am planning on taking like a two-week break off of all caffeine sources and just kind of resetting my entire body then we have 40 milligrams of sniffing 1 milligram of the Alpha here you know him being 50 milligrams of l-theanine definitely could be a lot more there 200 milligrams of the area utterances that's a great amount that's what I usually see in most pre-workouts we have 400 milligrams of the lion's mane 500 milligrams of the l-tyrosine and 0.8 milligrams of the huperzine a which is kind of a standard so with that being said guys in terms of the label and the ingredient breakdown everything is fully disclosed I feel like some of these ingredients are a little bit under dosed I'm not super stoked about some of that I feel like the big ones for me the stems in here are pretty well dosed there are some new ingredients in here that a lot of other pre-workouts as far as I know do not have just some differences here I like to kind of see that when when you're gonna come out with a new pre-workout you got to set yourself apart I don't think being fully transparent I don't think being fully you know dosed is gonna be what's gonna set you apart you have to find other ingredients that help the user when it comes to the pre-workout and the workout itself so in terms of the label guys I'm gonna give it a 3 out of 5 I don't think it's great I think it's missing some things especially like pump products I know a lot of people are chasing stem and there's quite a bit of stem stuff going on in here but personally I do want to see some of those pumpkin greens as well honestly I do take citrulline on the side regardless of what pre-workout I'm taking I'm always taking 9 grams a day ok at least so for me personally I don't necessarily need all those pump products but I do prefer to see some pump products within the label and here not seeing a ton and I would have liked to seen some more everything is fully transparent which I do appreciate I think it's just missing some some stuff on the label that I would like to seen and yeah that's just my honest opinion so with that being said guys let's move right into taste this does not I I could not find any information regarding how much water to use or what the suggested site is like I said I got one photo and I'm fortunate on the website it doesn't show me either I'm just gonna do 8 ounces of water because there is no amount of a gram of scoop size that I talked about in the label ingredient breakdown what I'm going to do is actually I'm going to open this up and this is the pre jecht extreme pre-workout bomb pop I did get another one it's a strawberry flavor today we are gonna do the bomb pop and I'm just going to open this up what I'm gonna do is actually just weigh this with my scale here so I'm at 0 grams here and alright so it's an 11 gram scoop that's exactly what it comes up at I think that's a little bit low like I said there are a ton of ingredients in here guys there's a lot of lot of actives in here now is everything fully dosed in my personal opinion I don't think it is I think there could be some some increases in some things you know the price point is great I would have liked to see more efficacious doses in my personal opinion given the fact that I would pay a little bit more for a pre-workout of this nature so like I said guys we went with the bomb pop like I said that's I've never tried it this per workout guys ever I have the other sample literally show it to you right here has not been opened yeah the the the powder itself is not like a very thin powder I will say that it's a little bit different a little bit thicker or a little bit bigger grains give this a nice good shake here a lot of foam a lot a lot of foam which is always somewhat concerning for me because you know I don't want to run into any stomach issues I really do run into stomach issues guys but I know some of you guys do run into that you know some bloating or whatever it might be you know there's some some grains on the bottom here nothing too crazy I would say everything mixed up pretty well the foam has gone down it was you know kind of up here and now it's you know pretty minimal let's give it a good taste it's like a skittle starburst explosion in your mouth the texture of the liquid is very smooth it's a lot different than what I was kind of expecting based on the size of the of the grains within the powder it wasn't a very powdery you know substance it was more of kind of more grains like kind of sugar kind of granulated sugar kind of style but as I'm looking at this everything mixed up very very well there's a little bit of some stuff on the bottom which typically happens you know there's gonna be some things in in your pre-workout they're just not gonna break down they're not gonna mix as well as everything else it's like a fruit explosion in your mouth literally like a fruit punch but not like that super cherry rich flavor it's like tropical flavor like a candy and almost yeah it tastes like a candy I mean you know it's a bomb pop it literally tastes like those red white and blue popsicles that used to have this kid or maybe you still have them today I think the flavor on this is actually solid I think the mixability is really good I'm gonna give it a solid 5 out of 5 I think it tastes really good we'll see how it goes you know I'm working out it has been a few days since I have doubts and I've taken any pre sometimes I can throw me off but we'll kind of see how we go I am gonna go hit the gym I'm gonna go downstairs I'll come back I'll give you guys my kind of honest thoughts on how the workout went and yeah we'll go from there I'll see you here saying all right guys we just finished up that workout and let me tell you that was killer absolutely killer I did a different style workout I did the lean X chest and back workout today I haven't worked out in about five days I only got one workout in was in Colombia so it felt really good to get back into the gym overall with this pre-workout let's talk about the shelf nutrition pre jacked holy I mean the focus right now is absolutely insane feel laser focus just dialed in I don't really have too much of the jitters a little bit nothing too crazy I don't feel like I've got to talk super fast just the focus is super clean and I'm really surprised by this pre-workout guys I wasn't really sure what to think you know with it being a new you know version 1 3 workout but honestly the effects here are 5 out of 5 hands-down definitely feel good I push through the entire workout I mean there were some Sprint's on the treadmill I had to push through there were some rowing Sprint's on the rowing machine I had to push through worse than the workout everything felt really good I did get a really good mind muscle connection I would say that was the biggest thing the pump you know like I said I always take citrulline throughout the day no matter what so I did get a pretty good pump obviously I'm not too sure if any of the ingredients in this pre helped with that potentially could but overall I feel incredible guys like I'm just so spent right now that like I wanted to get back upstairs and like really give you my initial thoughts you know post-workout it was a 50 minute workout with a 15 minute Stairmaster warmup overall incredible career I would highly recommend you reach out to them on Instagram guys top-shelf nutrition look them up reach out maybe get a sample you know I haven't seen too much of these guys out and about give this a try love to hear you guys thoughts what it worked if it worked for you or not overall though I mean incredible incredible feel really good stim wise I think this is probably one of the heaviest hitters I've had so definitely uh go ahead and check out these top-shelf nutrition guys again this is completely unpaid I'm biased I didn't really know what to expect and now post-workout sweating my tush off and I feel really good so anyway guys if you guys enjoyed this video make sure you smash that thumbs up button 50 subscribe and bail for notifications remember there's new video tomorrow that's what we'll see in the next [Music]", "mZPUMQ0So_g": "okay we have one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a fourth a cup of water we're just going to stir stir stir over medium heat i do medium because i don't want my sugar to burn so and i'm not using can of sugar in this one um i'm just showing you so and you're only going to stir until it starts to boil and it is starting to boil so now we're going to insert our candy thermometer and you're going to insert it and you're going to let it boil and do not stir until your candy thermometer reaches 305 degrees do not stir at all and then remember we want it to get to 305 degrees okay we are at 305 degrees so we are going to remove it from the heat and let the temperature drop back down to 280 degrees all right our temperature has dropped back down to 280 so now we're going to add in well i'm adding in distillate i'm also adding in tincture we're going to stir we're gonna add in our candy flavoring um it's one to two teaspoons of candy flavoring i eyeball it gonna add our food coloring [Music] i'm using americana red because i'm doing a fruit punch candy and the recipe is the same for hard candies than it is for suckers same recipe and then you immediately pour into your moles um you have to pour fast because it gets hard fast and then you just let it set out at room temperature until it gets hard um it takes about 30 to 45 minutes um humidity and the temperature in your house they play a big part in how your candy's set up okay they have been cooling for about 45 minutes now we're gonna pop them out this is just the batch i'm doing for me so i'm okay to touch it with my hands lego man i recommend using silicone molds because it is easier to get them out of and like if there's excess you can just break it off do little hard candies you", "uQPi9CKNxtQ": "[Music] everybody VHT Joe here coming to you and wasn't actually planning on making a video today but I was getting ready to actually fill up all of my vitamins for the next couple weeks and thought I would go ahead and share with you guys what vitamins I'm actually taking and and what's going on so we'll get into it and I've got much stuff here off camera so I won't be making a whole lot of eye contact I'm sorry but so with vitamins as always I'm not a doctor I don't even play one on TV I don't even play one on YouTube but my surgery center they actually gave me a list of vitamins that I should be taking as part of you know supplementing as a lot of you guys know or if you're just doing your research on this if you are a VST or weight-loss surgery patient of any kind essentially you're never going to be able to eat the amount of food to get all of your nutrients of vitamins in that are recommended assets you will need to supplement so that you're able to actually you know have a nourished and/or be nourished and and have a good you know good nourishment throughout your body I guess way to mess that up Joe but that being said my surgery center instead of giving us a brand that you always had used or something like that they actually give us guidelines so they gave us a book here and show on camera a little bit but essentially it goes through and it tells you what nutrients you should have depending on what type of surgery you had so you know goes through it gives you vitamin b1 b12 folate calcium all that good stuff and all that stuff is in your multivitamin some of it you watch supplement outside of your multivitamin but um they do that and you know as far as the vitamins they're then they've got minerals they want you to take and all that good stuff and it's been really good because like I said I don't have to worry about what brand I'm using as long as it meets the requirements of my surgery center so hopefully your guys's surgery center will give you something similar some of them won't you're just using a certain brand so I'm only what you buying them from I've heard kind of all kinds of stories and you know it is what it is but I like having that because like I said I'm not locked into a particular brand I can try different ones as long as they have the nutritional values that our surgery center is looking for so I'm going to break this up into a couple things first off I'll show you my pill thing it's not anything great but I'll show it to you anyway just so you kind of get a feel for it then I've got my what I call the morning vitae ministers which is why I take morning and afternoon and then I've got my evening stuff which I take at night so that is it so to start off I do have one of these little guys makes me full feel more geriatric than bariatric but it helps out you know I put all my stuff in here I've got a couple of these then I load them up for a couple weeks and that's it don't worry about it and I have this guy so this guy right here helps me out it's basically just a pillow holder but it's got you know a little divider in there so I could put four different things in there and it helps me not because I just pop my stuff into this the night before and then the morning grab it throw out of my pocket and then we'll Maurice are taking my vitamins I have them ready and available I put just my multivitamins and stuff like that in there I'll show you guys in a moment and then my calcium is wrapped up so I can just actually take that with me in my pocket as well but this I would recommend just so you don't have to carry around all the time you can put them in here you've got it my wife has some circle ones I should have got those for the video I didn't sorry guys but essentially any kind of small or pill you know a whole rich you can use put in your pocket throughout the day it works out great so all right so without further ado what am I actually taking so I take a multivitamin as everyone does and I have to stop here for just another moment I am taking the back drink advantage I'll show you guys in just a second I actually before have said that I thought they were involvement flavored bariatric of a hinge [Music] my bad to bariatric advantage it was actually a celebrate pineapple something or another I was taking it was horrible it's baked chalky pillow taste garbage and I wouldn't take them however I ran out of those as one does and I went out and actually we got the bariatric advantage chewable essentials multi these are the berry flavor took me a few days to kind of get used to it but they're actually pretty good I don't feel like vomiting want to take these now it's not it's not a great tasting pill but it's not a bad pill as well so I'm one that's always been kind of sensitive to vitamins and stuff like any kind of medicine I could really taste the medicine taste in it so these are like said a lot more berry flavored than anything else and really helps out so I take two of these a day I take one in the morning after I eat my breakfast and then I take one after lunch once I've finished my lunch so that's it just two a day and that has all the multivitamin stuff in there I'm not gonna read this as far as the labels concerned I like this stuff I am actually gonna have links to all this stuff down in the description box below so if you want to check them out and look at the stats on them for how much stuff is in there you're welcome to do so um also I signed up for the Amazon affiliate program so if you see something in there and there is a chance I will make some money off of it I don't have all the details yet I haven't really been approved they don't even review your applications until people buy stuff off your link so you've been warned sorry but by um don't buy them at least you'll have the nutritional information you can look at for them next I take calcium I use the bariatric advantage calcium citrate chewables these are the caramel flavor this is probably the best part of the day this is what it actually looks like it's just little looks like a little caramel to like a Werther's or something like that or the Kraft caramel cheese if you get the bulk stuff anymore on the stores two of these day once again one for breakfast one towards lunchtime stuff like that so when taking your calcium it is important you don't take it with hired these multivitamins I forgot to mention do not have in them I take an iron separately right now later on that I'll change and I'll have to take these separately but we'll deal with that later on but as of right now take two of these take them at the same time I do a multivitamin so also when I moved to Georgia apparently I have developed allergies who knew I take the Kirtland allergic I still have these I don't actually have a Costco membership anymore I don't have a link for these but this just an allergy medicine I take all my mourning stuff but fair to show you guys this really has nothing to do with the having bariatric surgery so I take it next thing on the list I have is vitamin d3 this is members mark which is a sam's club brand i'm not gonna lie i didn't know this until i started looking for links so that you guys can see the facts on this this is just a 5,000 IU by the way I take it daily they actually have this on Amazon so you can buy it from there if you're not a Sam's Club member I didn't know that makes me rethink why I'm paying for a membership at this point well anyway I take this every day as well my vitamin D level was tragically low before I had bariatric surgery so they recommend I just take a supplement every day I'm gonna have labs done at the end of the month and at that point we'll reevaluate whether or not I need this but once again just an additional supplement d3 500 or 5000 IU so and if you guys want to see this probably a good thing is a very small soft gel coat let's see if I can do this without spilling them all over the place but that is it so very small very easy to swallow and I get my vitamin D in alright and I'm moving on I actually have very very very high levels of b12 but I'm still taking this multivitamin the b12 I'm probably gonna cut this down once a week currently I'm taking it three times a week we'll kind of see what my blood work comes back but my surgeon did say a cut the amount of b12 I'm taking there's also be 12 in this multivitamin I'm not sure how much a thousand micrograms are there so I don't think I really need an additional 5,000 at this point but probably just do this once a week moving forward but like I said that is something a lot of people take it is vitamin b12 supplement and that just helps with your energy levels and things of that nature and that is it so that is all my what I would call morning medicines so that's it like I said take all those in the morning to multivitamins to calcium's one vitamin b12 one vitamin D and my Howard G pill and that's it so not too bad like I said calcium and multivitamins get split up between meals the b12 vitamin d3 and the allergy pill usually just take those first thing in the morning just get them done the multivitamins I will recommend that you take them not on an empty stomach I know for me anytime I take a multivitamin if it's not on a you know after a meal it will tend to make me a little nauseous for a few minutes and then I'll be okay but I just come at that by taking it and that's been with a couple different brands that I don't know what it is it's probably just me but I if you have trouble taking them make sure you take them what the meal makes it a lot better so moving on so at night I don't really take much probably my favorite vitamin of the day is this celebrate iron plus vitamin C it is the grape flavored ones and these things taste like great candy basically there's not really a bunch of sugar or anything like that in there it just does it's just one tablet if you guys want to see what this looks like that is it right there so chew it up it's tubule for now I'm only five months post-op right now so everything basically is tubule as a matter of fact let me show you guys this is the new multivitamin by the way and it's only that big so really easy to chew up and get through and all that good stuff so this is the vitamin C and iron that I'm taking obviously if you're not eating a lot you can you allowed me that's where a lot of your iron comes from so greens as well by the way and then this last one is something that I use it's not a vitamin or anything like that but it has saved my ass so to speak it's still softener so this one is also the numbers mark one you can pick a brand guys on that stuff but anytime you're eating high amounts of protein and not anything else there's not a lot of anything else your show gets pretty hard so a stool softener is probably going to become saving grace for you guys I know it's helped me tremendously because when you're eating that much protein it hurts guys it hurts so but once you get through the kind of bariatric surgery you find that out quickly so I would definitely recommend a stool softener or some sort like I said this is just a member smart brand it is pretty much about the same as colace other than green star concern and it's just a it's two of these it's a pretty small pill so and just you know take it with some water and following like I said it'll save your ass so but guys that is it so you could like I said I've got links for all this stuff I'll put it in the description box below click on them buy them don't buy them that really doesn't matter but you should be able to see all the nutritional information for them and like I said follow whatever your plan says as far as what vitamins how much of them you should be taking things that nature I am NOT a doctor so please don't see this as medical advice it's really not like I said I just know a lot of people are curious about what vitamins and stuff you take after surgery I had VSD surgery back in July of 2018 and this is what I'm taking right now so I'm gonna go ahead and fill these up I won't bore you guys sitting there clicking through everything but I'm go ahead and do that and I'll get out of here

time have a good day", "DxVx5My-Zkc": "hey guys welcome to taste of love i'm marine and today we are making jolly rancher candy grapes so before we get started go ahead and give this video a thumbs up click on the subscribe button and turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time a new video drops so let's go ahead and get started okay so here we have our supplies we have our cairo syrup white food coloring blue food coloring toothpicks jolly rancher grapes and a one cup measuring cup so before we get started we're going to prep our grapes our grapes have already been washed and dried they would drive using a paper towel and now we're going to insert the toothpicks into our grapes so that we can dip them in the candy now when it comes to dipping the toothpicks when it comes to putting the toothpicks into the grapes you can't put it where you remove the grape from the stem on this side you put it on the opposite side on the bottom so you run the toothpick through the bottom of the grate so that when you shake it and you dip it it won't fall off so we're going to insert our toothpicks into all of our grapes make sure you go through your bag of grapes really carefully because a lot of the time some of the grapes are rotten and they're deforming so you don't want to dip those grapes into candy so we're going to stick them all and then you want to put the toothpick not just a little bit in so that when you go like that it'll fall off but more all the way in so when you shake it because you would have to shake off that excess candy it wouldn't fall off [Music] and then you put it all the way in so that it's sturdy so that it really holds onto the grate you can use any other food color that you want also i'm using blue because i wanted mine to be blue and i'm going to flavor it with the blue jolly rancher candies also [Applause] but i'm going to show you guys that in one second so you also need your thermometer and a deep size pot because sometimes your candy batter does bubble up for this recipe we're doing the four one one method so we're using four cups of sugar 1 cup of carrot syrup and 1 cup of water now if you do put your toothpick all the way through and it comes through the top it doesn't matter because when you slip it out after you dip it in candy it'll still come easily out [Music] [Applause] okay so right now we're going to add our ingredients to the pot to make our candy batter so we're gonna add four cups of sugar [Music] one cup of water [Music] and our cairo syrup [Music] now i'm going to add a few drops of white food coloring [Music] and i'm also going to add the blue and just two drops of the blue now i'm going to start my stove and turn it up to 7.5 so that my candy batter can cook and we're going to leave our candy batter to cook until it gets to 300 degrees okay you see the the colors is getting all mixed up on its own this is why i don't mix it because i like when it gets mixed from cooking it gets a more even mixture then if you try to mix it up but that's just what i like so this is why i didn't mix it when i put the colors in [Music] [Music] all right our candy has finished cooking it's gotten to 300 degrees look at how pretty that blue is so we're gonna take our pot off of the hot stove and then we're gonna get ready to dip our grapes okay so i have my pot angled to the side it's leaning on the stove just so that the angle would be i guess kind of able to tilt all my batter down so that i can get it and what i have here is my food processor which i'm going to crush up my jolly ranchers with so i'm just going to drop some of the jolly ranchers into my food processor and crush them up real quick and the reason i wait for my candy to be done cooking while i do this is because i don't want my um my candy to my well not my candy not my candy batter but the jolly rancher candies to get sticky and stick together and then it's hard to use so i'm just going to drop them in here really quick and blend it up so i'm opening my blue candy first because what i'm going to do is take this blue candy and drop it into my candy batter so that it'll flavor it i'm just putting two of them in here the candy is hot [Music] so it will melt it [Music] so now i'm going to drop my jolly ranchers in here really quickly so we could just crush them up if you don't have a food processor you can put them in three ziploc bags i will triple bag it and then use a rolling pin and crush it [Music] that method has worked for me personally for a little while before i started putting it in the fruit processor the food processor just makes it more fine and more dusted than really chunky and i like it finer than more chunkier because if you ever ate candy grapes you know that when you put it in your matcha bite into it if it's really chunky it can like scratch the top of your mouth and it's really painful so i'm just putting all my candy in here [Music] and i don't really need a lot because we only did a little bit of grapes [Music] okay so i have all the jolly ranchers that i want in here now i am going to turn it on so we can crush these up [Music] there we go nice and fine now i'm going to take them and pour them out into a little bowl so that we can go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy mixture and add jolly ranchers to move this inside nice and crushed so now we're going to go ahead and dip our grapes into our candy okay so here's my grape i'm going to dip it into my candy shake it off and roll it into my genre and there we go that's how it's going to look here now let's dip all of them shake it off you don't want to exist and also i use a spoon to keep the jolly rancher constantly mixed you can use a fork so it doesn't really matter because if you let your jolly rancher sit still it will start pumping up and get hard [Music] and i would suggest putting them in the refrigerator immediately after dipping [Music] i do suggest putting your candy grapes in the refrigerator immediately after dipping because it does get sticky and it starts melting almost immediately candy grapes is one of the fruits that will melt really really fast like really really fast from the minute you dip the grapes into the candy it starts to melt because grapes are a water-based fruit so they don't last very long you can put your grapes in the freezer after you dip them to try to lengthen how long they last but it does not lengthen it by much maybe by just a couple hours and putting it in the freezer would not change the taste it would still have the same great taste so we're going to go ahead and keep dipping and then add the jolly ranchers too [Music] look at how pretty that color is now the reason we add white food coloring is so that the color does not become transparent if you don't add white food coloring to your candy your candy will be transparent meaning that you can see right through and you can see your fruit like if you guys remember in the candy tangerine video we didn't use any color so the candy was clear your candy will be clear with like a light color if you don't put the white food coloring in the white food coloring is what gives it the background basically so that your grapes can turn into a different color so they won't be like you know green with a light blue look and i've tried dipping red grapes however red grapes are really really really sweet so they're not as tasty as using green grapes i think it's more delicious with the green grapes because the sweetness weighs out with the sour to give it a nice taste but with the red grapes it's just overly sour and i mean overly sweet i apologize it's just overly sweet so it's not really [Music] that good because to me too much sweet just takes all the flavor away from it [Music] i was about to dip it in the jolly rancher without putting it in the candy bag [Music] and you see how good our toothpick comes in handy um you can use skewers if you want to um i think the skewers are too long personally i don't like using screwers that's why i choose the toothpick method but there's like a different way for everything and i tell you guys this all the time i teach you guys what works for me i like showing you guys what i like to do there's always a different way for everything i just show you my way and what works for me because you can do it and say oh i don't like her way of doing this i like this way better and that is perfectly fine because there's always a million different ways to do stuff [Music] so my jolly ranchers are almost finished i'm just going to [Music] start using my spoon so i can pick up if you wanted to add a flavor to your candy also you can use the lorraine's flavor oil and you can add that instead of adding the jolly rancher like i did i wanted my jolly rancher flavor since we're using jolly ranchers and their decorations [Music] i'm running out of space [Music] let's just give them a flat bottom instead of a flat back and then you have to dip these real fast also because depending on the temperature of your house the candy batter will start to harden really fast because these are hard crack candy that's why we get it to 300 degrees 300 degrees is the point of hard crack [Music] it's how a lollipop would be you can use the same batter to make lollipops also and of course if you guys try this and i would love to see what you guys did so take a picture and tag me on instagram my instagram is in the description if you guys make these you had problems with them it was easy um whatever happened just let me know leave me a comment let me know if you liked it if it was delicious just let me know how it turned out i would love to hear from you guys [Music] and you see that the jolly rancher candy is already [Music] [Music] the whole time [Music] okay so we're almost done [Music] then i'm going to show you guys how to easily slip your toothpicks off and get ready to serve them eat them enjoy them put them in the refrigerator um if you're saving them for later later like you don't want to eat them right right now put them in the freezer so that they don't start breaking down as fast because they do break down very very quickly very very quickly like i believe candy grapes only last i think a maximum of about two to three hours depending on how you make them depending on the time of the year um to me i find that they last longer in the time because it's colder depending on how hot you keep your house also um in the summertime if you have them outside they will almost melt immediately and the same thing goes for your candy apples also they melt really quickly i'm gonna sprinkle it some of my candy is still on wet most of it has already dry and hardened it gets hard almost immediately after dipping them they dry really really quickly okay we're down to our last three grapes so now we're going to get ready to start pulling off our toothpicks from our grapes and separating it last two roll it in my jolly rancher last one i'm gonna cover it in our jolly rancher there we go [Music] all right so there we go now we're going to slide them off of our [Music] toothpicks and i'm going to put them [Music] and you can tell that the candy is hard when you squeeze it it doesn't get soft or squishy [Music] and that's how it looks when you like into it [Music] it's really crunchy and there we go jolly rancher candy grapes if you enjoyed today's video go ahead and give this video a thumbs up subscribe and make sure you turn on your post notifications so you'll be notified every single time we upload a video and of course if you have questions leave it in the comments and i'll be happy to answer you guys see you guys later", "5oifHBFjaHE": "[Music] hi everyone today I am going to show you guys how to make taco salad before I started I took off one of these so the first thing you want to do before even frying the hamburger you're good know for making it for a large amount of people like a large group this is so you're gonna need that size of cottage cheese and dump it all in there okay and then I don't I don't measure because I've been making this for years wait you're gonna reuse the Kraft Miracle Whip use whatever mayonnaise that you like the most and I just start off by doing like start off with three heaping tablespoons and mayonnaise mix that around you want it you want to be able to taste the mayonnaise and the cottage cheese so that's usually that's good you're gonna take some taco seasoning there I'm gonna do with this we're gonna pour this in and mix this around so after you have it all mixed up while you're then you're gonna want to start you know I'll take you through it but do this part first and cover it and put it in the fridge until everything's cooked and I'm ready to go okay so this is mixed put the lid on put it into the fridge and then we'll go into frying the hamburger so there's our hamburger and the pan getting ready to fry I put it on like a medium and like I said I make it for like a large amount because everybody likes the leftovers and they will get eaten so this is about a pound pound and a half I guess of of the meat and after that's fried I'll show you guys what to do next well your meat is frying I start grading your cheese and you just keep going until it's done probably half a breaker so so you're gonna dream the hamburger and then you're gonna put it back in the hand here add some water and then y'all take a full package of taco spice seasoning you just mix that around boil a little bit like gently and once it gets thick then you're just gonna remove it and then I'll show you how to put all the toppings and whatever else okay so while you're waiting for the hamburger to fry for the second time grate your cheese base your Tomatoes the only other thing is what to do is is the the lettuce probably cut the hole a whole head up because you'll need quite a bit of quite a bit of it and even after to do like when you mix everything up you'll need some for that too so just chop it real small put some on the plate nicely like a little hill here and do a little hill of meat okay and then you do the other plate too all right so when you're going to take remember the stuff I showed you guys at the beginning take that out put it on there nice and I'll do that for your yeah once Hey and then you can take what if cheese and then you're gonna cure Tomatoes and then after you get it all looking nice on there all the way around on the plate so it looks like like that when you're done what do you think what do you think about what it tastes as good as it does okay we talked it into in Banco it teaches as good as it did the billion times you made it before well you look so happy for if they wanted the recipe for this how can they get watching the video yeah but like what if they just want like there's a second hand to four yeah hey can they do something yes they can watch that video or can they they can message you I'm Twitter on Twitter Facebook and wherever you wherever you are mm-hmm and you can tell them we'll leave Donna's Twitter information in the description below cuz she doesn't know how to say that yet take a drink if you're eating taco salad remember to chew don't be like Donna there and just smell all the [ __ ] stuff that's it that's how you make taco salad and then the leftover part you just everything that you had leftover you just put it all mix it all together in one bowl except not the chips of chips you don't put in there and then you put the chips in and winter her to eat when you're gonna eat up some this is Donna's first cooking video and she [ __ ] up because she went to do it all hi so you gotta kind of figure out what she's talking about I guess everything but the chips mix it together and in the bowl and then when you're ready to have some of like everything [Laughter] [Music] what you're gonna eat some that's when you take the chips and you crush them up and then you just put them she's telling you a different version of the same thing she just made instead of put it all neat on the plate the way she did you can mix everything up into a ball and crush the crust the chips into it to keep it crunchy just don't leave the chips in it in the fridge because they'll get soggy and I think that's what she's trying to say but I don't know throw it on there did you eat too much of the edible again anyways that's it by", "TuvqbUm8Y0k": "Oh [Music] so everything we're going to need is some Jolly Ranchers sugar some strawberry extract Caro syrup some grapes a measuring cup and some toothpicks and I'm just starting off by pouring two cups of sugar so we're gonna add in half a cup of water and then a half a cup of the karo syrup you want to make sure everything is thoroughly combined and then you're gonna set the temperature to medium heat then I'm just washing off my grapes with cold water and the sink nothing specific I'm doing here just letting water run over all of them and you just want to make sure that they're thoroughly dry after and I just use a napkin to Pat them dry and here's how I insert the toothpick inside the grape I basically insert it on the side that doesn't have that little hole at the top because it makes it easier and more sturdy whenever we're dipping it into the syrup in here I'm just using my magic bullet to grind up two Jolly Ranchers because I wanted to have a kind of like powdery consistency [Music] [Music] and hey I'm just taking a cup of cold water and pouring a little bit of syrup in it if when you fill the liquid and it's hard that means it's ready and if it still feels like a soft ball that just means it needs to cook a little longer in here I'm just adding in the strawberry extract I didn't put a specific amount I just put like a dash of it in there and stirred it up and you can use any specific flavor you like I just want it to taste some strawberry [Music] okay I first start off by having my parchment paper on the counter I just laid it out flat just gonna grab the great fighter toothpick and dip it in the syrup I kind of hurt my pop tipsy to the side then you're gonna place it in the cup or play with your Jolly Rancher mix and just kind of scoop it on to the grape in the same steps apply if you don't want a Jolly Rancher mix on it you're just going to dip it into the syrup and then just place it gently on the parchment paper and this is how the grapes came out guys and they were so good leave a comment below if you guys decide to make these and things for watching [Music]", "VFr6RUbdQjE": "good morning guys so I have been up this morning they see something and about I'm out I'm up getting ready to do this order for our dates customers I can deliver to them they wanted 16 candy grapes unicorn colors but you know their own eliminated two colors you know for the 15 and you have to make one big part whatever any other separated and you did different components to it by the way you get two colors what she wanted unicorn colors so um I'm gonna do like a lime green and a neon pink I didn't you see uni yellows anything like that but anyway um I have these beautiful beautiful little glitter Andie crystals I'm going to design with what she won the plane but I told her um I'll do her daughter's on for free because she's the birthday girl I definitely hers but everybody else all will be like you know just a little color and I got these colors I say yeah being kind of a bleep unicorn as well and these glitters I use yesterday so I'm gonna show you what's going on on the stones right here on the stove is where I have my candy making I have my thermometer in there waiting to reach a certain degree and then I have the back one going to they'll have two pots of going and over here on my left side I have my great you have to make sure they're dry and everything before you mix it so and I thought everything is done I add my coloring and then I went to a cool little to get thick then I get mine okay so that basically is ready now I don't get my coloring they starting to thicken just a little bit I want to thinking a little more so we can grab really hold to the grapes so I'll be back want some ready for that and I have to do it fast but I mean you don't get to see that fart ask about the move fast and I have my other one over here it's not - it's not - a 300 degrees yet it's a bigger pot so okay I'll press doubt on this one so here we are you guys I picked up my feet oh I made these I put the little sparkles I was hyper sunny so although all of them they'll be the same so I'm on my galaxy candy and it's hot I want to just this one at the tie-dye which is lying through it go through it lime green and pink [Music] it's not were just experimenting with these are going to discuss around expanding ago there's candy apple candy some we call the South Sea as you can see another GP together for designing and also the staccato you can see that when it's very rustic but it's been oh here's another here's a poem with the galaxy on it this is another customer did it just me write this in her stuff oh yeah and of course if I don't want the candy on the I could get was gonna hot war for the candy meals or just feel it all being away that stuff in the bag of 16 of these in you'll see once I finish [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "Clad6bpfDlw": "what is going on everyone welcome to DIY or die today I want to talk about harshness so a lot of people have been asking about harshness a lot of new mixers have been getting into the fold and they're complaining that their recipes or their flavors are they feel harsh they feel kind of hard to put down they're just not as enjoyable and that's really what harshness has kind of come to be now what I find interesting is that the identification of finding that harshness seems to be a big issue and I want to cover that and I want to cover some solutions about how to how to fix this harshness so the first thing I want to talk about is nicotine harshness this is probably the most misrepresented sort of harshness now nicotine harshness to me at least this type of harshness is more of a kick it's more of a thud it's more of like this really just inability to kind of take in the recipe when I vape something that's at a much higher nicotine level than what I'm used to it kind of just distracts away from the flavor completely I taste a lot of that peppery nicotine flavor and my throat just gets pounded while there is a like a slight burn to it it's not necessarily a burning irritation it's more of just like that real like hard kick in the throat like a donkey just comes out and just nails you're rating the throat and that's sort of the defining characteristic of that sort of harshness to me so here are a few solutions the first thing I want to say is to just remix your recipe maybe you accidentally measured it wrong or maybe you should shake your nicotine and then remix your recipe maybe there's a hot spot in there you know nine times out of ten if you're receiving nicotine harshness that will alleviate the problem another thing that you can do is see if your nicotine is bad bad nicotine will be very dark in color it will have a very strong aroma to it and you can test it you know whatever your milligram level is mix that up by itself vape it and if you notice a very strong flavor from it then your nicotine is bad it should it should pretty much be a little bit peppery but there shouldn't be much flavor to it or if there is then it might be time to replace that nicotine now if you're at a higher milligram level maybe 6 12 18 milligrams and your nicotine is not bad but it's still kind of hard to get down then this is really one of the only times that will recommend this but then I would recommend a nicotine salt solution nicotine sauce are a more efficient nicotine but they are a smoother nicotine considering you get the smooth make it teen solution but this will allow you to reach those higher levels without much of that harshness you know reaching a 12 18 24 milligram babe with freebase it will be quite difficult it will be kind of hard to get down and you will experience that like real strong throat kick the next type of harshness I want to talk about is flavor burn what I like to call flavor burn and this is essentially a combination of flavors or pairing of flavors that creates that sort of irritation that harshness the defining characteristic of flavor burn to me is not so much a kick in the throat like with the nicotine it's more of that burning sensation that sort of like spicy throat sensation that's where I normally find that my recipe itself is actually harsh and not the nicotine a good way to kind of describe the way it feels it's like real fresh carbonation sort of purrs like in your throat just kind of like pins and needles sort of feeling just kind of you know it it does get a little bit warm and it does kind of burn a little bit and that's usually because there's some sort of compound in your recipe through a combination of flavors that's just over flavored there's just too much of it and that's a lot of the time like a malic acid or citric acid one of the acids they might just be a little bit too high on your recipe and it might be causing that flavor burn a lot of the time when I use cappellas lemon lime along with some other lemons and citruses I'll notice this I personally don't mind that flavor burn a little bit especially with the citruses because I just kind of like that throaty feeling but if you want like a completely smooth recipe then you should think about maybe looking at the recipe finding the offending pairings you know a lot of times it's the citruses but I get it from florals as well like dragon fruits and hibiscus and even sometimes like papaya but find those offending flavors and their pairings and try to rebuild that recipe around that knowing that you might have to pull them down a little bit just do a little bit more balancing if you do that and you're still kind of feeling that it's just too harsh it's not that enjoyable then you should substitute those flavorings completely try to find something else if you don't have flavorings look online go to noted go to my website and try to find flavors that are recommended in the same profile but might not be as harsh because there are some objectively rougher flavors it really just depends the type of person you are and your sensitivities if you can take down those flavors at an enjoyable level or not so something like this like maybe a lemon lime with a lemon sicily at a certain percentage is fine for me but it might be too harsh for someone that's where that sort of tweaking is gonna come into play but remember the flavor burn is usually a combination it's usually an over flavor because of the recipe itself now the next one the last one is flavor sensitivity and this is the one that pops up I think most often this is the one that more people should be claiming this is how they should identify their harshness flavor sensitivity is really just how your own body particularly reacts with a compound so for myself cinnamon cinnamon Ahad it just doesn't do too well with me I can vape it and I can enjoy it but there is a little irritation there and when I speak to someone else who enjoys a lot of cinnamon none of that happens to them that's a personal sensitivity of mine there are a lot of sensitivities out there one of the most common known ones is the vanilla bean ice cream sensitivity the TFA vanilla bean ice cream a lot of people who vape this they get this pepper flavor pepper feeling it just tastes like pepper it's harsh it's just not an enjoyable experience and that's because there's a compound in here maybe it's this little propanol but there's a compound in here that some people sort of perceive as just harsh and peppery and I don't I get a very delicious creamy almost kind of eggy vanilla bean ice cream flavor it's really just a very subjective thing and the flavor sensitivity sort of like feeling the way to kind of identify it is pretty vague some people get an itchy scratchy feeling some people get like a coughing feeling some people get a burning or a throat kick it's really subjective and how your body reacts to these compounds so it is the most so I understand why some people might think it's something else when in fact it is their own sensitivities to a compound another like defining characteristic of sensitivity is that it lasts a little bit longer so with like a nick harshness it kind of just hits you you know it lasts a couple seconds and it is subsides same with the flavor burn it kind of tingles a little bit and subsides flavor sensitivity sometimes lasts a little longer maybe a couple minutes and it kind of just lingers linkers around a little bit longer so if you find that you're getting irritation that kind of sticks with you then you might be sensitive to one of the compounds in there now the best way to identify what you're sensitive to is to take that recipe and test each individual ingredient it's gonna take a little bit of work but it's gonna save you so much extra development time in the future when you know what you're sensitive to so take that recipe break it down babe each of those ingredients solo and then find the one that's giving you problems and then hopefully that one has a flavor profile that similar or is a TFA flavor because then you can go to the TFA spec list and you'll be able to figure out what is in this flavoring and hopefully figure out what's going on on what you're sensitive to so for instance say you are sensitive to vanilla custard you would then press the list and then you're going to have a list of all the compounds that make up this flavoring and then you get kind of cross-reference them maybe there's another ingredient like the TFA vanilla bean ice cream that you're also sort of like a little bit irritant to well what are the flavoring compounds that they share acetyl propanol is a flavoring compound that we know sort of has like that buttery flavor it's a compound that some people have issues with maybe this is the offending flavor and what you could do then is make sure that you're mixing recipes without that by using v2 flavorings or just making sure you cross-reference to the spec list and say okay let me make sure that I'm leaving acetyl propanol out of my recipes or using v2 ingredients and substituting them and making those v2 ingredients work because sometimes a lot of is v2 flavorings don't contain that acetyl propanol once you understand it and you understand the compound and you can even get down to the the single compound it makes your life a lot easier and it allows you to develop recipes that aren't harsh for you that are delicious easy to vape and ultimately a lot more enjoyable so hopefully you are able to figure out your sensitivities there is another thing which is just too much sucralose some people have irritation with too much sucralose and the best way to solve this is to just either just drop it down to a percentage that you like and then stick to that percentage or just remove it completely but that that's another one's kind of goes in line with like the flavor burn but yeah hopefully you're able to identify your harshness figure out what's going on why that harshness is being caused and then being able to solve it using some of these methods and if you have any other tips for figuring out how to solve your harshness leave them down below in the comment make sure you leave a like on

the talk of losing weight or calories or food or anything like that perhaps maybe skip this video and I will be happy to see you in the next one I think another topic that I want to address is lately people think that if you want to change something on your body that you hate it or that you don't think you look good and I don't believe that that's true you can absolutely love your body and still want to change something whether that be your hair color if you want straighter whiter teeth fake eyelashes get a tan or lose a couple of pounds to see your muscles underneath or you know I know some people that want to put on a couple of pounds so they look a certain way and I don't think there's anything wrong with any of those decisions so let me say it one more time for the people in the back you can still love your body and still want to change something did also want to say before we jumped into that that I am NOT a dietitian you do not have to eat what I eat you do not have to eat the amount that I eat or do anything that I'm doing I'm not suggesting that you do that it's just showing you what I do give you some ideas if you want them that being said I have been a personal trainer I have a bachelor's degree in health science and my mom is indeed a dietitian so I do have some knowledge about food in general but you'll see this day of eating video is mostly quick and easy meals and I definitely don't eat like this every day I like a lot of variety my food that just happens to be one day so anyway with that being said here we go we are going to start our day of eating with kind of my workouts that I've been doing so on this particular day I had just finished a seven mile run it is one of the longest ones that I've done when I tend to run a lot more like way more than three miles my hamstrings and hip flexors and IT bands get very very tight so I try to spend maybe 20 minutes 15 to 20 minutes just kind of stretching everything out so everything feels better I guess and to prevent any injuries I've noticed this has become more important as I get older I'm definitely not running very fast right now I have definitely had a hard time I've been struggling getting my speed back after the whole long winter and everything like that I'm just trying to do all of my stretches so everything that you see me doing here is injury prevention and helping me feel better and you'll notice that I am extremely inflexible when it comes to my hamstrings I like I can barely keep my legs straight when I raced down and touched the floor my hamstrings are so tight and because I know someone's probably going to ask about my outfit the camo blue shorts were from Walmart a year ago it was only about four or five dollars very cheap the orange Under Armor tank top was from a friend at the gym she gave that to me about four years ago because she didn't want it anymore and I am trying out a new sports bra I'll probably do a sports bar review coming up here pretty soon so wait on that one it's red I like red so that's fun and then of course I did wear my favorite running shoes the Brooks ghost at the moment I'm wearing the purple ones and they are fantastic my runs during the week I do I'm running right now about three days a week outside anywhere between four to eight miles depending on the day and I am doing some sprints trying to get some speed back hopefully as some of the excess weight that I've gained comes off the speed will come back a little bit more and I'll talk about that a touch more later on in the video I'm currently working out six days a week I'm weightlifting four days a week there is some overlap on cardio and weights and I am loving the way it's making me feel right now okay I'm done with my stretching and I am like desperate for a shower right now but I'm pretty hungry so I'm gonna eat my breakfast until I just want something super super fast that will fill me up and I don't have to worry about so I'm gonna do one packet of this oatmeal right here this is the maple and brown sugar steel-cut oats microwave packet 160 calories actually really like these and one serving of a whey protein shake this is chocolate cellucor brand just like molten chocolate um so I can have some protein as well to help me feel full longer so this has like the fiber and the carbs that I need punished after the run and this one's got the protein to make me feel full so I'm gonna scarf these really really fast with the big lots of water and then hop in the shower and I will see you after that here are the oats I put them in a really really big bowl so it is actually a full packet it just looks really small and this bowl there's my protein shake always delicious and of course had to go with my crystal like pure energy strawberry lemonade you pick it up on it today's eating to be very like quick I was in a meeting and it went kind of long and so I'm really really hungry right now so I got out the leftover fajita chicken and veggies from dinner last night put it in this very very large bowl this is probably six ounces of chicken with peppers and onions I added one and a half ounces of cheddar cheese and a big dollop of sour cream so I'm gonna eat this with a big glass of water right there and I'm gonna see how I feel so if I'm hungry after this I will eat something else but if I'm not I won't it smells really good and pretty excited about it I could have put it on a tortilla but I actually really like it just like this I love fajitas yourself it is I'm still a little hungry someone to eat this brownie that one this edge piece because I don't eat dessert every day or even multiple times a day but hey if I have to go through like life without desserts ever that's not a life I want so I will be eating this right now I just finished my lunch some I eat this finish my water and we should be good lunch is over and we are headed to do Haley's driving test today skills test wishes luck if we can get through this we can set the appointment for her to get her license which probably won't be for another week but hey one step at a time guys one step at a time we're here we're waiting for our tester guy to show up or right next to his car I have all of the documentation proof of insurance Haley's permits with better being here you check ok this registration the money so we have all of the things so while I'm sitting here right now what I'm gonna do is tell you guys about as we've dealt with this stressful driving situation it's the perfect time to segue into Ned CBD oil who I have partnered with

Colorado I've been doing their period blend CBD oil it has some other essential oils and things in it and Dave's been doing the traditional CBD oil and I have mentioned before the body butter and what's the period lotion so like the salve am I saying it right that came with the hormonal blend okay so check this out Dave's knees were achy and he rubbed it on his knees and it totally worked he

he's here we are back from the test and I don't remember the last thing I said to you but she passed and he let her slide on a couple of things I think because she took the test in a stick he was like I'm really really impressed that you would take the test in a stick but I think one of the things was she didn't signal for a turn early enough he was so nice like he wasn't mean at all but it was like I just like to remind you that blah blah blah anyway so she passed and we are moving on to the appointment at the driver's license office which we can't do until next week I couldn't even call make the appointment today because they're closed today because they're moving to a new location so they're moving everything today so I can't call for a couple days and I know this video is supposed to be about like snacks and food and things like that it's also gonna kind of be a vlog I'm gonna talk about right now is why I personally would like to get back down to let's say my like normal weight there's the reasons are threefold number one when you are an athlete who does sport performance running cycling triathlons like that your weight affects how fast you are right now I'm trying to like get back into running shape I'm considering a marathon but right now it's not going very well so imagine trying to run a 5k which is 3 3.1 miles with a 10 pound backpack on is essentially what I'm talking about if you take off the 10 pound backpack you're faster because you have to move less mass right and so I do approach it as a sport performance issue typically during racing season I always cut 5 to 8 pounds anyway just to assist me in my speed and ability to climb my body and bike up hills better my engine doesn't have to work as hard right if you want to relate it to a car analogy so that's one thing number two is always been an athlete a lifelong athlete played sports my whole life I like on me a muscular look it's not necessarily about being like skinny in fact I would prefer to be a little curvier with like and a little heavier with ball muscles then weigh less and just be skinny for my body type I like the look of muscles on me so I have to lift weights and exercise to gain and keep my muscles and then also I do have to lower my overall body fat so you can then see the muscles and then the last reason which is totally a vein issue is that my pants don't fit very well they're a little tight they're harder to button and that's really it like I just don't want to go out and buying a whole new wardrobe that's all there is to it when it comes to like running clothes or you know like when you look at yourself out of the shower or whatever truthfully I don't think there's anything wrong with the way I look I don't think I look bad I just want to look more muscular and have it be easier to run and have my pants better and that's really it Haley and I did run to the store so I'm gonna record that haul separately you'll see that in a different video you'll probably have already seen it actually but I am gonna get a snack based off some of the stuff that I just got so let me record that and then we'll come back and I'll show you my next snack here's my snack it actually looks really sad but I cut up one of the nectarines they're really small it's almost like a snack size so in the future I'll probably eat two and a string cheese it's like man the name of the game today is like quick and easy I am Telling You string cheese nectarine Oh delicious okay we go do it what it's a little tart but okay I'm gonna have more of these after dinner I love nectarines mmm holy smokes I'm telling you I do like don't even need candy when these are around these are better than candy so good okay I'm gonna start making dinner in just a minute but before I do that I want to show you guys my Amazon subscribe and save order that just came today you guys do that I've been doing it for years you can get a really good deal if you get the five items and get the 15% off and then you buy items that have coupons as well it's typically how I get my protein powder so I'll get the protein powder with like 30% off plus the 15% so it's like 45% off well so good okay I actually didn't want very much this time so I got a couple of new flavors I'll have the Crystal Light energy this one I can get at my regular store but these I cannot didn't really save a ton of money it was just new flavors that I haven't had before the cherry splash and the tropical punch so there's three of my items I am trying out this well both of these like isolate protein powders for Dave we're trying to see if maybe the isolate works better for him or whatever so this one's for me because look it's birthday cake flavor can you believe that so I'm gonna have to maybe I'll try this after a bedtime snack or something I will try it out but here are the stats one serving is 110 calories one carb and 25 grams of protein this one we got chocolate peanut butter because I really like the peanut butter flavours approach powder it cuts like the over sweet flavor I feel like so this is 71 servings this is a huge five-pound container and stats are pretty much the same I've got two grams of carbs hundred twenty calories and 25 grams protein in one scoop chocolate peanut butter and birthday cake flavors and then my little crystal lights so who's like all drinks this time woohoo alright here's my dinner sorry about the noise the air fryers going I'm making some okra in the airfryer so I'll probably have that when it's done it's just not done yet everybody else is having these chicken and black bean and rice burritos and I am having the same I'm just not putting it on tortillas I did a really really small little salad with grape tomatoes over here on the side you know what I'm gonna have more Tomatoes I love Tomatoes and I would do a cucumber but I'm feeling lazy so we'll just do that and the okras coming too so I have about a half a half a cup of cooked rice down in there with I would say at least over a cup of this black bean and chicken mixture with this adobo sauce and a little bit of cheese on top and I'm just gonna kind of mix it all up and eat it with boredom so everybody else is having it wrapped up like that and I'm just eating mine in a bowl okay my okra is finished cooking and I think I'm gonna eat I don't know how many this is probably a cup ish really a cup a cup and a half it's a cup and a half of okra and it's really really hot so I can't really touch it I may or may not eat this whole thing I'm not sure if I do no problem and if I don't no problem I'm just gonna eat them until I'm not hungry anymore cuz I'm still gonna hunker okay I'm done I would say I ate half of that so I'm gonna stop there but I still think I'm probably gonna eat something later it's about 6:45 I like eat one more okay it's about 6:40 6:45 and I'll probably have a snack in like an hour or two look I'm really really trying to cut quickly as far as body fat goes I'll stop eating after dinner I just won't eat anything until the next morning and if I feel hungry I'll have a flavored water just cuz it tastes good it feels like I'm putting something in my stomach but because I feel like I didn't really eat a whole lot at the beginning of the day like breakfast felt small to me and lunch was like small and quick I find when I eat less processed foods like I focus more on things I've made myself for clean proteins vegetables that I'm more hungry more often and because the calorie content of all these homemade things are lower than like a burger or whatever your overall daily calorie intake is significantly less I'm just trying to make healthy choices when I do eat so like for the dinner tonight everybody else had theirs on a on a tortilla and I was like well I don't need the extra calories of a tortilla so I'll just have a salad on the side with some fruit afterwards which I'll probably have cuz that nectarine was so good but clearly I have no issues with like carbs or anything I'm eating rice and beans and fruit and stuff so and because I am in a more of an endurance athlete carbs for me are good like you'll often see me with some gummy bears or Swedish fish on a long run because you need the sugar like right now promise the kids that we would watch the second season of stranger things and so I'm going to log into my bed Angell accounts I can edit out all the bad language and if there's any adult content which actually really like they do not sponsor me but that would be cool if they did because I'm a really big fan it's made me feel a lot more okay with showing my kids a lot of different movies that I wouldn't been okay with otherwise so we're gonna go do that it's an hour episode or like 45 minutes we'll have like a snack number 562 you know when you're scrolling on your phone on Facebook well you're not scrolling on your phone you're scrolling on Facebook and they have those like little video snippets so I saw once a day and my brain just exploded oh I was today years old when I found out that you can cut a watermelon with dental floss oh my gosh my world has changed I need to go buy at watermelon tomorrow you try this out Wow like whoa wow my hair looks really weird it was mushed on the couch for a while I need to finish off this day of eating cuz wow it's nine o'clock and the two little boys are in bed what are you doing with that Hayley's gonna eat hey what what Wow Hayley is going to eat an Abel Abel no it's Abel for sure it's Abel for sure I'm like really thirsty so I'm feeling some liquids at the moment so I might even actually get my snack this nectarine sounds so good but I'm so thirsty I think I'm gonna do a crystal light like with a really big cup of water and water it down and just like hydrate cuz I'm feeling you know what I mean like you super thirsty so I'm really just gonna drink something I think I'm not really feeling hungry right now an apple a day keeps the virus away so if you guys want to know about the calories and all of the macronutrient breakdowns from what I had today I'll put that like over here I actually didn't calculate it out at all so I'm gonna have to total it up right now with my phone I use just using my Fitness Pal app and type everything in the most important part is being like really accurate with what you ate I'm not saying that these are the calories that you to eat and I'm not saying these are the calories that I eat every day some days I go way high and some days I'm just not as hungry and I go lower it's all over the place and most of the time honestly I don't track it that much I just try make semi good choices while enjoying life and not feeling hungry I've been kind of being more careful with my food choices like cutting out all the desserts and I may have been John some cookies a few many times a day during the lockdown to make myself feel better and so I've cut that out so I will say just in the last week and a half of like just being more careful I have already dropped like three and a half pounds of the about seven pounds that I had gained before and then I'll get back down to my normal pants and everything will be fine I may go to a couple more pounds below that like I said earlier in the video really about sports performance and running faster more than anything else I'm gonna finish up this video here I think because it's nine o'clock and I want to watch one episode of Supernatural with Haley before I go to sleep so I'm gonna go do that thanks for hanging out with me feel free to ask me any other questions about like checking your food or food choices or you know whatever you want in the comments and I'll hang out and answer those if you'd like to click on the screen if you want to see any other stuff I've done or if you want to sub or and I'm gonna go to bed so goodnight goodbye you turn it off videos over to go to your home don't you want to go to your home", "8SysMSl7Svc": "hey everyone so I just wanted to share with you guys a really quick easy healthy yummy recipe this is almost it's so simple that I feel kind of silly even doing a video on it but I feel like you know if you guys don't know about this and you are wanting some more healthy snack ideas this is a really good one to add to your pile because these are really really delicious and so what today is just some candied frozen grapes and all you need for this is some grapes which I have mine right here you just want to rinse them good and I have them in my little colander and then I just let them dry a little bit yeah but you still want them to be slightly wet so don't try them completely and then in this bowl you can use any flavor of jell-o that you would like but I have found that I like the blue raspberry or berry jell-o is the best with these and I also really like it the best with green grapes but you can experiment and see what you like the best so then you're just gonna pour some of your grapes once you have your grapes in your jello make sure you're just going to roll them around and get them all covered in the mixture and then you're going to put them in a ziploc bag or an airtight container and put them in your freezer and then you can just munch on them and they're super good this is what they look like when they're all ready to go in the freezer they're just lightly covered with the jello powder and then like I said you just stick them in the freezer and let them freeze so you want to let them freeze for at least a few hours if not overnight and then you can just munch on them and they're really good they taste like candy and Colton wants them but they're not frozen yet so I hope you guys enjoy this if you try it", "cypKvwejuQ4": "hey welcome back today i made snickerdoodles but there's wheat in it i didn't get this recipe from any one place i noticed most of the snickerdoodle recipes on the internet are about the same one so here is a general snickerdoodle recipe and i'll show you how i made 16 cookies with about 40 milligrams each first i'm weighing out my weed i'm hoping for about 640 milligrams in my whole batch and here's the equation i used for dosing next i set my oven to 240 and while that's preheating i'm going to start breaking up my weed i don't grind it because i noticed the flavor of the weed comes through a lot more when you do grind it so i just break my nugs up into smaller pieces then i put this in the oven for about 35 minutes and start melting my butter in a saucepan i'm adding 3 4 cup of butter and half a cup of water the water is to help regulate the temperature while the butter cooks i'm melting this on a very low heat and allowing the butter to slowly get to about 190 degrees i want to make sure it's at that steady 185 to 200 degree range before i'm adding in my decarb weed i stir this in and i'm going to cook this for a total of about two and a half hours to three hours i am going to be checking the temperature and giving this a stir every 30 minutes or so to make sure it's staying in that 185 to 200 degree range throughout the cooking process when it's finished cooking i just strain out the weed obviously the finer mesh you have the less weed particles will end up in your butter you can see that the layers are already starting to form but i usually just throw a lid on this and put it into my fridge to make that butter layer harden a little bit quicker about two hours later you can see that the butter has completely solidified on top of that water so i just use a knife to cut that and then remove the butter from the container i like to weigh my butter at the end so that i have an accurate idea of how much butter i'm putting into the recipes but also to help with more accurate dosing i left my butter out for a little while after this so that it could soften i am just going to cream this butter before i add in my other ingredients if you have an electric mixer i would encourage you to use it but if not you just want it to look about like this then you'll add in 3 4 cup of sugar and cream that together you do want to make sure you're whisking a lot of air into this batter so you're going to be beating this for a good minute when this looks very light and fluffy you're ready for your other wet ingredients i'm adding one egg and one teaspoon of vanilla then whisking until that is fully incorporated next i'm mixing my dry ingredients so to my flour i'm adding a teaspoon of cream of tartar half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt and then just mixing to combine when that is well mixed i'm going to start incorporating it into my wet ingredients i'm doing this a little bit out of time just to try to avoid a mess and to make it a little bit easier to stir but if you have a stand mixer you can probably just throw all of your flour in there at once i'm using a whisk to try to keep a lot of air in the batter but you'll see that even when it's finished it is a really light and sticky batter so we'll have to put that into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to let it stiffen up before we start making our dough balls you can use a cookie scoop or do what i'm doing and just use a spoon and shape the balls with your hand ideally we'll have 16 evenly sized dough balls out of this but that is kind of hard to do so i do recommend shaping all of your balls before you roll them in the cinnamon sugar for that reason you'll see that i have 13 of them and they're not super evenly sized so i ended up pinching pieces off of the bigger balls to try to make enough small balls so that i had 16 roughly evenly sized cookie dough balls ready to go next we'll prepare our cinnamon sugar so i'm just adding half a cup of sugar and two heaping teaspoons of cinnamon and then mixing this until it is completely combined next we'll cover each of our dough balls in this cinnamon sugar mixture i'm just rolling them around in it and kind of using my hands to press the sugar into the dough to make sure it's getting in all of the cracks since we've been touching them so much i do want to put them back into the fridge for about 20 more minutes to get cold again before we bake them i set my oven to 350 and when that is ready i will add my cookies and bake them for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they're just done you don't want them to be a dark brown color but they should look about like this when they're finished as i said these should be about 40 milligrams each but with homemade edibles it is hard to tell i recommend starting with half if you're unsure and keep in mind that it can take up to two to three hours for edibles to fully kick in let me know what you thought of this recipe and video in the comments if you try making it at home i would love to see pictures you can find me on instagram and as always thank you so much for watching", "yAoWytEBy_E": "good morning everybody Connecticut medical marijuana critic here how are you today good to see you as always today I'm talking about the AG elves H macaroons if you have not purchased them I would suggest you to do so for two a container ten milligrams of THC per macaroon if you like the taste of Nutella you want this because that's what they use in it that's right do tell them now I'm gonna show you what they look like I got in just the case ones out there who haven't seen them they're lovely delectable little morsels these are strong I am going to tell you that yes I said ten milligrams and I know some people are probably gonna be like oh that's nothing okay well one of these ten milligram macaroons knocked this boy out the other night when I had one at the end of the night oh yeah I wouldn't suggest eating a whole if you're new to medals eat a half they even suggest on some of the websites through the dispensaries to weight in excess of over an hour hour and 15 minutes hour and a half hour then eat the other half all right I mean they're good they're strong prices are okay for to a container and they're $39 so kept eat it here you try see", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "wtZa9dIqAEg": "bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim assalamu alayka wa rahmatullah wa barakatu my dear students today I'm going to talk about nasal polyps and I'm sure you know what nasal polyps are but still you what if you ask me the definition of it a nasal polyp is the pedunculated swelling of the nasal mucosa and the sinuses now to show you through an example a normal nasal polyp is a bit pedunculated swelling now peduncle what do you understand by Polanco a peduncle is a pedicle and I just to show you an example I have all this partially inflated balloon and you may be able to understand through this balloon what I'm trying to tell you now I'm not telling you that a normal nasal polyp looks like green color balloon but since that was the only thing I could get my hands on at the present time so just forget about its color normal nasal polyps are usually pale in color they're neither red nor green or blue the just pale color or Gration color so this imagine this partially inflated balloon as a nasal polyp which is a swelling with the pedicle do you see it this if you imagine as a pedicle this is the body of the polyp okay so let's just go ahead with further classification of nasal polyps bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim assalamu alaykum my dear students today I'm going to talk about nasal polyps a nasal polyp is defined as the pedunculated swelling of the nasal or sinus mikasa it's a great like swelling with the body and his talk hanging loosely in the nasal cavity when the types of nasal polyps can be divided into two the ethmoidal polyps also called an allergic nasal polyps and the second type is anthraquinone now talking about ethmoidal polyps if Marnell polyps are multiple bilateral pee grape like swellings which arise from the ethmoidal sinuses and present in the middle may time they are insensitive to touch and don't bleed on touch etiology of the causes of nasal polyps can be meant multifactorial various diseases associated with the formation of nasal polyps are chronic rhinosinusitis katanas syndrome cystic fibrosis asthma aspirin intolerance allergic fungal sinusitis young syndrome Chuck Stroud syndrome nasal mastocytosis while the pathogenesis of penicillin can be like that well the nasal mucosa becomes intimate is due to collection of extracellular fluid which gives rise to polypoid all change which in turn produces a society of and that Polly later on becomes pedunculated swelling and a pedunculated Polly due to gravity and excessive sneezing now the site of origin of ethmoidal polyps its moral policies you know multiple nasal polyps they always arise from the little wall of the nose usually from the middle meatus where the common sites in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity or uncinate process bula ethmoid alleys osteo sinuses and medial surface and edge of middle turbinate symptoms that can arise because of ethmoidal nasal polyps can be very many the first symptom can be nasal airway obstruction while first nasal discharge the post nasal drip headache rhinorrhea sneezing hypo smear or anosmia which is decreased sense of smell or loss of sense of smell and it's narrower science of its moral nasal polyps on interior in escaping polyps appear as smooth glistening grape like masses often pale in color often multiple and bilateral maybe sessile or pedunculated insensitive touch and they don't often bleed on touch while long is tending cases of Himalayan polyps may give rise to a broadening of nose which so much so that it can recall as frog face and increased into canceled distance while a polyp ethmoidal polyps may protrude from the nostril and appear pink and vascular stimulating oh sorry simulating neoplasms purulent discharge can also occur due to Associated sinusitis now in a case of polyposis comes to us laboratory investigations which can be done in such cases apart from the routine clinical examination we've got a routine blood examination which is a blood CP then theological radio and large assortment tests also called rasa tests allergic skin testing for those who are having polyp associated with allergic rhinitis sweat clara test which is genetic or and also genetic testing for cystic fibrosis in any child with multiple benign nasal polyps nasal smear is no fills may differentiate and learned it from non-allergic sinus diseases while biopsy from the polyp after evaluation by CT scan and MRI now we come to the treatment of viral polyps treatment first of all can be medical if the patient has not already tried a treatment and the nasal obstruction is not a complete sort of obstruction there is some room for the nasal drops to go in then we try into nasal corticosteroids which can be in the form of normally used into lazily steroids ah usually Beckler mythos on suck listen I flew nice alight fluticasone propionate fluticasone thyroid mometasone thyroid triamcinolone acetylide well if the polyps are very many and causing a lot of problem to the patient and if there is no if there is no contraindication to systemic corticosteroids then one may try systemic corticosteroids in the patient as well which can be given as tablets and depo injections oral prednisone can be given at 25 milligram daily for 10 to 15 days as a depo injection corresponds hundred milligram of prednisolone it may serve as a medical polypectomy well if the patient does not get better on medical treatment or if the medical treatment is not appropriate for the particular patient then one ops the surgical treatment and that is in the form of a nasal polyp ectomy to start with in that case in bilateral ethmoidal polyps one tries by little its marginal polyps polypectomy also called nasal polyp ectomy there can be done under a local anesthetic or sometimes a general anesthetic while intranasal it might ectomy is usually done in those cases which are usually recurrent and the polyps not getting better on simple nasal polyp ectomy then when goes up and twice removal of it white sinuses as well and that is partially Tomoya tectum II can be done through the international route if that does not help or if intranasal it's wide ectomy is not advisable in that particular patient one can try extra lazily tried ectomy which is an incision on the face which then goes towards the ethmoid sinuses directly and then the sinuses is whites are removed Tran central it's my dictum II usually tried when the maxillary sinuses were also involved in the polyps one removes the palate from the maxillary sinus and then goes towards the eighth white and there's tooth do that is annoyed ectomy while functional endoscopic sinus surgery also called fests operation is usually tried nowadays sparing it might ectomy through the transom to root or the intranasal is marred ectomy route avoiding external incisions now we come to talk about intracranial poly an intracranial polyp as the name implies is the pollak which arises from the maxillary sinus Mike Hauser mirus accessory ostium comes out of it and grows into the nasal cavity forming its nasal part continues to grow to worse the nasal pharynx through the corner where it further enlarges to form its quaint part as you can see it in the picture it's ology of an entrepreneur Paulette is not exactly known so exact causes unknown while nasal allergy along with sinus infection is usually incriminated seen in turret young adults usually single and unilateral as you can see on the CT scan there is a left-sided maxillary sinus capacity along with the pasty going to where's the nasal cavity as well the site of origin of intracranial polyp it arises from the MCOs of maxillary antrum near its accessory yas chip comes out of it and grows in the Queen er and nasal cavity thus it has three parts aunt ro which is got a thin is talked the cranial part which is round and globular and nasal part is fled from side to side symptoms of an trochoidal polyp can be unilateral to starve it unilateral nasal obstruction but when the Polly grows large in size by lateral nasal obstruction occur as well when Polly grows into the nasal pharynx and it starts obstructing the opposite Craner it causes a bilateral nasal obstruction thick and dull voice may occur due is also called - easily T where nasal discharge would be become mostly mu quiet and thick now science of intracranial polyp and posterior Rhino stripping it's a globular mass filling the Craner or the nasal pharynx a large polyp me hang down behind soft palate and present in our pharynx treatment of intracranial Polly is usually surgical when he both says the poly removes it through the nasal root or / route while recurrence is uncommon after complete removal coal will look operation is done usually in case of recurrence which removes completely the polyp for me from exciter for it while functional endoscopic sinus surgery is now preferred to doing a call we'll look operation now this compares the ethmoidal polyps with an trochoidal pipe as far as this slide is concerned one can talk about the age it's marble polyps are usually common in adults and two koi no polyp is common in children while etiology energy or multifocal in cases of it's morning polyps an antiquated polyp is usually said to be due to infection number of polyps is marts multiple while enter corner polyp usually solitary neutrality of the polyps in it works bilateral in case of its modal polyps while internal polyps usually in electron and in rare cases it can be by electro - origin of each model polyp is it - sinuses while the intracranial arises from the maxillary sinus near its accessory Austin growth mostly anteriorly and may present at the nares in cases of its modal polit where's aunt Roca Nepali grows backwards to Queen may hang down behind soft palate size and shape of the  in it vital polyp cases usually they are small and great like while Antron polyp is a tri lobe structure with antral basil and kweilyn power recurrence is quite common in its modern polyps while it's uncommon in cases of intracranial polyp if that has been removed completely treatment of with model polyp can be nasal polyp ectomy or face operation which is again functional endoscopic sinus surgery or in the current cases can be due to candy it's wide ectomy operations while entra coral polyp one removes through the nerves it well since the poly or it can't be done through the endoscopes with fast operation which is functional and the skopic sinus surgery again now talking about differential diagnosis of polyps one can have a blob of Mekas looking like a polyp which usually disappears on playing the nerves whereas hypertrophic middle turbinates usually appear pink and there the heart feel of bone on protesting and the probe usually does not go around the terminates whereas if it's an angio fibroma history of profuse recurrent epistaxis may be there and it's firm in a consistency and it easily blades on touch where it's new plasmons usually fleshy and pink in appearance and there friable in nature and they have a tendency to bleed now differential diagnosis one can talk about following are the unilateral swellings in the nasal cavity that may mimic polyps but they are not true politic hence such ambiguous swellings must be investigated properly before creating them and careful o sill or Menninger and capella sealed in newborns and infants gliomas in newborns and infants benign neoplasms for example juvenile nasopharyngeal and geo fibroma which bleeds on touch easily inverted papilloma and malignant tumors usually fleshy pink polypoid on swellings which may bleed on touch but that was all of that nasal polyps thank you very much", "9WdGsywzm-Q": "chennai it's still in tamil nadu and he is now the national eb member of tamilnadu branch of iap and one of the most popular most popular teacher and speaker from tamil nadu on on behalf of indian academy pediatrics kerala and calicut i welcome you sir for this cme program over to palindrome sir to introduce the speaker and as a moderator of this program very very very good evening my dear friends first of all i thank iap calicut and my close friend and classmate dr vijay kumar for giving this pleasant duty of introducing dr tangavelu it's really a proud moment and privilege for me to introduce such a great person whom i know furthermore for more than two decades in my life really i was gifted to be with him for the for the past two decades and so accounted with him such a very nice human being he is the third number number one the first and foremost is the one of the wonderful human being and best human being you can see in your lifetime number one then coming to the professional aspects he started his mbbs from tunnel valley medical college in 1973 batch then after completing his mbbs he had a very good rural service and he did a dch in 1982 from ich then in 89 and gradually he progressed in his professional career one by one one by one and finally mrcpch in 1998 from uk there where he had been to uk and passed the mrcpch and he like an academic platform gradually he raised from the bottom to the top in the same way he worked from the basic to the top for example he worked in the primary health center for nearly more than 10 years in district hospital for many years then the tertiary care centers and the top tertiary care centers even in saudi arabia so he knows the difficulties of for as a primary doctor in a primary health center to the top because he has worked in all the levels with a lot of experience from the beginning to the end so that is his speciality so he knows the difficulties at each level what a pediatrician faces what a practitioner faces this is the next thing and coming to the creeds he has done in his career at institute of child health where he started his career in 1999 as a dermatologist he also he's added around nearly he started diabetic clinic and nearly around 400 students 400 journal diabetes has been enrolled in a period of 10 years from the year 2000 he entered into the intensive care arena and because he was very much actually again very much has a test here towards intensive care and he did a very good internship job in saudi arabia so our institute wanted to actually take him into the intensive care and from 2001 he was an intensivist so far till till date he is one of the great intensivist and very good intensive care lessons we get it creative from him so any doubt with respect to intensive care or any intense acute emergencies we used to call him for any poisonings we used to call him even in the midnight he is such a person he will immediately respond to the calls for any pediatrician who entered into that thing into their professional life even yesterday also such is the great speciality of him and he won all the awards from the basic to the thing he had did the top most award of iron order aryana variation award in the tamil nadu that is the top most award and he achieved the best doctor award as a best teacher award from mgr university and all that and you i think i am sure you all will enjoy each and every person from the rural place to the tertiary institute will enjoy his lecture because it will be applicable to each and every one that is his specialty and every time he use a lecture it will be applicable the next day when you go to the thing it will be very applicable and usually his approach will be always to rule out the serious thing first then come to the second thing and then finally the benign things this approach is very easy to follow and another now the stage is your sir now i am really hope you all will be enjoying this lecture next to one hour is yourself thank you sir thank you very much for a very nice introduction most of the time you will introduce more than what they really deserve thank you very much for that thank you mohandas all the av functionalities and vision movements and everyone and that parvati and all the senior teachers i'm really happy to see you all here with this i'll just start my lecture good evening everyone our medical college days we used to classify the disease as congenital traumatic infection and malignancy later two more categories had that polynomial are able to see and hear me yes sir yes sir even slide yes the slides are visible go ahead sir okay so now two things more are added later in the last two three decades one is exogenous toxin which is labeled as poisoning or toxicology and the poison has inborn era metabolism so next one we are going to discuss about toxicology case scenarios and what all we learned from this this is the team of uh psu from icg h matas medical college scope of the talk i'm going to talk about ten commandments what i learned case scenarios learning points prevention one slide about poison information center snake bite and scarf instinct are not covered here because they form a separate topic by themselves why should i learn about poisoning mainly almost a third cause of period in any periodic emergency is poisoning like if you take alternative consciousness next to injury traumatic brain injury infection exogenous intoxication indigenous toxic that is inborn and metabolism are the causes for intervalopathy what else generally they declare after poisoning no they they say they proudly say that i consumed organophosphorous i consumed alcohol it comes with they declare and come the very purpose is to declare the world a child comes in silence with an emergency it's up to us to recognize the poisoning as a cause of the emergence otherwise totally will miss the problem when to suspect poisoning in children when there is a vacuum industry for example if you take a child develops monday fever and cough wednesday year discharge thursday's seizures and alter level of conscious means it means probably we are being a child with cns infection and other kind of child comes suddenly with seizure alter consciousness think about poisoning a child may start with the fever and cough by third day breathlessness that could be pneumonia but a child starts with the fast breathing without any fever or cough again you think about the parasite because that may be a reason why metabolic acid was due to poisoning whenever there is no one can add in the sequences mother could not give any history all along he was normal in the morning and suddenly in the evening is very sick means very high possibility is poisoning one confession is i'm not a toxicologist a simple pediatrician developed interesting toxicology after seeing so many sick kids in pico ych channel it's very tragic things midday meal tragedy 20 july 2013 23 children died after consuming the midday meals because the contamination of pesticides in the in the food preparation again in bhopal tragedy october 1984 more than 5000 deaths 2.5 lakh victims still the problems are not solved parsing of the whole city m is a gas leak for young students are in pediatrician just a pre-test you just note down your answers then we will check with the posters name two poisons where oxygen saturation may be normal saturation is considered the fifth vital sign name two poison where the saturation is normal name two toxins that can cause seizures without hypoglycemia tell one toxin which can cause death even after 10 days and one toxin which can cause death even within 30 minutes of consumption what is saturation gap what is the atrial and ventricular rate in ecg this is a pretest we will discuss in the last slide this is one of the very interesting lessons i learned we of course we make mistakes we do good things and from that we learn a lot of lessons so the lessons i learned is periodic toxicology thriller movie children don't declare it's up to us to identify them from common emergencies crystal station is universal key for all locks any sick child resistance alone can save the child even if you don't identify as a poisoning toxin is than toxicology which is not easily available nowadays and is expensive most of the time the second differential diagnosis in the list will be the correct one second interview will be most rewarding you have to anticipate your future because prepared for unknown future toxins we know nobody imagined that 2020 is going to be fully with kobe 19 nobody even anticipated in 2018 or 19. there are a lot of poisons the future toxins surprising anti-doors and fire extinguishers what is the comparison contrast between them intensives should have an eye on every side like sherlock holmes newer interventions for the older melodies document for the future generation document oliver case future generation may be useful for our own self too with this what are the recognition management various steps are i'm just now i'm not following the routine i'm just going into the case and before that i just give some introductory slides it is sustained a child assessed and receives a child paste and false assessments recognize by focused history and examination recognize a type of poison do the decontamination identify the toxidrome and identify the price and give antidote monitor the child carefully and before discharge of course you have to educate the parents at the time of admission we had to make a medical real entry so these two are very important legal steps for us starting the first case in a year this is a 14 year old girl returned from school at 4pm and the mother is a single parent returned from work saw her unconscious and convincing at 9pm the neighbors told that she returned at 4 pm from the school 9 pm she was convulsing referred is very still bleed because child vomited a reddish colored fluid child came and caught about my failure status epileptic as abc stabilized intubator and ventilated next question comes what is the disease-based diagnosis is it a variable bleeding variation bleeding is not cannot cause alter concentration convulsions whenever we come across a child who suddenly develops seizure alter consciousness think of these five things rule of fire unidentified injury unwitters decisions envenomation poisoning and cerebral vertical accidents here there is no injury because at six hours gap she was lying down in the bed not in an unusual situation so injury is less likely we can get only the clue from the environmental unmeters t-shirt is possible she would have developed seizure now going for status of liberty environment is unlikely because our residence was in fourth floor this is not a way of presentation of scotland in munitions or snake bite poisoning is very very likely because it is a single parent unsupervised child forever she was alone server was also possible but after stabilization we did the ct ct was normal that exclude trauma and cervical accident leaving and only with poisoning our status of obliques so if we take poisoning when we start analyzing poisoning poisoning can be due causing seizures can be due to the household poison like camphor neem oil opc gamoxin insecticides or medicines medicine can present hypoglycemia as an overall hypocrisy agent or beta blocker high blood sugar in inh and theophylline normal and sugar and tricycle antidepressant when you examined the child the child had metabolic acidosis hyperglycemia elevator received cpt so when we analyzed the child the child had hypoglycemia convulsions and hyperglycemia the triad biochemical try to be identified when we analyze the individual poisons toxin with hypoglycemia may be oral hypoglycemic agent toxin plus hypoglycemia and bradycardia maybe beta blocker toxin injection plus particular tachycardia and dilated people may be a tricycle antidepressant the toxin ingestion plus hyperglycemia metabolic acidosis high transformation may point to diagnosed identity we don't know the diagnosis the whole night today the treating team was working up to identify them one side after stabilizing the child they were trying to identify the problem going through all these flow charts in the meantime nurse called and showed this picture this is a gastric aspirate it's a reddish fluid urine sample also have a red color any diagnosis 5 to 10 seconds i can wait any diagnosis at this stage any any chat box you should move in anything in the answer in the chat box yes you may be correct serum and gastric acid was sent for the tbr hospital showed inh and refurbished it inh caused the convulsions reformist and gave the color the classical triad of nh poisoning is metabolic acidosis hyperglycemia and states of lifting reform is an added color to this that's what after she recovered she told that she has taken around 35 tablets our reform is an image so isoniazid poisoning coming to the poisoning the child present in a very sick stage with convulsions that that means child has consumed at least 70 milligram per kg that is a potentially fatal dose treatment is supportive treatment plus antidote is iv pyridoxine so iv paradox is not greatly available even now so we gave iem pyridoxine and then we crushed the pyrodoxine tablet and gave through nasogastic tube 36 hours of ventilation she completely recovered he could successfully extubate her after 36 hours with anti-convulsants paradox in i.m and oral through ngt about three grams of pilot oxygen will give so paid often has to be given like a tullabar no weight by weight so 70 milligram per kg means child is weighing around 40 kg so we have to give 2.8 milligram of finer should consume means we have to give 2.8 grams of pyridoxine we have to give so that's what we gave the lesson learned from this case is whenever you face a puzzling emergency one side the treatment team has to resuscitate the child and stabilize the child in the team you have to select one young hard working resident give a workout he should not be in he or she should not be involved in that management team should sit alone analyze see the books browse the net and try to identify the underlying cause for few hours in fact the chief can divide him with a good day up for him that is because you're not involved in the management team that's what we learned so pediatric toxicology thriller movie resuscitation is a universal key for all locks this is a mother and two children with suspicion of poisoning mother had been in a different hospital child had excessive salivation anxiety considered people bradycardia and muscle picture you can just say look at the video what are the possible diagnosis so suspicion is opc consecutive people teaching but gastric lavage did not reveal any any smell or suggest you off so looks everything looks like opacity poisoning but gastric lava didn't reveal anything of course it can present masculine effects decoding effects and cns effects clinical confirmation pollinators estimation will be the biochemical confirmation all of us know about this i can go a little faster so based on the quick severe tests by wh we can classify them as severe moderate and mild severe mean child unconscious recurring intubation moderate means conscious but anxious need only oxygen mild even child comes walking with abdominal pain and vomiting so our child comes under moderate risk the two kids comes under moderate risk you manage a child with skin and g d contamination give oxygen iv atropine p2 am 30 milligram per kg even though it is controversial but majority follow p2a 30 to 40 milligram kd over 30 minutes we can repeat the second dose after eight hours glycoparallel can be given if the child has atropine toxicity like tachycardia delirium but we should remember that does not control the anti-colonies effect in the cns we have to carefully monitor the respiration as the need for respiratory support we should indicate the child to child develop lacit paralysis or respiratory failure but to continue attribute targeting and drying of the secretion stop whenever the child develops toxic features certain drugs are counterintuitive aminophylline morphine scolin are contraindicated in the presence of opc poisoning colon will cause prolonged respiratory muscle weakness so it should not be used we have to use the chronium muscle reactions in carbamine generally p2m is not indicated because it's a reversible opc but how to identify fortunately most of them that they name the carbomate either as with this trade names buffoon car aldi car carbaryl so car will be there is a prefix that postfix if you identify carb we need not give uh p2am don't think that pesticides are available in the rural areas in our own cities we can help opc in our daily practice the surface and roof racer like it sprays made for cockroaches headlights shampoos pet versions they're all our opc products so learning point is coming back even though it is opc by saying why this stomach did not reveal anything but the toxic room says that it is opc now what we identified later is when these kids and mother recovered mother told that she has injected the poison into her thighs she used to give insulin injection to a father so stick opc and injected to all the kids and she also consumed that is why we don't have any smell so whenever the features are confusing consider alternate toxins are altering truths here we have to consider the alternate route instead of overall iam was given so toxidrome is superior than toxicology are safe seven year old boy on the on the way back back home he and his sister was coming back from the school on the way he saw a chocolate like substance kept over the wall of one of the bridges he consumed that despite his sister's objection remember the happy women's day hours in 8th march we used to tell everybody that they always used to listen to a woman who is available with you mother or sister or wife it's always safer to listen to a woman despite her sister's objection she consumed he consumed it and landed in ich er with bradycardia consider people gtcs and hyper salivation so commonness because they consider people is opc the first one second is opiate phenomenopia we don't see very commonly so the child was empirically treated as obc by sending next to all of us but there was no response and pinpoint people persisted so what to do next we went for the next dd because we cannot prove the type of poison but then we started treating for opaque poisoning so we gave an antidote for opiate within two minutes i just i was still telling the periods that i don't know whether this will work or not we have to try that so when we give antidotes naloxone within two minutes people's dialect and he started getting up and we have to hold him before pulling the tube then we have repeated doses and he had ventilated support for five days and he recovered it was a new experience for us that's the only thing which we did we have not seen a lot of opiate poisonings that's a new experience for the forest large doses may need to be given when the child is consumed hyphen oxalates like lomotil methadone pentazocaine or fentanyl and derivatives it can also lead to acute lung injury that's very very we have to be very very careful whenever you're shifting the child in ambulance when you give an allocation suddenly a supers unconscious child may even get up and try to pull the tube you have to be very careful somebody has to restrain the hands otherwise you may pull the tube because dramatic recovery is seen with naloxone so learning point here is always think consider the second dd also and you don't know we need didn't get any response the first dd at least start reading for the second dd because most of the time we don't have a clear diagnosis by the toxicology analysis that's what we did we got good results second lesson is listen always to women they're always correct don't think that opioids are not available in our environment these are all the opiate sources fentanyl patch commonly used for analgesia following surgery low motile opiate analgesics coughs with codeine opium as a liquid solid and fine brownish bodies are all sources further so second dd is sometimes the correct one sometimes second seating of history may be useful this is a two-year-old boy received in er at 11 pm with convulsions he came around he was normal till 9 15 pm by 11 o'clock he developed by 10 15 develop posturing and tonics issues brought to us er he had posturing and arrival needed a lethargic incrementally awake posturing there was no clear history as per our rules no the two hours before childhood already we thought strongly thought of poisoning we asked the mother mother very strongly decided objected that he would have never consumed poison he will not take even parasamal but we have seen by an experience they may not take parasmal they will definitely take poisons so again we thought of this possibility sinus infection i had a metabolic incredibly drug injection interaction breed anatomy injury we stabilized the child intubated determined support with all the investigation next 24 hours all the investigations are negative we are stuck now we are clueless then first history elicitation was done around 1 pm i came from home 1 pm i talked to the mother mother was very much agitated and depressed she was not even able to give a good history we made a second attempt after 24 hours we have asked all the mother to sit inside comfortably both of us stopped then i changed the question also initially asked any possible recognition she said no no no this time i changed the question anyone taking drugs at home third question is what medicines are available to home now she came at the correct answer she said i have carb must been phenetine at home i've been taking for the last 14 years but definitely you would not have taken that's what she said but unfortunately fortunately serum levels showed a presence of carbohydrate so that was the carbon fentanyl which was identified by the second history taking so usually they present with cervical science posturing coma seizures cardiac dysrhythmias respiratory depression metabolic causes like metabolic problems like hyponatremia half lip is four to eight hours but they can form a form covers a foundation they can form clumps and they may require aggressive decontamination you have to you may have to use multiple doses of activated charcoal every six hourly for 48 hours and whole bowl irrigation if they fail to respond they can even go for charcoal hemoperfusion dialysis may be useful the child completely recovered we stopped all the drug and then discharged the child so the learning point is eliciting history for a second time the first time the mother is very much depressed confused agitated now after stabilizing the child she is ready to give a clear history that was very successful so second history elicitation is very useful in poisoning so what are the antidotes for various poisons of course most of you know this is iron dispersion in anticholinergic satropin ptm narcotics naloxone warfare and vitamin k methamphetamine are methylene blue ionized pyridox and only that the antidotes are like fire extinguisher so whenever we buy these antidotes and keep it most of the time administrators will object after you bought destruction 10 10 miles and the methyl below 10 amps that has not been used at all completely we have disposed it off i used to tell them that just because you bought fire extinguisher doesn't want you to create a fire accident to use it they are meant to be expired antidotes or fire extinguishers similar they meant to expire cannot be used that's not a good attitude so we have to do it and keep all the antidotes in most of the hospitals these are all non-toxic substances candle calamine clay ink deodorant our angels are children now they will consume everything including lipstick pencil lead watercolor paint toothpaste all these are fortunately non-toxic substances they may not need any aggressive medication except keeping in the er for six to 12 hours for a short period to reassure the parents so gastric lavash decontaminates there are three procedures gastric leverage activated charcoal and whole irrigation gastric lavage most of you know that we have to use the largest ngt not the big tube which we used to use earlier twelve to four ten to twelve sized uh ngg give normal saline ten to fifteen ml per carry liquids maximum three hundred ml put a child in the right lateral position drain it till the till the effluents activated charcoal is very very useful to use within one hour gastric lavage also is useful only within one hour contra indicated in three c's they used to say unconscious child commodore's child and then second is uh hydrocarbons and corrosives activated charcoal is very very useful decontaminant within one hour the dose is one to two gram per kg mixed water juice can be given through nasogastic tube useful or many poisons it may not be useful only in few positions like alcohol iron pesticides and hydrocarbon otherwise a very very useful one to decontaminate this is how nurses are administering the activated chocolate into this and global irrigation is a likely solution through given through ngt commonly used one is a peg like 15 per kg per hour for four to six hours it will completely wash out the bubbles most commonly indicated in iron poisoning sustainable preparations and intricate medications this is sometime known some poisons we don't see we don't manage but still we have to anticipate for the future because this these are because some of the poisons may come in the unknown future also this is i think it is written as my idea then this is correct uh this movie was released in 1984 first 3d movie most of the kids were watching that happily in 1984 the same year i was in pediatrician one of the district hospitals i used to do post-mortem medically work along with the pediatric work also three persons went to a liquor shop her drinks two died within 15 minutes of coming out of the bar collapsed in the street broad did to the hospital casualty autopsy was done chemical and has proved this so far i have not managed a similar victim because they rarely come to the hospital most of this poisoning they die within half an hour so they don't have opportunity to come to the hospital so there was cyanide poisoning postpartum and analysis chemical and showed the presence of sinus sign poisoning death within 15 minutes one of the very learned physician senior to me he said anybody dies within 15 minutes of consuming something unless fruit otherwise it's cyanide so if at all if they happen to come to us we must be ready to manage them we must be prepared to manage them that's why i'm telling about this this is i took from the case but i've not managed the cyanide poisoning this took from the case report is an adolescent girl employee of an electroplating industry was brought at 11 a.m to the hospital no different history except that she came to the workplace very well at 10 am remember 10 names she was well 11 am she was very sick that means very strong possibilities trauma or poisoning and improving bleed so within 15 minutes she complained of giddiness and started falling down developed seizures this is very very highly likely a poisoning another previously healthy four-year-old boy came to here with the nausea vomiting and sudden answer of unconsciousness no trauma last is seen an hour before he was eating apricot within 20 minutes he started vomiting became unconscious low gcs normal rate surprisingly normal saturation 19 percent saturation so high angular metabolic resolution elevated central venous oxygen saturation demonstrate that when the child was resuscitated in an icu central line showed iron and gametobolic acidosis the new which is suddenly windows oxygen saturation anticipate rare and treatable poisons this is what acted in high venous saturation high venous pa o2 these are all normal ultimately turned out to be a cyanide poisoning so you might ask what are the clinical scenario where you will suspect china and poisoning anybody dies within rapid die is a rapid deterioration the death occurs we can't read them any rapid iteration within 30 minutes of ingestion is more likely to be cyanide sudden collapse of a lab or industrial workers particularly they come from jewelry shop or plastic industry because this is highly likely that because they use nitrile as a solvent in jewelry shop and plastic industry consumption will cause ionic parts and this called artificial nails to remove the artificial need they use this they call it acrylic sculpture nails use nitrile as a solvent to remove this nails again fire victim are attempted a suicide patient with anesthesia in coma or acidemia or injection of acetonitrile think of cyan and poisoning very surprisingly injection of seeds of some fruits like apple cedar apricot seed tapioca they contain cyanogenic glycosides generally when we eat apple and we don't bite the seed if we bite the seed the pits and seeds of many fruits contain a substance called amygdalin the plant compound that is our body converts into cyanide after eating that can lead to cyanide poisoning so high enough metabolic acid is a high lactate high venous pa would resulting in decrease the oxygen artery venous oxygen difference normally particle oxygen difference is 95 venous oxygen mean saturation is 75 usually the difference is about 20 to 25 there is a narrow difference unless root over is a cyanide poison management of course hydrox column is a drug of choice cyano kids available because it forms binds to cyanide to form cobalt ion to form cyanocobalamin which is essentially non-toxic and cleared renally early it is available to a cyanide composition these are the substance available which has amine nitrate sodium nitrate which converts into methymoglobin methanol binds to cyanide cyanomethamocolabin that is excreted by sodium thiosulfate so these are the substances available the hydrox cobalamin i think we should purchase and keep it in the hospital because it's surprisingly very silent poisoning comes we must be able to save him so anticipate your future poison get prepared to face them the father and son were found on another another position which never reached the hospital this again i took a case report father and his son were found inside the car that night they were waiting for the mother mother was in the er receiving some iv fluid management they were parking in the parking area with the air conditioner on whole night closing the windows mother was taking treatment both of them had cyanide both of them had carbon monoxide poisoning they also again came with normal saturation because carbon monoxide it's got 200 times higher affinity than oxygen so the boundary hemoglobin doesn't allow the hemoglobin to release oxygen so they can present the arithmes they happen to see the fundamentally red skin and little hemorrhages saturation is deceptively normal pulse oximeter cannot differentiate oxymoclavine from carboxymethane that's why you show a normal saturation ct may show a change in globus paradise i i write one case report published from calicut i think where a cleaner laurie cleaner was sipping inside a tractor where there was a the generator was there generally the smoke was directed against the lorry so he was sleeping he consumed carbon monoxide because carbon monoxide is a it's a non-irritant no smell gradually they go into deep coma that's why he died i think another case it published from calicut i happen to see that so suspect based mainly on the circumstances this is one of the entities reports saying that family dies of carbon monoxide poisoning from a room heater and jamun kashmir why carbon monoxide is not identical is island killer because no smell no taste that's why they add smell to the our cooking gas because smell and space is not that no sound so gradually they breathe and then they develop carbon monoxide poisoning and go into coma what are the sources at home is common household items gas fires oil binding oil burning furnaces portable generators charcoal grills even our air conditioning is not properly serviced or outside home running a car engine enclosed space like garage or in the road rainy days these are all risk factors that carbon monoxide poisoning so these patients generally again do not come to the hospital but seen in newspaper prevention how are these situations even when generally we tightly close our windows and doors when we use ac just conserve the light and temperature comes energy and temperature better you keep the door slightly open there are also case reports where old old people who husband if you died when they were sleeping that might have been very well due to carbon monoxide poisoning because i inadequately service this so always keep the windows and doors slightly open so that if at all any carbon monoxide generated they can get out early morning headache is a warning that your ac is not good probably you might have consumed some carbon monoxide in western countries they have a carbon monoxide detector and home to identify that these are all case reports in the sometimes reported deadly car deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning nearly 50 people have died as a carbon monoxide poisoning bbc news is the times of india chennai 37 old man died in the car because of carbon monoxide and this is the case reported in all days medical sciences 40 cases are fatal carbon months are poisoning so best thing to avoid the situations particularly in winter days in north india use of fire pot and electric room heater that is one of the reasons for carbon monoxide poisoning management is giving only oxygen nothing more just give 100 oxygen just with the oxygen and supporting management will completely recover so if they come to us with the finding we should have enough knowledge to treat them with simple oxygen alone oxygen or ventilation itself is enough hyperbaric oxygen if you are in the center where there is navy help is available so anticipate your future toxin get prepared to manage them three-year-old boy brought in alter consciousness irritable and tie kidney and sinus this tree is the morning mother went mother again mother and father went out of the house for doing work mother gave him and then the lunch gave him fish meals when she returned back in the evening the boy was lying down unconscious outside the home in the evening because they gave the the child was brought to ichir he was diagnosed tachycardia tachypnea was there but the chest examination x-ray was normal bp was normal so we have a child who is cynos but relatively stable cardio respiratory status and the next possibility is generally due respiratory cost cause cyanosis is only in the terminal stage bradypnea or apnea cardiac is only cyanotic heart disease these two things are not there third part third cause is methymoglycanemia so that's what you see the saturation only 86 percent so we thought of methamphetamine in fact we call the intersection he tried to see whether in fish bones are there nothing was there so we thought of methamphetamine then the color gave a cool this is the patient color in a classical injection vial this is a mother's blood for comparison control chalky brown color combined with the normal normal bright red color this gave a very good clue that we are dealing with the childhood chemical india other sources are naphthalene local anaesthetic creams yemla daf zone they're all the they consume naphthalene daps on a local anesthetic that can also cause methamoglycemia so when we did the abg abg has to be sent for center with cardiac postoperative states so they can measure the co oximetry coaximentary is a part of abg where they identify the hemoglobins you can see that this is saturation here is 86 percent when you look at this one you see oxidative hemoglobin is the saturation is 19.7 so arterial oxygenation 19.7 but pulsars when saturn is 86 percent so much of difference almost like 13 or 14 difference this is called the saturation gap normally the difference only two or three but it is so much of gap it is called a saturation gap whenever you see saturation gap think of abnormal hemoglobin like with hemoglobin here again the carboxymeter has identified the methyl molecule level was starting to point in most of the icus nowadays co-oximetry in the blood gas itself so now now this recent technology pulse accidental like maximum technology they can show like a pulse oximeter they can also show the methyl immunity here the 23.9 is the myth levels even without doing blood levels you can treat the child so we gave iv methylene low but before giving iv methylene glue we have to check the gcpd levels this speed is low it can cause eye methylamine can cause hemolysis so it is contraindication where iv methane will use low gcsp disorder to check the gcpd levels we gave two milligram per kg over 15 minutes repeated necessary maximum seven milligram the background is if we have diagnosed a child at 5 pm in the previous day evening yeah it was around 2000 i think in ics we didn't get anything live it was not available 20 years back it was not available we checked all the private hospitals even a lot of stores we went and personally employed we could not get it finally challenged seems he will offer to help us we send one person to collect a methylene blue he brought a methamphetamine next day morning around 10 10 a.m you know the cost of which madam charge only two rupees per while this is sterilize the heavy metal six rupees only are you methylene blue but we have to wait for 12 hours to start the management that time we decided that we have to stock all this in our hospital you can see that the urine is within half an hour you can see the urine colored with blue because of five methylene so suspect poisoning any emergency dramatic constant vacuum industry whenever you see a saturation gap between pulsating saturation and abg think of with hemoglobin keep preserve antidotes that's what i told that iv antidotes are something like a fire extinguisher they have to expire we have to keep all the antidotes in our hospital to save the life now we come to plant poison i just task with the plant poison go little faster and i have only 20 minutes more oropharyngeally written g returns demolition plants these are all the beautiful flowers poisons this is a very interesting story of georgie marco jorge marco is a bulgarian distant writer he's a communist bulgarian he belongs to that country but he later defected and came to london he was working in bbc this is the background one day he was standing in the bus stop following a sudden showers an unknown old man standing nearby opened his umbrella it caused a very trivial event of causing a scratch in the markov sky the same 90 developed fever and was admitted in hospital where he died four days later diagnoses septic shock but why they work the base because of the professional background the professional history was very useful he was he defected from a communist state working in a different country used to talk a lot against his own country government so that its background made people to work up postmortem for this man postmodern showed autopsy showed death was due to poisoning is not due to septic shock between rising rising is a substance alkaline available in the castor seed when you consume orally this not a very big poison it is only very minimal symptom the same thing even parent relates lethal so what he did was he was killed by the secret bulgarian secret service when you when you see the net you can identify this by this how did they do it this is what see this is a small pellet is about 1.25 millimeter pellet is so small village you kept in the palm finger pulp is when you enlarge you can see something like a big disc in that they have impregnated the ricin alkaloid here and is put inside the umbrella the umbrella was acting like a gun when you open the umbrella automatically the pellet was fired into the nearby person so nobody will suspect i think some of you might have seen this movie through to purify in tamil light also might have been released in malayalam the same story was depicted the villain used to kill people using this based on the real incident so they are very dangerous poison plant poison this is quickly i go through the child has consumed some leaves chewed some leaves he developed the swelling of the tongue lips and sometimes i developed severe laryngeal lydia may require even intubation because of a poison calls dumb can leaves i even had in my our own garden also we had this initially after seeing this case report i removed is because it's so attractive plant any child can pull the leaves and bite it they may develop severe edema of the tongue lips and they can go in first with laryngeal edema alcoholic father mother and two daughter consumed the same some talks in the village home child came it is heart rate is 50. hypotension bradycardia people's normal you can see the ecg this shows the normal pqrst sinus bradycardia if you see here this ecg was different here there is an av dissociation all the p waves are marked by blue arrow and red arrow show the qrs complex you can see a b dissociation you can see atrial rate we calculate the p p insulator rate is 100 but ventricular it is only 30 that's what the pulse rate 30 the child came with the soak atoms attacks convol certificate convulsions so when you see a child like this they didn't have any history you can look at the toxin room cholinergic toxic room anticholinergic sedation opiate anti-convulsion this is myocardial depression you have a child with bradycardia hypotension and shock without any background history we can very well suspect a myocardial depression poisoning so micro depression possibly they come with bradycardia hypotension arrhythmia there is one poison cyclic basically anti-depressant they can presume tacky arrhythmia they can also present shock and cardiac so here the toxin is superior to identify the toxicology so beta blocker will present with hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia calcium channel darker to hyper glycemia and then oleander will preserve the hypo and hyperkalemia by this we can identify them this is treated with isoprotein on glucose glucagon injection correcting hypoglycemia hyperkalemia calcium blocker managed with iv again iv glucagon iv calcium gluconates oleander poisoning only supporting management with the dg by digi bind if it is available but all these situations facing nowadays cardios are available there intervention cardiology the child has a very severe bradycardia causing stroke adam attacks a pacing will be able to save the child for a few hours 40 days old baby had a crying spill in the night because of crying spells sleeping grand grandmother got up and administered some liquid thinking is a gray part in the night in the night child developed a respiratory stress became calm but developed respiratory tests and this is any idea can you wait for 10 seconds what is the suspicion anything in the chat box mohan or somebody can unmute and say kerosene poison you can see no white necrotic tongue and lips so immediately kerosene poison is suspected what happened to us the grandmother has given an oil cleaning liquid instead of grape water which was not only kept in the grape water bottle we didn't without knowing that she admits a night corrosive i sent the child developed perforation we could not save the child so so source available to home or toilet cleaning liquids other household cleaning agents and batteries are these are all the common things available in our home which can cause corrosive icing corrosive poison they come immediately within maybe an hour you can give water or milk 10 less than 15 avoid large volumes and you have to decide whether we need intubating the child child has voice changes straighter we have to intubate with the most experienced person this is a two-year-old child with down syndrome brought with ruling of saliva this happened in year 2000 at that time we didn't have experience with this poison so this is a coin shadow so we call the intestine in the surgeon tried to remove the kind it was difficult to remove your calves were unacceptable bonuses are busy in the neonatal surgeries they said till morning we will not be free so we admitted the child because a child had a normal saturation happen to the child and then next day morning as a first case 80 am the foreign body was removed under anesthesia but what happened is by the coin was removed but child became very sick developed severe respiratory distress and shifted to ic even if child brought to icu can you see the x-ray child shows multiple longitudinal translucent indicative of gas leaks supported in this empiricima yeah thorax nemo mediastinum collapsed lung all this so i asked a young decision was it a tough thing to remove he's a rounded one only why the child developed diarrhea syndrome childhood bilal pneumothorax had nemo mediastina mediastinitis we had ventilated the child child had a very very serious issues only after cleaning the button battery pulling the coin we realized the button battery so then time we realized that is the first encounter for us with the button battery we started realizing that any kind should on the neck unless proved otherwise is button battery when you walk in the night under a tree if you happen to see a wire or a rope presumers snake and go away so any kind shed on the neck it has to be presumed with a button battery the immediate removal has to be done in four places no seer firing disease like even within four hours it can cause perforation because a very strong alkali sodium hydroxide and electrical discharge all this will lead to perforation so it has to be removed immediately within four hours in these places the way to differentiate is possible the difference you can if your double halo line is there in button body in the x-ray you can show this when you take a lateral view here the lateral will be like this in a button battery later view would be like this you can also see a double calor which is suggest a button battery but if you cannot go for all these analysis you presume any kind shadow in the neck this presumes button battery call the endoscopist and removage nowadays pre hospital try somebody calls you say that my child is consuming watermelon what to do that go to the hospital on the way you can give 10 ml of honey 2 spoons of honey by mouth every 10 minutes for up to 6 doses this honey will supposed to code the button battery will prevent further corrosion this is where you know the very very simple modality which can prevent this but you have to tell the parent that is not an antidote this can only prevent a child from going for corrosion it cannot it is not an alternative for removal of the button button so newer intervention for the older melodies this is an older one this is uh our national bird and national animal this is our initial poison kerosene one and a half year old child consumed correction brought here after two hours child came and caught a permanent failure died after five hours this is the x-ray massive aspiration causing erds but fortunately nowadays switched most of our family even from rural areas switched to gas cylinders so where kerosene is no more seen now i i think that very much same situation caligate also this one of the largest frequency of kerosene is all over india now it is reduced because of more switching over to cooking gases management still common sense yes sir okay i think i think most of them switched over to gas we are starting less now otherwise 300 to 400 cases but area in ic now it is reduced to double digits management is observation majority will not have problems observation auction administration the needed ventilative support but caution during ventilation because when we go into inland support they may require high pressure invasively result nearly syndrome pneumothorax surfactant is found to be quite useful surfactant is nowadays for sickle ventilated children surfactant which is used for rds is also useful for keratin injections these are case reports early administration of interactive surfactant after hydrocarbon aspiration surfactant therapy and acute rds following hydrocarbon aspiration nowadays it is useful 11th standard girl failed in mathematics consumed a paste yesterday second day also paste third day cake with that she came on third day with features acute hepatic failure an actress no bleeding tendency shock or altered consciousness but she had very high liver enzymes very high ldh raised bilirubin prolonged pt and inr other things are normal had thrombocytopenia so this when you see a child with acute liver cell failure possible sources are parasomal rotten decide and vibrate she can see confess saying that she has taken all this cake will allow super warfarin so anticoagulant paste you love yellow or white phosphorous powder zinc phosphate or thallium so all this can lead very serious complications see develop menstrual bleed excessive menstrual bleeding tenancy hypoglycemia and shock on fourth or fifth day despite plasma exchange when in planning for liver transplant we could not say what she died 15 year old girl just died of a simple problem as simple talks and is a deadly toxin so all the various mechanisms intervene the coagulation phosphorus is a very serious poison cellular poison cardio toxic decrease of vascular tone and shock release phosphate in gas it's a mitochondrial poison so we have come across a poison the rodent is a poison better refer the child to a nearby center with pico and hepatic support which can improve survival this study published is not to be published this is a study unpublished data from global health city hospital where 24 patients with rodenticide poisoning are managed with therapeutic plasma exchange almost 120 times and did it 20 patients improve without need for liver transplants great news after 24 20 survived without liver transplant to recover transplant two died so the lesson what we learned is whenever you come across a child the road and they said poisoning better refer them early only think the affordability refer them early to a nearby hepatic support center we can save their life internally if it is used in another modality to using beta blocker and calcium to market is something mechanics something to do with the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics but a simple message is act like a sponge which this intralipid take all the poison extracting liquid lipophilic drug molecules like beta blocker calcium and blocker it helps in the management of this stream so advanced organ support becomes available to icu's acute liver management exchange and transplant successful ecmo of bridge to sequential bilateral transplant for paracord poisoning i have not seen a paracord poisoning so there are newer interventions available to vulnerable melodies psu has done a lot for saving these kids with poisoning and inferno metabolism drama i've also seen poisoning cases presented by dr jay kirsten from calicut five-year-old child has consumed unknown number of thyroxine dull mother came with a history of thyroxine poison child is brought in here thailand tachycardia like a normal respiratory i was about to do a stomach wash mother said don't do that she was objecting she said if she is not consumed what will happen okay then we will not do that then she said no no no if she consumed what will happen she got oscillating between ace or no how to proceed so i just told her that we are not going to give any antidote we are just going to only wash up the stomach the poison is there we will wash if there is no poison we are not going to do anything more so fortunately the color of the syringe aspirin showed the color of the direction tablet this was helpful to convince the mother that child is definitely consumed so can decondone procedure activated charcoal cholisteramine block endurance circulation toxic effects are fever vomiting and diarrhea attack arrhythmia and cardiac failure the problem with thyroxine poisoning they can develop toxic symptoms even after 10th day how long you can keep in the hospital generally we keep for 2-3 days we tell the parents to come for every day is to emergency room because by 10th day also they have developed cardiac shock and diet so we have to discharge them and follow this opiate emergency room twice a day if the developed symptoms you can give penny slow propanol eye openage series are useful because it kind of inhibits the conversion of t4 to t3 that that way it is helpful so document for your future generation ourselves to convince the parent to say that child is really confused can consume the poison this just recently i had a tin tablet chalice consumed some ton tablets kept for mother came in a browsy state black stool came in shocked raised the transaminases hyperglycemia metabolic acidosis and this is the childless what is the poison raised transamination shock black stools unless through the reason only iron poison iron whatever that is available in large numbers no tin tablets peanut bopper tone dap zone iron water is giving a large number is now when you get large number even a money or oxygen even a large number is always poisonous so the child had iron poisoning active charcoal is not useful here we have to give whole bowl irrigation 15 milligrams and generally will use only for 24 hours beyond 24 hours extraction may not be useful may cause problems but you can see the color is the windrose color appearance so iv destruction is useful whenever child is consumed more than 60 milliliter kg or the serum level of final microgram kg when you don't have facilities to check the serum levels you're in district hospitals whenever a child had hyperglycemia or consumption more than 60 milligram kg or x-ray abdomen showing iron pellets this is an indication for ib desperation quick rapid fire recently we come across a lot of sanitizer poisoning i think you also might have heard it because scientists are available everywhere sandra color and smell is very attractive for the kids sanitizer contains about 95 percent alcohol it is more than scotch whiskey they consume you know what are the toxin dose is a toxic dose easily a 10kg child can consume two three spoons and land with alcohol toxicity hemorrhaging gastriti bleeding hypoglycemia respiratory depression respiratory supporting management support ventilation correct hypoglycemia we can manage one pump release two ml so two three pumps will be enough to cause poisoning for a varying kid this is not a poison whenever a child has followed something and came with international abstraction features if you see a garland-like appearance that means child has consumed multiple magnets they stuck to each other and then encase the bubble and lead to perforation and substitution another poison another problem not a poison is a decorative beads this decorative bead is in it enlarges up to 100 times commonly they use it in birthday parties the child consumes it can enlarge to form intersection the surgeon may think it is a cystic swelling so this is another poison where they can perceive surgical complications somebody has consumed something and coming in interstellar sex means either is a magnet or a absorbed in decorative beads mosquito repellents pretty commonly consumed stomach wash whether to do it or not it's a little controversial if they consume liquid better to avoid some wash because it contains kerosene as a hydrocarbon is the base that can cause aspiration they can develop cardio complication hypertension radical arrhythmia cns convulsions and posturing aspiration pneumonia fortunately most of them require nothing more than just observation because they are they peritherates are two thousand times more toxic insect than human beings some miscellaneous poison i am coming to the last few slides matchstick one of the doctor's child during a diwali day he consumed around 25 mastics so what is the problem with the matchstick is like a lollipop it was sucking everything it contained potassium chlorate it can cause methymogenemia hemolysis and renal failure naphthalene can cause symmetric anemia eukaryotes oil inhalation itself can cause issues liniment remember is a very very important thing we should learn is liniment 5ml of liniment meant for local application contains 7000 milligram of salicylate if the child consumed the 5ml of one spool of liniment equivalent to 50 tablets aspirants acetylene poisoning can occur not through aspirin travel by consumption lineaments once a child oral counters repel are consumed by lkg girl child is brought to us given when asked them to go home they were refusing because oral contraceptive is a very benign poison at the most maximum thing it can cause a withdrawal bleeding so we convince the parents to go home without getting admitted then the grandmother came and asked me whether will it cause any problem when she become older get married and pregnancy with his oral contract he will be disturbing her pregnancy that's what she was asking sometime medication whatever we know prescribed between legislation problems a doctor one of my colleagues in good handwriting pedialyte anybody can understand that you know wars prescription went to the medical shop medical shop fellow read it as pedichloride then within one hour the whole 60 ml particular wattage was consumed the father sincere father came back to another medical shop and came for another prescription because he said two hours my child has taken everything they forcefully administered but he asked the medical shepherd will it cause sleepiness is sleepy all the time he said he cannot cause sleepiness he gave the right pedialyte bottle that time he realized that he was unfortunately substituted wrong medicine fortunately we were able to save the child so coming back to recollect various steps in the management using pulse resuscitation assess the resistance during a pulse applications recognize by giving focus history and examination i try to identify the poison that will be very helpful to identify the poison to give antidotes decontamination gastric levels charcoal and whole irrigation even though western literature says that stomachaches may not be useful after one hour i think still we can go ahead in a safer manner always look for the toxic room because toxicology analysis is not available everywhere but toxin dome is very very useful you can plan the antidote stop the anti-road in your hospital continue to monitor the child make an mlc entry educate the parents and adolescent girl before discharge our recent observation and publish unto this data we see a lot of poisoning during the logged on period surprisingly everybody was present in home but how the child consumed because everyone's physically present mentally they were not present father and mother probably very busy with their office through the computer so tired parents and curious kids we saw a lot of spurter poisoning during lockdown period and in one of the studies we present is the role of high dependency unit in managing the poisoning out of 44 children we admit that 29 records 66 percent required i see so better better practice any child is poisoning better to keep the child in 24 hours in the high dependency unit so that we can identify the problem because some of them require mechanical ventilation crrt charcoal hemo perfection particularly regular thinner injection corrosives so always keep it a point to make a point to admit the child in a high dependency unit prevent these strategies store out of sight in higher cabinets some of the kids may even put a stool and climb up and then collect the medicine so always lock locking the cabinet is the best key check your home thoroughly for any potential poison sites don't keep child proof keep always child proof dispensing never tell a child that medicine tastes like a candy so a child will cry with the cereal keep cleaning product in the original bottles don't keep it like that like grandmother kit has kept the cleaning up agent kept in a gray water bottle caused a corrosive bison avoid buying large containers of sanitizers coming to the posters i think probably most of you would i guess the name two poison where oxygen saturation may be normal is carbon monoxide and cyanide so normal saturation does not exclude poisoning it can occur in both carbon monoxide cyanide they can come in low saturation and saturation gap is in methamone name two toxins can cause tissue without hypoglycemia is isolated acid theophilian tricycle antidepressants a toxin which can cause death even after 10 days is thyroxine and also a only under seed called onion relief called woodwondering i don't know corresponding malayalam name here what is the atrial molecular rate in ecg if you see av dissociation and third day heart block in a child with poisoning it is only under our digestion poisoning this under the contact information center is available it's worth noting these numbers all dance medical sciences your own amrita has got a good toxicology unit poison control from mmc and cmc below poisoning is a disease where we don't see lot of rcts or big studies because it's only individual experience so you have to always consult your colleagues so that they have seen a position like that always contact the past information center you will get a new information from which is a great word of steve jobs the only way to do great work is to love without what you do so i just love treating poisoning children that's why i don't of interest probably whatever the case name what you provided is a small part of apple which is written probably you may have to search for the rest of the apple to see that you have to taste only part of the apple by your practice you might learn a lot of poisoning case scenario and probably you will teach others thank you very much for a patient listening can you stop sharing only ramen yeah sure i have to go a little faster because i have to present all the all the material i cooked no all the food i prepared i have to serve so 100 slices presentations are as usual and here are the few questions from the chat box uh what is toxidrome toxidrome is something like a syndrome we have edema surface hypercholesterolemia means nephrotic syndrome so constellation of clinical features to suggest a toxin that's a very very useful one i think this is a recorder one means you can see that slide toxic drums is available in most of the textbooks so we have translation and clinical when the child comes with the pitching of muscle pitching consider people and frothing and diarrhea and bradycardia it is unless there is opc only you need not do any toxicology that's very very useful knowledge there is a toxic drug tax rule is a constellation of clinical features indicating a syndromic presentation of a particular person and nowadays the antidepressant that is the consumption by adults are very frequent because of the stress levels so here there is one question what about the excessive consumption of ssris the mainly acetylopram close up in mostly they come with arrhythmia and even hyperparaxia may also i will not read them many anti-depressant poisonings but some of the poisons like a tricycle antidepressant can cause ventricular tachycardia dialectic whenever you see a dilated pupil there are only two possibilities one is melatonin second is anti-depressant poisoning so dilated pupils ventricular arrhythmia convulsions and metabolic acidosis it's mostly antidepressant poisoning some of them will lead to hyperpyrexia arrhythmia posturing and neurological symptoms they also have only a supportive management and another interesting question is anything about sudden sniff death syndrome that's what i have written book only because they they contain the sniffing the glue sniffing is one of the potential problem in western countries i think fortunately our children did not pick up that the the sniffing is some some people like some people may we like the smell of a petrol or d cell so it has a smell they used to smell everything whatever they come across the glue used for ah sticking all that that glue has got a particular smell and the glue smelling can lead to ventilation that is one of the cause of sudden death in western countries fortunately i have not come across we have not heard about it because most of these kids they may not come to the hospital in adolescent death one of the power one of the possibilities adolescent died in the school or died at home and he was alone this could be a possibility just a smell can induce ventricular arrhythmia and they brought to us probably we can manage like you can do a we can use xylocaine or we can even um we can defibrillate all that but they may not be allowed to reach the hospital there is one of the reasons fortunately our adolescent has not picked up that habit i think i have not come across i have not seen in chennai but anybody anybody in the audience has any experience can you can share it i like to know from you because in any poisoning talk it is an interactive talk where both listeners as well as the faculty learn from each other anybody had uh experience of blue sniffing yeah yeah yeah we had one case in alabama okay we had one case in alleppey yes an adolescent boy who was found dead underwent postmortem and he had a plastic bag on his head so he put some fevicol in this and he liked the smell of it and he was sleeping okay that's supposed to cause even within minutes within minutes okay very very interesting very bad very sad to know that and particularly influence of dubai and everything is more in particular in kerala i think so that is one of the things happened and another question necessary any accidental poisoning along with iem both combined together in anything you are seeing in your practice excellent yeah it may be a confusion with the iem like for example sodium already can cause ammonia rise hyperammonemia one of the td for hypermonemia is sodium alpha injection and also iem like organic acidemias and urea sickle disorders iem child having poisoning i have not come across i'm not seeing and uh because that is one of the cause for liver failure also liver failure itself can cause ammonia so high ammonia liver failure can occur in sodium operate parastamal anti-convulsants any any anybody had an experience you can share with me i'm just because of theoretical i spoke exogenous toxins endogenous toxins exogenous poisoning endogenous what our body creates is the metabolic poisons i just for the sake of interest i just classify the disease and another one interesting questions are now plenty of you come across plenty of all the packages from amazon flipkart everything which contain a lot of silica which is seen in packages very any accidental intake of silica will have will do anything absolutely poison it is poisonless it is absolutely only silicon no usually given something like a small 50 pillow for it for absorbent it will not cause any even if it is opened also it is hundred percent safe unless the child bites it and aspirate into the lungs 100 say we can reassure the child provided child has not beaten it and some of the sand particles enter into the lung otherwise is 100 safe we need not do anything for that so we can reassure them your experience with respect to any indigenous homeopathic medicine toy poisoning yeah i heard about it i i can just quote one anecdotal from an adult experience i had one of a rated headmaster used to practice homeopathy but he used to be very friendly with most of us i was practicing a small town called adirama she used to bring children six children to me she cuddled to another doctor he brought a sea cuddle to another adult physician at nine pm he was friendly with us and by 11 pm he was brought from his home unconscious in the future two hours so in that age of 60 plus age group is only myocardial infarction so he was in shock he had tachycardia shifted him to another physician nursing home he was treated with dopamine somehow he was treated as a cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction but easy was normal he recovered after four or five days after recovery he told what happened to sir we know i saw you two hours before you were all right what happened sardonic smile he told sara are you practicing homie buddy i brought an accommodation from the pharmacy i just tried half spoon to see what is the taste that the half spoon of aqua night has caused cardigan shark with arrhythmia so that moment i realized that the human body i used moment i was thinking that homie is safer that moment i thought that muhammad is also not safer it can it can kill somebody he could have even died you know if he died without recovery we may not know that that is the reason for his death in another occasion from another city hospital presented a boy had eczema and then he was not happy with the dermatologist finally he was treated by alternative medicine where they have a lot of lead poisoning many presence of the lead poisoning symptoms lead mercury arsenic are commonly in these metals these drugs so heavy metal poison is commonly seen is i don't say that alopathy is superior and ultra medicine is inferior but i i used to tell my patients she is a known devil allah is known devil that is an unknown devil whatever medicine i give you go and see the net are in the medicine box there is a literature is that perismally cause liver failure or this drug will cause side effects but most of them they say that okay most of them they say that my drug is completely safe god has not created anything have only advantage even he himself has got disadvantages so nothing in this world is has only advantages equally known advantages and disadvantages are two sides of a coin there is no coin with only one side so so go for a medicine which is at least known to us yeah particularly the as you told allopathy at least whatever it is transparent we know that when we know the antidote we know what is there it's not transparent and particularly the kerala people are more fond of the homeowner medicines so that is the thing that is the reason the question had come whether you are come across any because they can narrate many experiences because they have they should have plenty of experience from kerala because medicine is very homey is commonly practiced in kerala they should have many experiences and how interesting can share if you have time when you preach someone has asked about neem oil i mean i see here we used to get 15 to 20 cases every year meanwhile is a deadly person i still like and remember eight o'clock the grandmother administered me ten child dollar convulsion it was faster than laura zebra so quickly is one of the deadliest voice and i've seen their children being ventilated for even days and weeks with a very high dose of miroslam nowadays fortunately neemal is not freely available otherwise there is one of the deadly poison camphor can also cause seizure but camber generally would get control of one or two dose of low receptor but neem oil is requires multiple anti-convulsions ventilations yeah as you said during sabrimola season the camphor poisoning is so common particularly kids and every day that have puja is happening and the child suddenly brought in the seizures so when you have a smell of camphor or coming from the during that season immediately you can know that it is mostly itself and one more thing is i used to ask an email even application over the skin is a trans animal application absorption is also good you apply neem that will get absorbed and can cause convulsions one second is the nowadays the sugar cube sugar cube as well as the camper will have a similar appearance white color attractive appearance attracting color the children consume like a sugar cube there's another reason uh delegates let them can let them share another one or two good experiences any specific to your uh thinking i can just one quote i used her verses are what you learned is only handful don't think that you are a very brilliant fellow your knowledge what you don't know is something like in universe this is i heard that this is in the website of uh i think nasa one of them quoted it because what they know about space is so much they don't know so much they know only very little i think it's exactly applicable for poisoning so whenever you see come on as a poisoning go and read the books browse in it ask your friends contact the voice information definitely you will get some new information so don't read poisoning without consulting your colleagues or referring a book referring a journal or we have a lot of very good nice poise and permission available 24 hours that is my experience that's my advice and in the chat box there is a one experience the child dying due to abras i think it is abras picatorious that is a good money poisoning also same thing money when it just swallowed without biting it won't cause any problem once we bite the alkaloid comes out because hemorrhagic uh hemorrhagic enterocolitis and systemic poison see something similar to ryzen only is consumed crushed only because oxygen consumed without biting it may not cause any problem remember that marco's story if you bite it it will release rising another statement has come up because in kerala there are plenty of homies available and majority of thing caused acute on chronic like presentations like causing liver failure and everything okay what is it due to due to acute on their written recently had a child who was taking some indigenous medicine given by some people raman said it's not transparent nobody knows no they keep them as a secret nobody knows what does it contain so it's very very highly likely and finally they put the blame on allopathic practitioner when they come to us and laboratory poisoning sulphuric acid poisoning one person had actually told witness death due to sulfuric acid poisoning that is common in adult eye thing now we have not come across mostly in mmc they get a lot of acid poisoning girls mostly they consume acid the commonest poison and favorite poison for rural women is either with they take oleander or acid the common favorite poison for a meningous opc with alcohol so adult mostly acid bison they come with perforation anybody might have heard a lot of things they have a long term complex even if they survive they have isabella's structure and long-term complication lot of surgical thank you sir uh i'm i'm i'm from sir in one experience in 90s in trivandrum there was a group of kids and adults bought with rapid neuroparalysis and at that time those indicators and all were not much available and a few people died all of this happened within a matter of hours actually they all consume shellfish and that was a season during which the the the the color of the sea changes to a particular shade okay and that's an algae during that period and the shellfish are poisonous during that period so we we came to know about the sexy him during that period only and few people a few six of them died 36 or people were affected and one kill one kid also died and uh six people died it was published not published i think it's a good distinct everybody should learn yeah there are other feel like some poison sold so it says one of the things is a sexy toxin there are other fish bond boys and also and uh the other other experience as you said the but button battery uh also producer without knowing the child present after a few days of the by the time gangrene occurring and one of the other other experience was with the the formic acid which was used for uh the rubber and we didn't know what happened because the patient this child didn't reveal the thing because he consumed it a 13 year old boy consumed for suicidal thing for the formic acid for the rubber uh this thing sheet preparation and he was having drooling and he was not taking anything and the next day onwards he had some discoloration of urine also so we didn't consider a poisoning because it is a urinary urinary thing on the third or fourth day only on close questioning he revealed that he consumed but the by the time the corrosive poisoning the whole esophagus was damaged and uh gastrotomy and after one month he died and uh there were a lot of cases of camper poisoning at that time there was a thalam there was a vaidyra was very fond of this thing he used this camper okay and uh there is the seo sensor it's a transient phenomenon as you said the the the calicut experience the generator producing this thing we had in in in one of this temple festival and uh here the the child who was sleeping near this generator coming with their uh unknown these things they're all uh almost all these experiences is so rare that's why i'm telling this every thing i'm telling this we must be prepared we should somebody somebody comes to the hospital he should not die in our hands we should have a senator we should have a relaxation we should have other drugs so that in case if he comes to us we can we should save him same with carbon monoxide also something uh it's not odorless producing uh av block and cardiac thing poisoning which procedure produces hypokalemia predominantly that is similar to holy underwriting no marijuana maybe hyperkalemia okay in the southern part of tamil nadu we call it they die invariably they die they get discharged on fifth or sixth day and then by 11th or 12th day they come come in the second week in a very bad condition they die who do on their life maybe the same thing in malayalam called us okay maybe the same thing thank you sir that is a very nice experience for exchanging knowledge from all of you thank you thank you very much also commented and another one uh that is mainly the plant poisoning that is arithmetic like oleander and everything okay what is it called the cambodia isn't it um [Music] kids was bought with uh this uh general medicine department sir okay the mercury is injected mercury injector injected mercury and that was a reported from general medicine you know what is the outcome outcome of the patient the child is saved survivor only thing is it's radiological in the curiosity okay another another important point which i didn't mention is one of time is more commonly children biting thermometer mercury thermometer is swallowing desperately they will call us it won't cause any problem at all because metallic mercury is only 0.01 percent absorption what is available there is very small quantity so metallic mercury if it is swollen if it is followed it won't get absorbed it won't cause serious side effects but mercury salt is dangerous can cause renal failure mercury when the bp apparatus uh broken and mercury is spilled when you when when it vaporizes it can cause permeability you can also spoil the gold ring and bangles only metallic even disposing the mercury lamp in western countries is a very tedious process we cannot just like they throw our tube light in the street they have a separate process places to dispose it off it's not regulation has not come in our country another question they asked the role of hematics in pointing management no nematic generally because we want the person to come out don't suppress it let them better they vomit it out so generally hematics that earlier they used now they found out that inducing emitting also dangerous because it can cause aspiration so we have not had experience they have started and they have closed it now it's not used now in western countries also it should not be used another thing any child with convulsion due to poison don't use phenetine best drug for control of seizure is benzodiazepines so phenytoin is contraindicated because it is called cardiotoxic effects so phenotype is contraindicated in any sea shed toxin-induced issues best drug is benzodiazepines yeah particularly that is a very very useful information so the last point you have noted because there are any seizures for status we naturally after the giving initial metasolum or anything we'll go first in a time you sir thank you thank you very much for the opportunity thank you paneer for nice introduction thank you thank you sir thanks i learned a lot from your discussions from your experience was very very interesting i'd say stuff i think that is a beauty given by government hospitals that's a gift given by government hospitals it's definitely we are working in a government hospital for more than 10 years or 20 years see that one day we get by working in hospitals government hospitals we get exposed to a lot of rare things we learn by making mistakes also i don't say that we always do good things we also make mistakes and we learn from our successes and by mistakes in fact the box forts and battery 2000 i never had an idea we never had a child died because i had a lot of problems mediastinitis bilateral demotrix ventilator and died thank you thank you very much sir and my best friend it was a very interesting talk for me also bali ramon is the best friend [Laughter] thank you sir thank you for for the wonderful session so this is a very it has a very informative session and very nice to hear from your experiencer on behalf of iap record and i iap kerala we thank you for coming all the way through soon and doing so wonderful talk sir and also thank uh for moderating the session for the wonderful moderation he has done and uh it is good to see sir we would like to have you more for our sessions thank you so much thank you very much i take the opportunity to thank our students now working in kerala participating in history and everybody thank you very much thanks everybody thanks a lot thanks for watching thank you thank you

Louis Missouri and has been a dietitian in the Washington DC area since 2011 currently she is the kidney transplant dietitian at the George Washington University Hospital prior to her current role she worked for a dialysis company as a dietitian she found her passion for renal nutrition when her nephew was born with only one kidney in her career she seeks out opportunities to educate the general public about the importance of early detection of kidney disease and the importance of a healthy diet for kidney health she currently volunteers with the american kidney fund the national kidney foundation and is on the nkf Capital Area Medical Advisory Board currently she is working with George Mason University the University of the District of Columbia and the American Kidney fund on a diet compliance research grant for dialysis patients in her spare time you can find Carolyn walking all over Washington DC taking pictures and searching for new and delicious restaurants or farmers markets Thank You Carolyn for joining us oh thanks Mike I'm super excited to be here another little bit of background for me like Mike said I'm from st. Louis I've been in the Washington DC area since 2011 and ever since I learned about kidney disease and their diet restrictions I've just been really interested in helping people with that especially with my um with my nephew only having one kidney since he's been born but enough about that let's just jump right in so what is protein I mean like you hear your dietician talking about all the time you hear your nephrologist talking about as it's protein protein protein but really what is protein I mean protein comes from the food that we eat it's one of the three essential building blocks necessary for our life the other two are fats and carbohydrates and these are all macronutrients and these are like fancy words but basically a macronutrient is what's going to give us our energy we measure our energy in the form of calories and so protein gives us calories fat gives us calories and carbohydrates give us calories together these all build together to make up our like our food supplies so you're eating like a steak or some pasta these are all going to have these different macronutrients in there so protein is most commonly known for building and repairing our muscles when we think about our muscles we really mainly just kind of think about like our skeletal muscles the muscles like our biceps or our triceps or our quads or our calves and these muscles that are moving our bodies but those other muscles are going to be our organs so your heart your meet your liver these are all these are all muscles in linear music and your body needs to be repairing itself it's going to be repairing it with protein protein also plays an important role in all of our body functions not only does it help build and repair muscles it also like aids in our digestion in metabolism so like how much energy our body is using and it also helps produce antibodies that helps fight infection so when you're sick your mom's chicken noodle soup really was medicine you know because you really do need that um that protein to help with just okay so what is protein protein is actually a long chain of amino acids and amino acids are just some fancy you know molecules that get linked together in different formations and become protein when you break when you digest protein it gets broken back down into these amino acids our body or there's 20 amino acids out in all of our food supply and our body is able to make all of these but 9 these nine amino acids are called our essential amino acids and you have to get these essential amino acids the missing nine that our body can't make from food amino acids so protein is helping us build and repair our muscles amino acids are also used in forming hormones or enzymes and neurotransmitters which are basically the signals that our brain tells our body and like how our brain communicates with our body and you can find protein in both animal and plant sources so complete proteins what is a complete protein basically a complete protein is going to be a food source that's going to contain all nine amino acids all those nine essential amino acids that our body is not able to make is going to be contained in those complete proteins your the list of the different meats 9 essential amino acids the only time you're ever going to need to know this is when you're taking a test to become a dietitian the where can you find amino acid are complete proteins you're going to be found in your red meats your whole which is like chicken or which is like your beef your pork your lamb goat you're going to find it in your poultry which is your chicken your turkey your duck fish eggs dairy so most mainly you're going to find your easy protein and meat sources but also soy and that grain quinoa that everybody's been talking about are also considered complete proteins research you hear your dietitian talking about well we want to eat animal protein animal protein all the you know because it's a complete protein it's also shown that people on dialysis actually have an increased benefit from eating protein that comes from animals it's just an animal protein is better absorbed and better used by our body the same thing with iron the iron that you get from animals is actually better used and better absorbed by our body so your dietitian is going to be right even here I use this term like eat more high biological value protein such as means protein coming from an animal and when you're on dialysis your proteins are actually higher than the average American or the average person and it's because of two main reasons number one when you're on dialysis it's wonderful it removes all the waste build-up but it's also going to remove some of your protein in your blood so you will need to eat a little bit more protein because of that but the main reason is because your body dialysis is putting stress on your body's putting stress on all on your heart on your blood vessels on everything because it's an active actively removing these wastes those Abused waste products so your body is under stress when your body is under stress your body needs more protein and so thus your protein needs are higher the recommended amount of protein for people on dialysis is a little bit higher it's higher than the average American like I said on average people should be eating about 0.8 grams of protein per kilo but when you're on dialysis we want you to eat more so that's 1.2 to 1.4 grams of protein per kilo and most people on dialysis actually know what they're keeping with their weight is in kilos because that's your dry weight so think about it this right here to spine hmm saying that somebody who is about 70 kilos or that's about 154 pounds needs to have about 85 to 100 grams of protein per day and 60 to 70 percent of that or nine ounces need to be an animal source protein so that's about six or seven ounces of meat about two eggs and a half a cup of milk and I know that milk is one of those on that list of foods that you're not really supposed to be eating but I do believe that the recommendations are still that you can have about a half a cup of dairy a day but use also getting protein from other sources so from plants you can get your your protein from plant sources as well and [Applause] the chance like we were talking about don't have all nine essential amino acids besides the soy and the quinoa so that means you're going to have to eat them in combination you're gonna need to eat plant a with plant B because that's going to provide you with all different with all nine essential amino acids and when they're paired together that's called a complementary protein a lot of people who are vegetarian or vegan need to make sure that they're really they're meeting their protein needs because they are eating and then making sure that they're eating these different types of proteins together really what we're looking at you should be eating legumes or being with grains so beans have a certain type of amino acid and grains have different amino acids and paired together they're going to give you all nine amino acids so if you want to eat beans with grains or beans with nuts or beans with seeds that's going to make sure that you're getting all nine essential amino acids for the net meal so they just need to be in in combination throughout the day they don't have to be at the exact same meal but throughout the day if you're going to eat means we need to eat some rice or some pasta or some bread to make sure that you're getting all nine essential amino acids I know you're probably thinking to me like oh my goodness what is this lady talking about she is talking about beans and beans are all too big there's no list you should not be eating beans but actually I like to think about but you can eat a more vegetarian lifestyle but you should be doing it like a per meal or maybe once a once a like once a day or maybe even just choosing a day to not eat any meat but what you're going to do is the way that you can do this is by choosing like let's say you want to go and have like some a burrito and you want to have like a black bean burrito as long as you're doing beans and rice without the chicken that's okay but what we want to do is make sure that you're not doing being rice and chicken because that's going to give you too much potassium and too much phosphorus in that meal but eating a more vegetarian myself that will help you with you know cholesterol levels and energy levels and weight by adding and also with constipation I mean like be into a lot of nice good soluble and insoluble fiber and that can help with your bowel movements but I think a good rule of thumb is if you're going to eat some beans don't eat any meat and that's a meal and I mean I can't stress this enough always talk to your dietitian about doing something like this because let's say your potassium levels are a little bit too high or your phosphorus levels are a little bit too high I don't know what your levels are but your your dietitian does and you can sit down and say hey you know I really want to make sure that I'm getting enough protein but I also want to you know start eating a little bit more on a vegetarian style lifestyle how can we do this together and your dietitian I'm sure has a whole bunch of wonderful great ideas to make that happen but when in doubt ask your dietitians this is a nice little Alma spy just kinda shows you about the potassium in different foods right so we always talk about like you know eat all this meat meat meat meat fun you need to limit your beans or your lentils or your nuts because it has so much potassium in it that's kind of where I got that rule of thumb you know eating beans beans don't need any meat a student if you look at this you can have a half a cup of beans like black beans is about 300 milligrams of potassium where is you know three ounces of like a beef roast is even higher again to tastin is 320 milligrams three ounces of chicken like a chicken breast is about 220 which is a great amount of potassium that's that's like the perfect the second you know the golden is standard and you can always like figure out how much 3 ounces is if you look at your palm the palm of your hand is about 3 ounces so when in doubt look at your hand and say ok well that's about 3 ounces so I'm okay with there and 3 ounces of chicken is about 21 grams of protein so there's a lot of protein to be had out there the next you always you know when you're a dietitian comes around every month to give you your lab she's talking to you about your protein levels but she's showing you a number and it's called albumin and albumin is the number that we we renal dietitians really like to talk about it's but what is albumin it's a protein that we get that our liver makes from the food that we eat I like to think about our the albumin as like our body's mailman it's out there delivering all the necessary nutrients like vitamins and minerals and energy and hormones and different like drugs that your doctor has prescribed to you throughout your body so it's out there doing all these important functions but also not only is it delivering all these things it's also helping keep the fluid in your blood so that way it's able to be removed during dialysis it's also helping you fight infection so there's a reason why your your dietitian is you know talking about humans so much it's also hard to keep your albumin at that you know magic number that she's wanting me to keep it at which is a level of four and how human is kind of sickle I always like to say if you look at it the wrong way it's going to go down but it can be affected negatively so it can go down if you have an active infection if you have inflammation I'm not talking about like swelling when I'm talking about inflammation when I'm talking about like inflammation is when your body is under stress which dialysis makes your body under stress so your body is always inflamed when you're on dialysis so inflammation make sure albumin lower swelling or edema when you have too much fluid on and your feet and ankles start to like puff up that can lower your albumin when you have too much fluid and it sits on your lung that's going to lower your element or anytime you take a trip into that hospital number one your body is under stress you might have an infection you might have too much fluid there's a whole lot of reasons your recent hospitalization is going to make your protein low your albumin low and not also the food maybe not be the greatest when you're in the hospital or you're feeling sick and you don't want to eat enough you know there's all these holes all these reasons why your protein might be lower doing for these reasons and these may not be what sound alike they are like a food issue like I mean infection well how can you do anything about that with food but when you're not feeling well a lot of times you don't eat as much and when you're not eating as much that will also lower your I'll demon level too so again back um you know grandma's chicken soup lets you know when you're in down when you're on dialysis you get that wonderful little report card that your dietitian comes around with you and every month they're checking your labs or reminding you to do you know to take your binders and to avoid tomatoes and potatoes and they always are probably saying oh we will need you to eat some more protein eat some more protein because your ailment is a little bit low we want you to be at a goal of four or higher there is a reason for that there's one lot of research out there showing that people on dialysis who have an albumin level under four have higher risk of death and have more hospitalizations so if your albumin is 4 or higher there is a lower risk of death and fewer hospitalizations which I mean that's always a really good thing um we talked a little bit and a few slides ago about what can make your protein go down or that albumin number go down and one of them looks like the edema or the swelling or the fluid on your lungs fluid really your albumin can be diluted dilutional and if you have too much fluid that's going to make your protein level or your albumin level lower so it's important so important especially in these hot summer months it's already getting hot here in DC I mean like I think the humidity is super hot and I know that the folks here are really wanting to drink more because they're feeling really dehydrated but it's really important to follow your fluid restrictions so that way the fluid doesn't leak out of your of your blood vessels I was talking about how like albumin helps keep the fluid in your blood vessels and when the fluid is in your blood vessels or then it's easier for the dialysis machine to remove that fluid because your blood is going into the dialysis machine and then they're using a mechanism called ultra filtration that's removing the fluid from from your blood and then it goes back in to your body and your body will repopulate the blood with more fluid and then throughout that three to four hour time circle circuit you're able to remove you know 2 to 5 liters of fluid per treatment the more fluid you remove the heart of that machine has to work and the harder it pulls on your heart and it puts an extra strain on your heart so having less fluid on following that fluid restriction is really important for multiple reasons not only lowering your keeping your protein level nice and high we don't want what we don't want to happen is that fluid to go into your third space in third space I mean you probably have heard your doctor or your dietitian talking about it it just means that space that's in between the blood vessels and your cells and that's when you notice like when you look at your feet and they're all swollen and if you can even push down on it and kind of leave that divot that's the fluid in your third space and your the dialysis machine is not able to remove that but if your albumin is nice and high and your protein that's nice and high you're able to it's going to keep that fluid in your blood vessels and you'll be able to remove it easier again I'm talking a lot about fluid the fluid is so very important when it comes to protein and so very important when it comes to your health too much fluid can cause a lot of problems some of these problems are flying around your feet and ankles it can also cause fluid to go into your lungs or sit on your lungs and could possibly end up leading it you know hard for you to breathe making air or you could even get pneumonia also it can start too much fluid can stretch out your heart you have this extra volume of blood and so now your heart has to work harder to move it through your blood vessels and it's not like it's working harder and getting stronger it's actually getting stretched out like a stretched out balloon and it becomes weak and floppy and so this makes it harder for your heart to work makes it harder for you to get rid of the fluid and also continues to make her or your protein or your albumin look you can also put extra stress on your body because now the Machine the dialysis machine is having to pull the more fluid off harder and it's making more strain on your heart which is also going to lead to could lead to all sorts of different things not only like hospitalization so and then too much fluid makes your protein low and then this whole little cycle if your protein is low the fluids going to leak out of your blood vessels and it's going to go into your third space and it's just this is little cycles so cutting back on that fluid and making sure you recognize trying to only hit that 32 ounces of fluid per day is a really important goal really but you your dietician is sitting there telling you eat more protein eat more protein eat more protein how do you do that how can you make your your albumin levels higher you're like I'm eating protein at every meal I you know I'm not hungry I can't eat any more protein how many eggs do you want me to eat a day oh my goodness you know what what can I do the next few slides and actually the rest of this presentation is going to really be about tips for boosting your albumin levels because I think it's really important to understand what it is but really let's talk about real life let's do you know how can we make this happen first and foremost back to this fluid drink 32 ounces of fluid or less a day and a fluid is not just water it's soda its juice it is tea its coffee its soup it's ice its jello if it's ice cream and popsicles and ice um anything that is liquid at room temperature it's going to be considered a fluid summertime is the hardest time because it is hot and humid and people want to drink more you really got to figure out what works best for you some people like to drink a just fill up a 32 ounce glass and they know that that's what they get to drink all day long some people like to have 4 8 ounce glasses and no and so they feel like they get to go back but that's whatever is your personal preference also eating a protein source at every meal it doesn't have to be an animal protein source we just learned that like beans and rice together make a complete protein so like I said if you want to eat beans go ahead and eat those beans don't eat a piece of like meat at the same time though but make sure you're always having a protein source at every meal and this sounds kind of crazy eat a bedtime snack you know a lot of times we keep on hearing about like oh my goodness you shouldn't eat when you go to bed you know all these things and if you have acid reflux eating a bedtime snack is maybe not the best choice but I'm not trying to say like you a big meal I'm talking about an apple or a half of a sandwich it doesn't have to be a protein you know heavy meal it's like an apple an apple has very little as any protein in it but it's still going to give us energy and the reason having a snack right before bedtime is a really good thing is it's been shown that when you're on dialysis your liver which is actually storing your energy only stores about half the amount of energy then some than an average person so you think about it you go to you're using energy all of the time when you are eating and you have food in your stomach like right after lunch which is kind of basically now your body has an instant source of food it's the food that you're eating is the food that you're digesting but your body's not going to use all of that food and it's going to store the rest of that in our liver in a form of energy called glycogen but what happens is when you are on dialysis your body's only able to store about half the amount of glycogen so you go to bed and you're not eating when you're asleep obviously so your body has to use your energy stores halfway through the night you have used up all the stored energy or that glycogen and now your body needs to have more energy to breathe to function to roll over to do any for your heart to keep on breathing or beating all of these things take energy takes calories takes you know you know sugar or glucose if you eat a bedtime snack then your body will use that energy at the first half of the night the second half of the night so you're going to use your energy stores in your liver and then you wake up and you eat you know a bowl of oatmeal or something and then BAM now you've saved all your energy and what happens is because like I said you know like protein is a macronutrient way back in the first slide it's giving us calories well your body is going to use those calories it's going to say oh I don't have anymore the stored energy I'm going to use something that's quick and easy when it'd be great if it was using our fats but it's not that takes a long time for it to break down takes a lot of energy it's going to take your protein in the form of albumin and it's going to use that to sustain you overnight so eating a bedtime snack I can't talk about it enough it's so great another thing who knew but Brazil nut Brazil nuts are really really really super high in an antioxidant called selenium selenium actually helps to fight the type of inflammation that lowers your albumin levels so one Brazil nut a day not two not three one Brazil nut a day as shown that you can't that will raise your albumin levels from a 3.5 to a four within like six months so you can go and find just the Brazil nuts I'm not talking about walnuts or peanuts or cashews or anything like that because they don't have the selenium content that these Brazil nuts do it's the selenium in these growers mill nuts that are going to help raise your elbow and cause it's going to lower that inflammation you don't want to eat too many just one a day because you don't want to mess with your potassium and phosphorus because those are always very important to make sure that they are within range for one Brazil not a day that's an easy quick fix also let's say you just got out of a hospital and you don't have much of an appetite or you just you know you've got these taste changes going on you just don't really want to eat anything and it's just you don't feel like eating and so you're not getting enough calories you're not getting enough protein all of this well if you don't have much of an appetite I always think a nice good little trick is to have like some chicken salad or tuna salad or egg salad in your refrigerator and every time you walk by that refrigerator you get like a a wheat thin or a little cracker that doesn't have any added phosphorus and you dip it in there and you take you eat a little bit if you walk back and forth in front of your in front of your refrigerator like 10 times a day that's like a half a cup and that's going to give you at least 20 grams of protein right there and some calories that will help boost up that level it's just a trick for everybody who you know is able to eat three meals a day and you know eat snacks no this is for somebody who really just doesn't have an appetite and just doesn't know what to do and you know your dietician is saying oh my goodness I need to eat more I need you to eat more well this is a great way of making that happen and then there's the protein powders and protein bars protein supplements we are all very very fortunate right now that we live in this world of everybody thinking that they need more protein members than they do that means we've got a whole bunch of different protein powders and bars to choose from some taste better some don't you know but now you get to make those choice also now with the new food label laws they're trying to you have to have potassium listed so some protein bars have already started doing that I think potassium doesn't have to be listed until 2020 on the food label I could be wrong but it's not it's not 100% yet so what you want to do is make sure that you're finding a protein bar or protein powder that has substance' listed so that way you know that you're not getting too much potassium also talking with your dietitian you know saying hey I found this in the grocery store you know what do you think but of course we are going to talk about these different protein supplements now so when choosing your protein supplement what you want to do is make sure you read the label first I can't as you know enough and talk about reading those labels you're looking for a protein supplement that has a least 10 grams of protein in it and also is lower in potassium your goals should be a protein supplement that's under 200 milligrams of potassium so certainly stay away from anything that has over 350 milligrams of potassium and again some some protein supplements do list the amount of potassium on there some don't on their labels right here these protein supplements these do list potassium on the label I've starred the different drinks and bars that have over 300 milligrams of potassium so the muscle milk protein powder has over 300 milligrams of potassium but the muscle milk low calorie protein powder is actually under 300 milligrams don't barge Larabars all these different types of bars but again when in doubt go to your grocery store take a picture of it and show it to your dietitian that I think is the best way to do it you and your dietitian working together can find the best fit for you again here are some just some snacks that aren't like protein bars Special K high-protein cereal you know like you can when you're on dialysis I know some dialysis units actually allow people to eat in there because these would be a great thing to bring with you if you know just as a little snack or something that you can just carry in your purse of the Special K proteins cereal 14 grams that's and a half a cup and it only has 125 milligrams of potassium that's that's fantastic Takashi go lean with 9 grams what you really want to do is making sure that you're getting the most protein for your bang with the least amount of potassium and again staying away from anything that has this over 350 really anything over 300 you kind of want to avoid if it's going to be something you're in to be eating a lot of again be aware of any protein supplement but does not lift the potassium content a good rule of thumb if the protein supplement is not listing the potassium on the label and it's made with peanuts or any type of nut or seed as a first or second or third ingredient it could very well be high in potassium because nuts as you've seen on previous slides are actually pretty high in potassium so that's a good to avoid any of those protein supplements if they don't list the amount of potassium on their also the reason we worry so much about potassium is because potassium controls muscle function and muscle contraction and remembering that your heart is a muscle so if your potassium is too high and or too low it can cause your heart to miss beat and not to be the way that it's supposed to and you can end up having a heart attack so here are a few supplements I feel like more supplements than not actually list the amount of potassium on there but here's a few supplements that are the don't list the amount of potassium so again if it's made with peanuts or it has peanuts in the first couple of ingredients you want to avoid those because most likely they have too much potassium also sometimes you think oh I'm going to you know eat a granola bar because that's going to be you know high in fat and protein but actually a lot of these don't have very much protein in them at all like I use like granola bars chewy granola bars crunchy granola bars any of those milk substitutes you think oh it's going to have plenty of protein and it's made from nuts but it doesn't so please be wary of that also um sometimes your protein is under 3.5 that your albumin when it's under 3.5 a lot of times dialysis facilities will give you a nutritional supplement either in the form of a bar or in a form of a drink and that will give you and that'll help boost your protein levels your albumin levels but also let's say your protein levels are under 3/5 for a long period of time maybe like three months or longer talk to your dietitian there is a form of protein that you can get during your dialysis it will go right into your dialysis you don't have to get stuck again for another another kind it'll just go right into the dialysis machine and we'll fill in this extra protein during your treatment and talk to your dietitian she knows about this type of treatment talk to your nephrologist they might even be able to find a company that can help you with your insurance and maybe you won't even have to pay for this but really in conclusion protein is a really important part of our diet you have higher protein needs if you're on dialysis albumin is that type of protein that your dietitian is talking about and the reason she is is because it holds the fluid into your blood vessels it helps you fight infection research has shown that it is it keeps you out of the hospital and taking making sure you take your phosphorus binders I didn't really talk a lot about this but I'm sure your dietitian is talked to you plenty about your binders but even with your snack or with you know protein supplements you need to make sure you take those binders because where there's protein there's going to be phosphorus and anytime you're looking to change your diet habits you need to talk to your dietician and your nephrologist first and it's just best to have everybody who's on your team knowing what's going on and I do believe so now it's a question time so I think people have been writing in questions and mike is going to do a rapid-fire questions and then I'll do the answers yeah thank you very much Carolyn we definitely have more questions that we've gotten in and that folks would like to ask more we do have time feel free to enter that in the questions box which is on your your dashboard there so first question from one of yours is why does having an albumin level of 400 or higher mean less hospitalizations in depth they understand kind of what Sannikov edit is happening oh goodness um yes they do now the question is do I know is all about again the inflammation because when your albumin level is under is a four or higher it shows how it really means that you maybe you don't have any infection or your inflammation that causes stress on the body is lower and if you have less inflammation but that is a really really really great question to ask you're enough for ologist your kidney doctor about okay on the inflammation piece also what are some other good sources of selenium besides Brazil not Wow um so is Brazil not is the the highest it's selenium is called a trace element and so they are found in very small amounts in lots of foods but really Brazil nuts is has the highest amount and that's what's going to make it you that's really going to be what affects your albumin level is the Brazil nut okay if you do have acid reflux what type of food would you recommend before bed and how soon should it be before bed okay certainly we want to not a more carbohydrate food so an apple or like some crackers we don't want anything that's going to be sitting in your stomach for a long time so things that are going to be like that have fat in them or that have a lot of protein in it because fat and protein sit in your stomach longer which is great because when you're trying to lose weight and it makes you feel full longer but when you have acid reflux that is going to make the acid to go back up a little bit longer if it's sitting in your stomach longer I would say recommend you could and two hours to an hour beforehand oh that would be just fine you would still get the benefit of the snack you know I mean I'm not saying that you need to lay in bed right before you fall asleep and like you know eat an apple but like hours before bedtime that could be a great rule of thumb for everybody because when you lay down the acid reflux it makes it a little bit easier for it to come back up so two hours okay we have someone that's asking about information regarding protein for patients with chronic kidney disease stages three and four and are there major differences in where could they get more information there are two schools of thought out there there are some new research coming out and it actually is saying that in the beginning these two talked about you we want to restrict protein and that's still the rule of thumb out there but now they're kind of looking and saying that they don't really need to do that some good good resources would be the American kidney fund the National Kidney Foundation divita calm person is calm they all have a really good peer-reviewed journal articles but I think the most important thing is not about restricting protein but restricting different types of protein so eating the more vegetarian style proteins the beans and the whole grains and things like that if their potassium levels are okay it would be in the fish in the poultry and avoiding red meat red meat actually is a vaso constrictor that means it's taking your blood vessels and making them smaller and so that means your heart has to work harder to move that blood and then your heart has to work harder to get your to move the blood your blood pressure goes up so your kidneys work harder to lower your blood pressure your kidneys do so much who knew but so avoiding red meat or limiting red meats to like maybe once a month when you have stage 3 or stage 4 kidney disease I think is the most important takeaway for protein and early CKD okay someone says why am I always hungry now that I started dialysis oh that's a great question um dialysis you have higher energy needs when you're on dialysis I mean like people who don't know anything about dialysis they think oh you're just sitting in that chair for you know three hours no big deal well your body is hard at work when you're on dialysis you may just be sitting there but man oh man that machine when I keep on saying it's pulling it's actually doing that it's putting your body under stress and it's working your body your body is using all this energy and so your your calorie needs are actually higher so I think having some lean protein snacks having some low calorie snacks you know just kind of throughout like in your purse or in your dashboard or by your chair you know it's a good way to get in some calories but not you know not the Doritos next I mean I would love to be able to eat Doritos all day long but that's no good for anybody so like having some lean low calorie snacks is important thank you very much so someone doesn't like apples as a snack are grapes as good as apples and snack and a so red versus green any difference um really no difference between what red versus green some people might say oh there's more antioxidants and red grapes versus green grapes that I think you would have to be like a bushel of grapes to make that be any type of difference grapes are low in potassium they have like zero phosphorous but they are high in calorie and they're high in sugar so that's what's giving you above the calories now it's natural sugars less great but if you have diabetes or you're trying to watch your weight maybe choosing you know like 15 grapes which is a serving versus like 30 grades or something like that where does the excess protein that we intake go does our body get rid of it and how yes when your kidneys are working the way that they should be your body gets rid of the extra protein or the protein later through your urine protein waste is actually broken down into ammonia so when you pee a VP you and you smell that ammonia smell that's partly that's partly your the waste of the protein when your body is but really mainly your body all the protein that we eat is being used it's being turned into albumin is be turned into other types of you know blood proteins it's being turned into muscle and it's really just the waste product that our kidneys are filtering out when your kidneys aren't working the way that they should then your body's not able to filter out that ammonia and that's what it's caused the your bu in and your creatinine these are levels that your doctor and your dietitian are probably talking to you about and your nurses but that causes those to rise and they can cause toxic levels in your body and cause like funny taste in your mouth and even you know kind of dementia sign okay some of this dialysis patient is saying I've tried changing my diet to pass but I always go back to old eating habits do you have any tips for making new habits stick - ditto um yes start small don't try and change everything all at once I think that that is the biggest leading the best the biggest factor that leads to failure in the falling back into old habits also don't like do any negative self-talk I mean we're all going to eat that pizza one of these days and you know just because you ate that pizza doesn't mean that you are you know that you're bad or you're doing the wrong things and things like that say okay I had my pizza now I'm going to move on and not feel bad or guilty about it the best best best advice I can give anybody about changing diet habits or trying to lose weight is number one write down everything a single thing that you eat don't lie to yourself if you ate that Jolly Rancher write it down number two don't buy those chips don't go down that aisle in the grocery store get rid of it at your house I know I mean like things are expensive and you don't want to throw away food and stuff like that but dang it throw it away get rid of it don't have it in your house if you have family members they can plead to them say please please please please do not buy Chips Ahoy cookies because I really I can't I can't not eat those maybe you don't like almond joys and say if you really want to have a snack buy those almond joys and keep them in the house but the most important thing is write down every single thing that you eat don't shame yourself and feel bad and negative when you slip up we all do and don't have it in your house okay great it's probably tips we all can use including me you talked a little bit about a vegetarian diet and that's definitely possible to do it any is it possible to successfully follow a vegan diet while on dialysis yes um it's certainly harder and that is something that I mean I don't know if you can be vegan 100% of the time because dairy will be would be an important source of nutrients and like also be vitamins but that is something that you and your dietitian in your nephrologist should should talk together I think a great way to approach that is writing like come up with a diet plan write down like I could eat X Y & Z and meet all of my needs what do you think you know if you come in with more information than that way your dietician your nephrologist be like okay this person has really done their work they know what they're doing they're going to do it the right way and they would feel more confident okay we have a fluid question I'm a dialysis patient have difficulty controlling my fluid levels what can I do to reduce feelings of thirst and will protein help me feel less thirsty now proteins are going to help you feel less less thirsty at all but you can if you let you know you can like fries grapes and suck on those frozen grapes you can chew gum you can suck on like sour candies I know this these are all probably things that you've heard before also like any type of fruit that has a lot of water in it so frozen apples watermelon pears freeze all your fruit and suck on that don't suck on ice because that's going to melt down and be turned into into fluid a little trick that I used to do back in the day when I was you know young but I would go to soccer camp and it's hot is all get-out in st. Louis and it's humid and it's awful but you need go and you'd run all around you're super thirsty and you drink as much as you can but you're still too hot I would take cold water like the drinking fountain and run it over my wrist where my blood supply was and that would help cool my body down also getting like a frozen washcloth and when you're at your house and putting it on your head and that will help cool you down it's about being high is a lot of times where do you feel like you're thirsty or have it getting a wet towel and freezing that and putting that around your neck when you're walking in this awful heat to the metro or that's less or the what not that is another good way to keep your body cool staying cool what helps decrease your your desire for drinking oh and don't eat a lot of salt salt makes you thirsty thank you very much any difference in the way the body absorbs animal proteins which is a protein supplement yeah because those are all synthetic all the strong work a lot of those are some are synthetic and they're not commonly found in nature your body is much better at breaking down foods in its natural form animal plant when we start pulling things out and making these supplements they're very important they do a great service but your body can maybe absorb more of them or less it just depends on how how it's working out I would look for like a whey protein because whey protein is in its most natural state okay that was the last question I didn't you made it thank you very much Carolyn great job today I learned a lot as well so I really appreciate you coming in doing this tonight okay well thanks I had a great time fabulous hour now webinar will be held on Thursday July the 26th from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time in partnership with satellite health care we present blaster therapy and dialysis exercise activity and wellness with dr.

"WpNae3-WNhY": "every profession has certain tools of the trade if you're a golfer those tools include drivers and pitching wedges and putters you're a carpenter your tools would include hammers nail guns and levels well being a diabetic isn't a profession but finding victory over diabetes does include certain tools of the trade and one of the major tools in your toolbox is the salad in this video we'll be doing a blood sugar test involving salad and discovering the power of salads in overcoming runaway blood sugar and if you haven't yet subscribed to this channel I hope you'll do so so that you won't miss a single video we post as we help equip you to win your battle over diabetes [Music] roll when you think about nutrition for the diabetic you cannot help but consider the salad in some people's eyes a salad is a lowly item something to be eaten quickly before you get to the real food far the diabetic salads are vital and they are filled with nutrition and they don't do a terrible damage to your blood sugar salads are the new potatoes for the diabetic in the pre diabetic what you used to get filled with in french fries and mashed potatoes and all kinds of potato products fried potatoes and so forth now we fill ourselves with salads so before the meal I tested at 1:05 I ate a nice salad fill myself up waited an hour tested what should have been my peak reaction to that meal blood sugar wise and it went to 103 two point decrease but given the margin of error for these monitoring devices basically it's it's a wash in other words nothing much happened ate a big old meal and nothing much happened let me say that one more time I ate a big meal enjoyed it and nothing much happened blood sugar wise that's exciting news that's why I tell you salads are the diabetics friend they just don't do much to your blood sugar now that was a chef salad later on I'm going to have a different kind of a salad that I expect will raise it a bit more because not all salads are the same and so you have to be discerning and discriminating when it comes to picking your salads or creating your salads but the good news is it is definitely possible to eat a large meal fill yourself up get plenty of nutrition and yet do almost nothing to raise your blood sugar that my friends is exciting it has been an hour since we finished our meal it was a good me it wasn't anyone I was tasty anime Jenny and it had a lot of carbohydrates for a salad it had around 50 grams of carbs what do you think all those carbs came from do any particular thing that seemed sweet to you yep you know there is mango in there mangoes yeah and those crispy yeah there were little crazy things being which were obviously made out of wheat so that's gonna raise it and then of course the salad dressing itself was very sweet yeah didn't you find it so guys yeah it is like somebody dumped a whole bunch of sugar in the the salad dressing and so between the salad dressing and the mangoes and those little crispy things there was there was 50 grams total so good news and not great news but fairly good for both of us and Benedict this case now what did you start out at before the meal I set it out with 107 107 and after the eating a meal and one hour at one hour later it was 104 104 so that's a three-point decrease she handled 50 grams of carbs in the salad and actually lost a few points your pancreas is working good yeah you're happy about your pancreas happy and your ability to process your ability to process blood sugar yeah it is efficient it's working well okay in my case I started out actually better than Benedicta did I started out at 93 but by the time I had eaten that salad and covered those 50 grams of carbs waited an hour I went up to 129 so that's a 36 point rise I didn't handle it as well as you did I started out better than you I ended up a lot worse than you now the good news for me is 1:29 is not that bad really it's it's still within a safe margin I don't like to push my pancreas too hard but 1:29 is not too bad considering I just ate 50 grams of carbs now I'll tell you one thing if I had eaten candy bar and a half-witch that's equivalent to I would have gotten all that sugar immediately and it would have really jacked it up I hope you found that helpful if so give it a thumbs up so that YouTube will rank it higher in its search engine and more people will get to see it and consider subscribing to our beat diabetes channel so that you won't miss any of the inspirational videos that we post in the days to come well that's it for now god bless and see you

best to get our heads around it all uh our two special guests today um our feature speaker has been court you're going to be hearing a lot about him from lessons learned from colorado and ben this is our uh fourth time hosting you which we're really honored and thrilled about he was here one time in person and this is his third time virtually uh and but we are also very lucky to have with us um from pennsylvania's commonwealth prevention alliance the executive director jeff hanley hi jeff hello thank you uh so jeff is going to get us started in just a moment with some history of where we are in history which is background in where we are today in pennsylvania just a little housekeeping want to let you know that we are recording this program uh we're going to be posting it on our follow-up page which is conversation dot zone slash cannabis um any questions that you submit in the chat box or the q a box during this presentation will not be recorded uh the panelists and i will see that

any time judy and i will be keeping an eye on those um and for the first hour or so you're going to hear from our presenters and then after for the last half hour we'll address the as many questions as possible we already received about 25 in advance during registration so thank you for submitting those um i don't know that we'll get to all of them but we'll do our best and we're going to have a lot of information on this follow-up page so some of the things that i have posted there already if you go to that page are the ben's program in may was his full powerpoint presentation so you can view that you can also view a couple of other presentations um dr joe garberly from karen treatment center talked about the um the addictive nature of this substance and what some of the fallout has been with the clients or the patients that he's been seeing at karen which is one of the top five rehabs in the country it happens to be right here in um the reading area warnersville pa um his recording of his presentation is on that page as well as another presentation by david fialco who explains what vaping is looking like these days nicotine oils and thc products so that is there and also our youth marijuana prevention project is linked on that page as well because we have a lot of information there also um we have a program coming up that is sponsored by that youth marijuana prevention project funded by montgomery county drug and alcohol program um and uh this is called cannabis that's complicated this will be especially great for parents to attend if you have um a son or daughter who is experimenting or is is deeply into their cannabis use this will be really helpful to you we have a local clinician who's phenomenal he's been a speaker of ours a few times his name is patrick dowling he's a licensed professional counselor and we will also have a young man who is uh in recovery from from cannabis use disorder um and he's going to talk about his experience with high potency thc and his subsequent recovery from that that's on october 27th and you can actually ask judy if you can share the online page the conversation dot zone slash online in the chat box that will take people to learn more about this and register to attend along with other programs we have coming up at the end of this program you'll have an opportunity to take a survey we really appreciate it if you can do that it helps us to know what was working for you what you might have learned wanted to hear more about or what you'd like to hear about in the future from us um so please even if you've been with us before we really appreciate you taking this survey and it'll as i said it'll pop up on your screen as soon as the program ends so uh without further ado i'm gonna get to um uh we're gonna actually introduce jeff hanley first i think it would be nice for us to hear a little bit about where things are in the state of pennsylvania right now so uh i'll stop sharing my screen and uh turn it over to you jeff all right well thank you kim and judy for having me i certainly appreciate it good morning everyone i'm great to see ben again i i started as the executive director of cpa in january of last year and uh lived in mercer county pa for years but also my wife and i spent some time in colorado for a few years and lived there and i heard ben speak in colorado at a school district a few years ago talking about marijuana and the impacts to date in colorado and it was such a great presentation um and it's so nice to to see ben uh here in pennsylvania um providing all of us which with such great information resources so we appreciate it and appreciate um kim and judy everything that you guys are doing too this is fantastic um so i just thought i could just provide really briefly uh just a quick update on some of the current legislation in the state i'll share my screen here real quick and um so everybody can see uh the three bills that are currently in the pennsylvania general assembly um there's senate bill 350 2050 in 1899 um i know that kim is going to share um this and then have this available to everybody um but i think the one thing that i would really encourage is to everybody go to uh these these websites and just take a real quick look at um mostly the bills but also uh what committee they were referred to so you can see here um i linked all these so anybody can go here and just click on the blue shaded areas and and um and pull up those committees so these three bills are in currently in committee which could be good news could be bad news uh the worst thing for a bill in pennsylvania is if committee never acts on it and then it just dies um so i would recommend um checking this out um all three of these committees are a majority owned or majority republican party um so um that is good news in regards to this issue uh what we're hearing um that there are are general assemblies back in session today um so i think or excuse me on monday they go back in session on monday the one thing that i definitely wanted to share at the bottom here so so you can see the session days remaining there are not many session days remaining and in 2020 uh the general assembly must adjourn by midnight of november 30th in even numbered years due to the expiration of terms so uh keep that in mind we know that they can add days to they can have session days to do voting they i can't imagine them accomplishing what they need to accomplish in four days uh through november so i would imagine that we would see a little bit of a change but uh keep that in mind starting monday we're going to hear a lot more about recreational marijuana we are going to hear more about expansion or deregulation of alcohol policy so uh anything that i hear i'll definitely pass on to kim and to everybody else to share but uh i would again just recommend pulling up any of these um committees and um the websites are real well done you can just see who's in charge of each of these committees and and if they're in your area if you know them make a call i i here's the majority the uh the republicans and then the minority of the democrats if you know any of these legislators i would really recommend making a call to their office and and just um talking about the legalization of recreational marijuana and what that would look like for you and your community um so um again those three bills i just wanted to finally say those three bills are are in committee still so they are all an option uh to to be looked at and voted on uh there is a resource from representative wheatley's website that i think kim might share um after the session and it shows the differences of the three bills it does a nice job of doing that um but um there is a lot of other information on that sheet that really isn't factual but you can at least see talking points from the representative standpoint on how they are trying to push this through and all the fact i think he has a a myth or fact page um all of those are very very uh disputable and there are many talking points available for us to sit there and say well ways again marijuana is addictive and here's what that looks like so um i i think only other thing real quick kim is just medical marijuana there's really a lot of discussion on these bills uh if if legalizing recreational marijuana uh were to get out of the committee a bill how would that affect medical marijuana and there's a lot of dispute between republicans and democrats uh republicans want to um they want to make sure that um that they are looking to protect um the medical marijuana current industry and what that looks like so uh it'll be interesting to see how that all kind of plays out and i know ben has talked before about what medical marijuana looks like um in some other states um especially after legalization of recreational has occurred so um a lot will happen next week and and again we'll keep our eyes and ears tuned to it as much as possible and update the field but now is a perfect time now it's a perfect time to look at those committees and and see if there's folks that you know and that you feel really comfortable reaching out to and just sharing your thoughts on on this and what this could look like for you for your community and um just come prepared with a couple talking points and and and you'll be in great shape so we certainly appreciate your advocacy your support and if there's anything that um i can do just please reach out at any time thank you kim thanks so much jeff and we already have one question if there are any bills related to decriminalizing and i think you'll find it i'm just in the process of posting those materials that jeff referenced onto that page but you'll find that that they do some do address it and some do not so i don't know if there's much more we can say about that at this point but okay yeah there's no nothing separate for decriminalization at all um i don't know if i see that happening um but uh you know we're just hearing right now things it doesn't seem like this is set to come out of committee um but it's such strange times strange times with covet that everybody's looking for new revenue and when they start saying new revenue um who knows uh what could possibly happen and we're working with um tobacco control and some looking at what taxes on tobacco could look like what taxes on alcohol could look like to help generate some new revenue so as we look at those numbers and hopefully get them really soon we'll share um so might be an opportunity for new revenue without uh legalizing um substance thank you kim great thank you so much jeff okay and now i will turn it over to the one and only ben court ben are you all set to go are you going to unmute i think so i was just reading lauren's question yeah i need some help on that uh from you guys but i can answer a bit of it i think we'll get to some of these other questions toward the end we'll we'll address these thank you for submitting those please keep keep them coming we'll we'll do our best to get to them i'm really easily distracted so when you send them in um probably if you just sort of see me staring it's not just because it's quarter or seven in the morning here in colorado um it's it's because i'm looking at the questions that came in and i really appreciated um the ones that everybody sent before i'll um answer a few of those throughout and then also go through them um bullet point at the end so my intent right now is to end um at 9 30 your time so we can have a solid 30 minutes for questions and between the four of us do our best to answer or at least find you some resources pardon me to uh to answer those um i'm bummed i'm not out there with you guys right now i was telling jeff you know like when it's not raining and in the fall i think happy valley is going to be one of the prettiest places in the whole country my wife's from central pennsylvania and my little sister's in bucks county and that's why these were so easy to agree to do because i could go stay with my sister and screw around with my nephew but now this damn internet business i don't get to do anything fun um i i'm i'm gonna really try my best not to just do a repeat of um conversations that we've already had however i've gotta lay a little bit of a foundation in the two planning sessions that judy and kim and i have had and trying to figure out what's relevant to this group and what might be purely repetitive i'm going to really try and focus on a couple of specific things which testing and driving because i think as you guys are considering these things legislatively that's incredibly important as well as what we know about mental health and co-occurring issues associated with thc um i i'm also as any of you know who've read anything i've written or seen anything i've done specifically most interested in um the effects that uh the industrialization has on consumption patterns as well as the actual products people are consuming so we're going to discuss those briefly as well um jeff in that paper you had i i honed in right away on the underlying part you had where it said that we there all three bills are encouraging um small business to keep the big players out and so i'm gonna talk to that for a minute too because pennsylvania is not the first to try that um okay so let's see if i can share the screen again for any of you who have been a party uh to stuff that i've done in the past um bear with me on this little bit of a review but we've gotta we gotta have some foundational knowledge but i guarantee it won't be nearly as much as usual all right let's see if i can get this little block thing out of here okay cool um kim can you see my screen okay everything look good looks great sounds great imagine that [Laughter] all right 21st century this is different we were talking about something very very different than what you smoked in the 70s and i i think that one of the most important part parts to doing a responsible job of considering this is that you've got to first recognize that we are not talking about the plant that so many people think that we are talking about um though those days are um they're they've passed into myth and history uh because this is a new school of cannabis and for us especially those of you who are lawmakers those of you who are charged with representing uh us and taking care of us from a policy standpoint you have to understand what it is people are consuming today for um us to do a good job of actually regulating it so the the idea that we have that we know so much about cannabis almost always comes from our own personal experience if not our own personal experience it's second hand experience and i would challenge that other than alcohol cannabis is probably the only substance in this country that everybody either has first or second hand experience with and the vast majority of people do not have first hand experience with it despite what they say most people have never consumed um but everybody knows a guy all you all went to school with somebody um you've got an uncle you've got a sister you've got everybody knows someone who at some point has consumed and the issue that that um that brings up is that we we think that we understand this because we know folks uh who have been exposed to it in the past but here's the reality of it that unless um you have consumed or know very well someone who has consumed commercial products that were produced within the last couple of years um you really your your construct of what this is is incredibly antiquated and that's dangerous if you've got an industry that knows exactly what it is they're selling and what it is they're doing and we don't understand exactly what it is we're regulating and what it is that we are trying to um be responsible with so here's all you gotta do to understand um the situation these next two slides unfortunately these data um have not been continued past 2010 um the 2011 was reporting that we got into 2010 anyway sorry we're not going to see a continuation of these data but this was amazing because it was done at a national level and beginning in 1960 and ending um last measured year 2010 reported 2011 this is the percentage of thc inside of cannabis over 50 years a representative sample from law enforcement seizures from every state and what a couple of things for you to understand that thc is the psychoactive component inside of cannabis if you don't have thc you've got hemp you've got a really interesting textile that incidentally makes the shoes that i'm wearing at the moment and has nothing whatsoever to do with getting high uh you you you've got a plant that's used to build and do things with with the thc you get um the the high so the more thc a little oversimplified here but the more thc you've got in it um the higher somebody's going to be able to get okay so when we talk about cannabis traditionally and something that i think is exceptionally important for you to understand especially as you're having conversations with people who like to cite the history of it is that when we began measuring this at um university in mississippi in 1960 we see what really naturally occurs inside the cannabis and what goes uh you know we've seen this uh there's actually been mummified cannabis plants that we found that we can test inside of tombs in asia and africa and we know that what naturally occurs inside of cannabis is somewhere between a point two and a point five percent thc that is the substance that humankind has interacted with for millennium of course there were some exceptions with higher percentages particularly around some religious traditions but you certainly weren't seeing anything more than maybe two or three percent thc globally anywhere in the world um until the 1970s so what ended up happening and since this is america it's fun knowing the history and learning a little we can actually kind of tell you what led to this spike um and then the rest of this is just good um uh gardening this is just folks who know how to um cultivate stronger and stronger and stronger because in this country we like to get high so here's the this is the most important thing i think i'm going to show you uh today is this next slide so um set the coffee down lean in get ready to take a picture of this one because th this is to me sort of what it's all about so i'm showing you 50 years in increments of 2.5 percent so over the past 50 years this is how much it's grown i am adding colorado to that in the blue and unfortunately these data will never be continued either um the whistleblower who came out with all of them anyway long story what you see here is the transformation of a plant into a commercialized drug and as we talk and discuss the importance of understanding and regulating we must move away from the hyperbole that describes this simply as a plant because it is no longer a plant this is a manufactured substance this isn't grown outside by farmers this is produced indoors by chemists with the intent of getting as much thc into a product as you can to sell for as cheaply as you possibly can because the math is really really simple um colorado has relatively good data we don't have anything after um sales gear 2018 but in sales year 2018 of all of the weed thc that we sold in colorado which was a lot um almost 80 of all of the thc was purchased by 20 of the consumers meaning that those who consume on average eight times daily are the ones who are driving eighty percent of this market they want stronger they don't just want stronger they need stronger because the way the tolerance works with this very very different than alcohol and opiates tolerance to thc is a different thing so what you see and what happens is that that fringe uh the smaller group of people who are absolutely buying and consuming the most are the ones who drive it and that's why you get pushing potencies like this because it's just driven by a market need so again i would challenge um the the idea that this is the same thing that humankind has consumed and interacted with for millennium it absolutely is not it has gone from a plant to a drug when we moved away from good gardening to good chemistry uh and the chemistry is even better now and and i thought it was nice that uh there there's an intent to try and keep it small and keep the big industries out but that will not happen uh you might figure out keeping them out for a little bit but the the reality is that the chemists from here the chemist from california the the folks with the phds who are actually manipulating this plant to get that amount of thc into it they're going to be in pennsylvania in a minute the same way they went to canada the same way they went to washington and oregon and there's um there is a multi-billion dollar a lot of different ways to count how much it is but probably around a 20 billion dollar industry behind this movement it's not so much a movement as it is a marketing campaign at this point and you had better believe that they are not going to let a state the size of pennsylvania allow the mom and pops to make the money from that mom and pops might make it for a couple of months but uh give it a minute med men will be in town like they are everywhere next most important thing that i decided you had to understand um is that the dsm which is the manual that uh mental health professionals and psychiatrists use to diagnose um it's where you get the icd code so that we can you know bill insurance and all of this kind of business um the last version of it the five which came out i think it's been three years now somebody will correct me on that if i'm not wrong um if i'm wrong included objective diagnostic criteria for cannabis withdrawal and um the reason why this is so so significant is that the idea of physical withdrawal from thc um up until the last couple of years was like like a funny joke like they would be like oh i must be withdrawing because i stopped laughing at spongebob like i must be withdrawing because i haven't bought um cheetos in the last two weeks like it cannabis withdrawal from a physical standpoint wasn't really a thing but in the last couple of years it has become a thing um so my actual job now um and the reason why i'm up in the mountains i took over a small men's only treatment program up here called the foundry um and i said at the ceo desk for it and while our numbers aren't big we work with 25 or 30 guys at a time um we're on the absolute front lines of this and we see it just like everybody in my field is saying if you ask man ask your colleagues and friends in pennsylvania what they're saying with it the the physical withdrawn the need to treat that physical withdrawal from thc is um is one of the best problems that we're saying over the last couple of years and there's not um there are no pharmacologic interventions for it it's not like we've got [Music] drugs to help people come off of this it's also something that's so little is known about that it's not often being treated adequately um and i'll tell you that it's a very very real thing and it's a big deal and it's also important for those of you who work in my field i believe that there are some of you on here fellow um mental health uh professionals and prevention folks to understand that as somebody is going through this for the i mean really out to about 16 days with a resurgence it seems like um 10 to 14 days or so they can be getting their asses kicked physically they can be really going through some hard stuff and struggling and so for up for us i think it's part of our responsibility to um learn more about this and understand the ways that we can treat it but but the simple fact that today we are categorizing thc uh with objective criteria for physical withdrawal should show you how very much um this drug has changed because it wasn't so um the most important factors when we are discussing dependence and now we're going to we're going to shift into diagnosable substance use disorder or cannabis use disorder are these age of onset frequency of use and thc potency and what we have found is is that so when we consider thc an addiction um it is very real absolutely objectively quantifiable and it's not easy to treat um i'm not going to go into the details of how this is quantified because i've done that in a lot a lot of different places but when you hear the marijuana is not addictive sort of a thing um that's that's uh old school that's somebody who hasn't stayed up on anything or it's somebody who's trying to manipulate the facts of it because objectively speaking without bias and without the politics of it all um thc absolutely is addictive and i mean to the point where where we get physical dependence on it uh the reason one of the reasons why it's not easy to treat is because you have people saying stuff like that it's not addictive nobody's ever died from it and i'll tell you though again those of you who work inside of my field um consider the microaggressions that exist in there when we get somebody into treatment we say something like oh it's just weed well you don't need a detox it's it's only that it's it's very difficult for us to treat i think because we bring so much bias into it and if you can imagine the social fallout that there is for somebody who raises their hand and said i need treatment for my thc addiction if somebody says i gotta i gotta kick heroin it's time for me to get off meth i need to stop drinking everybody rallies around them and supports them since a lot of the times our communities are made up of other people who consume thc when we say guys i think i need to stop thc the number of hurdles that they have had to cross and jump over to get there a lot of the times is pretty profound like it takes a lot of effort to stick with it as everybody's gonna push back on it with these totally antiquated ideas that it's um uh it's not addictive i think these probably have to be the same folks who are saying um it's not warming up and uh cobit's just gonna go away and everything's awesome there are people who just aren't really paying super close attention to what's actually happening it often requires much longer stays in treatment as well as antipsychotic medications to balance the psychosis that happens that we'll discuss a little bit in the beginning and the trick with it requiring longer stays is that as insurers i'm sure they know exactly what's happening but you know and insurers don't really like paying for things what you see is big big pushback from insurance companies on actually staying in treatment for as long as it takes um we had a case recently where it was um six weeks uh before the young man's psychotic symptoms actually died down to a point where we could start to to treat and of course at that point insurance had long since stopped paying and um we were just floating them um he was staying here and a big part of it was because i was really curious personally about how long it would take for him to kind of come back to earth and it was a pretty beautiful thing to see when it happened but um it takes a longer time to treat him so traditional addiction rates to thc were around 10 uh and this this is what we used up until about 2012 and in 2012 um there were some uh studies that would suggest that it was depending on those um those uh um factors i showed you before onset frequency and potency that would be up to about fifteen percent and in a huge meta study just published this month um we see that those are actually reaching as high as 30 percent as a result of the increased potency so a rate of 30 percent uh an addiction rate of 30 percent to a substance is pretty significant so that means that um a person will meet the objective diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder about a third of everybody who is exposed um can get to that point again this is this is why you've gotta stop thinking about it is the cheech and chong plant and the giant you know two foot long doobie that somebody's rolling up and the smoke all day and get a little hungry sort of a thing um were it still that substance you absolutely would not see this so a lot of these uh patients with a substance use disorder in cannabis require physical detox as well as medical intervention and the medical intervention um at this point at least uh revolves mostly around antipsychotic medications um because there's a difference so a lot of folks who come in to get treated for thc are experiencing psychosis um and what you've got to do which we'll talk about in a minute and what you've got to do is determine um and figure out if you're looking at a psychotic episode or a psychotic break a psychotic episode um you come back from a psychotic break some kind of shifts up here so a lot of the times we find ourselves administering short-term antipsychotic drugs in order to get to a point where we can can actually treat the patient and again i i i fully recognize that when you talk about this stuff and if we had longer i would have done a much better job of dancing and and uh easing into it so you wouldn't think i was some crazy reefer madness kind of dude but we just don't have time for it the the reality is that guys i'm a recovering drug addict raising from thc was a big part of it 24 years so we're raising three kids in public school in the weed capital of the country who runs an addiction treatment program here i got a pretty damn good viewpoint and i recognize that some of this might be hard for people to hear that no no you can't require physical detox no no they're not actually taking antipsychotics yes you are and and yes that's exactly what we are doing and um i i hope that a lot of us can shed our own bias and our own desires for this to be a quick fix and a panacea and something that'll make everything work to recognize that what's actually happening here is different than what we thought so here's what um a commercialized market looks like and again i don't have time to go into the economics of it just brief so you understand the vast majority of thc is purchased by the most dedicated consumers the people who use multiple times daily and because of the way the thc um binds and in the way that your tolerance grows to it you you just gotta keep getting it stronger to get the same effect so remember the couple of slides ago where i told you that what naturally occurs and up until um a couple of decades ago was 0.2 to 0.5 percent thc um we're seeing products right now that are pretty much pure thc 99.99 thc which is um remarkable for a lot of reasons but the the one of the ones i'd like to point out to you is that no recreational state no matter how hard they've tried has ever limited potency we attempted in colorado two years later when a lot of people here felt buyers remorse a big group of folks got together and they tried to uh impose a limit of 16 thc in colorado and the reason why they used 16 was um it's the best information that we have um about the the effects of high potency thc is capped out at about 16 percent um we really have no idea what um 20 thc is doing to the human brain and body from a scientific standpoint i can tell you um anecdotally and what we see but we we tried to stop it at 16 percent here in colorado and um you saw an industry unite uh like nothing i'd ever seen before and they said we'll kill the market it'll kill the concentrate market um you can't do that you don't understand what you're doing the problem is they uh this this industry banks on the fact that we don't understand what they are doing and what they are doing like any other industry that has addictive potential anyone food opiates alcohol porn it doesn't matter every single one of those industries has to drive user engagement and the way that the cannabis industry drives user engagement is by getting more people dependent on it and the higher the thc potency the more dependent the other things that matter the most um certainly when a person begins consuming it and they're going to say the same stuff that the tobacco industry said because they're saying here in colorado oh we'd never want a kid to get high oh good god we'd never want a kid to get high and i i've got literally over 600 photographs just of the most egregious clear dedicated marketing to children using cartoon characters you know using stuff that would make joe camel um turn over in in his grave spuds mckenzie look like nothing because we don't recognize that this is what they're trying to do trying to drive use so that they can make more money one of the things i love about um kim and judy and and the entire organization here is the fan is the focus that we have on children and the importance that you guys see in the developing young brain and i think it's beautiful and i think um if you guys do get an established cannabis industry inside of pennsylvania you might have some friends there because they absolutely also have a focus on youth and on the developing young brain because that is how they drive profits that and creating stuff like this 99.9 thc so what we all have these ideas about the you know mom and pop kind of farm um farm-to-table cannabis and everything this is what's really going on behind the scenes drive potency drive use drive early engagement and so here we are thinking well we're going to regulate this thing and we're going to teach people how to do it we're going to wait because because when i was a kid this was how we drove around and meanwhile the industry is like awesome pops you go ahead and figure out building a regulatory infrastructure for your freaking model t well we're ripping around in this thing and let's see who comes out with the money at the end of it all because weed isn't weed anymore it's not this this bud that you see here it's um wax and it's uh butter and it's chatter um the and again we we don't have uh i don't have the time to to get into all of this but what you've got to understand is that the lion's share of the market the most money in colorado is being spent on concentrates these are concentrates this is what the cannabis market in colorado looks like it's not 60 year olds buying buds it's 21 year olds buying this and sharing it with other young people it this is a concentrate so concentrated cannabis and you'll see your um proposed bills all have language that includes this in it this is what the commercial thc market looks like it's not plants and buds and pretty things it's this because this is how you get higher thc potency into a product so that folks can um overcome the the tolerance that they've built up and and here's um really the future of commercialized thc markets a thing called a distillate um this is the this is what um our market is sort of centered around in colorado when you go to the dispensaries it's on counters i go to lots of dispensaries um this so that's that's what's being sold as weed and i'd like everybody just to take a second and look at that and shake your head and say that's not weed no it's not it's a concentrated thc that started looking like this uh this was before it was cooled that's great distillate water clear no alchemy just pure science can you imagine the scientific acumen it must take to go from a green organic material to this and then we package it up and we sell it like that it's not weed but it's absolutely being sold as and this is the majority of our the market in colorado there you think you'd ever see the day um that's a commercialized cannabis market this this is all thc and then vaping you guys have better things about this uh i'm not going to cover it edibles are a huge problem the issue with them is that you have multiple servings and you guys will too multiple servings inside of um one package and because of the uh okay so there's no fda oversight nobody is overseeing this at the federal level so that means every state has to manage um all of these um food products and topical products and things which is definitely something that states are not used to doing because it's fda's job but since this is federally illegal fda can't have anything to do with it so what is ended up happening is the um the edible market is exploded uh and to include things like this if you so edibles we traditionally thought of as like baking an organic material into a brownie or something like that here here's an edible um that's infused with a distillate so if you remember the distillate what i was what i was showing you that clear liquid that's 99.9 percent purity it's not just thc it's um isolated at the submolecular level to pull out just the delta 9 thc so now we have and because we do it by weight not by potency you've got these so this is a hundred milligrams right here you can see it even though colorado law says that you can only have 10 milligrams per serving what the package for this will say is that you're to separate each one of those into tents before consuming and again it's not um then eating 10 milligrams of organic material it's 10 milligrams of distillate here's um a granola what do you call like a graham cracker size thing with a thousand milligrams hundred legal servings and it'll say on it separate into one hundreds uh the problem is that young people just don't do that but does a nice job of getting them to be returning dedicated customers look these have a thousand milligrams of sodas cake pops chocolate bars this industry is insidious and this industry doesn't have regulatory bounds and nobody understands it well enough to actually go in and regulate it and say hang on what exactly is in this poo tang pi cannabis that's being sold as medical um how is it being how are we assured that it is not full of things that i shouldn't have in it how are we assured that it actually has the potency it says that it does and that we're so far behind in our understanding of it they're just kind of doing what they want so ketchup and hot sauce coffee k-cup coffee thc infused lemonade ice cream and candies granola bars thc infused nasal mist topical intoxicating thc thc um pills so you can swallow and get high thc infused lollipops thc teas little uh gummies there's things made to look exactly like other candies obviously with 100 milligrams of thc in it pot rocks it's not a joke that's a real thing again very clearly not being marketed to the 40 year old responsible user because i'm not psyched on sour apple pot rocks i think my kids would be and they know that there's uh keef cola makes a soda with 350 milligrams of thc in it you can actually get for less than that now um and a little warning label on it that says separate it into 30 fifths uh 35 servings and that is what that little cap is right there 135th so go ahead and put keith cola into youtube tonight and see how many of those kids are separating it in the 35th if you keep up with rap culture at all here's your pre-made thc syrup and i thought that was pretty incredible there's thc water seems to me to be the apex of things the point being once you've got this commercial market in place everything that can be put into your body is going to be made with thc in it that means you know how are you going to tell if somebody's eating a regular candy bar or a 350 milligram thc candy bar um the liquid thc if the five hour energy they just took is five hour energy or if it's actually thc there's a intoxicating underarm applying thc here's thc breast spray the list goes on and on and on let's move to mental health consequences associated with casual use so casual use and uh for this particular incident we're looking at uh 10 to 12 percent thc 10 to 12 percent and we know the higher the thc the higher these numbers and this is the part of this that i just listen if we decide to move down this path in this country fine and it's what i said in my book i think that there are probably better things to spend our time and treasure on but if this is what we decide that we want to do in this country fine we just have to be honest about the risks associated with because it's being sold all the time as this perfect there's no issue everything's great um cow why didn't we think of this 50 years ago sort of a thing when that's not honest uh because the the mental health implications that are associated with this are fairly significant and they're things that every single day of the week um i'm seeing and working with and to to you know write this off is to write off the suffering of a lot of people with significant mental health issues that are either complicated or created by their thc consumption so the risk of depression is 1.4 times increased with casual use we do not have any idea if that is causal so do more people consume because they have a depressive disorder or do you get a depressive disorder when you consume more don't know the answer to that we know that acute anxiety is causal causal so we know that uh in in the higher the potency it would seem the more acute or the the louder the acute anxiety is so we know that um somebody who tends to be anxious to begin with when they are consuming these higher potency and higher potency here i mean i'm talking about like 10 and certainly it escalates and escalates from there um that it causes acute anxiety there is an increased risk of anxiety disorders we don't yet know if it's causal um we'll we'll see what happens with that one i think kind of uh common sense is going to tell us something there but we'll wait for the science to hash that one out you have considerably worsened outcomes in treating bipolar disorder um a pretty brilliant psychiatrist who i know um who spent a lot of time considering and thinking about this said uh what what i think it has to be is that um this higher potency stuff is kind of always changing the chemistry of the brain in unpredictable ways and so it makes it very difficult for us to keep up with um balancing medications for it and then the risk of attempted suicide requiring hospitalizations which is sort of the big measuring factor because we can ask a person questions there we know it was um a very serious attempt but they're uh not deceased so we can probe into it a little bit the risk of suicides requiring hospitalization is twice as likely and somebody who consumes casually which should sort of be the end of it if you look at colorado's numbers this is i wish everybody who was thinking about this would do if you just look at colorado's numbers causation correlation i don't know and we will never know but we have never recorded higher teen suicide rates in colorado than we have the last six years we have never recorded higher overdose rates from opiates than we have the last five years so this isn't this thing that you're going to introduce and everything's going to get fixed use of any cannabis at all is associated with one and a half time increased risk in psychosis so psychosis is kind of this big generic word for um the pejorative would be crazy but for mental illness and it can show up in a lot of different ways and regular use so uh twice a week would be associated with a twofold increased risk of psychosis and again here when when we took when if you look at this third bullet point when we're talking about high potency i want you to keep in mind that we were talking about a 12 so higher potency cannabis more frequent use and genetic susceptibility so the presence of those can increase your risk of psychosis by eight fold listen if if there was like a chemical that was found inside of this coffee cup that i'm drinking from right now that did one fifth of this there would be a ban on it tomorrow an absolute across the board band until we figured out what it was because um we finally are starting to wise up and care about mental health um in this country a little bit and um to have setbacks like this is pretty ridiculous so any use before the age of 18 sees a two and a half time increase risk in the diagnosis of schizophrenia that risk increases as dosage increases so probably pretty causal so here are the acute physical health and i'm going to just run through these because i want to talk about the testing impaired memory motor coordination react time singular focus reduction and perceptual accuracy those are all very very very important skills when it comes to driving and if you you look into so everybody keeps good numbers on this the rocky mountain hydra report high intensity drug trafficking area has some great numbers but um so so do all of the um departments of transportation and all legalized states and the uh traffic safety institute um the the rate of our um fatal crashes where the driver is positive for thc is you know it's a line on the graph that just goes straight up um these are things these are skills that you need for driving and working so here's the issue with it uh chronic use for pregnancy i'm sorry but i have to run through it because i want to make sure we get our time going here so here's the testing and driving you cannot measure impairment any other way than with a dre a drug recognition expert that's a specially trained member of law enforcement who's going to put somebody through about half an hour's worth of um tests physical tests to just to see if they're intoxicated or not because um thc is fat soluble we have seen it stay measurably in a person's system for up to 72 days with marilyn heuses look at a beautiful wonderful elegant study um so we also have found as you're seeing people say things like well we'll be able to test this way and don't worry this product is going to come out that law enforcement will be able to do a roadside the method of ingestion makes that whole thing moot we can tell when somebody has smoked but as you saw a tiny little sample of there's so many ways to consume that aren't smoking where it ends with us is that the presence of thc inside of somebody's system be that urine hair uh blood the presence of thc does not indicate intoxication and colorado has decided on five nanograms per milliliter is our benchmark for sobriety or 0.08 equivalent if you will less than five nanograms per milliliter does not indicate sobriety so you may ask okay well if if under five nanograms doesn't indicate sobriety and over five nanograms doesn't indicate intoxication how do you determine intoxication back to the first bullet point you cannot measure intoxication other than done by a dre so you could have a person who consumes on friday night goes into work on monday alongside somebody who was consuming the entire way into work that day or who ate an edible and they could be involved in a workplace accident both of them are going to test the same depending on the way that they test and how things go one of them clearly intoxicated one of them not but as soon as you change the laws of the state where it's a person's right to have thc inside of their system um everything changes and i will tell you guys the uh maybe it's because it's early and i'm um tired and i just saw how old i look in the mirror versus how young i looked in that picture maybe there's just not a lot of time anymore i'll tell you that until we have a reliable and responsible way of measuring intoxication at the roadside anybody who moves forward with this this is checking a box being okay with more intoxicated driving and i really don't think that in the 21st century i have to make much of a case about why driving under the influence isn't a good idea here are a couple of places to look please um i'm a board member with these guys sam smart approaches to marijuana much more politically minded um more politically minded than i am but uh good place to start if you're interested in getting involved nida the national institute for drug abuse samhsa smart colorado is a group of moms basically that um personifies the buyer's remorse um who have joined together to try and tell other people what's going on and then just make sure that you use a critical eye when you're looking i subscribe to probably every single pro cannabis newsletter and website on the planet just so i can keep up with things and just remember that the more money is involved in something on either side uh the more apt people are to sort of twist it to what they want to do there's a copy of my book it should be your barnes and noble um amazon wherever i don't think it's a particularly good book it's not high art um but uh i think there's some helpful information in it 7 30 nailed it questions awesome job ben you did it thank you so much great stuff um we have some really great questions um i want to start with a comment though that's um quite heartbreaking and i want to thank this person for sharing this this person said thank you so much for telling the truth about marijuana our son died by suicide in april he had marijuana induced psychosis there was no convincing him that marijuana was the problem and the treatment center that he attended failed to deal with the root issue even though we shared with the physician and social worker that we could see that marijuana abuse and psychosis that company were the problem and i'll just say that you know i um i'm assertive judy and i are both certified family recovery specialists i i facilitate a support group every week i've been doing that for nine years the support group thing ten years really um a week doesn't go by that somebody isn't lamenting the the fallout certainly not always to this extreme and again we're so sorry for your loss um but it is it is just um infuriating when i hear people say nobody ever died from overdosing on marijuana well first of all an an overdose does not necessarily mean death and overdose means toxicity you can overdose from a lot of things i can overdose on aspirin you know so that doesn't mean you're going to die but it's certainly what i'm really seeing is the the loss of motivation and the loss of connection to the family the isolation i mean our kids do not need to be isolating more than they already have to right now social media is contributing to that let's not add something that that one of the number one side effects of using this substance is lack of motivation apathy that sort of thing so um i just want to say this is a truly serious topic and when people say you know it's not fair to to incarcerate someone of course we agree with that but it's also not fair to minimize the effects that this has on a young person that's the end of my speech about that but i really want to thank this person for sharing that well said and um cannabis induced psychosis is a very very real thing and a very loud problem and i'm so sorry um we see it every day here too i'm so sorry kim i can go through these questions the pre questions that you want or we can run through the ones i've tried to answer some of them how do you want to do it well let me just say that that um a question that came up a lot is how do we help our community members understand this share this video this if if this doesn't help explain the the potential you know challenges i don't know what will so please share this video um and i did load ben's powerpoint on that page that i mentioned the video will be there later tons of resources are there and for for folks that are asking about parenting and the challenges of convincing our our sons and daughters um and by the way judy and i both had those conversations several years ago with our sons um who are thankfully in recovery today but um that program on october 27th is going to address a lot of that that is going to be very specifically about parenting so that's on our online page so again check that out but ben i think if you want to pick some of those um advanced questions that you'd like to address go right ahead so let me run through the advanced ones because um you guys sent those in and then i'm looking at the other ones i'll get to those as well um the how can communities be helped to understand that marijuana use can be harmful i think that the most important thing is that we all just keep having honest conversations and then we not shy away from um the pushback that you're gonna get with folks because a lot of the times especially somebody who the the circles that i roll in and travel in um tend to be a little bit more on the left leaning side most of the time when you bring this up you know folks like whoa hold on what are you talking about just um be willing to have the awkward and uncomfortable conversations and know that if you got the facts behind you let the pundits be the pundits and let the the people who are just trying to profit off of this uh do and say their thing i think it's our job to move this conversation into a more intelligent place so how how can you help and especially about seeking treatment so this is listen not all treatment is created equal in another life i spent a lot of time and then still in some ways continue to spend a lot of time making sure that people in my industry are actually doing a good job with it look look into the program really well ask him some hard questions and and here's the bottom line um this is something that uh for me it's 12-step work um i'll put my email address inside one of these things if you've got questions specific questions about how to help a kid um i i would be more than happy to either walk through that with you or to put you in touch with somebody who can help with it because um that's the way we stay sober is doing those things i thought this was a wonderful question how do i balance my support for decriminalization of cannabis and my concern that the damage that frequently being high has on people i support the decriminalization of cannabis i i have written this for for years for for pushing a decade now that i don't see any issue at all with decriminalisation decriminalizing possession and realistically um we had de facto decriminalization in colorado prior to this whole like all these people were arrested sort of a thing um they were fined i mean anything under two ounces of cannabis in colorado was a hundred dollar fine and most of the time it was dismissed like you would a traffic thing but that's what they were calling arrests so i don't think that there is any problem at all with supporting decriminalization of a thing and saying no to the industrialization of it this is where i think the vernacular gets super duper important when everybody says we want to legalize um yeah you don't uh most of the politicians who are involved in this thing when uh the when decriminalization comes up their lobbyists push back hard and they say well no decriminalization is not really a solution the only solution is you know letting us make hundreds of millions of dollars in doing it and and that's just uh ridiculous the efficacy of this drug and behavioral health treatment per diagnosis so um pretty much every behavioral health you could condition you can think of um uh ptsd uh adhd and then certainly the more severe ones bipolar disorder depressive disorder anxiety thc is contraindicated for the use with and we certainly would not some want somebody using it um you know like freely like take as much of this uh as often as you want for as long as you want it would be done in a physician-monitored uh way with an actual prescribable medication one of the big things that people miss is that um one cannot prescribe a marijuana it can't be done it's a schedule one controlled substance the way that your law is written um allows a physician to recommend the use of but you can't prescribe that somebody smoke a plant because that's not how it works in this country things go through fda approval and fortunately like thank god because some of them are doing some amazing things we have some fda approved cannabis cannabis-based medications because there absolutely is medicine inside of the cannabis plant absolutely there is the trick is to separate it out and to give it to folks effectively but um to use smoked cannabis is an intervention for behavioral health issues is a no-no um is it possible to help our adult kids understand how weed and other substances is negatively affecting their lives yeah absolutely it is everything is possible uh and and i think the the first thing that we have to do is to get a little bit educated on it um i really i for the most part was tired of traveling and wanted to be with my kids and that's why i wrote that book and i have a chapter in there called something of that effect you know how to argue with a 17 year old or how to talk to your kids or something like that um there are lots of effective ways to do it and i'll tell you that the the first recommendation that i'll give you is don't come into it angrily don't walk into that conversation when things are bad don't walk away from something like this with information that becomes weaponized and yell and confront and holler i've i've always found that the very best way to have hard conversation during good times is to sit down with the person i love uh at a place that they really enjoy and feel comfortable if it's a dinner if it's outside if it's it and then to try and bring it up when we come into them with um anger what they hear is that anger when we come into those conversations with genuine love and concern it's much easier for them to understand that um so that this is in my opinion is cannabis addiction most similar to alcohol addiction or does it have a a different effect so what you use is just diagnostic criteria for them the symptoms are obviously very very different the lethality associated with alcohol alcohol is far and away the most um dangerous substance inside of this country unless you were to count tobacco but um from immediate deaths and uh it's not necessarily that alcohol is way worse than all these other things it's just more commercialized and used so we covered that one you asked how can we convince the legislators that legalization doesn't increase revenue you just simply show them the numbers um that have come out of colorado california everybody else and then um you you hope that they actually look at that and don't get pulled into the political discussion um there was a for somebody i got you kim for somebody who really wants to understand that question there was a brilliant researcher who sat on the pro legalization side of this thing who unfortunately passed away uh two years ago i think named mark kleiman out of the university of washington and dr kleinman had dedicated the last i think 20 years of his career into trying to determine exactly how you could adequately tax this vice substance to pay for the the impacts of it without just building the black market up and as you've seen colorado california all these places that have big commercial industries our black market has um dramatically increased it hasn't decreased it's increased since so where dr kleinman came up with um what was almost an impossibility like to tax it at a high enough rate that you would make up for the costs associated with you would just create a black market to tax it at a low enough rate um to get rid of the black market you wouldn't even get close to it you have to look at tobacco and alcohol as the paradigm any vice any by substance so we've got 60 years worth of data and for every dollar that we earn in taxing alcohol it costs us about nine dollars and for every dollar that we earn in taxing tobacco it costs us about eleven dollars societally kim i was just going to add thank you those are really great points um on our on that follow-up page the cannabis page um judy put together some talking points i also shared that piece that jeff has together that jeff hanley mentioned at the beginning so also a finder for how to find your legislator so that i think is the most important thing you can do and they should be paying attention right now because if you haven't noticed it's election season so what uh what kind of tax structure do you recommend for concentrate thc products um i am sort of a you you figure this out and i don't live there uh don't tell me in colorado what to do which was what pissed me off because like all the people who were pushing this were from california and stuff when they came out um and so i'm gonna let you guys make up your own decision on that well in just about everything but this is why i'm fr concentrates just have no place in the world none like they don't belong until we have a much better understanding of what they are doing to the human brain and body the only place that they have any worth is in the portfolio of the cannabis industry they don't belong in a person's brain or body so what is my suggested tax rate for that none because don't sell it because when we're selling it we're just kind of pandering to what it is they want to do um how did i overcome my struggles i just woke up one day and everything was better uh what no it was awful um a lot a lot of 12-step was what did it for me um i got involved in that world and that's a very long and um interesting story that took place a lot of it between pennsylvania and washington dc um but uh what they say you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired and eventually i just got that gift of desperation where i i i wanted something else um inevitable got that one got that one okay why are states putting this question on the voters ballot if the lessons from colorado show it's a bad idea when's the last time we did things that made great political sense i i don't care which side of this thing you're on if you like the dude from reality television or if you like the dude who's been in politics for 50 years i don't care who you're going to vote for i'll ask you do we really have a choice between the finest two americans when his politics made sense and the reason why these things end up on a ballot is because you have massive commercial industries behind it and those industries can get anything they want to on the ballot i've joked before that if you give me enough money i'll bet you i can get on the ballot and convince enough coloradans that um in order to keep our fires at bay here we should sacrifice a puppy every monday in town square give me enough money to sell that message and you can sell anything um ben i just think we need to note that in pennsylvania we're not talking about a ballot issue we're talking about legislation so it could happen without anybody's input other than the people in harrisburg you know the only people who've done that so far quick little trivia here the only state so far who has passed legislatively anybody illinois no illinois people of pennsylvania you could put yourselves up right next to the state that brought us everything else that takes place in illinois um okay i'm gonna run through the questions that we have here i didn't think medical marijuana could be prescribed to children until i did an assessment so again i'll um make sure you get the vernacular uh straight on it you cannot prescribe marijuana can't be prescribed and i don't know what the specific laws are in colorado um you can be under 18 and get a recommendation here judy do you know the answer to that one or jeff yeah it is illegal in pennsylvania for anyone under the age of 18 however a caregiver can get registered and on behalf of of the um their their child or half of the youth of the year there are some fda approved medications that um one in particular that can be just fantastic for children especially children with a very rare um seizure disorder um called epidialex and so that is a cannabis derived medication that is prescribed often to young kids well i mean often there's probably a couple hundred kids in the entire state on maybe maybe 100 kids in the whole state because of such a rare condition but other than that no nobody's telling a kid that they should smoke something so explain how tolerance is different from alcohol so here's going to be your i'm going to give you a two-minute answer to a 20-minute question um you get to a point of tolerance with alcohol where your body doesn't let you get any more tolerant we've seen this um jaundice liver failure kidney failure etc you get to a point where ethanol so saturates things that um you're just not able to keep putting it in because you'll die and then ultimately um you it'll take you less and less and less alcohol the further you go down the spectrum to get intoxicated because your body's no longer processing it well enough the difference with thc and one of the because there is no uh lethality associated with overdose from it works very very differently it saturates and binds to cannabidiol receptors rather than um anyway so what ends up happening is we just over saturate those receptors and over saturate those receptors and different from the other drugs particularly alcohol you have cannabidiol receptors throughout your entire body i mean almost every little bit of you has these receptors inside of the top of your head to your toes and so what we'll end up doing is um creating a um a need for introduced uh thc to bind to these receptors in in such large amounts that what your body produces naturally won't be able to bind to it so um the way that it's different is the tolerance is essentially unending like you can just keep getting more and more and more and more tolerant um i i really encourage you to watch some youtube videos and you guys have seen me before you know my favorite guy is um somebody called stoner's r weed um and because he has a program called kill a friend day where he gives people his first their first concentrate hit but the thing that's so interesting about him is he consumes concentrates regularly and you can see people who the first time they consume a concentrate um acute psychosis passing out go crazy you see a blood pressure spike and things like this and then you see people who've been consuming concentrates for a little bit they can consume and consume and consume and have no noticeable affect change so you can keep going forever withdrawal symptoms probably the easiest thing for you to do is just google that they'll give you those um definitively the the most frustrating ones that we see for people are um sleep uh and anxiety and diet issues but uh anxiety and aggression are pretty big ones too you mentioned deaths and seems and and seem to imply that there have been overdose deaths caused by over consumption of thc are there such cases no not really i mean there's like one or two in the literature but i think they're probably pretty crazy uh and weird little one-offs however to say that no one has ever died as a result of is asinine it's to say that no one has ever died of tobacco because no one has ever overdosed from it to say that no one has ever died from um falling asleep at the wheel because they didn't overdose falling asleep at the wheel people died doing dumb things when you're intoxicated you tend to do more dumb things and there is case after case after case in colorado i wrote a chapter about it um even back then about the people who who took the lives of others directly because they were intoxicated so no uh overdose not a thing it's not a thing uh you're not gonna overdose from thc for those of us not experienced in this area can you explain how butter wax and chatter would be consumed i understand vaping yeah yes but is shatter smoke like crack yes it is it's a rock um so you would smoke it uh like you would smoke anything else in rock form so vaping is obviously the easiest because there's no associated smell with it um but it's a hot knife it's a superheated needle um that's that's how you do that judy would like to answer this question live is that what it said no no you would like it yeah isn't there some controversy about the study that showed association with marijuana use and schizophrenia and teens um so it's not a study it's multiple studies at this point like multiple and um no no there's no controversy unless you want people to allow your industry and the the controversy is going to come from the people who are waiting to profit on it what can scientist researchers do to contribute to this issue um we have a couple of pretty brilliant minds here in colorado working on some large long term which you must understand is the importance of longitudinal um as opposed to um quick short-term ones and the information that we need more than anything we're getting in utero and early life exposure data right now uh our university of colorado hospital and dr apollo riggs but what we really need is more and better long-term understandings on brain and um body everything below the shoulders of of actual high potency so not 16 uh that's that would be the the most important thing the other thing i would be particularly interested in is the sociology around um there was a book in if for those of you in the medical or scientific world um springer who publishes the medical textbooks that our doctors um use when they're in med school to uh to to to it's where all the textbooks are this year they published cannabis and medicine and uh it has uh experts from every single field of medicine um explaining interactions with drug drug different all sorts of stuff from every field of medicine and um i actually got to co-author the section on treatment and recovery from and one of the things that we could use some more research on um is recovery from as well as drugs what specific regulations would you recommend limiting location of cannabis stores advertising potency i wrote all of that in the book so again more commercials for it which i usually suck at doing but i make a buck 50 every time you buy one of those unless you buy you so go ahead and i think i stopped charging you guys long ago to do this so i'm a book um but i wrote about that it needs to be a progressive policy of um discipline that's associated with until you eventually get to a point where the economics of it don't make sense for them to do it anymore but i i wrote all about how i would do it did i miss him me comparing how the recreational legalization will affect the medical field no because i didn't really do it and i think that's probably way better asked um of your experts um here in pennsylvania who have a better idea i worked for an alternative school in pennsylvania we had an intake interview with a student who was prescribed medical use by a doctor so again um recommended versus prescribed um he just like every other pennsylvanian just like every other american cannot be prescribed cannabis they can be prescribed cannabis medications or recommended cannabis my advice to law enforcement officers when talking to students and parents about marijuana is to be as informed as possible i think a lot of the times when when we come at them and they hear old guard they shut down when you know if we're not up to date on the language and you know if if we come in and we're like hey you know you kids and your reefers and you're smoking on your mary janes and you're if if we're not informed and if we don't understand what it is they're actually consuming they're going to write us off and not listen to us at the beginning so i i guess um it's this it's the balancing the fine line between trying to be cool when we're not cool i don't know maybe maybe you're totally cool fred i like i'm not at all so i don't try to you know use words and be like yo kids this presentation is going to be straight fire you know y'all should hashtag you know what don't do that [ __ ] um what i do is just try and be me but also try to be informed so i would recommend sir um that you you just be hip to and aware of what it is they're doing and then um go into it asking questions more than telling and then if you've got enough decent information you can um you can feel those questions well the other thing i will tell you is as somebody who part of my living amends is trying to to make up to for the the crappy stuff that i did uh that involved law enforcement down there um you call me absolutely any time uh and oh here let me put my email in here and i'll help um if it's specific stuff if it's not i'll help you any way i can because um i have a great respect for the work that it is that that you and your fellow officers are doing and i thank you all for it that's all the questions fred there's my email address uh what am i missing uh there were actually a couple in the chat box that we didn't get to the definition of casual use actually it's not super well defined we would we're using two times a week okay and just for clarification you cited that that study from australia earlier um just kind of looking like is this really real 30 is now the rate of addiction can you clarify that yes it's really real um so the study is it was funny kim when you sent me the link the pubmed link it had that other researcher's name on it um uh i had seen the original publication with wayne hall um at all who is sort of the one of the leading thought leaders about but yes it's absolutely real and it's not some uh dr volkov at nida said three years ago and she was saying publicly three years ago just just wait you're going to see 30 40 addiction rates once the science can actually show what we're seeing on the streets and the problem is to get journal published peer-reviewed science takes time to throw out some sort of tagline and and quick little answer to something takes no time so science takes time wonderful uh we are i can't believe it's 10 o'clock this has flown jeff do you have any last uh thoughts comments no no no kim thank you again for having me and i appreciate it ben can you um can you provide us with a citation somebody asked for the guy from washington mark clyman about the taxation of the substance can you can you get that to us sometime so that's a summary of about 20 years of work for him so look into who mark kleiman is and read his research i i i think it's k-l-e-i-m-a-n um okay brilliant brilliant guy uh but totally sat on the us thought we should fully legalize thought we should fully allow for commercial sales um so somebody who you know he and i would be on opposite sides on the panel but brilliant researcher and um really couldn't quite get there okay thank you just put a put a link in the chat box yeah so um ben we can't thank you enough that was fabulous and um you're such a dear um treasure for all of us so thank you thank you to everyone who joined us we had more than 100 folks with us consistently this morning um which is amazing so thank you all very very much uh jeff ben judy thanks great being with you have a good rest of your day everyone follow up on that page oh and take our survey please when this ends take our survey and follow up on that page conversation dot zone slash cannabis bye-bye everyone thank you bye

the mixed berry flavor working with 10 milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams of THC so that is what we have got going guys just getting into it here and open it up for you it does have a yes do have to bite it or open it with scissors because it is childproof guys so do mind that that it is not gonna have a seal I would open it the other way I just walked up so you got your lollipop here it's got an imprint of THC with an M underneath to say medical or to dictate medical tastes really good but we're gonna get out of here guys see you shortly 30 minutes an hour so I'm like that not sure gonna let this kick in and we'll come back and I just loved you guys off meant to do it a piece but with bad guys to review this after we're high from it peace guys what's up everybody welcome back to the second part of this lollipop mile ha sucker review guys mixed berry flavor from mile high 30 milligrams of THC 10 of CBD picked up at affinity guys today the repeat that we're doing on this is gonna be the more of how to fix and things like that the first part was more of the taste I'm still eating on it obviously I didn't finish it should knock me out went to sleep but very very good guys um the taste overall when you first start into a lollipop I pop second taste is gonna be that dry Hoshi powdery type taste I don't know that house to describe it you kind of have to eat inedible to illegal edible to to kind of get that flavor or that that taste for it so thank you paying a my Lighting's perfect leave it right there so we're pancake being my lighting studio basically really really good guys I would give this a good a good eight or nine out of ten I would say it eight out of ten the flavor is pretty strong on it of candidates I have have had some edibles that geez what are you doing that don't taste as strong of cannabis or that powdery taste I'm not sure if that's really doable with a lollipop but from edibles that have had those chocolate bars and drinks and stuff like that they have tended to be a little less weedy if you will and a little more of the lollipop or the other taste so that's not really hindering the full experience of you know an enjoyable edible so that being said guys basically this stuff is like edibles are a full-body hi to me I don't ever get edibles in my head on they never messed with me in the head it's always a body high and it's always something I don't really ever feel until about 75 milligrams but this was pretty good man I I didn't mean finished all of it i I did feel some effects from it which would just be kind of lighter body and [ __ ] your body weight seems lighter I'm just kind of floating you know spaced out but it's really good edible overall guys and for something to just kind of walk down the street if you will and eat which is illegal so don't do it but yeah it's a very concealable very discreet way of getting high you know around people or you know around around nobody just to do yourself if you don't like smoking cannabis or anything like that this lollipop would be great for you guys that's gonna be it for the mixed berry mile-high sucker review guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up below and subscribe for more peace guys", "s6wv6AtOTbo": "Hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in\npublic displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida Greg is doing the narration and Jake is doing the subtitles. The candy I'm going to be making today is  sugar free Sour cherry. As I pour the hot candy onto the table let me tell you how unbelievably hot it is. This is hotter than sugar by 25 degrees F (4C). It does not seem like a lot , but ti is. \n The candy is been flavored with a natural cherry oil. Unlike most cherry candy, this does not taste like cough syrup. Also it is a great flavor for masking the flavor of the sugar free part of  the candy. I thought there would be two parts of The flavor to cover.The front of mouth taste, and that I covered with the cherry oil Then the back of mount flavor I thought I could cover mostly with a good sour. To do that I added this citric acid. It's trickier to add acid to isomalt because everything is hotter. And this citric acid while harder to add  gives this candy a crisp sour tart flavor just like you'd\nexpect from a sour cherry. Sour Cherry isan American tradition it's the most common cherry here in North America and it's known for being made into\ncherry pies and things like that but its history is ancient it was first discovered by Roman soldiers when they were on duty near the Black Sea. They  found this cherry\ngrowing in towns along the Black Sea and they brought it back\nto Rome and eventually the cherry was called the Montmorency cherry. It was  named\nafter a region of France even though it didn't come from that region in France. It was just the flavor I was going for and I'm happy how it came out. This candy is sugar-free, and as such it's not made of sugar it's\nmade of isomalt. Isomalt is a substitute a type of sugar alcohol and is a sugar substitue used primarily for its sugar like properties it has little or no impact on\nblood sugar levels and it does not stimulate the release of insulin so\npeople who aren't supposed to eat high levels of sugar this candy is good for\nisomalt is also about 1/2 the sweetness of sugar so to tweak the sweetness up a\nbit to match what we expect a hard candy to taste like we had a little bit of\nsucralose and we don't need to add much sucralose because sucralose is between\n300 and 1000 times as sweet as sugar. Since I only needed a tiny amount I used a very accurate scientific scale to get the proportions rights. So we build on the sweetness of the isomalt with the sucralose and we count on the isomalt to behave like what you expect hard candy to behave like. Neither of these mate rials promote tooth decay or effects insulin levels. I heard from so many of you that you wanted to try our candy by could not. iI's a little different to work\nwith than regular sugar it's a lot hotter when I pour it and it also sort\nof behaves more like plastic than clay so I have to get the temperature just\nright now that it's adjusted we're gonna cut off pieces and we're gonna feed it\nthrough our drop roller this little machine was made in the late 1870s and\nthis particular machine was owned by the A Cincinnati candy company. Greg\nwas able to acquire this piece of equipment because of a Kickstarter\ncampaign we did and you our fans allowed us to get it.  I want to thank all of you\nfor the support you've given us over the years this has been an amazing to get to do what we love, and have a lot of fun. All this equipment is on display and our store and is used in our store in almost a daily basis if you ever make it to tell a see Florida\nplease come on by we're located right off i-10 on the Thomasville Road exit\nand you can come and see us we open at 7:00 a.m. when we start serving\nbreakfast and we start serving ice cream at about noon and we go til 10:00 p.m.\nmost nights so you can come in we're usually open we're not making candy all\nthe time but sometimes we are and we love it when fans can catch us and can\nsee us make candy now all that's left to do is to split up\nthese sheets of candy into individual pieces and we do that by making the\ncandy live up to its name what's its name you ask fruit drops and that's what\nwe're gonna do you know it's more fun than popping bubble wrap if you want to\ntry this candy for yourself just go over to our website www.PD.net thank you very much for watching and\nthank you for letting us do what we love to do because you know

prevention program nada a division of the ministry of health i am lyra thompson hollingsworth and i will be your host for this evening's proceedings over the past few weeks we delved into several issues regarding young people and their development because in most cases substance use begins before adulthood and we would have explored into the reasons why this is so we would have presented on parenting and the facts surrounding major options for substance use namely alcohol vaping and marijuana it is intended that the information shared will empower all stakeholders and indeed every citizen who may have direct influence on a young person whether you are a parent teacher employer or a leader of your community or faith based organization and to continue to build the protective factors and to mitigate against risk factors so that our young people will be best insulated against the possibility of drug experimentation today we will be presenting on the topic of new psychoactive substances changes in the times always leads to innovation and with the dangerous drug market there is no difference your presenter for today is my colleague ms michelle nasser acting deputy director at the trinidad and tobago national forensic science center ministry of national security ms nasir has been employed at the center since july of 2000 and has been the head of the toxicology section for 17 years where she performed analyses of drugs alcohol and poisons in biological specimens and crime scene evidence she possesses a bachelor of science and master's degree in chemistry and analytical chemistry from ue saint augustine she is also the holder of a certificate in the analysis of drugs in biological specimens from the department of forensic science and medicine university of glasgow scotland and a certificate in the substance abuse prevention policy and forensic toxicology from john hopkins university baltimore maryland usa she has completed internships at the toxicology and control substances laboratories in the connecticut department of public safety and the baltimore office of the chief medical examiner in the usc as well as a fellowship to the university of toronto canada as a research assistant she has given evidence in courts of law in trinidad and tobago as an expert witness in toxicology cases she was a member of the society of forensic toxicology and made presentations at regional meetings and at the international association of forensic toxicology she sits on the steering committee of the adult drug treatment court of trinidad and tobago and assists with the opera operationalization of the children's drug treatment courts you are reminded that these sessions do not facilitate a live question and answer segment but you may send in your questions at nada programs at health.golf.tt and one of our professionals will respond in a timely manner i now hand over to you good evening and thank you mr thompson hollingsworth for that wonderful introduction my name is michelle nasser and it's a pleasure to be here the forensic science center is more often known for conducting autopsies and providing evidence in courts of law so this evening it is indeed our honor to pull back the curtain a little bit and feature the forensic science subdivision this is the lab that would usually perform tests and generate results from submissions by the triangular police service and customs i'm excited i'm inviting you to come on in and let's begin for you too better understand what we are going to be discussing and looking at i've divided into two into eight areas we're going to look at some concepts first and then we're going to see what drugs we are seeing in trinidad among the 11 to 15 year olds 16 to 21 22 to 25 year olds and then how these new psychoactive substances are coming into our markets why persons are taking them and what the health risks are and finally we'll see what is actually in our laws and whether these substances are legal or illegal so what are new psychoactive substances well the united nations office on drugs and crime divided these new substances into nine categories as you're seeing on the top right side of the screen these new substances new psychoactive substances are drugs which are designed to replicate the effects of illegal substances like cannabis cocaine and ecstasy while still remaining legal that may sound a little confusing because you have illegal substances and other drugs that act like them but there are still legal how do we understand this well illegal substances on your right like amphetamine and methamphetamine think of these as keys and all persons have done is change the keychain on the keys the keys will still work but the actual compound has changed so we see in this slide just changing one substance one functional group an extra oxygen on the compound changes impediments to catenones methamphetamines the metacatalons and so on and the catalons are now legal but if still the key part of the drug has remained the same and will still act the same way these new psychoactive substances little is known about the effects often they are being manufactured under non-ideal conditions so there's no quality control here so they can put anything in them as you'll see in the coming slides the toxic effects are also not known because drugs can be added drugs can be substituted so you're almost playing russian roulette as to what substances you will find when you take these substances it makes the effects unpredictable drug transportation is a concept we must understand because the drugs have to move from outside to inside of your cells we're going to be looking at three different ways that they can do this staying with the key and lock hypothesis think of your cell membranes as a wall of fat molecules that contain doors or doorways and the far left the yellow picture shows one particular door in trinidad we sometimes have b curtains think of this though as a b curtain molecules can pass freely through them there's no barrier these drugs are therefore fat soluble drugs and the cell walls pose no barrier to their penetrating this makes the action super quick the middle slide the purple one that these are a picture of the cell wall where the door has a lock inside of it protein molecules and the drugs are these keys that can unlock the door and get in very easily lastly there are some drugs and the suppliers know this they put two drugs together one very harmless one that almost punches in a cord into the door to open it and allow the drug true we'll see all three examples of these in the new psychoactive substances that we're going to be looking at i challenge you to tell me which drug you think is the one that is fat soluble and will penetrate through your cell membranes as if they are just be curtains no barrier lastly the last concept we're going to do before we actually look at the drugs are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics kinetics big words we're going to try to make them simple pharmacokinetics is what the body does the drug all drugs will be treated exactly like this in your body they have to be absorbed and this is where the drug transportation comes in how they get from outside the cells inside your cells then they'll be metabolized distributed and finally eliminated from the body for these drugs the target of what is usually the brain because that's the only way to keep the person addicted they're looking for that pleasure reward response pharmacodynamics is what the drug will do to the body and this is where the harmful effects will be seen so what i'm going to show you is what we're seeing in trinidad and tobago what has been submitted to the forensic science center and what we're seeing what we have confirmed as being present in the drugs i'm going to take this opportunity to talk about a drug that was pointed out to me by my uh colleague mr sinclair as a drug that is more seen among the younger population it's called lean and it's a drink everything in this drink is legal because it's just cough syrup codeine mixed with sprite with a little sweetie cola jolly rancher mixed inside of it everything there is legal it's easy to buy and so on but this is a very harmful drink that young persons are engaging in it's called lean because while they're drinking it they slowed or lean to one side and has been made popular by music among rappers and musicians it has nicknames such as the despite syrup purple drunk little weirdness idolizes this in his songs and has been known to be hospitalized with teachers from drinking this it has even been linked to deaths pharmacodynamics of lean lean which contains codeine and it is an opiate slows your heart slows your breathing can cause teachers as we see it will penetrate your cells within 30 to 45 minutes and last for one to two hours i put lean into this presentation because of the pharmacokinetics of lean lean contains codeine as we said and in the body trying to eliminate it it produces something more addictive in my slide you see codeine being metabolized in the liver to morphine we know morphine has a very highly addictive opioid it is the same metabolite that occurs if you ingest heroin narcotics anonymous groups usually tell you it's not what you take how when where you take a drug but what happens when you take it drinking lean and drinking morphine produces the same metabolites heroin is totally illegal coding is legal but you're getting the same put up so is it safe to use you be the judge and when they can't get lean they go to the other over the counter prescriptions the nyquil and the robotos in they substitute the codeine and they use these substances and they produce the exact same combination it's called robot tripping because they're using robot acid now it's going to produce synergenic reactions so although it's legal it's producing illegal reactions in the body among the 11 to 15 year olds this was touched on already in my my college previous presentation with marijuana we're seeing marijuana edibles i'm also highlighting this because the exhibits are being seized in school environments it's being sold by miners two miners as also being sold in large public gatherings for young people notice that you're seeing marijuana cup getting cupcakes you're seeing the jolly rancher sweetie which we just talked about in the lean and you're seeing gummy bears and we try to enlarge on this to show there are puncture marks in the gummy bears where they are injecting the marijuana into the edible so if you guess that is my one i was talking about as being a fat soluble substance you would be correct as opposed to smoking where the marijuana will go through your lungs and then to your system and last for so before you even finish smoking the joint you're high literally because within 10 minutes you feel the effects of smoking marijuana if you eat marijuana however that's gonna pass through your stomach and your liver then it's going to enter the bloodstream and you're going to get effects one hour after you have digested the food it's going to come all at once the dose is going to be higher and it's going to last a longer time that's why you have a psychotic event you have a hallucinati event you see people being rushed to the hospital as a result of this smoking as opposed to eating eating is that much more deadly and that's why i'm highlighting it again because forensic is more concerned with the criminal justice system we will see quite a bit more of the variety of uses that persons have tried to to use illegal substances to get into their systems so again the opinion was talked about previously in another series we are seeing vaping pens that contain marijuana oils we are seeing new variations of marijuana in this slide you're seeing something called tanji the tangi is a marijuana that is citrusy in flavor and you're seeing different vaping apparatus that was seized by the polycellus so among the 16 to 21 year olds i have a short video taken off social media concerning this jezebel this video was taken at the end of a party outside the national stadium you're seeing young persons collapsed on the ground the ambulance is present this was the first red flag 21 year olds is this a pill the forensic science center had already started seeing ecstasy since 2018 but in september 2019 disaster made its way onto our headlines as a result of this video and the subject news that followed this as a pill is what we taught we didn't know what his spell was at the time but we had already detected ecstasy actually belongs to our first group in the nps category out of the nine we're only going to be looking at three because we've only detected three out of the nine in trinidad and just want to focus our attention on those from it so ecstasy belongs to the first group fan eater amines triangles are a group of psychoactive drugs with stimulant effects and includes amphetamines and mdma which is ecstasy the chemical name is that nice long word you're seeing there three four methylene dioxide meth amphetamine the street name is ecstasy or molly it seems like cesar is our own local name for ecstasy the desired effects are increased energy or dead sensations i like to say it gives you a nice warm fuzzy feeling the effects last 30 to 45 minutes and they can last from three to six hours ecstasy is one of those drugs that has the key to deluxe so it's gonna open that protein molecule in your cells and enter right away there's really no barrier is was the vehicle that popularized the use of zester of excessive pills the pill that was submitted to us as zessa it's in the shape of a man's face with glasses and a hat on that face is from the movie breaking bad you can see the logo and you can clearly see the resemblance of this that's a pill to the logo cesar is not one pill it's not a movement it's not a concept because there are billboards with it as is shown in this picture the zessa deal this was a billboard outside the university of the west indies any pill that's coming into us is being sold as a decipher and we'll see these films don't contain ecstasy as i said we weren't sure what this has affected her in it but we were already detecting ecstasy back in november 2018 it was enough that we had seen in september prisons collapsed on the ground after a party it happened again in october 2019 party goers collapsed on the ground outside a large public event the trentomega police service made a video and issued it on television warning quizzes about the rise of the zester pill the forensic science center i've been given a raman testing device it's shown in your picture it's used to go on the field and test on the spot through the packaging whatever the drug that is put on in the package ramen is a non-destructive way to test for drugs in the field and it can give you a quick idea as to what the drug contains we started using this device in november 2018 because the drugs that were coming in were not easily identified using our traditional laboratory equipment and tests the wet chemistry was not working because the mix because these drugs were present as large mixtures of chemicals to date we have seen more than 30 different xt tablets i've tried to show you to show you pictures of them but we're going to pull out a few of them for special mention the kim jong-un tablet picture of the north korean prime minister president on the face on one side of the tablet you have his face on the other side has a radioactive symbol why someone would take a tablet with a radioactive symbol bottles my mind when we tried to discount this tablet it contained ecstasy and a few other things that we still have not identified of course if we have the north korean president we must have the u.s president so we have donald trump tablets as well all different colors why i pulled out this one these tablets the purple one in particular was found in the apartment of a university student selling to other university students they were taking it to stay awake not appreciating the danger and addictive power of the tablets donkey kong smiling monkey face gives you no cause for alarm by looking at it it's taken from a cartoon character in a movie ice age more than four thousand eight hundred tablet sees at one point these came in at wrong carnival 2019 biomass mass band leader and was seized by customs and lastly the other one i'm going to pull out for a mention is the shield shaped tablet it has don perignon engraved on it which is the logo for a champion brand we'll see this tablet shortly in another form so from october 2018 until now we've seen as much as seven thousand we've seized 200 bigger police services as well as customs they have seized more than 7 000 tablets we've done more than 40 seizures of these tablets ecstasy pharmacodynamics we see difficulties sleeping has one of the effects the drug has on the body so that's why they are able to stay up for long hours and study but it's highly addictive and that can occur as a result because their body temperatures increase it's a stimulant and they become dehydrated you saw the effects of that when persons were collapsed on the ground outside the party add alcohol to this mix and it can very quickly escalate to a life threatening situation the green heineken again these are not um taken from anywhere else these are tablets found in triangle vehicle summatively forensic science center that we have confirmed for the presence of ecstasy the green heineken tablet this tablet is linked to deaths in germany at 1820 year old went to a party and died as a result of taking the heineken tablets the blue punisher gets his name from the comic strip called the punisher notice the logo as a skull and that is color is engraved on the tablet again linked to death because of the strength of the ecstasy that is present in these silence and lastly the blue pharaoh another tablet linked to deaths of two people in scotland we have not confirmed a linkage between ecstasy and death in trinidad as yet but based upon the number of tablets that we are seeing the average dose of an exit tablet between 75 to 100 milligrams of ecstasy in the uk this organization called the loop they sample the exit tablets available at that time and they test them and tell you how much accuracy is in there as part of their harm reduction strategy and they rank the tablets based upon strength so for last year the top 10 strongest accuracy tablets are shown on your screen sri lan tobago has six out of those ten strongest exit tablets we have the top two input donald trump has more than 300 milligrams of ecstasy in the tablet i don't want you to think for one second that we're only getting tablets we're seeing the powders we're seeing the crystals we're even seeing pellets people are swallowing accuracy tablets to traffic them i know you're getting concerned now as parents but this is actually not the worst slide i'm going to show you this is the slide i'm going to show you youtube tablets what is called were seized in trinidad and for the first time we detected matte amphetamine in a tablet crystal meth last week we discovered for the second time crystal meth in the tablet show until your left superman there's a super there's a s on a tablet in the shape of superman superman tablets of different colors that's we have not shared this information yet with anyone so i'm using this yesterday alert we so we have seen superman tablets that contain crystal metamphetamine we're also seeing in that same submission to the center we're seeing the don perignon champagne tablet also contain ecstasy but previously also contains methamphetamine my my pardon but you already saw this tablet with ecstasy so same time but one time i continue next to see now it contains crystal meth for those of you who don't know what christian matters is very bad news it is a psycho stimulant just as cooking but but whereas cocaine is plant-based methamphetamine is man-made beast cocaine will last 20-30 minutes methamphetamine will last eight to twelve hours your body will need 12 hours to get rid of it it is 12 times the potency of cocaine we have tablets and trinidad that contain methamphetamine and you don't know you are taking them because they think this is zesta they think this is ecstasy so again you don't know what you are taking when you are taking these tablets the long-term effects of methamphetamine deteriorated teeth because you're grinding your teeth it'll damage your brain it'll damage your liver it'll damage your lungs or damage your kidneys you'll because hallucinogen hallucinates hallucination sorry and again as i say in in narcotics anonymous first the man will take the drug when he becomes addicted the drug takes the drug and finally the drug takes demand ninety percent of the users of methamphetamine can not kick the addiction trinidad we need to pull back we do not want methamphetamine using trinidad we are not ready for it the national security or in health so how can parents tell look at the eyes of your children your pupils will react according to what drug you are using if you want to know what size your pupil should be that's the black dot in the center of your eye just look at your own eyes and you'll get what the size should be so if you're taking the lean or you're taking the robot your robo tripping your pupils will be constricted or smaller there'll be like a little pin drop inside of your eyes if you're on marijuana or alcohol where you know your eyes go red and finally if you're on metamphetamine or mdma your pupils dilate you can see the large difference between the size it's supposed to be and the size it actually is in someone who is on a stimulating substance like methamphetamine or cocaine or heroin the young professionals these are the people who out of university out of school have a job have that all-important credit card no responsibilities they can afford to buy the xc tablet and this deals tablets we are seeing the nps drugs the ones that we have no way of detecting or treating the first type we're going to look at the second class of nps drugs the synthetic categories also called bath salts these cartilands came from the cat plant their stimulants the speed of the message between the brain and the body and they have similar effects to amphetamines we just saw the superman crest tablet with metamphetamine present now we see this command tablet with cotton on present the story behind this is that when we got this tablet we used the raman device and all that came up on the raman device was caffeine this was submitted to us in october 20 2019. ramen said that it was caffeine but any good toxicologist knows you're not going to have caffeine in a tablet only it has to have something else there the caffeine will punch in the cord in the door and open it for something else to come in and sure enough when we put it on the more sophisticated machine we saw the caffeine peak at 18 minutes and this small peak at 20 minutes is what we identified as the synthetic category mdpv mdpv is a bath salt flakka is a new version of that you might have heard of flacco on the streets it is just a different version of mdpv so we're not confirming that we've seen plaque yet what we're seeing is the same class as blacker we also saw another tablet that was submitted to us tesla that contained both ecstasy and another synthetic catalog these tablets as you can tell they appeal to all types of persons the logos are good to have you are trying to identify yourself with something so whether it be speedy cars whether it be expensive champagne the ones that concern me are the ones that are shaped as cartoons because those would appeal to the younger crowd and they all look very innocent so there's no alarm bell that's going off last one which is piperazines the other class these are also stimulants but they're usually sold as impediments as mdma sorry ecstasy we find them as pills capsules or powders in their own right but you mix them with ecstasy you mix them with alcohol and we have a cocktail of disaster they'll be vomiting insomnia increase body temperatures again we have also found this in an xc tablet we call it the pablo escobar accessory tablet because of the logo on one side of the tablet there's the face of pablo escobar pablo escobar was more commonly known for cocaine not ecstasy however he has made his name onto ftc tablets again found in trinidad confirmed to contain both ecstasy and hyperazine how are these nps drugs cutting into the country the unodc questionnaire and the australis in 2012 show that they were coming in by air or by mail and turn on we can say we're seeing it in the mail the majority of these tablets were seized initially in 2018 we found them entity posts and the mail people are buying it off the internet and shipping it to themselves the internet has allowed there to be a polar border persons can go on the internet with that all-important credit card and they can't find out places they can buy it the price they can pay how to make it even and the feedback from other users as their defect this is born out in the global survey on the source of nps drugs 50 percent of persons said they got online why are you taking it well there's a perception that it's easy to get because your identity is totally anonymous so persons have a certain measure of personal safety as a result it's also enjoyable and it's affordable as well again there's a perception that it is legal however dew caution is required there's no safe level for drug use there's always a risk attached especially with npf drugs because you really don't know what they contain you should avoid driving swimming operating machinery while using these drugs and again combined with alcohol the effects become toxic we have already shown that six out of the ten exit tablets with the highest concentration from last year are present in the trinidad tobago market so it's very easy to overdose however one of the major concerns that i want to highlight there's no routine clinical laboratory tests to detect these nps drugs you've seen that we've had to go to more sophisticated equipment that equipment is not available in emergency rooms their 40 doctors will not be able to correctly diagnose what you are on so that you can be treated and it's safer to use these drugs with somebody who hopefully stays sober so they can advise when you collapse and are unconscious what you have taken if this doesn't live up to the words of mother teresa never travel faster than a garden angel can fly i don't know what else you're using drugs that doctors and emergency personnel cannot detect how did we respond in november 2019 the ministry of health together with the attorney general's office with input from different stakeholders such as the forensic science center national drug council they amended the laws of trina tobago to include all these new psychoactive substances i'm showing you the dangerous drug act of 2019 you can see mdma clearly listed as well you can see amphetamine is there you can see methamphetamine is there mdpv is there all the new psychoactive substances are no illegal to con to possess in trinidad and tobago this law may may be cited as the dangerous drugs amendment order it is act number 24 of 2019 and the charge is if you can if you possess 5 grams that means if you have the powder or 20 tablets of 3 4 methylene dioxide methamphetamine which is ecstasy or any other drug listed so any of those i just showed you in that long list you will now be guilty of being in possession of a dangerous drug the offense for which carries are fine and jail time finally my first slide was don't judge what you don't understand i'm hoping that you now understand the different aspects and probable dangers of nps nps drugs are not approved for human consumption there are known health effects to other professionals and other professionals will not be able to give you correct treatment they have not been studied enough in the scientific literature so the effects are not always known so they become toxic and it's very easy to overdose and finally they may appear to be easily available but easy availability does not mean legal or safe there's no correlation in trinidad tobago it is illegal to have any of these drugs i'll invite you to take to to become aware of the fact that if we if we reduce the demand for nps drugs for ecstasy then the supply will eventually decrease because it will no longer be profitable please if you have not already done so go back to the other presentations that went before me in this series they talked about drugs and alcohol and other adolescent development alcohol vaping and marijuana thank you for your attention and have a good evening thank you ms nasir for that deeply

today and throughout series do continue to be safe have a great evening you", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "CWKmFxYqqSQ": "a can can do me a little bit of I need some lime please thank you yeah yeah yeah that's crazy yeah one second hey what's up welcome back to true buds bar it's your buddy Jack and I'm gonna be mixing you up something tasty today what are you in the mood for Lemon Drop is my favorite I got you on that Lemon

similar but if you want more of a crisp taste with less cannabis I would suggest the distillate if you want a little more of that cannabis flavor in there which some people love it's your preference really to be honest with you the crisper one sounds good you want to do the distillate a little crisp you won't even really notice that those cannabis in there we'll do a half ounce of that in there let's go ahead and squeeze 1/2 ounce of lemon juice in here whoa thanks nice one the day that's a juicy lemon today cool so we got our vodka we got our infusion we got our lemon let's go ahead and add the ice before I added that ice I should have gone head taking a lemon wedge put it around the rim so you get that juice on there this will allow the sugar to stick and I know it's usually done in a martini but you usually have your stuff on the rocks if I'm not mistaken so let's go ahead sugar that rim ice have some sugar in the bowl they're perfect very nice sugar to rim we're gonna go ahead

my Congress person I'll speak to my City Council just tell me what I have to do I've been tweeting at you your biggest Korova let me help you let me help you and help them to guys figure out what you need to do to get this know to 100 because we do not want that 100 milligram cap here I believe Colorado it has that cap and it is not as fun place to be in terms of edibles okay so last but not least last but certainly not least the very last thing we have to talk about here is the big whopper the bird is best 1000 milligram white chocolate macadamia cookie this will be another special video this will be one that we watch maybe do over for hours eat half come back two hours later eat another half don't think I'm ready for the whole thousand milligrams by myself in one go so this will probably be a special video as well in addition to the kirova experiment that we will be doing in the future with mangoes so that's it that's the dispensary haul we talked about my mom as mr. Crocs wanted do you guys have any other questions for me anything else you want me to talk about if not we'll be signing off here pretty soon doesn't look like it okay guys well that's going to do it here for this dispensary haul video thank you so much for watching wheats guys we'll check you out on a future review peace", "d2znw-FjhME": "[Music] hello this is Jamie and I am with edibles led and I'm Patrick I am also with edibles list today we're making lemonade not just any lemonade but in used lemonade using as Rossum cars called magical th see startups power this is one of the easiest ways to infuse drinks because its water soluble is just malko dextran it's involved in any warm pre-prepared already made our own simple syrup yes simple syrup just sugar stardust powder and hot one alright and then tell us about start us yes every packet is 15 milligrams of THC and it is gluten-free and vegan is the multi dextran powder it's one of the easiest ways that you can infuse pretty much anything with THC it goes great in coffee tea or soup but you can also mix it with a little hot water and then once it dissolves you can add it to anything you can pour it over a salad with a dressing you can infuse an oil and vinegar dressing with it put it in oatmeal put it on your stereo also you do a lot yeah I mean it's you can infuse pretty much any food since waited that easy is weighted so we're going to go ahead and continue we've actually started to juice some of the fresh lemons that we actually got out of our garden fresh squeezed lemon juice we're pretty excited friends

and give us your 420 2020 puns and we'll start sharing that stuff I think that's a fun conversation for Paris and the stories where we share that we could do it all year long we'll do it all year just get through the High Holidays wait speaking of the High Holidays I want to tell you guys that I had a great edible over the weekend you did too it was I I had these things that were came from California very nice and they were called Camino and they were asked you know Camino I do I do i recently discovered them on my last trip to California the golden say licious and really said they were sour and yeah succulent actually they made my saliva really fluff I'm awful I had a couple of things I had I had the wild berry myself you liked it I did it was my favorite between the two and the other one was watermelon lemonade then whatever eliminated on the on the packaging it says it's good for bliss Wow Berry says it's good for chill well it wasn't I can tell you that I went to bed my mind was not chillin okay it was on the rev I would say it was good for rev what about you how did it work oh it totally did what it was supposed to for me it relaxed me I I wanted it I wanted a nice couch lock so I could I could just unwind at the end of the day and and it it was very nice my wife and I each had a chill and we did we just chilled and we hung out together and we cuddled on the couch and we had a nice relaxing evening oh well and the Camino gummies are manufactured by Kiva yeah yeah they may they make one of my personal favorite edibles which is their chocolate-covered coffee beans yes they make a sativa 5 milligram chokolate covered coffee bean which I am just the biggest fan of so Big Ups to Kiva yeah they work they work they work they work for you know they really work great for speaking of the holidays they work great for holiday gatherings like if you ever have to go yeah I suggest giving every member at the table a little 5 milligram yeah but even if they don't want to partake and you do I promise you there's gonna be one less argument at that table yes everything's gonna taste really good too what something else to that that that I had was was kick cocoa tranquil tea how was that it was actually very relaxing it was for sleep I got it for my dad actually because my dad has Parkinson's and he has trouble sleeping getting to sleep at night and so and he took like he loves tea obviously there's no caffeine in this cuz it's to help you go to sleep and it's it's five milligrams of CBN 3 milligrams THC and it just relaxes you puts you to sleep and it works really really well Wow did you try the flavor what flavor was it it was chamomile valerian sounds like something out of Game of Thrones I'm from house chamomile valerian anyway you know I'd love to hear you know we we're not all over the world we're not all over the country even we're just three people and if you guys have any products you think are fantastic or you know great value please let us know we're happy to talk about them we're happy to try them if we're in the right place I might not get arrested but yeah we'd love to know it's it's a great way of sharing what we what we encounter so we all liked we all would say the Camino gets a lot of points and the name of the tea again Alan was it the brand is Kotoko and it's chamomile valerian is the flavor that I had but they have a bunch of stuff they have synth the sympathy sensual positivity they have all sorts of different stuff for different effects it seems I'm looking at their web so they claim anyway well by the way this is not a paid endorsement this is not a paid or folks this is just us sharing our is with you okay well I'm also back in New York for some work and a visit and I did spend the week upstate in the Catskills in the woods and also had a really delicious gummy this one was a little bit different I think this one comes out of Colorado and it's a company called Incredibles and this was a peach gummy 5 milligrams we were kind of popping them every I don't know six eight hours depending on how the ride was going throughout the course of the weekend and these were also fantastic really manageable it was a good uplifting you know we're communing with each other we're communing with nature we're cooking food having a great time and it really lifted our spirits had us laughing and giggling about so again these great quality products that are available and out there they affect obviously affect people differently some are uplifting some are down lifting so you're just gonna have to get out there and try it but let's start slow yeah five milligrams a great place to start totally enough totally enough just just enjoy the ride these were available out of Massachusetts and but I think the company is out of Colorado look around Incredibles and if you want to find more on them online I love Incredibles com will show you their entire product listening and I guess they're like an old guard you were saying yeah when I when I was running reporting brave new we they were just beginning the company was just starting I mean it was like an outlaw kitchen but they were

week's episode is a pretty intimate conversation about cannabis sex and aging with with two pretty extraordinary elders Charlie and Shelly winninger's you're probably not going to hear this kind of conversation on CNN you're certainly not gonna hear about it on Fox but he's 70 although that's probably where they should be their target demographic yes I guess I don't know he's 70 and he's the author of a new book that will be out this year called listening to ecstasy which you can figure what that's about he's also a psychotherapist she's 68 and a retired RN and listen they've been married for 20 years and they told me point-blank that their sex life has really never been better hmm he's having full-body orgasms amazing men most men don't say that and hers are getting more powerful as she ages at one point in this interview they even said that they knocked Charlie out of bed so what so they use a bunch of substances and this interview will it be exploring many substances because we are a poly substance we are Pro poly substance but they really like cannabis and a little dark chocolate and they're gonna talk about a lot of the secrets that they have learned over the years and if you go on to our our blog and brave new weed calm I also posted a something called a harm reduction call which is if you are gonna use substances that do change the neuro chemistry of your brain it's very useful to take some supplements before during and after a journey that will reduce some of the depression or negative feelings you may have following them everything in the protocol that I posted online is available in a health food store or on Amazon instead of natural supplements about yeah like when you do Molly you come down and well what so the service component really drops right so you can you can you can mitigate that by taking these these up your list a few na RA la I don't know what that is magnesium glycinate vitamin C and grapeseed extract okay now when you're after the journey I've always known about this you take something called 5htp which which again sort of changes the way the body produces serotonin it gives you it makes it much nicer much easier so anyway that harm reduction protocol is posted on the brave new weed site under this episode episode 72 it's a very valuable thing I think okay so in the meantime let's talk to Shelly and Charlie Winton sure so I'm here with Charlie and Shelley winning juror thank you for joining us on the brave new weed podcast folks we're gonna talk about cannabis and sex and aging is what we're gonna talk about today these are topics that are interesting to me and to many of our listeners I just want to introduce you all to the listeners before we begin so Charlie you are a licensed psychoanalyst and you're also the author of a book that will be out in 2020 called listening to ecstasy just tell me in one sentence of what listening to ecstasy is please it's about the transformative power of MDMA and a memoir about our 65 MDMA experiences together and how they've made me a better husband a better psychotherapist and has helped both of us with the aging process that's great and surely you are a retired RN what's your what's your role in this other than the significant other well it all started by being a woman going through menopause and we found we were kind of sad that our sex life is going to kind of be depleted somewhere I I didn't meet Charlie until - until 2000 is this your second are you married i we are we are we are married okay great and is this your second marriage yes okay and you met him in 2009 Oh sex life started declining when four or five started going through menopause I went through it at age 53 uh-huh yes ooh look these are topics that are not often discussed in the mainstream so that's why we have podcasts cuz we get to talk about them freely and openly here so tell us so menopause happens sex life gets to be a bit of a drag or not as interesting or exciting how did you come across cannabis as a possible antidote to this and feel free both of you to talk to us freely well when I met Charlie he told me he was a hippie I had been a hippie during the day and we started smize started smoking with him I do smoke before maybe five times not really so and I raise children working as a nurse you know and life was different for me okay but I found that it made me more sexual and what we did actually I think we added hash to the mix a little bit of hash and it made me even more sexual and that we started playing around with it cured the menopause symptoms the symptoms being pain dryness discomfort no just low libido libido yeah Charlie how about as from the man's perspective here has this helped you in any way in terms of libido or desire I've known about cannabis in specific you are talking about kind of it sure I I mean when we have sex generally the only drug I'm doing is very dark chocolate and Shelley is the one who's smoking because I don't I'm fine and she is she turns me on completely and and and actually more than ever before okay that's great so you're not a cannabis user in terms use it but every now and then I'll use it and make love with it and I I what the only thing I notice is it heightens my sensual pleasure and my orgasms oh great okay yeah so are you guys smoking are you eating what what method of ingestion are you using smoking mostly either vaporizer or regular joint a joint well actually no vaping vaping okay vaping bud or vaping a Candace okay or oil yeah but what I have found what how it works for me especially as I've gotten older it's like noise a noise cancelling headphone it blocks out all the the [ __ ] from the day yep from the day and from like my son called me or my daughter is having problems with the kids and you know with my grandkids cetera and it helps me focus on but on him on Charlie yes and yourself no doubt yes it I listen to the music I listen to my body I'm feeling Charlie whatever he's doing and the love that we have I know the fight we were talking about it I don't know if I would be as responsive it was if it were a casual relationship but because our love is just so deep it just it's like whipped cream on top it's just wonderful that's great that's great I've always thought that it increases the word I use is receptivity so in that that expect goes I like that work as it sort of spans all things be it sex be it music be it food right the things that we know that cannabis does I think it makes us more receptive actually with anything to do with this senses but you think yes how does that work for you Charlie can you be more specific well I mean certainly for music at heightened his musical pleasure anything to the touch anything to the taste so and she looks like I say even better to me than normal so when you know on some good weed we're having sex and I feel like I am strolling into the garden of Shelley so Shelley I have have you told a lot of people about this obviously you're on a podcast I know you've done public appearances on it in New York it shows you talk to your peers about this you talked about other women your age who do you talk to you about how you use cannabis for sex most of my peers that's a good question thank you because I don't work anymore so and I couldn't when I worked I could not talk about it to my coworkers okay because by law just by now legally I was they could report me I could have lose my license right back in those days okay yeah otherwise no difference attacks yeah so I I it was mostly in this psychedelic community I mean we went to a concert in Brooklyn and there was some women who was it Disco Biscuits and we were table is talking after the concert to some women behind me who were younger they were in their like 30s and Here I am in my 60s and I don't know how it came about but we started talking about weed and sex I mean it was a Disco Biscuits concert Disco Biscuits is a yeah our jam band Phish like jam band and Disco Biscuits it's actually named after an old term for ecstasy okay but we were smoking smoking pot so you know it know you're taking ecstasy as well probably we were that night yes okay that does tend to enhance conversational bill you know was a conversation right yes so do you guys use it I just want to finish that god yes because with you were talking to these women about it and I was noticing that they were they start surrounding her in a rapt attention they were all like 20-somethings and they were fascinated by how as they get older they don't have to stop they don't have to stop rocking and rolling and they don't have to stop smoking and they and their sex life can still be as alive as ever they don't have to stop rocking and rolling or smoking and screwing okay I don't what I don't want you to feel inhibited we are an open podcast I say we want no advertisers are gonna drop because we don't have an advertiser but so it's a lot to talk about here there's cannabis there psychedelics how do you use so you're smoking what kind of sex do you find is enhanced with cannabis for example I know that I tend to get dry mouth if I'm inhaling so it doesn't it takes me a while to sort of like get get kissing back back in order got up to speed you have any do the create any issues for you no that's good the only thing is sometimes I do have to smoke a little bit more than if I want to just relax I need to get a little higher you need to get higher yeah that's what needs to be that's your noise-cancelling yes it doesn't mean I'm not present and it also depends what kind of pot I'm smoking what kind of weed I'm smoking or whether it be sativa or indica what do you notice the difference ah well with a sativa even though the Charlie's like oh sativas best for sex I was using sativa and I was having problems it wasn't helping and it's making you too anxious no no it just wasn't making me as orgasmic Oh once I started adding indica making it like a hybrid whether it be a vape or vaping a combination of different weed I became much more receptive and more orgasmic cuz it changed the quality of your orgasms and can you describe that really it just makes it easier easier mmm I'll tell you what I've experienced on this end from her yes I know and this is just you know very subjective and I don't know exactly what she's experiencing of course but it seems to me that is she gets older her orgasms get more intense because that that's what it's been like and more frequent than when we first started almost almost 20 years ago Wow more powerful would you say yeah the one thing I do find because these substances are powerful sometimes after having I call them orgs so they're like little orgasms sometimes I'll have larger orgasms but many times most of the time actually afterwards I still have a lot of excess energy inside me and Isis after I'm done he's finished I wait a few minutes sometimes some I'm listening to the music and I'm like I'm not finished you finish that a certain point in life and yes we do and but those because they come fairly quickly and I mean I'm using more stimulation a strong vibrator and it's like BAM and my whole body he can feel it a full body organ yeah he can feel it after times it knocks me out of the bed and it's not that the vibrator is you know a better lover than Charlie because it when I I don't think I could do it unless Charlie helped me but it just gets that energy out if somebody was to come to you and say look I'm in my 60s I want to have better sex with cannabis what would your recipe be either one is a play with different kinds of cannabis whether indica sativa or hybrid and smoke enough or eat enough whatever you want to do where your your high start that way or start low and then if it doesn't help just get a little higher and music helps again let's talk about music for a because you've now mentioned music both of you several times what's what's the playlist chill out 2016 it's there the trip hoppy kind of music that I put it on shuffle oh we on Spotify or we on Pandora what are we on here well Pandora we do trip up okay but this I have Amazon music so I can download different of different albums the plug for Amazon music will work for Amazon I'm thinking of switching over because they don't have everything I want but in the meantime they have this one album 30 30 songs I shuffle I sometimes I'll say I never heard that song before and because it's just shuffling and sensual and exotic music sonic erotic it's edgy 0-7 is another is a group that has some albums and they're very edgy and what I what I do is when I'm listening to the music I kind of pretend well now we're talking about a little bit of fantasy I go for it I pretend that I'm in a movie and or in a in a in a place and the whatever music I'm hearing that's what in my mind I'm surrounded by whether it's if it's Eastern I'm surrounded by colors you know from rugs like like you know in a tent if if it's like a Scottish kind of thing I'm I'm with a fireplace it just just helps me set the mood so it also sounds like cannabis somehow stimulates your imagination as well as your your vagina and other organs is that correct yes absolutely absolutely cannabis is great for well it's it's notoriously good for creativity and I used to use it creatively now I can access I write a lot so I access my creativity and just like I said with dark chocolate but interestingly cannabis and dark chocolate are two of the world's most complex chemicaly chemicaly complex organs or or substances I should say but yeah certainly when I'm high my imagination runs wild they both stimulate the under cannabinoid system they both have an effect on the under cannabinoid system I'm not quite clear I don't think anybody quite knows how they affect it but it's quite interesting to look at is there any particular sexual act that you've been more prone to exploring has cannabis opened your your your I want to say your your sexual imagination in any way are you comfortable talking about this just um finding different parts of my body that I know are reactive but like on my breasts but even more so anything anything goes and I will tell you just to tell you if we're talking about a combination of psychedelics with with pot yes let's just just standing at a concert over this summer listening to music and just moving back and forth I hadn't or against what psychedelic was that MDMA and wheat they go well together did you go well together but I want to ask Charlie do you find that MDMA is a sexual stimulant as a man good question thank you it's it's a double-edged sword I think it is to Tommy I find it frankly more difficult to get or stay hard on MDMA similar but there's something I can take for that right yeah I do that if we're gonna have sex I will do two things I'll take a cialis and I'll smoke and both those things will will help me stay hard and also if I if I smoke enough the MDMA is if I'm not at the height of the roll I can come got it so lots of I went to the maps conference this year in New York I know you were there - I saw you're there and there's lots of information about MDMA and its ability to increase empathy right I mean obviously ecstasy I think you know this was when it first came out they called it empathy but right really a great brand right people didn't really go there so ecstasy worked much better yeah how do you find the connection of empathy and and physical pleasure how does let's make let's sort of draw some connections there they're not necessarily connected well for us they are I mean it's like I don't know it's like the difference between you know the part of Wizard of Oz where all of a sudden they enter Oz and things go from black and white to color yes well it's sort of like that so when when the MDMA comes on whether we're smoking or not it just heightens the intimacy between us and our kisses are more the less delicious and and and a touch is more remarkable and astonishing and so it just heightens everything and that is where the sensuality is heightened it heightens the heart-to-heart connection yes I find the same but so let's talk a little about your book please listening to ecstasy oh okay if you don't mind how many trips did you do 68 we've we've we make it called rolling over also 65 about 65 rolls that that we have done together over how many years over about 1516 years so it's like four or five times a year and can we talk about what got you going on this ah Shelly I had given up MDMA by the time I had met her but she said you know she was just out of a what'd you want to talk about it she was just out of a long hard difficult marriage and she wanted to spread her wings and when she found out that I was interested in psychedelics she said I want to try ecstasy people told me about it I want to try this so I said all right it's and I I had given it up I I didn't know about the protocols at the time and how to make it a safe and rewarding journey so I turned her on and decided to do it again with her and we learned about how hydrating and keeping ourselves hydrated during the experience we learned about 5htp afterwards too - we've never had what they call the Tuesday blues never did it never but we regulate the dosage we get a lot of sleep the night of so we're very careful and we've we've followed the protocols and since then I mean it's it's just it's add icing to our cake you said that but it must have added more if you're writing a whole book about it but before you go there I want to ask you what is the correct dosage of 5htp to kill those Tuesday blues well if you make that measurement that's a good question III don't know what it might be for you for us we take 200 milligrams the night of and another 200 milligrams the following night at that time not in the morning no we do the night of at bedtime for two nights that's what that's what works for us Shelley I just wanted to say one thing something interesting I have coronary artery disease I have a six stents and when I tell people that they're like what and you you take MDMA and I cleared it with a expert a physician who's an expert on ecstasy and this doctor said just take a beta-blocker MDMA has some amphetamine in it so it'll speed you a beta-blocker makes your heart go slower so and I'm on beta-blockers anyway so I just take an extra one I've never had a problem you've never even had a symptom or anything when we're rolling and that's something that people older people especially with their medical problems it doesn't mean it's a life sentence of abstinence not necessarily I mean some people with some heart problems you definitely should stay away from it and if you really have a high blood pressure issue MDMA will increase your blood pressure slightly but often the medical community is a little hysterical about things like MDMA and so but don't take our word for it check with your doctor if you have a have an issue good good good warning right there are good disclaimer but let's go back to other things that listening exes to ecstasy other topics may be that you're broaching other than sex it really has helped me and both of us I believe with the aging process well that's it know about that a little bit well for one thing you know Minh my time comes I am NOT going to have too many regrets with or with the I mean I've lived a full life and can't continue to live a full life but MDMA makes it even richer and more complete and so I know that I and we are living life to its fullest so just from an existential point of view we're choosing to live a very full life that is not in the norm and and and gives us four or five times a year walks in heaven together and that is an interesting it's an interesting way to look at it but it's a way of preparing for one's demise to tool it to know that the one has lived fully and but also it just helps me because it helps with transitions as I'm listening into older age psychedelics and an MDMA in particular it just helps me get get it get be at peace with the changes that are occurring I think that's crucially important I'm thinking about these things a lot now as as I begin aging or ternal there are two opening let's say opening a new narrative how's that okay and you know I mean it's a struggle it can often be a struggle especially when you're beginning to sort of recognize oh I don't recover as quickly right I don't hear as well or I may lose my balance the things that want I don't have all those issues but you know for people I know my pot my parents did certainly you watch it always hit you as a bit of a surprise doesn't it yes it does and I'm wondering how you know psychedelics I mean obviously I know I know the studies that have shown that it helps people who are really at end-of-life deal with end of life yes people with cancer and they know they're dying especially we just know we know we're dying on a different scale rising on a slower more more gradual yeah scale right they're giving in studies famous John and hop Johns Hopkins study over ten years ago where they gave psilocybin which is magical mushrooms to two people who are at the end of life and it it helps them deal with faced their mortality and quell their anxiety you know yeah yeah and they're giving it to other people who are very mature who are who are well and they're coming back and saying this was one of the most profound experiences of my life and they follow up a year later and they say that was one of the most profound experiences of my life so a lot of doubters would say you're you're taking psychedelics which is a complete sign of your craziness it's obviously gone to your brain and obviously I'm not one of those people yeah how do you address that that sort of response there is I would say to that person you know if I was exposed to the same drug war information that you've been exposed to all your life without any opposing point of view I would believe the same thing there's been a lot of hysteria around that and around psychedelics I rock your brain they burn your spinal fluid they destroy your chromosomes all this has been debunked but the media doesn't follow up with the debunking story so it gets a bad reputation I also gets bad reputation from people who abuse the drug and you know if you like I say if you abuse MDMA it will return the favor you know if you do too much or if you do it too often it's it's going to hurt you but that's why you have to follow the protocols as I outlined in the book you should never do more than 120 milligrams that at one time and halfway three hours later you can do another half of that amount you've got to stay hydrated and you've 5-htp and getting the sleep that you need and and and after you do it especially if you're over 40 you shouldn't do it again for at least a four to six weeks do you choose ceremonial occasions do you or do you create your own ceremony around them we well let's put it this way we don't sit around on a Saturday night and with nothing to do and say gee why don't we take some whatever little let's drop some acid let's take some mushrooms we don't do that everything is plant when we go on on trips out of the nut nuts like Delic chips but regular trips yes like what vacations like vacations we do often do psychedelics in fact our most the it wasn't the first probably my third or fourth time doing MDMA we went to a place in British Columbia called Butchart Gardens and it was the most beautiful garden I have ever ever seen I'll bet it was and every time we when we travel we were in Barbados one year and we went to a botanical garden couldn't compare so so with jug garden this is like our gold standard so we're often checking out places to see what can be our next gold standard we also will if it's New Years Eve sometimes New Year's Eves will spend at home and we will plan an experience around that this New Year's Eve we're gonna be second time in a row we're going to be celebrating with a few friends and eighteen other thousand people in Madison Square Garden at a Phish concert oh so that's so great I thought we were going to say eighteen friends at an orgy experienced yet yeah we have it all right you know I'm not sure psychedelics or cannabis lent to that they are more intimate in using experience correct yeah and I know they're certainly orgies that occur within the MA and have you been to any well we did we wouldn't that we didn't have sex with anybody else but we went into the there's an a regional burn a burning man light experience called the Philadelphia Experiment or PEX and we went into the sex tent that pecks one one one night and it kind of blew us away no pun intended it was like a just a an extraordinary experience what we saw there and you'll have to wait for the book to read the details now that's a good two years but let's just say when we entered it we knew we weren't in Kansas anymore it was one of the most remarkable experiences of our lives and it's still every now and then I'll get back to it in your mind in your cannabis fueled imagined absolutely have you had either of you had any negative experiences using cannabis with sex as it made you overly thinkI or overly cautious or overly paranoid III do notice that I can get into my head and get lost there when I'm smoking the way out for me and this just works for me I don't know for anyone else is to get into the body and into the into my senses as I'm a gestalt psychotherapist and Fritz Perls who innovated and created Gestalt therapy said lose your mind and come to your senses so with cannabis if I focus out if I get to get out of my head I'll get into making love to this gorgeous woman I will get into the music that we're listening to I'll taste some rich chocolate anything sensual helps me get out of my head taking a bath sure absolutely hot bath hot shower absolutely sauna on the sea swimming in the in the ocean we want to swim we were on a cruise and it where it was freestyle dining so at dinner time like six seven o'clock there was an indoor pool we were we were the only ones and we we just had the pool to ourselves and they had lights and under underwater and it was beautiful beautiful amniotic sac experience yes yes absolutely yeah any other revelations that have occurred to you about cannabis and sex I mean you guys go out you talk about it public if kids by the way I do so they obviously know that mom is talking about having sex at the age of six what do they say well they don't know too much about me talking about sex they do know that that I do psychedelics my daughter actually had a misconception she thought that I was doing drugs and I just recently ahead all the time yeah like all the time I said I have to tell you I only I done LSD once every two years same with magic mushrooms once every two years MDMA four to five times a year and and she smokes more weed than I do so you know it and I said and that's it she said oh I thought died for some reason I thought you did other things I'm like no well it is you know look I think one of the very effective propaganda tools of the drug war is to put all substances in one bucket yes yes and make no distinction between them and make no distinction for Responsible use versus whatever other countries there is other people will disagree with me they'll all say you know all drugs are good and human beings should be able to put whatever they don't want in their body I mean I have a slightly different opinion about that because I've seen people go off the deep end sure a lot of feda mins and I mean it's not always been pretty that way and I know enough people who work in substance abuse clinics to know that addiction is one real problem I think that substances we're talking about here have never been shown to be in any way addictive or physically debilitating right right everyone draws a line somewhere when it comes to drugs but there's another issue there are people who to them what we're doing it is almost sacrilegious they feel that these these medicines medicine these medicines should be sacred and just used for sacred for ritual or or spiritual enlightenment like people who who will do ayahuasca or magic mushrooms for for spiritual development and so there are those who on the other side will judge us for using something like the like using mushrooms or LSD or MDMA or cannabis for recreational purposes and I like to say that fun joy play these can be transformative experiences I I I don't take that lightly I think that's a really important conference really important point fun is psychologically healthy I think another thing when when we talk about it with a group with groups and I say well I don't usually set an intention but what I do is especially if we're out in the park or something I learn not learn but I really appreciate nature i reaiiy appreciate what we have here on this earth so even a blade of grass or a little flower i'll see there's no question so so even though I say I'm doing it for recreationally I'm learning I'm appreciating and that's important to me also I prefer from to recreational which which sounds too many years as trivial frivolous and frivolous I prefer the word celebrational I like that so you look at these as celebratory experiences you make sex a celebratory experience you make a holiday or a yes walk through nature as a celebration yeah yes I love though I think it's really gorgeous let's end on that note Charlie and Shelley winter I'm so glad you came by to talk to us on the brave new weed podcast I want to end it but is there anything else you want to tell us or do want to discuss there anything we haven't brought up in this rather wide-ranging well interesting you use that term I have found that with psychedelics and and with cannabis it's wider ranging that when I was a younger man because of what I learned from set about sex from other guys I thought that sexual pleasure was really limited to my penis or just the tip of my penis yeah little one-inch that's right think about it it's like it's it's so limiting and and so what these substances have taught me is that there's a wider area of pleasure and that my whole body can I mean I want so twice in my life had full-body orgasms I've been really yeah yeah so but when when using any of these substances I can experience intense sexual pleasure and orgasms throughout the entire it's often through the entire pelvic area from my belly button down to my knees I'm like having an orgasm let's learn dog that no because what could be better thanks again folks so glad you joined us thank you thank you hi listeners we are always on the lookout for great things to talk about on the brave new weed podcast and we'd love to hear from you you can always email us at brave new weed cast at gmail.com with links to articles interesting news stories personal accounts of things that you've done or leads on books or products that we should know about you can always contact us at brave new we've cast at gmail.com [Music] alright gentlemen here we are yeah we've just heard that interview what a conversation what do you think I think it's great I think it's great first and foremost just from the most base level of people being able to talk about sex just in the same way that we have experienced prohibition of cannabis and other substances by nature Western society especially in the United States has this weird mental prohibition about talking about sex I think that because so many of us were raised in the church and had this morality beat into us or abstinence only education in public schools we just have this massive shroud of mystery and sort of general kick about talking about sex and one of the things that I've learned in in moving to Germany is that you get away from that moral abuse I'm gonna say and and and people are better about talking about sex people are better about communicating what they like what they don't like what works for them what doesn't work for them sex positivity is a thing in the world and needs to be a bigger thing just like talking about cannabis normally and normalizing it if we can talk about sex normally and have it just be a normal thing that people do because we we all do it or we all want to do it one way or to bury it and hide it and say oh it's dirty and it's immoral and you shouldn't do it because God says or because you know people will talk about you you know we got to get past that mentality and I think it mirrors cannabis prohibition in a lot of ways to be able to just freely talk about our sex lives thank you Matt what struck you the comment on that I want to lump therapy into that mental have Salou mental health as well our culture just the generation of you know 40 and above like our parents generation 50 and above I guess at this point just don't want to talk about mental health it's bearing it barrier to hide it and then it's all it's like don't enjoy yourself don't express how you want to feel it and I just like how you know there are many things I don't like about Millennials but one of the things I do like about Millennials is it there's like well in therapy let me tell you about what we just talk - yeah we're getting to a good point anyway about that interview it was very very interesting to me her comments on menopause because I've as a man who has a partner who has not gone through menopause I don't know much about it and it's going to come oh yes it will I'll tell you about buck yeah of course I will and and for me you know like libidos can change after childbirth and libidos change obviously during menopause and so for me to my question was about like whether or not orgasms are affected and I guess that's an orthogonal conversation too - libido so you can still have powerful orgasms and and have things to amplify and sustain that side of your body while doing things the other conversation is how do you have the sex drive back to then want to have the origins and how do you keep the intimacy factor going right I mean that's that's not easy after 20 years we all know that if you don't know it let me assure you it's not easy okay so I I thought that they were very bold and very brave to come on and talk about this I'm so glad they did and I want to remind you all that this episode was brought to you by 420 summit which is part of the YPO organization young presidents organization or to actually but here's how you do it you go to dub dub dub YPO org forward slash summit for 20 20 20 I'd sign up space is limited don't delay bring your partner bring associates who are members of I p\u00edo and i look forward to meeting you all there again well I think a big a big get and a big thing to look at and note about that conference is the keynote speaker being Ethan Adelman since he is retired from the DPA we don't get to hear from him as much and he's just a brilliant mind and a brilliant thinker about drug policy and to have an opportunity to see him on stage speaking to a forum in such a way I think it's an opportunity that people shouldn't miss yeah and I think we'll know more about who else is speaking in in the upcoming week so stay tuned we'll be talking about it they graciously sponsored this podcast and we couldn't thank them enough meanwhile come back next week we'll be talking about some more very provocative topics thanks for

calm [Music]", "0bf4NtxIhNY": "hi everybody it's me Alicia Bunn thank you for coming back today and joining me we are going to be making some of this delicious kool-aid candy this is so fun and it's so good so let's get right into it first of all we're going to take a cup and a half of sugar and add it to a pan make sure you do not have your heat on just yet next I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch and I'm going to give that a stir and make sure my ingredients are mixed together pretty good you want your clean starch and sugar mixed together really good next I'm going to add a half a cup of light corn syrup and then I'm going to add 3/4 cup of water and give all of this a stir until your sugar is almost dissolved next I'm going to add 1 tablespoon of butter and then I'm going to turn my heat on medium and I'm going to let this slowly come to a boil you don't want to make this come to a boil too fast because you can you can burn where your sugar will burn a clown why's so I'll just let this slowly come to a boil you're going to need a candy thermometer I got this one at Michael's for about $4 and after your candy starts to boil you just want to stick it in and you want to let your sugar heat up to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit this is very important because this is what makes the consistency of your candy so you don't want to overcook it and you don't want to undercook it so 250 degrees Fahrenheit once it's reached 250 degrees Fahrenheit then you can turn your heat off and we're just going to move it off of the heat and I'm going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm going to stir this really good until my vanilla is completely dissolved and then since I'm making three different flavors I'm going to separate this into three different bowls so I'm going to try to get it close to an even amount in each Bowl if I don't know well but my three flavors as you can see our orange blue raspberry lemonade and watermelon so after I have my bowls all distributed evenly then I'm going to pour my package of kool-aid into each one I use the whole package here but my candy turned out really really sweet it was really good but it was really sweet so I actually recommend only using half a pack for this amount of candy if you were going to do one full batch of what I did instead of separating it use a whole package but since I divided it into three separate parts I should have only used half a package of kool-aid so after you have your kool-aid in each Bowl then you're going to start each one until all of your kool-aid is dissolved completely you want the color to be bright and pretty and you want the flavor to be evenly distributed so all of your Chanti has that really good taste so I'm just going to mix this together really good and then I'm going to mix my blue one in my orange one as you can see here it's already starting to thicken up but you want to let this sit for about 15 minutes before you actually try to touch it because it is hot and it does cooled down but you don't want to burn yourself so here's a third of my flavors mixed together and they've been sitting for about 15 minutes so you can see on camera that even they look thicker now - so I'm just going to move them on to the side and place down some wax paper so that I don't make a mess all over my cabinet because this stuff gets really sticky so have to have my wax paper down I'm going to take some more butter if I'm just going to coat my hands with this stuff because this candy like I said it gets really really sticky and really messy so coating your hands with this butter is going to make it to where it kind of slides off your hands where I won't be sticking to your fingers and everything so give yourself a generous amount and cover your hands then I'm going to take my spatula and I'm just going to stir my candy and you can see here just how thick it is and after I see that it's thick enough to actually play with and give it a little touch and if it's cool enough to touch then go ahead and dig on in there and I'm just going to pull all this out and just start working it now I wish I got to show you the pink candy on camera but my battery died without me knowing so here's the blue one and the pink one looks exactly like the blue one you'll see it later but the consistency is really good I was really happy with the way it turned out I just have to keep adding a little bit of butter until it doesn't stick to my hands and I'm just working it and working it until it's firm and have to not drip all over the place this is a lot like the slime if you haven't seen that video I'll put it in the description below on how we made slime but it's a lot like the consistency of that here's my orange one and this turn got really good too I really like the colors it smells so good in here and I can't believe the taste it's just so so good incredibly sweet but really really good so after I got done with all my candy just for experimental purposes I had a few candy molds that I used and here are a few little flowers and I just stuck my Jandy down inside here and I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 to 30 minutes just to see if it would hold its shape so here they are cooled off and out of the freezer and I'm just gonna pop them out so you can see here how they turned out and I have to say I was really really excited and bummed that this picking time because they held their shape really good when I popped them out and I was so excited I thought they were gonna stay that way but sitting just in room temperature after a few minutes they started to turn into candy blobs so did not hold the flower shape but it was pretty cool to see that they did maintain the shape for a little while I think after a couple days if you would let them sit they'd hold their shape here my lollipops I did the same way in the mold refrigerated and then popped out then I actually kept these in the refrigerator and they stayed they held their shape the whole time until they got eaten behind my kids and then here are the stones I'm the same with them they really didn't make it past 24 hours but the time that they did sit in the refrigerator they held their shape pretty good so if you're not going to eat these right away I recommend keeping them in a cool nice and cool place but after a couple days this stuff does stiffen up and become like a real taffy candy so I hope that you enjoy it if you liked this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already if you want to see more videos like this later thank you so much and I can't wait to see you guys on the next video see you later bye", "_ye7_mXKUuk": "[Music] the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are talking high five chuckles again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "Yb8FxO9cw80": "last oh yeah well it's four o'clock we are starting for the last lecture of second to session 2 and this lecture will be presented by Professor Venus she is deputy head of the clinic of Bruno here in Zurich which has been trained in Arkham and Mather habilitation r2 when she came to Zurich and now she changed to completely Swiss and the subject is naturally fascinating the all the circuitry didn't have until now that is sexual health in aging women thank you very much for the kind introduction I hope I can make your life and those of your patients happier with this lecture and I had to take exams at the beginning of the week for the new doctors and there was a young women who had to question this gynecological patient 40 years old and then I heard this doctor asking this actor patient at the age of 40 are you still sexually active and I was quite astonished because I know that many people think that about elder people but I found the age of 40 is quite young to assume that there is no more activity so what is discussed the background of such development is often sexual the Iyer so I decided to start my lecture with sexual desire and then I went into the internet and tried to find a nice picture to start on female sexual desire and this is about what you find so most of the women seem to be not so excited and I've yeah just took the first seven images I saw and there is seems to be one women who's interested and who shows some activity to start a sexual contact so unfortunately this meets reality independent from age lack of sexual desire is the main problem in women and it's followed by orgasm disorder dyspareunia and wagon ISM on point four but lack of sexual desire is also number three for me so I now had then a deeper look on how does this sexual desire develop throughout the lifespan and this is own data from the Zuri cohort study so we have really something nice from a representative sample in Switzerland which I published together this professor I'm the leader of this study and he started to investigate about 300 women and 300 men in 1987 and they were all together seven waves different ages where he asked this group the question how would you rate your sexual desire and he only started these questions at the age of 70 27 28 and you see that for women it remains relatively stable around 15% of women who tell who held the interviews that they lack sexual desires and in men you have a different development you have an increase and as you see year this stops quite early if you would prolong this curve you would see the same development with an increase in the min and relative stability in women so if you ask this women why is there lack of sexual desire you find something very interesting because this lack only relates to partnership sexuality so they are not very interested of what happens with their partner but if you ask questions on masturbation or on a general sexual interest there is no lack of sexual desire at all and if you discuss with sexual therapists the reason behind may on the one side be that not all men are so interested that their top female partners have fun when having sex but what we see what is far more important is that many women do not know what they like and if you don't like know what you like you can't tell it to your partner you can't explain or show it to your partner and many of these women do not try to find out and then the next step is that many especially long-term partnerships people have difficulties in discussing what they need it's very hard to tell your partner that well my last orgasm that was 30 years ago and we've got kind of a problem so what you can do in your daily business is to support couples in discussing sexual needs because what we know very clearly is that if their sexual satisfaction there is sexual desire that's good data showing that it's not age but it's the duration of the relationship and the energy you put into your sexual life which creates sexual desire and what is also very important is that many men and women expect that women would react to visual cues but women often react to relation ship parameters they like to play with error to season seduction topics of women so when we look at German data we see again that Lex sexual desire is an important problem here even 25% and this graph shows your comparison of women in partnership and single women and here you see very clearly that there is bigger problems than lack of sexual desire especially in single women because here often you have lack of a partner so there is lack of interest towards this women lack of sexual activities and especially lack of tenderness which is reported by up to eighty percent of single women in a fifty to sixty year old group and this is further emphasized by this which you saw before in the higher age groups we've got more women than men and if all this women would look for a partner on the same age group they would already have difficulties but as you all know most men are orientated towards younger age groups so there is lack of available partners and from the point of attraction this might somehow be understandable but if you look at the physiology you see that in both men and women arousal and excitement and the easiness to approach orgasm decreases with age so from a physiological point of view it would fit much better if elder men and elder women would form couples and you would not have such a strong age discrepancy so let me now come to hormones as you all know testosterone is one of the hormones which is discussed intensively in the context of female sexual desire here's a nice study where testosterone values were collected from six years to menopause to eight years after menopause and as you see very easily is with menopause you do not have a strong decrease so you can't explain any sudden drop of sexual desire by that I want to present you some study results here study which was published in a very high-class Journal where 70 women having surgical menopause received Astrid estrogen treatment partly in combination with testosterone treatment at two different doses and interestingly this women were asked inclusion questions for study participation which did not focus on sexual desire but on sexual activity and satisfaction with sexual contacts and I think that sexual activity and satisfaction is a very complex issue so I do not think it's the right entry question for a study on testosterone effect however what they did is they use two different doses in addition to estradiol and Atlas Abel always estradiol and as you can see here is the hundred and fifty microgram dose you are close to the normal range and with the higher dose you're quite above the normal range which is yeah a bit difficult as we do not have any long-term data on what testosterone does on breast cancer risk and cardiovascular risk etc then if you look at the effect of on sexuality you can here see from the baseline compared to the placebo you have a strong increase around 20 points if you compare this to the reaction for that lower testosterone treatment group there is hardly any difference here you see a difference with the higher dose but if you see the increase from the baseline to placebo and then the next step to the highest dose the increase by placebo is far stronger than what you achieve with the testosterone treatment I want to show you a meta-analysis which was published in Jason quite recently where they yeah did a summary of all available study and to investigate the effect of testosterone on different sexual parameters and here you see that there is a small but positive effect on all parameters but I think again these studies are biased because often they do not work with a holistic approach so they do not differentiate between placebo they do not use any possibilities from sexual medicine there are perfect and I think to clearly investigate an effect of testosterone you should account for this confounders what supports this idea is for example a study from client plots where she investigated couples who rated their sexual life as grape sex and she also discussed with different specialists and they come to the conclusion that this is the list of factors which really influence the quality of your sexual life and as you see it has nothing to do with hormones it's about presents how connected you feel with your partners how easily you can share sexual needs discussing them and coming close to the path how authentic you are so it's all qualitative partners and this is what I see in my sexual consultation also it's really a minority of women where you can improve the situation just with the hormone and you're far more effective if you address this issues so if you to use testosterone as a therapy there's no preparation on the Swiss market which is allowed for this indication if you want to use something you have to use for example these three preparations which are on the market for men and women need about a tenth of the doses so it's always a bit tricky how you adjust that viago for women is not a solution for lack of sexual desire as you probably know it has been the site product of a development of antidepressants you have to take it on a daily basis and if you look at the studies you have about one more sexual context no increase of sexual desire in about a month to six weeks and on the other hand you have side-effects that you get dizzy and so it's really a big question whether it's worth taking that most women do not appreciate that okay what is very clear is that you can improve the situation and the physiological situations replication of estrogen estrogen is a hormone which is involved very deeply in vagon mental health looking at the layer superficial layer or at the extracellular matrix which explains the elasticity of the tissue it is also involved in the density of muscles and blood vessels which you need for lubrication where in association with sexual arousal the vessels are dilated and they through this dilation you get more liquid in the inside of the vagina and as you can imagine if due to androgenic effects you have smaller vessels and the lower quantity of vessel base will not work adequately here if you have a systemic treat this will have this effect but you can also use local preparations here it's advantages to use estriol which cannot be Cerro conversed in to extract estrogens which would have a negative or potential negative effect on for example hormone-dependent tumors what is another topic is general health as you all know with increasing hu there is a variety of symptoms which you could have perimenopausal symptoms we know today that they do not persist only two or three years after menopause but may persist long term with hot flashes heat flushes and sleeping disorders the general training fitness is a topic we have heard a lot about cardiovascular diseases auto patek diseases may render sexual contacts more difficult incontinence is an important topic cancer diagnoses have important consequences on sexual performance and but most often it's not the health of the women but the health of the partners in here for erection also medications have a fast stronger effects on the male side than they have on women and this is why if you look all together this is again data from the Soraa cohort study if you look at women and you have relatively stable numbers of sexual disorders throughout the lifespan but it's known that in men it certain disorders especially erectile dysfunction strongly increase with age and as a consequence a couple will a lot more frequently stop sexual activity because of health issues of the male partner than the other way around so there is also new developments regarding sexual health in older women for example there is a strong increase since 2005 triple fold increase in the use of dating platforms for elder people there's altogether 39 of these dating platforms who are now have started to make special offers for an elder group and to let you have an idea it's about 43 percent of men above 40 and about 60% of women above 40 who have tried such a dating platform the motivations are very different from men it's an opportunity to get in contact to more women to have more opportunities to meet women and when you ask the motivation in in women why they use such a dating platform it's more that the M through these platforms they can find more easily a partner meeting their needs and they can have more control over the dating process so they can first send mails and answers and really choose whether they want to meet this person or this man in person men and women report that there is an H penalty so if you look how often a male or a female person is or somebody else is interested in this person you see that the maximum is as to expect around 2530 and then there is decrease for both men and women and what people do to compensate for that is often their report not their real age they try to show nice photos where they look a bit younger and interestingly it's yeah the classical points which make men and women more interesting they describe this in the text they present on this platforms and men its socioeconomic status and occupational success and for men and women its physical appearance and usefulness and there has been detailed analytics showing that yeah the way they present their pictures they support exactly this yeah very common topics okay I'm dreaming of a situation like this and I think this is something we all observe that yeah now the Dage of 60 or even 70 corresponds to the age of 50 about 20 years ago but women and men feel more healthy that the identities changed that what you do in your free time how you you spend leisure time changes and I think with the increasing health status of elder postmenopausal women their roles and how to present themselves will hopefully um change as well and I will close with this slide which I found very interesting the beginning of research was a lot about what dude women when in which circumstances about numbers and now research on female sexuality addresses also effects of this sexuality in combination with health and any studies focusing on whether sexual activity improves your general health is very delicate because there's always this hand and egg effect because women who are very healthy will likely engage more often in sexual activity so that it's difficult to say what is the hand and what is the egg but I like this study because here they it's part of a representative sample in England and Ireland the elder study whether investigated women between 50 and 89 it's about 7,000 women investigating or adults investigated in this study and they had the men and women do two different cognitive tests one where they had to do number sequencing and another one was what recall to investigate memory and executive function and they adjusted results for a variety of factors including physical activity but also depression how they rated their health so at least they could get an idea of the influence of certain confounders and they found that in men both cognitive tests and in women the recall test was associated with sexual activity so I hope this is another reason why in the future you would support your patients in creating a fulfilling sexual life thank you for your attention [Applause] thank you picketed I think it is a really important subject that is highly underestimated Potamus to future now speaking of accepting his age there has been a very old study 668 where one of the questions was does menopause destroy attractivity you know the study and in Italy and France most women said no in Germany yes so the huge cultural differences but another question that is I think a real problem for a lot of us how make a couple that is completely is integrated to speak again together what is your took they want to stay together has basic condition but if they know already they want to stay together basically yeah because then you can start to discuss what they would need to stay together I think if they come to see us then they already did the first step because they show that their relationship is worth seeking professional help I think this is something you can all do - yeah to help them to discuss and I think I always experience if you can have the role of a moderator they know what they want to know from their partner you as a moderator you can ask questions more freely because you haven't asked them hundred times before and God not the answer you wanted and you yeah you're not in the same boat in my experience is if they come and they are so motivated they're very happy if they see that things get forward they learn about each other and with each step it gets a lot easier but to come and to start it this is the difficult yeah do you have questions yes you know he agree with you that the role of testosterone has been by some probably exaggerated because all of the other things that you mentioned and I remember more than half a century ago Robert Greenblatt who was one of the fathers of Reproductive Endocrinology used to put subcutaneous capsules he used to put the said I mean this was before every sixty years ago and he felt that women were happy but to my knowledge he never published anything which means that he in the end didn't find a lot of results of course I don't know about the Female Viagra whether that holds I think what most of these studies do not see is when a woman comes and you start discussing about sexuality so you pay more attention and then you give some tips aside what you could do and I think if really you would do a fair study you would see the problem and then have really a holistic approach where you take any sexual therapy tech possibilities on the one hand and you have a look at the hormonal situation and then you put everything together and you can see what you do it's the same if you look for at viagra for me most when men take it for a year and then they stop taking it because it's not integrated in improving the the sexuality as a total and sexuality is not just about penile erection or a certain hormone level it's a lot more complex and really to improve it I think you need several factors are there other questions how is it completely clear I think you're far away from that but you can always call that press Ramos thank you very much past present and now the future this is the last chapter and the last presentation of this conference actually future nobody would ask a retired professor to talk about the future but Professor Martin byeongho he is a splendid exception although he retired and stepped back a couple of years ago from his chairmanship at the insult beetle in Bell he is still a very and one of the most active members of the scientific menopausal community not only in Switzerland but also worldwide and he always gives stimulating presentations he knows much more what's going on then many of the younger colleagues that's why he is the man now for this presentation for this talk and I want to take already now the opportunity once again to thank you Martin for the fruitful collaboration in the preparation in the organisation of this conference thank you and I invite you now for the talk menopausal hormone therapy available alternatives and substitutes in development please Martin thank you Bruno it was a real pleasure as always to work with you and as we learned this morning we have to stimulate our brain cells so we try to do it now the subject yes here on the first slide but before I go to alternatives and to new substances I introduced the part 1 we need a new thinking because very old errors continue to be repeated in even recently updated position statements the best example is this document here primary prevention of chronic disease conditions you wouldn't expect that I think attention people are still able to write the sentences you will see now the first sentences of the accessories that had been attributed to menopause is uncertain that is nonsense we known since the Framingham study that there is increased risk already in 76 it has been shown for CVD and we know since then and it has been said today several times that all the diseases including moot resolve the sexual dysfunction also pros the CVD etc are increased after menopause the risk for to suffer for all of these problems is highly increased and if you go back to the Pepa trial we have already come from out of conformation for that in 95 so this statement here is really wrong the next error is evidence is limited to determine where different types of hormone therapy affects its benefit to harm profile or the prevention of chronic conditions again evidence is not limited evidence is existing if you go to if we follow the authors of this document they still think that C E is equal to e 2 and that M PA is equal to all of the protestations we know us for about at least 20 years that is not the case we have strong evidence that AC students are not identical e 2 and C is different and the strong evidence that there is no you nique what restaurant activity that each substance has a different profile error three is that they pretend that there is limited evidence to determine where different doses of hormone therapy have different effects again we know for a long time that there is no unique dosage that can be used for all diseases and for all Prevention's if you go to the Women's Health Initiative the test is just one dose so this study doesn't give any evidence supporting the lowest effective dose coming from the study error for is that there is limited evidence to determine with different modes of delivery have different effects again that is a big mistake to think that all MHT has the same effect as thermally MHD I cannot imagine how these people here have this idea we are a little you know them well it is a huge difference if you use the thermal e to offer all it - not all apply for venous thrombosis at stroke of other indications - and the last big error in this paper here they pretend that evidence about whether the benefits the harms of mhg vary by age of x it's menopause is limited again it is not limited it has been clearly stated that there is a difference if you start at 51 or if you start at 70 and for that we have very old evidence the Nurses Health Study is not a bad study it is not the RCT but it's a good study Danny adopts the Danish study and you had recently like trial all confirm that age is very important for the effects and risks again or in the paper trial 95 has shown it and that was during the time and the first steps in the women sensitive have been taken so article like that shouldn't be published anymore and I think we have to make pass this message to our environment I do not know what actor States versus pay I hope it will be corrected now we are coming to the available alternatives to MHT you see you see here the alternatives cited by Jane and Davis I added some aspects to it we have the SSRIs or as in our eyes they have clone it in on this table gabapentin pregabalin hype no this has been mention of stable cognitive behavioral therapy weight loss for IBS women and the Stella Crangle care you mentioned before Polly the interesting approach with a difficult approach and then the last item cited by Jane and Davis was fitter phytotherapy I put it a different way with some classes of bonuses we have the life path changes for me that is the beginning cool environment you have to cool down your apartment if needed today everybody has I think that's too high then we have the CBT called the behavioral therapy if you go to the literature and I would say not to the highly specialized spectra if I try to Mindy don't cry and a lot of other products mostly horrible products but for all of these you have no significant difference compared with placebo then with acupuncture we have 50 students isoflavones included black cohosh and depressants been the only been by in one of my favorites quite low in the possibilities because the side effects are important conservation insomnia primers gabapentin pregabalin in the lower part to again because of side effects dizziness headache some knots the dopamine agonists have been nearly out of use the last years because of side effects and the Gunnison at the blockade is low not because it's bad is excellent but it's difficult and if you need a specialist who's able to do it we've discussed only the blue points in some details just to give you an introduction to behavioral therapy on it's like the importance of self-confidence for the symptoms woman suffers from after menopause this study has shown that the higher the self-confident is the less you suffer for menopausal symptoms or put in all the way the better is you quality of life of the middle poles here you have the women is a low self-confidence here was a high self-confidence the difference is clearly significant and that you can correct by behavioral therapies the cognitive therapy is I think still quite rare on the continent for in I think in part for financial reasons it's not reimbursed mostly by the insurance companies it is a psychological intervention where you develop strategies to use unhelpful thought patterns and that will improve your responses to stressors but the CBT protocols so don't only focus on as a motor symptoms but also depression anxiety sleep and sexual concerns so it's a broad spectrum there's a recent study where it has been proven that a therapy the CBT menopause group in this RCT has shown that in the active group we should treat but there is a lot of production severalty of symptoms and in depression symptoms and the reduction sleep difficulties to whether the British able group there was no significant decrease so it is effective what about acupuncture it has been compared with the study to applied relaxation no effect significant effect but I could pump to have a significant effect both types of official even surgeons and electrical puncture there are other studies and are and reviews to confirming this factory study in berm and could show in this study that medium to medium to low symptomatic women had a migration women with serious symptoms have no raishin but there's been a publication quite recently it has been shown that Ridge there was no difference between acupuncture & sham acupuncture nobody knows why it's a riddle because in if you looked at these studies or other studies of this type you find the difference in this other study no so we don't know a lot about acupuncture in fact what is going on really but it is interesting approach in the same study he two tablets have been put in as a comparison and of course where you had the highest effect there was a Cochrane review on factory students for 2013 I think the most cited one and you see the statement is not so optimistic they come to conclusion that you have no really evidence-based effect the studies included 43 are cities only five of these 43 yielded data suitable for the inclusion and all these correct studies have been done with one substance the provinces that is a red clover extract the globe results have been as I have seen as I said before that you have no real evidence based effect although there is some amelioration in some women and some studies but that what has to be stressed the placebo effect in most trials was very high it went up to minus 59 percent so how to find out if the placebo is so high if the active substance is successful or not what is said in this review to is that benefits from this special group in history in preparations Nia is worth to be further investigated it wasn't said for all other substances they better be looked at here the date of red clover no significant difference overall but nevertheless in another part of the resume he comes he comes to the conclusion that he can be tried but the passage as a Florence effect on hot flashes we thought that the efficacy of science of law schools has been demonstrated in several clinical trials and confirmed in maternal eyes in reviews that was three years after the recipe Cochrane review it has been said in this statement that the effect is independent of the source of the size of neurons but there are some combinations that have been included in most of you two combinations with red clover extracts or other substances or her per sub stencil the effect on bone mineral density has been revealed quite recently by the group of AB dia RT Peyman was in this group they concluded that ease of labels may have beneficial effects on bone health even opposed the women I think that is too optimistic because report about changes in BM d are controversial and what is more important there are no fracture data so for fracture prevention the use of factory students demands a rigor control by DEXA otherwise you shouldn't do it let me have a copper review about black cohosh that is 50-meter who got a melosa for menopausal symptoms the conclusion till 2002 was that there was no significant difference between black hose Bathsheba in the frequency of hot flashes or other when opposing complaints and lead says there is curved insufficient evidence to support the use of Nicole but the same in the same paragraph the cultivation is there was adequate justification of compactive for studies the problem of this copper review and all other American reviews is that they mix all species up and all extracts that make no difference between of samosa and Asian known ineffective a species of Djibouti food god of course you cannot find anything so if you put it together what it's a mistake the big mistake of this review in 2002 after five times use of drones pcs mainly the asian species this speech has been shown to be inactive there has been a jube huge variability in the compound selected by certain experts then some America drugs use multiple technical mixtures you do not know what is really in and which part has which effect and then and I think that is the real range of this review the sources are not standardized extracts are not normalized I think we cannot use this old review 2002 we have New England Europe reviews no cooperation but from other sources Francis Pirelli Francesca finds the difference between possible and black cohosh but only watching Musa and the same form Allah who states that the effect is higher than placebo and control over some of the symptoms so I would say it is a substance we can use if you go to Guto so the last of these reviews and there's a statement that there are six well the central to the black cohosh and these six trials following to those who demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit that old beta we have yet a perceivable group and here we have to see our group the Somoza group the difference was significant but again only in nazi rare and medium syria patients not in severe patients and then here's some comparisons here black kohl attains conjugated Easterns that is the placebo group jibiji fuga at Somoza and conjugated these students that is four major dimetric complains waking up here tonight and you see that Timothy fuga and conjugated estrogens have post a positive effect there is the difference between the two groups is not significant but difference of post-operative 2 plus able is significant another study done by Jose Lenape confirms a significant effect for transdermal is to dial you have a TransAm is available in the black column and the co-operative the blue ones you see a significant decrease for both again the difference between the basal values and the treatment values is significant but the difference between the two treatment groups black holes and this was is not significant and this study has been well long it was a solid Saudi an RCT but again it is a standardized extract not mixture that is not clearly defined the last study I found to prove that the black hole is an inter substance is a comparative tip alone done in Germany and in this study the results show the similar clinically proven in both groups the difference was not significant and the similar responds and the percentage of women indicated satisfaction for say for 84 and 85 for the two groups so if you put knowledge about you got suppose that together it is not a factory surgeon and has no the ceramic properties it has significant beneficial effect there was a mood symptoms we have a positive effect on bone remodeling but no again fracture data there's a non significant positive effect on the very epithelium there is no stimulation of endometrium and depressed safety profile is good and they have no negative impact on breast cancer survivor' for loss of time I cannot show you the day try to study done in Germany where you have no not more relaxes in the hot samosa group than in the control group then we have the big group of SSRIs and SNRIs what do you know about norepinephrine and hot flashes we know that norepinephrine plays a major role term regulation it acts through too erratic receptors we have a main metabolite and this metabolite is higher in symptomatic women than in asymptomatic women symptoms I mean as a motor symptoms and this metabolite increases significantly hot flashes so it plays a role in the mechanisms of the creation of us about symptoms the hypothesis of Freedman is that the elevated sympathetic activation acting through this receptor and that is modulated by incidence plays a role in the decision of hot flashes so this article states that men oppose this withdrawal might involve this mechanism going through Northland and that SSRIs and SNRIs might for the reason correct what about the symptoms do you see a cartoon illustrating what it just said is the design the fearing in the transmission of signals between in aliens and the alternating neurons to the postsynaptic neuron and this is i influencing the communication of the two types of neurons here if you take it the way then you have a base inhibition of the fruits between the two and if we substitute again you can correct it and the idea is that if you give the neuro transmitters themselves you can correct it to both has been used in menopausal women we have the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs block 13 paroxetine say 14 see fellow probe we have one snri that is used when flaxseed and degenerative Desmond vaccine not nervous at all and we have in Phase three now the data being analyzed me that's a feed and a spirits up in this substance is not used in women for menopausal indications if you look at the literature we have a general agreement that SSRIs and SNRIs reduce the frequency diversity hot flashes in perimenopause and post menopause and that the league was significant it is said that parts a time is the most effective SSRI followed by citalopram and acetyl prom venlafaxine effects as the most effective s NRI there's a Dracaena second option and it is a - that the brief choice should be patient specific for side effects - and begin with the lowest dose available these data show the results for paroxetine I will not show details for the other substance just an example if you go to the left you have a provement if you go to the right you have no improvement and you see that final date asked electrifying later has a significant positive effect on was about symptoms the adverse effect are headaches dizziness nausea fatigue drives etc and constipation the most important side effect is nausea and dizziness but it is said that the in side effects disappear mostly after the first week of treatment now there is own complication we have the fact that women with haste of best cons and taking tamoxifen should avoid SSRIs which have been shown to interfere with tamoxifen metabolism the most pre a pro drug that has to be activated and this is inhibited so as in our eyes are the safest drug for this population instead of SSRIs and that means that the first try struggle first tries for the special group of women is when the vaccine days when the vaccine but there is a another aspect exactly this optimal group has been associated with increased blood pressure and some patients so the patients have to be strictly controlled for and warranted iteration of blood pressure so if you conclude the chapter interaction between tamoxifen SSRIs we can say that for pragmatic reasons already we should avoid the substances having a competition at this enzyme and that includes not only paroxetine but fluoxetine duloxetine and food problem then sertraline citalopram STI ROM have a lesser inhibition of this enzyme but nevertheless venlafaxine should be preferred but there is no effect at all and for women already taking tamoxifen which are known cyp2d6 inhibitor any change of treatments would be gradual to minimize the risks office for all symptoms and all the effects commonly seen if you start again the new treatment with a new substance that means venlafaxine let us not come to the substitutes in development the first group is treatment of VMs there we have one hormone compound but at the FO estatal one study has just been published a phase two study we know from earlier data that Eve 4 does not bind to the high report in shbg that it uses the synthesis inhibitor that is not following that it does not induce the synthesis in hepatocytes culture vitro and that there is no change of the activity of valoran cytochrome p 4 T 5 related liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism so if you look at these already known data it should be quite so a safe substance that is the study purpose just about four weeks ago fifty women have been included his women have been randomized in the open label fashion to receive either two milligrams of e for two milligrams of it to Valerie 10 in each group and then subsequently the other 30 women's participate in a dose elevation study you see here the elevation started from two to four to 20 to 40 milligrams II for here the result you have if you take the low dose no effect of AD arrow HDL a little bit if you take the 10 milligram doubles and that is those corresponding to two Limina grams of East I'll Valerie we have a small increase not for the higher breeze with the high dosages and again if you take the two milligram e to Valerie and the tail milligram before you have a decrease of LDL cholesterol in the difference between the two was not significant so there is some effect on their pitch ball turnover is influenced to the two milligrams the low dose group had no effect but if you take two milligram e to valor eight usual dosage and ten milligram efore you have more or less the same effect on bone turnover again bigger effect for the highest thoughts compute forest at all if at all showed those independent Israeli effects on endocrine problems of bone turnover and lipids defect on triglyceride or small does not been shown the slides as well effects on hemostatic valuable variables and they confirm at the end of discussion that the ten milligrams of etc are comparable to 2 milligrams of each evaluate for clinical use we will see what happens to Federation in a bigger study I'm not quite sure that will no effect at all then we have a non homo principle linked to the key spec sheets you see here the principle we have a case between signals directly to the Christmas table directly to generate you see it here then the location of the case 50 new inspiration is available Salamis and the place is species specific he's between neurons in the infundibulum nucleus that is in humans correct person new rocket in bay and did nothing and from there we have other neural receptors to activate it so in fact his between stimulate secretion of both alleged beneficiated human also the effect on the image is much more marked and his pertains coordinate generates and various possibilities on this basis some theories have been developed with his pet chin and the whole chain of the revelation of the candy wire ohms and jitter Tunes could be used for treatment of hot flashes and then oppose the patient's if you look at the evidence existing today we know that these NPP neurons are key length between the independence of the menopause and resume all the symptoms that has been shown for good the case between European Bay and did no feelings in the system epithalamus is approximate and obligates evenness to generate secretion and interesting enough this these neurons are hyper profile of the monopolist again suggesting that there must be a link between this system and menopause and mighty symptoms below to that new reckoning be signaling is increasing and post women and it has been implicated as important mediator Hofstra so far the data are safe there has been one study until now with this substance that is a code for the substance it is a real interest antagonist party topless photos Eddie I've been healthy women aged 40 to 60 two years so the group we are aiming at the petition received four weeks of the substance in the dose of 40 milligrams all be given price daily and the placebo they've been randomized to the two groups recibo active treatment the primary endpoint has been the change in hospice frequency and this first study confirmed that was the hypothesis said if you give this intercept a second is you have a significant decrease of HotList frequency I think this substance this antagonist will have a future we do not know when the first I was really the first lots of Phase three trials will be available and we cannot predict where the substance will be available to market but I think it is of high interest then we have some substitutes for fracture prevention they have been abandoned project without some sentiments that the agonist has been dropped because it was not effective enough already in phase two or Donna cotta be the interesting substance in iberica 33 have a successful phase three trial if he looks at the reductive hip fractures vertebral fractures and clinical Myrtle factor but unfortunately an increased stroke risk nobody knows why but based on this increase in stroke risk Merck happen and in the September that the development of the substance will be stopped that was a huge loss for the company and their stock market reacted then we have above the source of swap that is an ongoing project it santa clara skin it is a monoclonal antibody we have as most important studies frame study with about seven service the postmenopausal women the first year was blind it was a comparison between the active substance the placebo and then both groups active at the zebu switched to an edition of the music renewal mob for the second year here at the results in bmd lumbar spine total hate femoral neck all sites show the significant increase you see here the final values of BMD again a highly promising substance the first fracture data are available it is only until a vertebral fractures are 12 and 34 months you see the significant decrease of the right rate at the vegetables for this substance if there is no accident like for caffeine for instance an increased CVD risk this substance will be quite soon on the market then we have the Apple apartheid that is a selective activator of the parathyroid hormone type receptor again for the substance the first data show a BMD increase at all sites significant increase we don't have more date until now no fretted beta what is interesting for our balloon specialist hypercalcemia is significant law which is analog than with our digital teriparatide so again interesting substance for the future you see here the conclusions we can draw for these new drugs in phase 3 development are there not many be they are expensive and they're all using different signaling pathways involved in all as a motor symptoms or the range of bone remodeling it's a completely new approach so nobody knows if other services will follow might be that it is simply too expensive for the company's existing today thank you very much [Applause] Martin I think I can say you not only met my expectations you topped my expectations there are really new information you have questions for professor bierko's oh no baby yes clarification when you mentioned that some compounds may be effective you basically yes yeah whereas of course these surgeons have does it mean if one uses these phytoestrogens etc it is because the insurgents cannot be used contraindication yeah you see an independent use thank you that has to be clarified if you use alternative for e2 and you have the slightest suspicion that this alternative might have any effect you cannot use it for cancer indicate cancer patients the current use for all the patients having contract occasions against East regions you can use these substances for women not wanting instruments and they are quite a lot so the use is limited the second limitation of course you cannot replace these students if you look at the effect on the brain on the heart on the bone that is impossible and if you take the sources mostly are on the American market as and as medical nutrition supplement they are not on the market as a pharmaceutical substance and therefore they are not well defined and that makes it so difficult to make a formal statement but what is it about classical HRT will have been future role for these classical substances and the product or are they so to say so dangerous that we need to fully go to new substances not at all not at all and therefore I made a first part in my lecture build it in yesterday evening when I have seen this statement from the American source this strange paper if you give a clear indication to well selected patients the danger is minimal to illustrate it with data from the Women's Health Initiative it is always set in a global way stroke risk is increased that's completely wrong in one paper from here you have a small chapter where this she applied the framingham stroke index to select the low risk population relation we would give these regions and if you take the lowest population doesn't increase at all nothing happens so if the indication is correct and you selectively patients well the risk is not existing that's why I always say with the exception of clotting problems if there are no contraindications for the first five year irrespective whether estrogen only or combined the respective whether sequential or continuous combined there are no increased breast cancer risk no increased cardiovascular risks and I think we should also inform the patient in that way not in the way in the first years and especially after five years we have increased risks it's the other way around after five years maybe we have to consider our Finnish guests has already departed but we have to consider whether it makes sense after five years to break to a stop maybe this is the interest behavior but for the first five years I think we should be aware even with WH I they are actually no increased risk but after five years there might be maybe ten or in special cases cancer patients definitely we need of course alternatives and substitutes it's a pity that substances such as pastor doxa vein and combined with GE are not marketed they meet the needs of the patients they want to have a product that does not increase breast cancer risk it even has the potential to protect against their breast cancer but actually I really don't know why but the Pfizer company all tho approved is not really marketing marketing it and it's also in Switzerland it is improved but it is not on the market and I don't get a real good answer why not but let's hope and let's work on that yeah I would follow the continuation even be a little more open after five years I think if you change to transfer me to and you add petrest rone or tight restroom there is no risk nothing at all get the confirmation today from Finland okay so thank you mounting once again we come now to the end of this conference I would like to thank you all the speakers for their really excellent presentations thank you very much I would like to thank once again dr. Sylvia Missa tee and her nonprofit it's a foundation for the excellent in generous support of this conference of course I thank you for coming and for your interest and I pass now on the world for the closing remarks to Sylvia my city thank you very much so don't worry my closing remarks are just two minutes to thanks a lot of people but first I would like to remind you that all the contents of the presentation that you you hear today will be reported in a volume of proceedings that you will receive and then it will be published on the website of ipsa foundation so also if you lost something today you will find everything reported so this is very important now it's just time for me to thanks and I would like to thanks a lot of people so I'll start with you that so for coming today I thanks to all the speakers that accepted our invitation as Bruno said I would like to thank him special Bruin and Martin for all the great work that they have done with the program and today so thanks and leave me thanks all the people that work with the Apes a foundation that probably you don't know them but they are around and they took care of all the different aspects of this kind of day so the photographer video people that took care of travel catering and all the organizations so I would like to thank them and I hope to see you pretty soon because ageing this kind of topic I think is very interesting so maybe we will be back for an update on this so thanks and bye bye [Applause]", "l0OW34u7rzI": "[Music] [Music] [Music] they're saying got no audio yes what they're saying no audio yeah can't hear you just making sure everybody out there is paying attention welcome everybody I'm Sherlock Holmes and yeah so welcome late-night stream we didn't realize how late it was but we're gonna do a quick one anyway I've got big country and gentleman's e-liquid with me tonight Isaiah and Larry what's going on guys thanks for being here well no thanks for having me what's up all right so before we get into it thank you everybody for joining me I see chats going on we got all about the vapor in here what's going on buddy we have new build tools and new coils on the website I have a few clearance coils I think they're around $4 a pair so check those out 10% off with coupon code sure lockdown off and so Larry mr. big car tree won't you tell us a little bit about yourself and what your channel is about hey what's going on everybody a big country here and if you don't know who I am I'm just a little youtuber viewer that does product reviews I have a server chased by the clone show and I DIY my own juices so that's me in a nutshell that's that's it take it away Isaiah what's going on everyone I am gentlemen's e-liquid and I am a DIY er I make a liquid that's really all I can say I just like to make it and help you guys out and teach you some new tricks on e liquid so between the three of us we're a one-stop DIY shop yeah we're the entire vaping world yeah man all right so make sure you guys post your links to your channels in the chat and I'll throw them in the description if I remember to so yeah I'm going to be building as we do this live stream I'm going to be building alien frame staples I'm using point six gauge Kanthal for the frames and four pieces of 0.5 by point zero one ribbon in the middle and wrapping that up with 36 gauge nichrome 80 for the actual alien wrap and I already have my alien wraps wrapped Clapton and I have two of them stretched out so I'm gonna be doing that as as we talk here Isaiah do you might be a nun chat for us yes fine I can be the chat moderator and chat mandra I mean not moderator I shall watch the chat no you're the chat [ __ ] tell my dog we were talking about we had our plans to go to vapor slam and no Charlotte sure Charlotte North Carolina and they're having trouble with an indoor smoking ban which is really disappointing so we have yet to figure that out so for those of us who heard us talking about it on one of our prior streams we're not sure now if the crew is gonna go down but yeah it's kind of funny is that they were was on the website I'm like I'm convinced they just have an open sales yet even though it says cells in it I for whatever reason on my head I'm like that's not I can't happen it's what three months away it's not possible so I call this phone number expecting to get a machine in some office in this due date interest money shot about almost don't know what to say when he answers and I ask him Lots opportunity is like yeah they're there the convention down there but they're having problems with the event right now it's currently in limbo that's the word he used limbo facing an indoor vaping ban convention there's being stubborn and bullheaded and they're just fighting it so I asked her there's anything I can do to help or we can do to help and they just like no there's I guess in the class other events committed some issues or whatever but they got their own people lobbyists and so forth fighting fighting the fight so hopefully they can they can win and we'll hide the vapor slam in Charlotte because I thought that's like one of the biggest on the East Coast if not the biggest and what I from what I hear so it'd be a shame for not to happen and I know there's a handful of people at least it is down that way and used these channels and it'd be cool to meet up with people so yeah you should know something within about a couple of weeks and I'll just be posting them on the site and waiting for that so yeah if y'all want interested in following up on that feature in the next couple weeks just search for bait mania 17 and a lot well and my I'll never brought it's made many of us make slam 17 yeah it's just ridiculous man I mean we all know it's a big pharma Invicta backhoe and it's all about money and once once the government figures out how they want to regulate vaping they just need to separate from tobacco and I think it'd be a lot easier if they would but right now on on law because I have one a guy worked with he's actually house delegate on our on our Western you know I just liked her here and he said about you know on papers make them smoking the vaping is the same so they had to regulate in both the same but he's trying to fight that locally here trying to get him separated and get him in different terms so he agrees and it's ridiculous the [ __ ] word 1/3 right now for trying to get healthier or there's get off cigarettes so we don't die as fast and we're all right die eventually but you know we don't want the tobacco being the cause so yeah it's just [ __ ] once the government figures out how they want a government and and hopefully it wasn't being fair force then will be it will be fine it's just up until that point that's a pain in the ass every step of the way you know all day babe says I need to know how to measure out my portions for di di why a liquid um as strain sonic say you'll need a pop a scale that goes down to 0.01 grams so that's like what a hundredth of a gram yes and you'll need a bottle obviously and you can just measure it all just like that or you can use like syringes and do put drops if you don't have that but the best way I would say is use a scale absolutely weight is the most accurate but I do know those you to watch our videos we all use the same little norpro mixer mm-hmm and right now it is currently on sale like three hours and change on Amazon and I am currently looking trying to find that post so I could send you a link you gotta find it you gotta find it I'm gonna find it it's it's like chump change all here it is right here well 383 I'm gonna give you a link in case there's anybody out there who wants just matter of fact no it's just a screenshot there's no way but it's called the noir Pro cordless mini mixer yeah and like right here yes you know our P our own or pro q Amazon it's a it's even prime eligible so three dollars and eighty three cents you'll have it by Wednesday or Tuesday there you go no no no not at all I'm not sponsored by Amazon at all man all right anybody right now well you have a suspect epilepsy or chronic migraines CB o CB saw CBD I can see the I could see the useful CBD and I kinda I just I recently found out what that is it gives me don't know what CD is basically just you may pick you get the muscle relaxing effects from marijuana but without the THC hi okay so CBD is a cannabinoid and what it is what you call was that one cannabinoid can I'm annoyed part of the either hemp or cannabis plant it can be derived from either and it's everything that's good about marijuana or hemp it's the thing that prevents seizures and has pretty decent looking evidence against cancer and it helps migraines and all kinds of things joint pain anxiety there's a myriad of positive effects for it and that's another industry that's being suppressed by the FDA in big pharma because it does work for so many different things and it's a completely non psychoactive which means it does not get you high it doesn't get you high at all THC is the chemical inside of marijuana that gets you high so they have it has by law I think CBD products cannot contain more than 0.0 0.0 I think it's zero zero 3 percent THC so there's like no THC in CBD and if you're a person who is looking for alternative means of like people who are on opiates I know a guy who has stage 4 lung cancer and they give him all kinds of pain medications and he's recently switched over to CBD instead and he really upped his quality of life so it's not just some like su dose like hippie science [ __ ] there's really something to it unfortunately I'm not able to to do it but like I have really bad knees and stuff so I would love to be able to supplement my fistful of proof in for some CBD but there's some really really promising research into CBD and it's marijuana's it's not like it gets you high it's completely different so so you said you can't do it what's the reason you can just as far as my medical health right now my doctor doesn't want to go down that road with some of the other medications I'm on so it's just okay no okay I didn't know was that's that's serious if I were just can't probably yeah no let me or something okay there's not enough research to know interactions with other medications mmm-hmm but actually in Pennsylvania they just legalized marijuana and it's all coming into effect like next month so they're still trying to again with the regulations they're trying to figure out all those regulations and so part of that from the medical standpoint is like obtaining access to the research to what the THC interacts with as far as other foreign pharmaceuticals it's a pretty intense process but yeah so that's where we're at with the CBDs some people were saying that you're pretty low comparison to us yeah that's what I was just gonna mention too as some people are saying that you're a little bit low on your microphone yeah probably I mean I see it on my I might thing there and I'm like I'm not even talking soft like I'm kind of yelling now are they high and I'm low or they're normal and I'm low you're just locum we're kind of normal I'm listening to the audio now you're just about 20% lower than we are maybe which could affect them on mobile devices I think well guys I don't know what to tell ya sorry I don't know how to figure that out I'll just yell loud this work can you hear me some people are saying the videos a little laggy to God you guys are impossible to [ __ ] please well I don't know what to tell you guys Wi-Fi right now that's all it is the bad night in Pennsylvania for Wi-Fi yeah era Iran I mean man I know where you're coming from with the anxiety and depression so man if you ever need anything you can always hit me up man DM me on Instagram or just message me on youtube definitely talking to the mic works perfectly yeah maybe just reposition of the mic might help a little bit but yeah moving back to Pennsylvania are yeah I'll fade you weren't here a little bit ago I noticed you said hey after we talked about this the convention down there in Charlotte there's one get some loops right now because of an indoor vaping ban which is why the tickets when I'll set off talk to a guy a while ago we're fighting it so it within a couple weeks that should have an answer so keep an eye out for that prevention paper slam because it's possible and still go on they just had to stop sales or everything we telling if that worked out yeah else women marijuana once it's legalized completely headfirst dive Bruges McDuck yeah I love duck tails man I love that damn game that's why my childhood favorites dock tails yeah man duck tails awoo bump-bump but don't put out boom boom I love this yeah number screws like that oh that's why he's talking about diving headfirst until he's gonna swimming and doing the backstroke and all that stuff yo peace just wanna hello gotta love it but marijuana just became legal here in West Virginia as well but it doesn't go into full effect until well medical marijuana just let me rephrase it its medical marijuana that will be legal on July 1st of 2019 is the earliest any medical cards can be distributed handed out for anybody but as right now the way the law is written only vaporize abou creams ointments and pills and edible are allowed plant form of none allowed but as another year between before it's legal I'm sure they'll modify some more in the next session so by that by job 1st 2019 it probably won't be legal at all so but we'll see what happens that's crazy yeah I want to that's a I know some people in California I got a buddy of mine they they have they have a lot of land and they and they're there in that industry so I told him what if I could get set up here if he said y'all come out here and show me how to get going show me how to look and show me how to extract it from the plane as well so you know something that they already they already got their business stuff they're set up so they've been doing it for a couple of seasons now TC vapes is not legal here in Minnesota but it's still decriminalized ok I didn't know that I live in Minnesota too so I actually didn't know that a mellow Larry mellow how you doing buddy my name's Larry in case you didn't know mm-hmm how you living back late holy [ __ ] three or four dollar just Beckley's like 45 minutes from Charleston yeah I was talking to a guy who lives right next to you yeah I guess solver 121 Broadway yeah I'll throw this all over my body Mara and miracle marijuana went help Medical maybe in it miracle I mean it'll be a miracle becomes legal everywhere yeah I mean I see I never meet personally I mean I smoke pot when I was young because you know that's the thing to do right everybody around your smoker but every time I spoke this [ __ ] I need to get high as hell and go to sleep I got high self so after a while I like to stop that man no I just didn't I just didn't like it I wasn't gonna get high and go to sleep I wanted to give I don't know how I wanted to party all along so I found other means of that when I was younger but I'm old now under nothing I barely did the beer these days when I go out of town if I'm went out in them going out way for a while I'll drink some beer of course but I here at home I rarely ever drink a beer that's football season then when I go out to watch a game I'll drink some beer but TC I am in the middle cap not an hour away from st. Paul down in the st. Cloud area in a sorter you don't sound like a Minnesotan I wasn't born here but I have lived here all my life so I says it'll be legal in Toronto next year lawyer Mello says he can't wait it sounds like a pretty mellow guy no mr. Myles tonight hold up no not yet Matthew dryly you live in Beckley - holy [ __ ] three or four representing up in this [ __ ] small world yeah yeah look at that three of us here from the Brio [ __ ] yeah what is that your area code yeah three or four is six eight one I can't say three or four only in them because they just add in six eight one like two months two years ago but it used to be all just three or four the whole state and now it doesn't really you know like a lot of states have it designated you know different regions depending on what your area code is here used to be just all state with three or four now it's this entire state three or four 6a one it's just kind of merged in whatever numbers they have available so but I guess eventually I think if the population or whatever they do round a number if they might break it down into sections again like other states do but I doubt I doubt West Virginia will ever ever get that house everything is a lot of different area codes yeah you do know three-one-seven there you can go a Steve on maintenance okay you're in Prior Lake okay born into one to living in the seven oh seven one seven six one two that's Roma moist my wife's room she's from Bloomington Oh there we'll go hey yeah everybody's doing a lot right everybody put your your area codes in the chat let's see you got three one seven two one two seven one

school is there's the duplex right across the street from that's where I lived Arnab Bryce you know still today I miss it that [ __ ] duplex and that was duplex and you're like who wants to label did you play this [ __ ] was it bad there you go Wolfpack baby right I liked it when I did it and in the review I think I said you know I wish the creams would come out more in that blood orange and I forgot I had I just pulled it off the other day and holy [ __ ] after its steeped for about a month so much better yeah yeah I did like it then as well like yeah I agree with you it wants to steep down some the raspberry would come through a little more in the creams become the better and but it was six mg I just can't do that [ __ ] no more so I gave it to my roommate I don't know if he's probably still got it upstairs but I might try train sonic wants a drum a VG yeah man I mean you can even buy drums of eg bug that'd be pretty costly well I've been winning a gallon one at $12.99 I think it's about a hundred bucks for a drum so around there there you go without bad buy your drum but but it might be through all sale only maybe yeah you probably can't get corner just like that as just individual I don't know one website you guys had me on for the supplies you could buy a [ __ ] $10,000 aren't the nicotine I think I'm gonna start making coils let me buy five million feet of [ __ ] I haven't tested yet well one day I was like [ __ ] so Aron goes so we're from talking about CBD and other marijuana related subjects to area codes wonder what's next it's just a totally random [ __ ] Sunday nights during him at midnight so the privilege you're here that Mika says by the way Sherlock this ribbon is killing me right now I hate my life right now lol yeah dude I know how you feel man just make sure your preps nice and clean and be patient alright so we got 10 minutes on the call just a heads up yeah for some reason that's a night it's showing it to me on the screen most nights I don't know what it is and this doesn't always show me yeah weird plus $1,000 shipping of a German VG probably probably right hey Ron's there I need gallons of VG nicotine and flavoring from being a chain smoker I've turned into a chain vapour and go through easily 200 billowy K I'm saying when I first started I was probably that at least because every time I got the urge to smoke I would just puffing puffing puffing puffing talk the earth went away just so I did not want to go back cigarette was ready to quit and of course I was using a tape man so tanks used more juice too you just burn a lot of juice in the tank it's just it's just what it is but then when I got to after I got over the urge of there wasn't a cigarette so often my baby habits went down some I don't make as often and a lot of times I've made not because I'll really feel the need for nicotine it's just the flavor it's so good it helps me not grab that candy bar you know to me it's like it's good good you know it helps you just hear that sweet tooth or that craving if you want to snack just take a bait so we take the sweetness god I'm telling you ASL a39 very sexual for a little Rob asked how do you guys wrap staples without and twisting my tall roll-up when I wrap them around the rod I'm wrapping them right now I use it's hard to demonstrate like this but so I don't just wrap it normal like I would wrap any other coil I pull from the inside out if that makes any sense like I'm pulling I'm looking at it and I'm pushing away to away from me to wrap it so I'll grab the inner left side and pull that way if you do the best way to learn right is to take a bare frame staple so you do like four pieces of ribbon and frame it with 26 gauge and try wrapping that and that'll give you a great idea as to how the ribbon moves inside as you're wrapping it and so when you know how the ribbon moves you can counter it and it'll just give you a better idea a better feel and you'll know how to how to wrap it and pull it tight pull it really [ __ ] tight and straight out with a little bit of Bend yep it's it's hard for me to just like explain it so definitely do the the naked frame wrap style that'll give you an idea so there's a question for you Larry right here yeah see it what's my favorite ejuice well I have a few well I got ok I I can't I came tonight even though I love my catalyst I love mud you go to relevant you go to blue I love McGann the Scots all of my puddin talk of everything is my unicorn which I'm trying to create is this right here this is the beer to vape company number 32 this is a cinnamon funnel cake it's a 60/40 freaking mix it's so sweet and cinnamony it's just [ __ ] hot I love this [ __ ] I love it I love it I love it but catalyst which was which came out a bottle like this fried blueberry ice cream ice it - that was my first contact with champion development was to see if he'd kid I see him about all this if he can try to clone it for me now creating a clone is pretty difficult you rarely ever want to find a one-to-one let's just get lucky so the goal was to find a mix having a create a mix off of that flavor close enough to where I wouldn't miss that flavoring for because that company pissed me off and I refused about anything else from them and I rich in their names I won't do it that was my heart that was my whole reason to going and allowing to DIY so I could make this [ __ ] right here that was my whole my whole motivation to go to the hour and so I can make this right here the jam pins put something together I bought the stuff for my first purchase was just stuff to buy but to make that I did it and I fell in love with mixing and a month and a half later May 10th my first order now it's July 10th it's a two months later I've got two hundred flavors in there on my desk you know I've got seven rest pieces of been released I got countless other ones that are still private because the buzzer the test you know but my motivation from yeah why was catalyst grape juice but I won't buy another bottle from them ever again or maybe we mention that dead company necklace they pissed me off the rat bastards what happened so there's your answer catalyst what happened beer 32 they lied to me I'm basically simple that they lied to me I'm straight up I'm honest and I'm about to say something I want to do it and I expect everyone to be that way I'm a handshake kind of guy you know I'm not a P I don't need a piece of paper saying what I said I know what I said I just expect everybody to be that way and once I find out someone lies to me I mean little white lies or one player or something is one thing but if you just straight up blonde out coming out send me the line to my [ __ ] face or through my email or whatever saying that thing or texted me don't [ __ ] lie to me once the people lie to me I just cut them out completely I won't lie I don't lie it's too hard to remember what you said so well I it's just the way I am and it's the way I am so Larry doesn't like liars we've established that much yeah but that's all war let me need to forget the details that's what that's what it was there lots of me period okay was it I'm working on mine now Rob this gets a rest yours one day one day I'll become a cold maker but until then I can rely on Sherlock I dialed my homie mm-hmm speaking of which man you're on Duggar booze

too later guys peace", "Md67DK8k3vY": "hello and welcome to episode 8 of the ganja geezer tonight we are going to be reviewing a cannabis tincture made by company called healthy creation edibles LLC from Denver this is an indica tincture and black berry flavored not my first choice for flavor but this is the only flavor that was available on the shelf they say they have trouble keeping them on the shelf ingredients are glycerin this is a glycerin tincture versus an alcohol one agave nectar natural flavoring and sweet leaf so obviously they're using a leaf instead of extracting it from flour or hash what else about this kind of disturbed by the fact that the website goes nowhere if you just type in healthy creation edibles calm it goes to a GoDaddy landing page and so I don't know if a company is still in business or not and there's no instructions on here on how to use it that I find kind of strange because this is not just like eating a cookie or something I talked with the sales person at the dispensary and she said to take a whole dropper full put it under your tongue and hold it there for a minute and then maybe rub it around on your cheeks and then swallow I'm gonna be more cautious she said based on my low tolerance one dropper full should be fine I'm going to be playing on the safe side and use a half dropper full since I've never done any of these any of this before in the bottle there's a handwritten concentration of a hundred and fifty no unit but I'm assuming that's milligrams for the estimated cannabinoids I don't know I mean that's kind of another strange thing and the batch number is hand written on this is definitely a mom-and-pop type operation making this out of their kitchen no expiration date even though there's a line for it another strike against it in my opinion I'd like to know how long this might keep so this is not really an edible so I won't be reviewing this on my for point on evaluation of taste pain relief side-effects and price I'm gonna remove taste from it because this is pretty well a medicine so you know if you don't you don't complain about nyquil not tasting good so this isn't going to be a place where I'm going to drop taste out of it I'll tell you how it tastes but I won't use it in the evaluation process so I will take this and open it up it has a little plastic shrink wrap around the dropper bottle here peel that off just like any other over-the-counter like nyquil or anything like that open it up take a whiff of it here it smells like blackberry a little bit weedy I can tell in the odor and I can show you here in a dropper if you can see that the colors very amber liquid kind of looks almost like honey and yeah I'm gonna take this I'm going to stop the video while I'm holding and swishing around in my mouth because you really don't want to see that I'm sure so here we go that's about a half a dropper full right there oops it just dripped out on my keyboard nice so here we go and I'll be back in a sec alright I'm back as expected the taste was not very palatable I mean it was not as bad as I expected and they had a lot of agave nectar and they'd have sweetened it but still bitter and that slimy tasted glycerin holding in her the tongue wasn't very enjoyable or anything like that but again I'm not gonna evaluate on taste and according to the person at the dispensary they said it should take between 15 minutes and a thirty minutes to take effect versus a normal edible for me taking an hour and a half so we'll see while doing this it was just kind of a side note here any of you fans of um Hunter s Thompson if you've seen I'm Terry Gilliam's direction directorial version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I felt like I was in the scene where he takes the adrenochrome from the eyedropper so I hope it's not quite it doesn't quite have that effect that comes out in that movie but again right now I'll sign off and depending on how this works I will either come back later this evening or tomorrow morning [Music] [Music] well it's the next morning and it's time for the final assessment of the thg tincture indica strain since taste isn't a try-catch area as I mentioned for this it'll be reviewed based on pain relief side-effects and value and at this time I'll get into it but it can't really be a milligram per dollar interpretation so let's get into it the pain relief concerning pain relief it was very impressive remember I only took a half drop or full and I was feeling its effects by the time I signed off last night I mean it hit quick while I was swishing around in my mouth and swallowed I mean I was already starting to feel it come up I was feeling them the body buzz started already I have the seer I was highly emphasized in highly recommend that you start with a half dropper if you are a low tolerance patient because it comes on fast and furious and it peaked around 20 minutes after I took the dose I mean this is a lot quicker than a normal edible you know I don't have to wait 90 to 120 minutes with it to get the full effect as with the standard edibles on the downside this also meant that the pain relief didn't last as long from start to finish it lasted oh I'd say maybe three hours and that's not bad that's pretty good but a huge benefit I see going forward is that it the next time I take this I know in about two to three hours I can take another half dropper if I need it so it makes it that is if I'm not asleep because we'll get into that in the side-effects in the next section to review the takeaway here let me get to the point the takeaway here is that it's an excellent rapid pain relief for when you don't want to wait so I give it a solid eight for pain relief factoring in everything and the speed of which it comes in and the the length a duration of how long yes side-effects I'll say there were very little head effects meaning that this was an indica tincture so that's good for me I was able to go out for a walk felt fine and felt a little heavy and tired but I was able I didn't feel uncomfortable or anything in public it was fine got very powerful body relaxation effects I went for a walk and I felt completely comfortable in public I didn't have any head high or any feelings that I had any difficulty acting normal felt a little groggy a little heavy but on the walk went well again this was you know a very relaxing dose so that makes become makes me come to the conclusion that this is definitely a nighttime medication I slept very well as you could expect and woke up feeling clear-headed and refreshed I will so at this point I will rate the side effects is a pretty good rating of eight makes you sleepy but if you've taken to be considered that into consideration and use it at night that makes it a very good medication so price here's where it gets a bit squishy you know everything I've been reviewing so far is like milligrams per dollar and you take a specific chunk of the unhittable and you can divide it pretty easily and get the calculation now I've got this bottle of liquid here and it's making me kind of difficult I don't really want to take all the droppers out and put it in a glass and calculate it so I'm going to estimate that there are 15 droppers full worth of medication in this bottle and if you factor in the fact that I took half a half a dropper full that gives me at my current dosage thirty doses for thirty dollars so if you calculate it out and it goes you know one hundred and fifty milligrams per 30 dollars that comes out at is abysmal five milligrams per dollar price ratio but when you have thirty doses in the bottle and factoring in out it works and how good it works I'm going to have to give this a rating of eight as well for value because a little dab will do you I think it has to do with the fact of how quickly the body can absorb this sublingually versus eating it and taking it through your digestive system alright so this makes a pretty easy rating to calculate I've got eight for price I've got eight for side-effects and eight for pain relief yeah gee I wonder what the average is when you divide by three you 24 divided by three is well you guessed it eight what a surprise well that's it for now and in the comments the YouTuber HC fisher made a good point that i need to keep you know help remind you to click the like button down

sugar crash first of all who are we for my guests right you have your guests in the house what what good to see you kind of our guest but you're like family cuz you've been here forever so this is a us so we're we about so dr. kimberly and i are the founders of the clinic now we have two we're on the way to twelve we're gonna start a clinic another claim with a hospital that's what this looks like right here that's a denver hospital is a chiropractic hospital only chiropractic in this hospital with the five essentials it was the first one of its kind it actually had results that the world has never seen before if you went in with every disease you can imagine they did everything before that he had stainless steel cooking and organic cooking and all the rest this hospital is doing it so our goal is to actually bring that back and if you didn't know it yeah you're part of that we need thirty four million people it's ten percent of the United States population doing and thinking this way so that we change healthcare can I get an amen on that right anybody think we ought to change health care Thank You Jesus so we're gonna do that so how do we get into this first of all the facts are pretty simple and they're absolutely staggering one in four of people don't even know they have diabetes did you know that like that's just nuts and this even works watch this forty six hundred people got diagnosed with diabetes today that's how many people get diagnosed every day did you get that that's nuts what's that forty six hundred people got diagnosed with diabetes just today and tomorrow seven days a week that's how bad diabetes is and here's the other thing if you're thirty years old and get diagnosed with diabetes it's gonna cost you over three hundred and five thousand dollars out of your pocket what your insurance is not gonna pay did you hear that if you're if you're 50 and you get diagnosed with type-2 diabetes it's gonna cost you a hundred and seventy two thousand dollars cash like here's the thing about food guys you can pay now or pay when and listen I guarantee you paying now is way better got it and so we're gonna talk about some of that tonight but there's some numbers on there one and three medical care dollars spent on this one five total health care spending dollars one in five is spent on diabetes it's how bad it is what's crazy is it really is a lifestyle disease now there are some things there's some people again they want to make excuses for some but some of some people it's not their fault they had they got just tragically exposed something I had a lady here one time she was so offended and I see why because you know there's so many people to come in here with diabetes and we just reverse it and they put themselves into it but I get there is a percentage of people that it wasn't their fault and so I don't make everybody feel like their judge but I can tell you when you were see somebody reverse you want to do that now let's go back to that you know I'm a history buff right let's go back in history a little bit everybody say Marshall Islands South Pacific eighty years ago ninety to a hundred percent of what was eaten as food on the Marshall Islands was actually what they grew so they didn't grow it they didn't need it so what was in the if there was a store or a place to get food it was just stuff that they were agriculturally growing right so guess how much diabetes they had just it was almost zero it's just almost here a disease was almost here just a healthy place to live it's full of sunshine and lots of healthy live stuff but then over the past 80 years they've had a lot of trade routes and boats and ships and stuff go through there through the Marshall Islands especially through the world wars and stuff like that they start bringing stuff through so they brought sugar they brought a flower that brought these things now in the main islands ninety percent of food eaten is actually from off the island it's not agriculture it's usually canned the average diet of a Marshall Island person is spam donuts and coca-cola now soon I say all of you guys go that's terrible but if you live in the Marshall Islands you're like yeah it's wholesome meal out so we eat dicey I'm not even joking but of course where do you think that led them so obesity diabetes now Marshall Islands has the highest rate of diabetes on the face of planet Earth literally in just that short span it's not what God intended would you agree and so it was literally the food that created that and watch this so if you're a man or woman in Marshall Islands if you are an adult 75% of women are morbidly obese and 50% of men of children 30% of children already have diabetes a 50% of adults and almost it's more than half so the majority of all surgeries performed on the island are for amputations they're just amputate in feet toes hands fingers nose ears over half of all the surgeries and here's the crazy part in 2006 they went there to see if they could help stop this thing right and so they went and all they did was two of the five essentials they got they had them in classes so they had them classes weekly or monthly and they gave them action steps like I'm gonna give you tonight and so you're gonna get you're gonna get not only action steps but you can get a challenge for the next thirty days which is gonna be great listen to me who needs to be on the challenge I would raise my hand to listen don't go the way of the dodo on this so anyway they gave them some challenges they started having them work out a little bit and they gave them some nutritional information on how to get rid of higher glycemic index foods and guess what happened I mean as if it was a magic trick like their blood sugar points went down a fifty to a hundred points like that they lost one to three pounds every single week that they continued and blood lipid so cholesterol through the roof I was just went down immediately like it completely erased disease and the people who stay with it except if they stopped going to the classes guess what they went back into what they were doing before who here has really been on track as a patient I some of you guys have been here for decades you've been really on track you lost a lot of weight you got all your meds you were doing great doing all your stuff and you got off track and you stopped coming to workshops and then it was harder to stay on track anybody don't raise your hand don't raise your hand right that's why you're here and also you guys that are watching a home that said you were too busy to get here tonight or the ones watching you're overseas so staying with these workshops is really important so let's just I mean some crazy says one big thing that I want to point out on this this is the stuff that happen with the people disappearance of pain and legs arms and joint right you can if you'd like to have some pain disappear in your joints anywhere and what they found was not only did their diabetes get better or go away these people kept coming back so regular they had to write it down like man my knees but I had knee pain it's completely gone I had shoulder playing my shoulder pain school gone my back pain is gone right and so I mean I find myself in the room with you guys and someone goes yeah this my knees still hurting and the first thing I want to think is then one are you getting your chiropractic adjustments like you should are you doing your rehab like you should and the very third question is what what are you putting in your mouth and you look at Marshall Island people and you go well but they're eating pretty crappy and you know it's doughnuts spam and coke and I don't do that mine's not that bad the problem that is your body was never designed to have sugar let me put that let me say that again your body was not designed to have sugar it wasn't designed now now listen it's so amazing and fearfully wonderfully made that you can get away with it but my diesel truck is not supposed to run on unleaded got it and you're not supposed to run on sugar if you're if you have something that's got a high glycemic index it should have enough fiber that it doesn't let your blood sugar go up doesn't make sense I mean I have I attend someone ask me today about orange juice well even fresh-squeezed orange juice like from my house listen I'm gonna kill that later today but listen you really shouldn't be eating what I found a cold listen you drinking if could anybody here Sydney ten oranges at one time probably not sounds like I could not the cuties I'm talking about orange you're qt4 saying yeah but you can't eat sit and eat ten of them and the problem with that is if you can't set any ten oranges you shouldn't drink ten oranges without the fiber because your blood sugar you're not designed for it and there is consequences for not it tastes good which is why people sell a lot of it and people especially if you're going on vacation they sell a lot of it at the table right because it tastes good and you're mature adults and guess what you can make your own decisions problem with it is you make your own decisions and there are always good decisions right so as soon as you want to judge the Marshall Islands and go I got myself here until you actually admit that to yourself you're not going anywhere else because the captain of your ship is sit on your shoes tonight in fact if it was that the captain wasn't in your shoes tonight then you have no power to get out of where you're at but I'm here to give you some good news tonight you guys every single person here has an opportunity to improve way more than where you're at now and that's even if you're doing everything right that you think of so far my goal tonight is not to prove how bad sugar is my goal tonight is to prove to you that you're still getting it and to help you have lenses to be able to find it like x-ray vision so you can see it in every area of your life and remove it because you're not supposed to have it anyway and as I'm getting into it I want to let you know the food the the food industry if you will not to get conspiracy theorists but the food industry is a science industry now it has to be it just has to be because is as one food company becomes more scientific and figures out how to get food to taste better then they're gonna sell more product and the person that's not being scientific and figuring out how to make it taste better they're not going to sell the product and I'm not selling my product I'm not doing business anymore right and so what happens is the food additives get crazy but the number one food additive in the world right now is what sugar and it's everywhere I want to make sure you get this but I actually spent about three hours going through research on every single one of these bullet points I can prove to you physiologically chemical pathways how eating sugar literally is linked to every single thing here does make sense but I'm not gonna take the time tonight because I wanna make sure it does everybody get that and again I don't to villainize sugar you know that part of it right now I just need to get to it now here's that here's the crazy part I don't eat sugar and I hear this so I get down to that third question again are you getting adjusted are you doing your rehab what are you putting in your mouth and I hear this every time I'm I'm eating pretty what I'm eating pretty good well when you live in the sickest country in the face of planet Earth pretty good is horrible okay and so you're still getting sugar and I'm gonna go through these but some of you guys get this every once in a while and I'm talking listen um let's not be legalistic is it okay if we have a treat every once in a while it's okay listen Randy was in the Randy and Don Truesdale they own American teen coffee down the street best coffeehouse on the planet Earth you have been in there make sure you go in there it's a cutest place is so cool I went in there and I've got a date with my daughter Zen a-and we got a chocolate chip cookie now for most of you guys you're like what will rain he came out he was like it's like it's like he caught me naked or something I'm like okay okay we're gonna find this okay but it's okay to have let's not be legalistic okay but it's okay that's fine it's okay to have treats every once in a while you just don't go crazy right the problem is you need the door guess what happens it's that you oh you unleash the monster who here has done really good with your die for a long time and as soon as you had to treat it was like it was like really really hard right so let me just let me just tell you it's better not so I really wanted to go through this most of you have no idea how to read a food label so I'm gonna really help you tonight what the heck is a gram anyway like what is a gram of sugar like what's five gram is your 10 gram 50 grams of sugar what is it gram anyway we don't even we don't even use grams in the United States and so why did they use grams on us food labeling because you don't know what a gram is so let me educate you that's I'm serious right so watch let me educate you on what a gram is four grams equals one teaspoon of sugar okay or a small cube okay there's different sized cubes I guess I didn't know that but four grams equals a cube or equals a teaspoon or equals a sugar and I guess there's different sugar packets too I didn't know that there's half a teaspoon there's full teaspoon teaspoon in the halfs I didn't know that but just a standard packet is about is about a teaspoon got it now what does that mean to you what the heck does that mean what I want you to do is I want you to envision when you read a food label we're gonna go through food levels right now and I want you to know from now on when you see how many grams of sugar you're just gonna divide that by four and you'll know how many teaspoons are in there because I can do I can figure out a teaspoon right right so watch let's go through this so where is it where have you seen this where have you seen this where is this at grocery store it's also at Starbucks if you don't have the latte Frappuccino super whip whatever whatever if you I want something healthy and they get this instead right there's 27 grams of sugar now divide it by four okay what does it mean it means that it's six point seven five teaspoons of sugar but wait a second we forgot to look the servings is about two which means what there's thirteen and a half teaspoons of sugar now how big is a knod wallah now this is me it may have been so thirsty that you went you can drink the whole thing in just one breath I can do that the point I make is it's thirteen and a half teaspoons of sugar you think that might have let's go through this so how about this healthy choice because it's healthy right it's not even sweet it's not even sweet it's chicken okay but it has 23 grams of sugar which means what five almost six teaspoons of sugar just in that meal and you didn't have you thought you weren't getting dessert well you got dessert all right right now what did I say your body is not designed to ingest sugar like this so whether it's one teaspoon or it's five or it's whatever what does it do to your body it goes through a chemical pathway that sends your body into a sympathetic fight-or-flight so that you actually are increasing internal like anxiety physiological anxiety like different pathways for like a lion's ready to attack you does it make sense so that's what happens to be sugar and you're just having a meal right how about this let's have something healthy like yogurt because that we need that for our gut right except for how big is a yogurt it's tiny but you got six and a half teaspoons of sugar in a little tiny cup of yogurt you ready how about this one Clif Bar you're in the airport you didn't want to have McDonald's so you wouldn't got a Clif Bar instead right how BIG's a Clif Bar it's half the size of your palm at least mine and there's five and a half teaspoons in that right how about this one frosted mini-wheats because you wanted the fiber because your doctor said you need fiber right 18 grams of sugar and watch this what do you think of serving sizes though yeah it's like half a cup anybody do just a half a cup of that stuff no you did like four cups now here's the other thing what you also have to know is that serving sizes are purposely small so that it looks better on the label and so just so you know the average person eats 3 to 6 times the amount of servings that it says it's 3 to 6 so what it also means is you also get at times this by that so now times that by 3 to 6 you and me now let's just see salad because doctor David I've had salad I'm gonna need a salad all week my blood pressure is still the same you said my I was gonna get off my blood pressure man or my joints we're gonna feel better I haven't even absolutely advanced plan I've been having great meals I'm making salads fresh salads every day except for guess what the dressing now just so you know how big is a tablespoon it's not big so one squirt of this thing is a couple tablespoons and it has one teaspoon of sugar per squirt now I know everybody here only puts one little onto their salad right you make salad soup last time so think about it it's like just taking this like a spoon and just dumping sugar all over your salad that's why we do oil and we don't do the other yeah yeah the new book the line your health marches let's not do Thousand Island let's do something healthy it's just oil rights just oil it's like oil right it's just oil no it's got the same amount of Thousand Island but that's the thing it's got bad oils in it it's canola oil now but watch so what's what's got to be the worst though for dressing everybody says it it's ranch it's got to be full of it actually ranch has less sugar even though it is worse it's like yes thank you Jesus however all the bad fats and all the bad stuff in it so yeah it's just all the bad oils okay but how about something that actually is good so look at this it's got less than a gram of sugar for 17 crackers now if you've ever had these Alma cried they sell them at natural grocers I bet you can't even eat 17 of those crackers because you're full because it's actually a whole food and they're really crunchy and salty you may feel like some crunchy salty and goodness yeah with some good organic cheese bring it that's good stuff simple mils take a picture it's good Costco has it - thank you Costco got it so the other crackers are finally processed when you actually look on the label it's gonna say oh I think it says one or two grams of sugar like saltine crackers right the problem with it is when it goes into your mouth amylase turns that into sugar within four seconds that's why kids that you take sugar what you're not getting sugar they go home and suck on bread or suckle and saltine crackers because they turn to sugar in their mouth right got it yes it's one gram per serving which is 17 crackers less than again mmm less than a gram they do not have sugar on it it's almonds and it is really good but what's this how about these let's have some peanut butter crackers no it's just full of sugar got it so don't do peanut butter crackers either but here's this one this is crazy now everybody just laughs but watch what wait wait this cup is a four ounce cup the serving size is two ounces the nine teaspoons yeah you have a communion I asked them but when's the last time you had two ounces of grapefruit juice they're like a church yesterday like no no no no I'm talking about when you're enjoying it right but it's crazy right that's a lot is that a lot that's a lot okay now we could talk about the old with the old favorites we could talk about the old favorites having a soda right so that has eight teaspoons in it but the United States government says this is how much so this is how much a man should get and this is how much a woman's woman should get in the course of a day that's safe of sugar and watch this how much how much does the average American get so what's this wait a second so not in teaspoons but in pounds the average American gets almost half a pound of sugar a day and that's actually if you're not even sugar executive just kidding from hidden sources that's like pie crusts and pizzas and bread it's added to bread alcohol it's added to beef it's actually in yours table salt if you're not getting sea salt it's actually in iodized salt if sugar is in that because it makes it taste better so what is added sugar now here's the thing I need to get your phones out because I need you to take a picture of this and take it to the store because there's too much to remember and to for much too much for me to say at one time you guys ready so get you out what you take a picture here we go so types of sugar types of syrup and other added sugars now this is what's gonna be on the list I didn't say some of these don't have health benefits what I said is it Rises the blood sugar so fast that it's not good for you got it now I have every single person starts I mean they want to squawk about agave nectar now God made a nectar agama it's they says good for diabetics listen to me it is not good for a diabetic ever to have a gobby nectar and let me prove to you by got it so thank you pictures I'm about to switch it disaccharides galactose barley malt like how many people knew that that sugar barley malt you're like yeah that's good but I'm oh right it's sugar okay I took a long time to make that because I want you guys to have that that's why it's important you take a picture got it here we go so now what's wrong with these because they're healthy aren't they what's problem with it is you guys already get so much sugar I think honey does have some benefits and it may actually decrease allergies but you're getting so much things that just jack your blood sugar up you do one more ounce of anything even if it's supposedly healthy it's like it's like I think having a diamond that size of a fist is awesome but if you're grounding and I throw you a diamond it's one more thing your head may go underwater so it may have value but it doesn't matter if you're drowning and so right now we need to get down to business with removing that finding that in your life and then moving those sugars so that we can live life with joints that work so we want to joint some work don't have disease all the rest okay now every citation glycation glycation is when you actually you have you're eating enough sugar and this is not sugar holics this is most of us in this room that you eat enough sugar just even small amounts that your blood sugar stays up a little bit because you have insulin insensitivity and as there's blood sugars a little bit high for too long it actually attaches to protein in your body and the most common most sensitive most easily damaged protein in your body is collagen and elastin you get that now why is collagen and elastin important for joints and skin it makes it it makes it pliable like this but when you actually start having the sugar attached to it it basically attaches across the lines of collagen and elastin so it doesn't stretch like it did before okay it starts to become brittle and once it does it at one spot if you know anything about chemistry you know you make a crystal you make a little seed crystal and it all go to that one crystal same thing with sugar it actually starts attaching to that first one and then it literally goes out and we call that spot we call it advanced glycation in product when you start actually having all the sugars attached across protein strands we call it advanced glycation in product and what do you call it what it what's an announced a GE it's called an age spot or ages it also is is exactly why you do get brown spots but it's the biggest reason why we have these because our elastin and collagen or they don't come back and they actually start to crease and the problem with it is yes we get that on the face we get it on the skin whatever else but it happens on the inside this is a disk and this become brittle and they're not squishy anymore and then one day you just twisted or you bent down to pick something up and it ripped on you and the reason it ripped is because you've been eatin just a little bit of sugar and it was no big deal and you didn't feel any different you haven't gained weight but your body's not designed to eat it and it brittle your soft tissue and then you got an injury and you said why did this happen to me got it he said it just happened no it didn't happen you spent 25 years developing it but it's also what shoulders the shoulders and all that ligaments that go around it you just reach in your back hard and get something and then boom you uh your shoulder won out oh no that's because it's brittle how about this one knee joints look if you look at how many knee replacements and how many shoulder replacements how many hip replacements why it's because we eat sugar and it just destroys our joints you almost never saw this in in 1920 the average person ate four pounds of sugar a year the cost of a teaspoon of sugar in London was $5 equivalent $5 for a teaspoon of sugar because it just wasn't prevalent and now we eat a hundred and seventy pounds a year from four pounds and now it's one of most common surgeries you can have somebody came in the other day is a new patient they had both hips replaced both knees replaced I'm thinking I mean the bionic man was like I was like the 80s that's not that wasn't a thing like seriously and it's an amputation it's not a surgery if you didn't know that but this is again it's it's really I don't get too far into it tonight diabetes and treating it but diabetes is not an insulin problem because it is treated with insulin is it not okay it is not an insulin problem diabetes is an excess energy problem it is an excess energy problem if you put fifteen times the amount of energy needed to run the lights and the tables and stuff in this building what would happen there would be a problem we would have a fire we would burn everything out when you're eating the way that you're eating and I'm talking about me and my family too when you're when we eat and we put all the sugar in it's just too much energy and your body burns out and that's what diabetes is it's a burning out of the receptors of insulin it's not an insulin problem it is an excess energy problem once you look at that way and the aging is a lot of that in fact this is diabetes as well here's the other thing aging right now should never be the way that you think it is like my mom when she was 68 you guys heard the story had arthritis so bad she could not open it she opened a door handle like this because she couldn't bend her fingers and her thumb and when she radically changed her diet she felt so good so fast lost so much weight so fast you couldn't you couldn't put bread in her mouth for cash like she is what I'm gonna do it in fact what's funny is about two months ago she called me again she goes David I got these croissants for your dad I knew where she was going okay and my joints hurt and I whatever mom you just got to get off of that breading it's because I know it that's why I called you and every single weekend my mom and she watches all my videos thanks mom but she runs a 5k run she's about to do another half marathon and which every time she comes into town she that's a CrossFit workout with Luis is embarrassing to me cuz I'll show of my friends I work out with all the time I'm trying to catch up to my 75 year old mom who's doing pull-ups but you can do that if you just actually do some different changes now what we see is this this is literally what it looks like I thought was just a cool representation it literally just ages the skin those age spots it just ages and ages and ages and you'll see people like on the islands my sister did work in Palau and she saw people that were literally in the outskirts islands of Palau and they only like there was only a book like once a month or something like that and these people only ate what they grew and that you would see like 70 80 year old men with six-pack ABS and like great skin and like tight you know just look great 70 80 years old and they're out you know bending down you know getting fishnets in there running around and like all their joints feel great why it's because they are just not playing by the rules that we're playing it is thing you don't have to either but you have to make a conscious decision you can be in the world and not of the world but you have to make a decision who captain's your ship and here's the thing often times what captain's my ship is the food craving and here's the other thing the whisper in your ear that says you know what it's been a really stressful day you deserve it right hey you know what it's holidays you deserve to have a little bit guess what one meal turns into three days right come on and somebody the cruise thing I actually I had a family come back from a cruise just recently and they state advance plan the entire time it is possible now this is what we teach five essentials guests this is what we teach all right so again today we're really staying in nutrition and mindset but I want to stay in this just for a second is nutrition that's what live food looks like guys that's just what live food looks like if this is what your gross trees look like it would move better off the problem it is you just we we need to eat things that are you know processed some that are box some we do too just so you know we're not all but the the patients I have that are more plant-based and more live food based they always do better they always turn things around they always look great but we want to really start balancing things out so let me just kind of go through this a little bit first of all you want to stay towards more low carb veggies got it it's toward more low carb veggies you want to add it to everything that you can like we add veggies too to everything that we can't like literally we'll add it to soups like I made soup yesterday because it was getting cold he may want soup when it's cold and I put all these veggies in there everything actually I put some chicken sausage in there too so Kimberly wouldn't eat it I don't know why she would leave it but we put vegetables of anything and everything and as much as I can try to eat them live I would just cut a bunch I'm on a cutting board and set them out kids us who loves like ice cold cut cucumbers with salt come on somebody right we can do that right carrots are higher glycemic index but if you're eating them raw not cooked you can do that some but veggies you want to put them in things also let's get to fruit a little bit you want to get to fruit and you want to do lower glycemic index fruits got it now mangoes I love them and they have great vitamin C they have great benefits to them antioxidants but you do mangos it's high glycemic index and you can't do that I fell in love when we were Zimbabwe and I still just my joints don't feel as good when I'm doing them what are some low glycemic index fruits green apples and berries straight across the board you want to go wrong on it okay so good stuff grapefruit now it depends on what you're talking who you're talking to we've gone back and forth a little bit it's just because it they're a lower they're a lower glycemic index now they're not as low as fruits like berries and green apples got it this is a great time of year for a grapefruit zone to come glycemic index so glycemic index means when I eat food and I watch my blood sugar as the higher my blood sugar goes this is a glycemic index range okay so a high like Simic index food is something that makes my blood sugar go up higher right goes like this you want to stay with the lowest glycemic index stuff that you can now we do need sugars but you get them naturally from vegetables and things like this legumes you know all this so next is the green leafies cruciferous vegetables there are vitamins in cruciferous vegetables that actually help regulate your blood sugar and I can't tell you how often I have people come in my office who feel like they're eating pretty good and then when I ask them how many servings of raw cruciferous vegetables they get in a week they're like like August like August ahead so right it's like just you don't know and so listen you listen you guys have to make an active stance to say I'm gonna need some live stuff and eat some like once last time you ate a piece of broccoli that was not cooked honestly come on today yeah somebody's it yesterday good now this is like the choir and I'm the pastor okay but everybody watching I'm talking to you okay also what's that fruit infused water fruit infused water is actually will help with some of the actual ease got some good benefits as well but like cucumber infused water is great to help with some sugar cravings also we use the Vita brand stevia you can put that in with some lemons we make some killer lemonade it's better than any lemonade you could buy at the store with stevia and lemons and ice and water I dare you do that also my daughter will mix it up and she'll put it in ice cube trays and freeze it and then she loves it she digs it so that's another way you can do it but here's the other thing you really want to start adding in a lot of good fats and let me tell you why fats caused you to regulate blood sugar when you eat something sugary what happens your guys seem to index it does well goes up high watch this the high if you look at any person even if you're like metabolically challenged if you're a healthy person or a sick person you go up high the higher you go up the what the lower you go down in fact the higher you go up the faster you go down does that make sense everybody so what ends up happening as you were eating these sugars you do it regularly you let's say you just get a teaspoon here a tablespoon there you just get teaspoons and taste with the tablespoon just a little bit of sugar when some happening is you're on this roller coaster and you're hyper and hypo and hyper and hypo and hyper and you're bipolar too by the way because you're all over the board emotionally so eating fats is gonna help you now what are some good fats avocado nuts seeds walnuts almonds cashews the nut butters say memory may be a little bit more away from peanut butter as long as this Valencia then it should be fine or what's the one that starts to be the type of peanut anyway a healthy organic peanut but like nut butters what's a good way to get some good fat just to almost anything is olive oil I'm not talking about cooking with it I'm talking about just drizzling it over almost anything got it I mean you could always just turn it up and also coconut oil yes yes yeah it's good it's fine yeah you bet the thing about peanuts is peanuts generally will have a fungus on them sometimes and it's at Valencia can'twe if it starts with a V Jackie I'm sorry you guys but it does it's it's a it's a less fungal prone peanut basically and they're smaller peanuts I don't know what the the reasoning is for that's but that's just my reading but if you just get a good organic or you do it yourself if you have a Vitamix you make your own nut butter butter you guys have never tried that just throw it in there and it's right there at your own house add a little water that's good to go yeah the ground right there and natural grocers good stuff Valencia Valencia peanut yeah yeah so okay so the difference between roasted and non roasted you do want a raw nut roast and that's the reason that they'll do roasted nuts he actually changes the fats in the nut to a like a trans or a bad fat and so the shelf life is indefinite like if there's a holocaust nuclear holocaust in a thousand years you would think that that roasting done go ask awesome because it just never goes bad and so you want to stay with that now let's talk about food allergies for a second I don't get too far into the number one cause of food allergies right now on the face of planet Earth today is vaccinations and and that you can go look ups snoops or whatever else I don't care what's nope says they said it's an absolute lie but snows is made by a guy that left his wife has a hooker and they actually just put stuff on the internet so whatever the point is the the vaccinations the base oil is peanut oil or they had been for years and years and I just inject peanut oil into your bloodstream you probably have a sensitivity to it yes or no and so the reason that we have peanut allergies where we never had them before is because we vaccinated the crap out of the whole population so now we've got allergies to everything now there's human DNA in vaccines there's Caterpillar Lavi DNA there's monkey kidneys there was another child just the other day that had a brain tumor she's a 2 year old they went and she died they did an autopsy they found monkey simian virus in the tumor do you have monkey DNA in a tumor well I know because you grow vaccines on monkey tissue right and so every time they added vaccine into the into the vaccine schedule for children childhood cancers goes up 1.9 percent and it's not a vaccine talk but you wanna get into vaccines or just go into food allergies the reason we have them right now is because everybody keeps getting vaccinated and so I don't wanna get too far into it but balancing food with sugar here's the other thing the whey protein so this right here if you actually are gonna get crazy over the holidays make you a little drink with a little bit of this even if it's just some some like coconut milk or just even water because whey protein has been showed in a national study from CDC shows that if you if you do a little bit of whey protein after you've had some sugar it actually will balance and keep you from having this massive high and low and so this is a really really good having a whey protein it's good stuff and I'll go into some of the products here in a minute but control cravings here's an easy one just eat protein there's protein that whey protein go for a walk next time you feel like you're gonna go nuts like you're gonna claw your own eyes out to get some sweet just get out of the house now first of all if you're a addicted to like pornography or something I would say just get away from computers and whatever else right just get away from sources so if you're in your house and you're having trouble with like sugar get the heck out of there I just go for a walk get out of your house but also walking or working out or going for an expenditure of energy actually decreases sugar cravings so just keep that in mind next time avoid artificial sweeteners except for what xylitol and Sweden there although or stevia if you do a lot of stevia it tastes sweet and it will make you one sweet so I don't wanna they want to decrease the fact that if you can get used to sweet so again you don't go crazy on it eat fruit but what kind of fruit look so green apples and berries yes no they are a higher glycemic index fruit so you guys have given you that as an as a as a prescription that I want you to do that so that I would say if I've given you as this prescription do that and just say only advance but on the other stuff because there's some hormone things I'm trying to get through so that things palm that like the juice of pomegranates it's pasteurized so anytime you pasteurize a juice it basically just concentrates the sugar and so it just kills the stuff so you want to do non-pasteurized even flash dark chocolate dark chocolate is lower glycemic index you may like dark chocolate come on yeah bring it my name is David and I love chocolate but also drink tea in the evening time get you a good tea I can't just tell you where the greatest source of Tia's in the world American tea and coffee you go American tea and coffee seriously you know if you're a tea snob they outdid you like they have a wall of teas and they're a lot in half am in there are non caffeine so you can drink them in the evening time I'll be having something here in about an hour they're good they're good there's there's some good stuff you can watch out for some of the bags because the the bleaching of the banks getting an organic bag - I like loose leaf tea it's just better well let's go through some of the products I'm gonna make sure you guys have the night max fit max fits not just as you're working out and you were trying to recover which is good for that too it's got green coffee bean extract and ashwagandha which actually decreases your cortisol rise when you eat sugar first of all but also when you're under stress who here has been under stress and you had more sugar cravings when you're under stress anybody else need to so this is yes the only time you binge yeah so but so watch this doing max fit and then what you take it is you take just one little capsule both before a meal and it decreases what happens when you eat that meal got it so this is a really good thing make sure you guys get this but max if it's a big one vitamin C you guys been asking me for 10 years if will come up with a vitamin C from maximized living because you know it takes us like a 10 years to create a product because we're not gonna put something crappy out there this is ten years in the making I want to stop for the moment of silence that we actually have a vitamin C thank you Jesus vitamin C it's not just vitamin C it's got bio 5 flavonoids and quercetin it would actually increases absorption rates and if you look at the National Institutes of Health did a study on vitamin C which I don't even know how it made it out but if you did a thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day just just one a day boom thousand milligrams you actually control blood sugar and could reverse blood sugar insensitivity so insulin sensitivity issues now what happens is they said they did a they did 500 milligrams and a thousand milligrams what they found was the 500 milligrams didn't do it the thousand milligrams did and so you just got to make sure you're looking at the milligrams you got to take it so this I don't know if we have this in the house just yet it's so new yeah is it there it just came in then just so you know yeah kidney stones and all the rest yeah but it was the National Institutes of Health they said their what they didn't see the blood sugar benefit to you know Thalmann make it happen so she said do 500 morning 500 night got it you can totally do that yep yep so but vitamin C big curcumin watch this brand-new product again so you guys were asking me about can you get some tumeric Kenya this is a by the way I've been waiting I haven't told one person I was gonna show you this yet this is the for the first patients to know that we this is coming out by the way yes and listen some of you guys have tumeric as a supplement that you got like GNC or Costco or sprouts in like this I can tell you there is nothing on the planet Earth as far as supplements like this one it's got three different Kirk humanoids in it and most of them don't and the ones that it does have it actually is in a therapeutic level and there's not one on actually the three that we tested that were like the the highest quality brand we could find we had them tested in a laboratory and if they say there's a hundred milligrams of cumin ones in there it's usually between one and five milligrams so it takes a hundred capsules to equal what they're saying is in one capsule does it make sense and so this is not the cheapest supplement but I tell you this is the most anti inflammatory substance as far as a sum you can take by pill that we've ever produced as maximize living so joints all the rest but if you know anything about Kirk humanoids where they do to help with balancing what the balancing blood sugars huge yeah so and then last but not least on this the whey protein again this is this is not grass-fed cows that are partly grass-fed this is year-round grass-fed cows no antibiotics no shots no vaccines it's hard to find cow that many callous because we now have people buying this all over plain earth we have 650,000 people go through offices once a week and they're most the people are taking the product so imagine how much of this we're producing also you guys notice the beginning this year or end of last year we could we change the container we started actually doing research on how much plastic and let's round containers we were putting in landfills and when I found out and we found out as a company I actually a part owner of the company now we were like we have got to change what we are putting stuff in like the the tens of thousands of pounds of plastic set the I saw that this is why this changed last year so anyway so grass-fed protein also to help you get through some of your sugar highs coming up it's also great after workout too so there's the bundle right there you just pick one of those so it's four products just pick one alright now I want to throw one couple things in there for we're done tonight and we go through mindset a little bit okay again pastoring a church I can tell you this the average teenager today has more anxiety than an inpatient psych ward patient in the 60s like that's that's a real stat just so you know and one of the things we get with being on Facebook and an Instagram and social media all the time he's trying to keep up with it who here has had any trouble in last two weeks keeping up with all the emails that you got anybody raise your hand please right now watch this stuff and no I really want to see this I've been waiting to do this now raise your hand if you throughout the day check emails on your phone just raise my PI wanna see all right good so about 80% of the room now watch this do you feel like you kind of have to keep up with the emails to erase them because you have so many just crappy emails in there anybody yes I get a lot of nods right this now here's the crazy part right now just the fact that you said I have to keep up where you have this feeling of keeping up there is a level of anxiety and stress that you have just by having that phone on you there's a company right now that actually is creating flip phones that are a little more technology advanced they could actually have dictation so you can text by this dictating into it but they're not a smartphone it's a flip phone number flip on the move the razor come on everyone you got a razor buddy like yeah look at me I got a razor phone what's up all right watch this what if you had what if you had a razor phone again and the only time that you were actually checking emails is when you got your laptop out the only time you get on social media is when you got your laptop out would you talk more yeah would you would you would your spouse look at you in the face more would your kids if you got kids talk to you more just saying we're going in a great direction exactly so but mindset so stress increases blood sugar levels the reason is that is because stress your body's inducing itself ready to fight that's what stress is okay so it's gonna move glycogen from the liver increase your blood sugar so it's just like eating sugar so some of you guys are in chronic stress you got to figure that out right and here's the thing life is neither live on earth and you have an enemy and and he wants to have you stress that all the time but here's the thing my mom has told me something and it stuck with me the rest of my life I went to work and there's a long story but I had to I had to deal with a hard issue and my mom told me one thing I'm gonna tell you to unite to four or four words they can't eat you they can't eat you I was like well mom I don't know they've replicated it I'm like no they can't eat you whether it's bills whether it's finances whether it's relation stuff whether it's housing issues whether it's cars shoes listen they can't eat you it's gonna be fine God didn't leave you back then he didn't leave now he didn't bring you this far to leave you here and I don't have a Joel Olsteen message to preach tonight but I'm just saying he didn't bring you this far to leave you right where you're at he's gonna come through he's faithful got it and so anyway I could preach a whole message but I'm not gonna do it so I shall strategies this listen to me you need this coming up so don't go to an event hungry even for you go focus on the activities there better be some activities other than food gotcha don't linger near the food table come on people have a conversation talk to somebody plan ahead bring a healthy dish avoid alcohol since you started drinking alcohol guess what happens I need some salty I need some sweet I need some salty I need some sweet okay but this is your social strategy for the holidays and parties are coming up yes or no oxygen and exercise you have to do this when you actually start moving you control blood sugar and there's easy things to do it increases insulin sensitivity and again city guys do everything right except for this one I mentioned exercise and it's like I mentioned a dirty word it's not it's more than four letters I promise you read it but it's it increases sensitivity and it's not hard if you just walked 30 minutes a day I had a lady spent having headaches she started walking 30 minutes a day and guess what her headaches are better just from walking 30 minutes a day right 63 percent decrease in breast cancer walking 30 minutes a day 42 percent decrease in colon cancer just walking 30 minutes a day 85 percent decrease in diabetes and obesity walking 30 minutes a day and some of you guys won't do anything less you do it perfect well stop trying to be perfect just go in the right direction okay minimizing toxins I have to hit this for diabetes and the reason I'm saying this I'm not gonna sit on this long but everybody knows that we have pesticides and the Jacksons and bleach and all that stuff do you know the United States government now has changed their their idea on talking about pesticides and toxins you've heard me talk about xenoestrogens chemicals that mimic estrogen but do you think that there are chemicals that actually lead your body into diabetes it's actually destroy your body's insulin pathways so that you actually develop diabetes not because the sugar because the drug do you believe that or because the chemical watch this they do the United States government just recently did a study they actually did testing on blood and the ones came up with the most what's called a persistent organic pollutants it's P o p4 sistent organic pollutants and all everybody had them but the ones were the highest ones in there which is like bleach or pesticides these things they actually had 37 point seven times more likely to have diabetes I didn't say percent I said times it's almost like 38 hundred percent increase in diabetes the more you have these chemicals in you and guess what they started calling it now not persistent organic pollutants that actually the name of it now is diabetes ins like carcinogen diabetes in because it literally is causing diabetes did you get that so yes stay away from those things okay in pesticides it's in like makeup it's in the soaps it's in cleaners you gotta stay wet you just gotta really start getting more organic with the things that we expose yourself to anything if the chemical it's got more than 27 letters and you probably want to put it on your skin got so core chiropractic this is a group guests let me be clear this is the chiropractic sales pitch my guys that are family members already this is the sales pitch to resale you again to start making sure you're doing your stuff at home I had somebody come in the other day they got adjusted and they freaked out they called me back they first adjustment is this okay my blood shot an insulin pump and they said my blood sugar went down so hard I couldn't hardly get up I was dizzy and I had to decrease my insulin pump half half the usage just because if my blood sugar was so crazy so low she was that's not from the adjustment is it I said well when you get adjusted and in green creases insulin sensitivity she says well I don't know if I want to do that again I said what do you want to stay on insulin rush your life so she gets her second adjustment almost passes out again and her second adjustment she decreased her insulin usage another 50% so in to adjustment so is that the usual I know as usual but every adjustment you get makes your body function better and guests you can decrease sugar but if you if you've not had your spine check to see if things are working right you may be spinning your wheels in the metaphorical mud so to speak and you have to check that okay but the difference is is looking at what controls all functions that'll make a big homo talk out of this but the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal access the hypothalamus is the brain of the brain and it's the most effective thing when you have one misalignment of spine and neurologists aren't talking about it Indies aren't talking about endocrinologist aren't talking about it but if you get a high shoulder a ear that's shifted one side head tilt you got any kind of high hip and they kind of saw Salter shift like this let me tell you something your blood sugar your body is not functioning right and you will begin to break down faster than somebody else even if you eat great food that's why the lifetime chiropractic care just to maintain a good clear nerves by is so important and there's some warning signs again guess if you have any of those get checked if you don't have any of those get checked because the worst symptom is the symptom of no symptom at all then you get surprised okay good yeah I could take a picture that one right there good now I just want to give you some encouragement this guy Larry is a spectacular study of what happens when you just take a little baby step who you know was skeptical when they came to my office come on so let me just so this is Larry this is this book is amazing it's gonna give you a lot of hope and encouragement she says once I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes my doctor started me on metformin you may know anybody only metformin okay to manage my blood sugar levels over the next few years my doctor altered my medication because some because it became ineffective others created side-effects in fact most medication I took worsen my diabetes in their heard of that before it says in fact says after about a year I was diagnosed I attended a max living seminar like this I tended to max living seminar supplicant subsequently read the book put out by Max Lilly on the nutrition plan before starting anything I wanted to process things did you want to process things or didn't want to start the advance plan yet I don't know wait Benzie school there is no doubt that I was skeptical after all I read about 25 other books have felt a lot of doubt that food and lifestyle listen could really do me or my diabetes any good okay regardless that following New Year's Day I committed to following the advance plan the first three weeks on the program were the difficult I get a Amen from anybody they don't scare you guys off we haven't tried that yet he said but he goes the first thing I noticed that I felt about 25 years younger all of his joints whoa so that's like what my mom then the weight loss benefits were secondary asked for my diabetes my blood sugar levels began to stabilize over time my doctor gradually tapered me off my medications thank you Jesus eventually I was able to get off all my other medications including blood pressure cholesterol and sleep although I've lost about 80 pounds I've learned from maxsa living the best medicine at least for me is real food through some simple dietary changes I've reverse diabetes lost weight and now I feel so much better I know I have also reduced risk for other diseases my immune systems also improved I no longer get seasonal flu or cold should I get a sniffle today I get a good night's sleep and adjustment I feel better I can now work more effectively and ever I get a solid seven to eight hours to sleep without having to get up at night I'm back to playing sports regularly my cognitive emotional health has greatly improved I'm back to learning new things and almost nothing bothers me like it used to today when I when an issue comes my way I immediately look for solutions rather than focusing on a problem and he goes into some other things and he goes oh yeah and my wife is done great - she's lost 120 pounds that's pretty cool I'm by the way and they put him in there like whatever so the point is though Larry is a good example now who wants at least a version of what Larry had what you got to do is you got to do what Larry did and what Larry did is you took some action steps and the action steps that are very simple I'm going to give you today she already gave you and it looks like this it is an challenge now I didn't say massage I said it so it was a challenge so which means is you're gonna come up with a time that you're not going to want to do this and you're not going to continue know that before you get in it so before you before you accept the challenge just know this there's gonna be times where you're not gonna want to do it and guess what you push through it because nothing worth having comes easy got it and so you got to push through got it now this challenge involves eating and it involves exercise and this is the max t3 and you guys all have accesses patients um you have a patient you get it access for almost nothing and as you go max t3 com okay but now watch listen to me look at me look at me everybody look at me seriously if you fall down just what get up some of you guys on day four we're gonna fall apart and you're gonna go that's it now you quit the whole thing I want you to commit and push through it what if you only did 75% hallelujah thank you Lord right it's a challenge does everybody have the challenge in your hand it's run back guests in the house we had a gift for you so make sure you see the staff right there guys come on up they've got new patient points for you that are almost free and they'll walk you through that got it so any questions yeah what kind of salmon same it's hard to get I don't try to buy it unless it's wild-caught so I don't get it yeah there's a lei at the market here at Capel market and actually Dallas Market has it to douse the Dallas farmers market there's a Saturday mornings they'll come they'll come down they'll come down I don't know where the Dallas Market is you guys some of the Dallas if you just dude Dallas farmers market there's a there's a cappella farmers market I don't know I don't know if they're meeting every week now in Saturday's after Thanksgiving you every other week Costco is Wow okay good it's good other questions yes yes good question every listen she asked can I use the P protein if I don't if I'm not using the whey protein some of you guys like the P protein and the answer's 100% because P protein protein in general if you ingest it at the time you're getting a higher sugar meal will actually help you level out that blood sugar so P protein is actually really good this study was with way but protein in general is good you should have to have the right like P protein will definitely work because proteins actually in some ways more digestible even than Ray but the whey protein we have is amazing so either ones fine with that so you knew the P protein yeah and then back to you okay it's it is designed to have sugar in a natural state like with fiber but it's not designed to have sugar in a process state it's you have natural occurring sugars fine the problem with it is if you can get into a situation where you actually can rebuild and heal from all the stuff that we've done at this point time and then never eat actual processed sugar again you could do core plan from now on we find but most of us can't do core plan all the time regularly because we just constantly get this inbound sugar all the time here's the other thing to process sugar the reason that process we're not designed for it's like if I took gasoline for your car but then I like condensed it to where it's like it's just it's almost like nitrous oxide like it's not designed to take nitrous now it's fun you're off you go but you'll just burn that engine up right you just burn it up and so it's just is where you were made to have a certain octane level and that's it's like it keeps it burning at that temperature when you get sugar in there just goes what takes off and it just burns things up yeah glycation glycation it can and there's a dermatologist in Miami and New York that wrote a book called ten minutes ten years I haven't read the book I don't know what it is but he talks about how you supposedly held just decreasing all sugars helps rejuvenate because your body's always putting new proteins down like collagen x' and stuff and actually helps you actually look younger over time that's why a lot of people actually start maxilla and Kerr change their diet and they just yeah yeah you're so yours is one - yeah so when she came yeah so it's good yeah Gogi something that says like 6 grams of sugar but you don't see any sugar as listed as an ingredient for example lady size yeah yeah it'll be because the tomatoes have fructose no not necessarily unnecessarily so we're gonna get some natural occurring sugars in fruits and vegetables yeah so we're gonna get some natural sugars now again if I had somebody's trying to reverse their diabetes I'd probably steer them away from like tomato sauce because it has a higher glycemic index right just like I wouldn't there's benefits to two mangoes but I have them steer away from mangoes too right and so but yeah so when you don't see it on the label it's probably naturally occurring from what's in it that's why you don't see sugar and label for like laura's bars but you see dates and dates are like they're basically sugar with a wrapping like it's like they're just all sugar so good other questions good yeah so he's saying stevia looks like sugar it does look like sugar but stevia is it tastes sweet because it attaches itself to the sweet receptor in your mouth but it does it's not a straight it's not a sugar it's not a straight chain sugar like that so that it actually increases blood sugar like it does not increase blood sugar now the difference between like a fructose and a sucrose is fructose has it some different varying branch chains on it and sucrose looks like a straight like this so you imagine it can't just kind of goes right into the cell and just write as much real fast fructose doesn't rise it as fast but it's still flunk those rises pretty fast so that's kind of the difference but like when you look at like xylitol and stevia and those things they don't rise blood sugar because your body doesn't take it in as energy it's yes it's that I hear that all telling cuz it's processed it is processed so it is is there is there possible negative possibly yeah yep haven't won No if there is I'm in trouble Oh everyday everyday now the difference is for me some of you guys won't be able to do zile talk because it's a gut irritant and if I do much xylitol at all it's flatulence and diarrhea like I just can't do it like it's it's it's a lot some of you guys would be fine with it but for me I've just developed a sensitivity so yeah yeah yeah yeah now she just started her chiropractic care actually we want to really give her a round applause because she did a whole week of intensive so she did yeah and she did she got them she got six months of results in a week and she killed it it was really really good but it hurts it was intense right there was intense so but we literally just launched you into this whole thing and so function will catch up as the gut begins to heal and continues to heal you'll have less and less sensitivities but also just as we change some of the things that you were doing that were bland but weren't as healthy that the gut lining will be able to start healing as well too and so you got so to answer that question yes you will see a change and a decreased sensitivity and there'll be things you could not eat before that you will be able leave before yep yeah come on girl come on yeah yeah yeah so good yeah I get a hug for you leave so so my arms are collagen that's how collagen works it's in it's in protein strands right sugar binds between and then where it could it could stretch and it could stretch all of a sudden where it binds it it's now stuck and it won't stretch anymore and so it can actually break and so it can actually create a wrinkle and actually so having sugar glycation actually causes the glycogen and elastin to get hard and that's how it works yeah it's good stuff but it also having two organs to Jeff in the back year-round grass-fed no antibiotics no hormones no shots it's the biggest one so when I say organic there's a lot people have an organic way not even on the same planet as ours and it's just it also - I have some people that can't eat way and then when they try ours they're like oh I guess I can and sometimes they they afford it - what they're doing chiropractically but it wasn't chiropractic was literally the different kind of way and so it's good hey guys I want to thank you guys for coming", "7NnWklaeJ8c": "Glucose (also called dextrose) is a simple\nsugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6. Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide,\na subcategory of carbohydrates. Glucose is mainly made by plants and most\nalgae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. There it is used to make cellulose in cell\nwalls, which is the most abundant carbohydrate. In energy metabolism, glucose is the most\nimportant source of energy in all organisms. Glucose for metabolism is partially stored\nas a polymer, in plants mainly as starch and amylopectin and in animals as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals\nas blood sugar. The naturally occurring form of glucose is\nD-glucose, while L-glucose is produced synthetically in comparably small amounts and is of lesser\nimportance. Glucose is on the World Health Organization's\nList of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. The name glucose derives through the French\nfrom the Greek \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, which means \"sweet,\" in reference to must, the sweet, first press\nof grapes in the making of wine. The suffix \"-ose\" is a chemical classifier,\ndenoting a sugar. == History ==\nGlucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf. Glucose was discovered in grapes by Johann\nTobias Lowitz in 1792 and recognized as different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by Jean Baptiste\nDumas in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 proposed the term\ndextrose (from Latin dexter = right), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane\nof linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, D-fructose (a ketohexose) and\nL-glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation\nof the plane of linearly polarized light (d and l-nomenclature) was later abandoned in\nfavor of the D- and L-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric\ncenter farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of D-\nor L-glyceraldehyde.Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding\nof its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in organic\nchemistry. This understanding occurred largely as a result\nof the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize\nin Chemistry for his findings. The synthesis of glucose established the structure\nof organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus\nHenricus van 't Hoff's theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical\nbonds in carbon-bearing molecules. Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established\nthe stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible\nisomers, applying van 't Hoff's theory of asymmetrical carbon atoms. The names initially referred to the natural\nsubstances. Their enantiomers were given the same name\nwith the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry\n(e.g. Fischer nomenclature, D/L nomenclature). For the discovery of the metabolism of glucose\nOtto Meyerhof received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1922. Hans von Euler-Chelpin was awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Chemistry along with Arthur Harden in 1929 for their \"research on the fermentation\nof sugar and their share of enzymes in this process\". In 1947, Bernardo Houssay (for his discovery\nof the role of the pituitary gland in the metabolism of glucose and the derived carbohydrates)\nas well as Carl and Gerty Cori (for their discovery of the conversion of glycogen from\nglucose) received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1970, Luis Leloir was awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Chemistry for the discovery of glucose-derived sugar nucleotides in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates. == Chemical properties ==\nWith six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. D-Glucose is one of the sixteen aldohexose\nstereoisomers. The D-isomer, D-glucose, also known as dextrose,\noccurs widely in nature, but the L-isomer, L-glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates\nsuch as milk sugar (lactose), cane sugar (sucrose), maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc. It is commonly commercially manufactured from\ncornstarch by hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further\nenzymatic depolymerization. Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients\nof honey. All forms of glucose are colorless and easily\nsoluble in water, acetic acid, and several other solvents. They are only sparingly soluble in methanol\nand ethanol. === Structure and nomenclature ===\nGlucose is a monosaccharide with formula C6H12O6 or H-(C=O)-(CHOH)5-H, whose five hydroxyl\n(OH) groups are arranged in a specific way along its six-carbon back. Glucose is usually present in solid form as\na monohydrate with a closed pyran ring (dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it\nis has an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as \u03b1- or \u03b2-pyranose,\nwhich partially mutually merge by mutarotation. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms\ncan be crystallized: \u03b1-glucopyranose, \u03b2-glucopyranose and \u03b2-glucopyranose hydrate. Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides\nlactose and sucrose (cane or beet sugar), of oligosaccharides such as raffinose and\nof polysaccharides such as starch and amylopectin, glycogen or cellulose. The glass transition temperature of glucose\nis 31 \u00b0C and the Gordon-Taylor constant (an experimentally determined constant for the\nprediction of the glass transition temperature for different mass fractions of a mixture\nof two substances) is 4.5. === Open-chain form === In its fleeting open-chain form, the glucose\nmolecule has an open (as opposed to cyclic) and unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms,\nC-1 through C-6; where C-1 is part of an aldehyde group H(C=O)-, and each of the other five\ncarbons bears one hydroxyl group -OH. The remaining bonds of the backbone carbons\nare satisfied by hydrogen atoms -H. Therefore, glucose is both a hexose and an aldose, or\nan aldohexose. The aldehyde group makes glucose a reducing\nsugar giving a positive reaction with the Fehling test. Each of the four carbons C-2 through C-5 is\na stereocenter, meaning that its four bonds connect to four different substituents. (Carbon C-2, for example, connects to -(C=O)H,\n-OH, -H, and -(CHOH)4H.) In D-glucose, these four parts must be in\na specific three-dimensional arrangement. Namely, when the molecule is drawn in the\nFischer projection, the hydroxyls on C-2, C-4, and C-5 must be on the right side, while\nthat on C-3 must be on the left side. The positions of those four hydroxyls are\nexactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of L-glucose. D- and L-glucose are two of the 16 possible\naldohexoses; the other 14 are allose, altrose, galactose, gulose, idose, mannose, and talose,\neach with two enantiomers, \u201cD-\u201d and \u201cL-\u201d. It is important to note that the linear form\nof glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in a water solution. The rest is one of two cyclic forms of glucose\nthat are formed when the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (C5) bonds to the aldehyde carbon\n1 (C1). === Cyclic forms === In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose\n(either \"D-\" or \"L-\") exists in equilibrium with several cyclic isomers, each containing\na ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution however, more than 99%\nof glucose molecules, at any given time, exist as pyranose forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25%\nand furanose forms exists in negligible amounts. The terms \"glucose\" and \"D-glucose\" are generally\nused for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by\nan intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either\nthe C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a hemiacetal linkage, -C(OH)H-O-. The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a\nsix-membered heterocyclic system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar\n(hence \"\u2013ose\") containing a derivatised pyran skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and\nC-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether furan. In either case, each carbon in the ring has\none hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the\nhydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is -(C(CH2OH)HOH)-H or\n-(CHOH)-H, respectively). The ring-closing reaction makes carbon C-1\nchiral, too, since its four bonds lead to -H, to -OH, to carbon C-2, and to the ring\noxygen. These four parts of the molecule may be arranged\naround C-1 (the anomeric carbon) in two distinct ways, designated by the prefixes \"\u03b1-\" and\n\"\u03b2-\". When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in\nthe Haworth projection, the designation \"\u03b1-\" means that the hydroxyl group attached to\nC-1 and the -CH2OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a trans arrangement),\nwhile \"\u03b2-\" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a cis arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer D-glucose\ngives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: \u03b1-D-glucopyranose, \u03b2-D-glucopyranose, \u03b1-D-glucofuranose,\nand \u03b2-D-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium\nand interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid catalysis. The other open-chain isomer L-glucose similarly\ngives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of L-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding\nD-glucose. The rings are not planar, but are twisted\nin three dimensions. The glucopyranose ring (\u03b1 or \u03b2) can assume\nseveral non-planar shapes, analogous to the \"chair\" and \"boat\" conformations of cyclohexane. Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume\nseveral shapes, analogous to the \"envelope\" conformations of cyclopentane. In the solid state, only the glucopyranose\nforms are observed, forming colorless crystalline solids that are highly soluble in water and\nacetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol. They melt at 146 \u00b0C (295 \u00b0F) (\u03b1) and 150\n\u00b0C (302 \u00b0F) (\u03b2), and decompose at higher temperatures into carbon and water. === Rotational isomers ===\nEach glucose isomer is subject to rotational isomerism. Within the cyclic form of glucose, rotation\nmay occur around the O6-C6-C5-O5 torsion angle, termed the \u03c9-angle, to form three staggered\nrotamer conformations called gauche-gauche (gg), gauche-trans (gt) and trans-gauche (tg). There is a tendency for the \u03c9-angle to adopt\na gauche conformation, a tendency that is attributed to the gauche effect. === Mutarotation === Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal\nof the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming\nof the ring. The ring closure step may use a different\n-OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and\nfuranose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite\nhandedness as the original one (thus switching between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely\ndetectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium. The open-chain form is thermodynamically unstable,\nand it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms. (Although the ring closure reaction could\nin theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not\nobserved in practice.) In solutions at room temperature, the four\ncyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called mutarotation. Starting from any proportions, the mixture\nconverges to a stable ratio of \u03b1:\u03b2 36:64. The ratio would be \u03b1:\u03b2 11:89 if it were\nnot for the influence of the anomeric effect. Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures\nclose to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). === Optical activity ===\nWhether in water or in the solid form, D-(+)-glucose is dextrorotatory, meaning it will rotate\nthe direction of polarized light clockwise as seen looking toward the light source. The effect is due to the chirality of the\nmolecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, L-(\u2212)-glucose, is levorotatory (rotates\npolarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for\neach of the five tautomers. Note that the D- prefix does not refer directly\nto the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has\nthe same handedness as that of D-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that D-glucose is dextrorotatory\nis a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed some of the other\nD-aldohexoses are levorotatory. The conversion between the two anomers can\nbe observed in a polarimeter, since pure \u03b1- D- glucose has a specific rotation angle of\n+112.2 \u00b0 \u00b7 ml \u00b7 dm\u22121 \u00b7 g\u22121, pure \u03b2- D- glucose of +17.5 \u00b0 \u00b7 ml \u00b7 dm\u22121 \u00b7 g\u22121. When equilibrium has been reached after a\ncertain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7 \u00b0 \u00b7 ml \u00b7 dm\u22121 \u00b7 g\u22121. By adding acid or base, this transformation\nis much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain\naldehyde form. === Isomerisation ===\nIn dilute sodium hydroxide or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides mannose, glucose\nand fructose interconvert (via a Lobry de Bruyn\u2013Alberda\u2013van Ekenstein transformation),\nso that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an enediol: == Biochemical properties ==\nGlucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used aldohexose\nin most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that\nglucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the amine groups\nof proteins. This reaction\u2014glycation\u2014impairs or destroys\nthe function of many proteins, e.g. in glycated hemoglobin. Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed\nto its having a more stable cyclic form compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends\nless time than they do in its reactive open-chain form. The reason for glucose having the most stable\ncyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its hydroxy groups (with the exception of\nthe hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of D-glucose) are in the equatorial position. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural\nmonosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides. Another hypothesis is that glucose, being\nthe only D-aldohexose that has all five hydroxy substituents in the equatorial position in\nthe form of \u03b2-D-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions, for example,\nfor esterification or acetal formation. For this reason, D-glucose is also a highly\npreferred building block in natural polysaccharides (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of\nGlucose are termed glucans. Glucose is produced by plants through the\nphotosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms\nas an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its\nfree form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which\nare energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell\nwall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. These polymers are degraded to glucose during\nfood intake by animals, fungi and bacteria using enzymes. All animals are also able to produce glucose\nthemselves from certain precursors as the need arises. Nerve cells, cells of the renal medulla and\nerythrocytes depend on glucose for their energy production. In adult humans, there are about 18 g of glucose,\nof which about 4 g are present in the blood. Approximately 180 to 220 g of glucose are\nproduced in the liver of an adult in 24 hours.Many of the long-term complications of diabetes\n(e.g., blindness, kidney failure, and peripheral neuropathy) are probably due to the glycation\nof proteins or lipids. In contrast, enzyme-regulated addition of\nsugars to protein is called glycosylation and is essential for the function of many\nproteins. === Uptake ===\nIngested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3\nmakes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300\ng per day are produced by conversion of food, but it is also synthesized from other metabolites\nin the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing\npolysaccharides happens in part already during chewing by means of amylase, which is contained\nin saliva, as well as by maltase, lactase and sucrase on the brush border of the small\nintestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates\nand can be split off from them using certain enzymes. Glucosidases, a subgroup of the glycosidases,\nfirst catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing\nterminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded\nby specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often\nderived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide\nchains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named\nafter cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin) and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides,\nthere are maltase, lactase, sucrase, trehalase and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code\nfor glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation\nof glycogen, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides and poly(ADP-ribose). Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases\nand trehalases, but the bacteria in the gut flora do. In order to get into or out of cell membranes\nof cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins\nfrom the major facilitator superfamily. In the small intestine (more precisely, in\nthe jejunum), glucose is taken up into the intestinal epithelial cells with the help\nof glucose transporters via a secondary active transport mechanism called sodium ion-glucose\nsymport via the sodium/glucose cotransporter 1. The further transfer occurs on the basolateral\nside of the intestinal epithelial cells via the glucose transporter GLUT2, as well as\ntheir uptake into liver cells, kidney cells, cells of the islets of Langerhans, nerve cells,\nastrocytes and tanyocytes. Glucose enters the liver via the vena portae\nand is stored there as a cellular glycogen. In the liver cell, it is phosphorylated by\nglucokinase at position 6 to glucose-6-phosphate, which can not leave the cell. With the help of glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate\nis converted back into glucose exclusively in the liver, if necessary, so that it is\navailable for maintaining a sufficient blood glucose concentration. In other cells, uptake happens by passive\ntransport through one of the 14 GLUT proteins. In the other cell types, phosphorylation occurs\nthrough a hexokinase, whereupon glucose can no longer diffuse out of the cell. The glucose transporter GLUT1 is produced\nby most cell types and is of particular importance for nerve cells and pancreatic \u03b2-cells. GLUT3 is highly expressed in nerve cells. Glucose from the bloodstream is taken up by\nGLUT4 from muscle cells (of the skeletal muscle and heart muscle) and fat cells. GLUT14 is formed exclusively in testes. Excess glucose is broken down and converted\ninto fatty acids, which are stored as triacylglycerides. In the kidneys, glucose in the urine is absorbed\nvia SGLT1 and SGLT2 in the apical cell membranes and transmitted via GLUT2 in the basolateral\ncell membranes. About 90% of kidney glucose reabsorption is\nvia SGLT2 and about 3% via SGLT1. === Biosynthesis === In plants and some prokaryotes, glucose is\na product of photosynthesis. Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of\npolymeric forms of glucose like glycogen (in animals and mushrooms) or starch (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis,\nthe cleavage of starch is called starch degradation.The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules\ncontaining two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six\ncarbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result\nof other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all biomolecules come from\nthe assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants during photosynthesis. The free energy of formation of \u03b1-D-glucose\nis 917.2 kilojoules per mole. In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver\nand kidney, but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g of glycogen are stored,\nin skeletal muscle about 250 g. However, the glucose released in muscle cells\nupon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated\nby the hexokinae, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport\nprotein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build\nup glucose from other metabolites, including lactate or certain amino acids, while consuming\nenergy. The renal tubular cells can also produce glucose. === Glucose Degradation === In humans, glucose is metabolised by glycolysis\nand the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis is used by all living organisms,\nwith small variations, and all organisms generate energy from the breakdown of monosaccharides. In the further course of the metabolism, it\ncan be completely degraded via oxidative decarboxylation, the Krebs cycle (synonym citric acid cycle)\nand the respiratory chain to water and carbon dioxide. If there is not enough oxygen available for\nthis, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation\nand releases less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through\nthe bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs (Cori cycle). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite\nacetyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle can also be used for fatty acid synthesis. Glucose is also used to replenish the body's\nglycogen stores, which are mainly found in liver and skeletal muscle. These processes are hormonally regulated. In other living organisms, other forms of\nfermentation can occur. The bacterium Escherichia coli can grow on\nnutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source. In some bacteria and, in modified form, also\nin archaea, glucose is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.Use of glucose as an energy source\nin cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation\nof glucose by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation\nof glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged phosphate group\nprevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the cell membrane. Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate\ngroup activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis. At physiological conditions, this initial\nreaction is irreversible. In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule\nproduces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis\nthrough substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the\nprocess). In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose\nis much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending\non the organism) through oxidative phosphorylation is generated.Click on genes, proteins and\nmetabolites below to link to respective articles. Tumor cells often grow comparatively quickly\nand consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis, which leads to the formation\nof lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen. This effect is called the Warburg effect. For the increased uptake of glucose in tumors\nvarious SGLT and GLUT are overly produced.In yeast, ethanol is fermented at high glucose\nconcentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration but not\nto fermentation). This effect is called the Crabtree effect. === Energy source === Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms,\nfrom bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria),\nor fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of\nenergy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of\nfood energy per gram. Breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g., starch)\nyields mono- and disaccharides, most of which is glucose. Through glycolysis and later in the reactions\nof the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, glucose is oxidized to eventually form carbon\ndioxide and water, yielding energy mostly in the form of ATP. The insulin reaction, and other mechanisms,\nregulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. The physiological caloric value of glucose,\ndepending on the source, is 16.2 kilojoules per gram and 15.7 kJ/g (3.74 kcal/g), respectively. The high availability of carbohydrates from\nplant biomass has led to a variety of methods during evolution, especially in microorganisms,\nto utilize the energy and carbon storage glucose. Differences exist in which end product can\nno longer be used for energy production. The presence of individual genes, and their\ngene products, the enzymes, determine which reactions are possible. The metabolic pathway of glycolysis is used\nby almost all living beings. An essential difference in the use of glycolysis\nis the recovery of NADPH as a reductant for anabolism that would otherwise have to be\ngenerated indirectly.Glucose supplies almost all the energy for the brain, so its availability\ninfluences psychological processes. When glucose is low, psychological processes\nrequiring mental effort (e.g., self-control, effortful decision-making) are impaired. In the brain, which is dependent on glucose\nas the major source of energy, the glucose concentration is usually 4 to 6 mM (5 mM equals\n90 mg / dL), but decreases to 2 to 3 mM when fasting. Confusion occurs below 1 mM and coma at lower\nlevels.The glucose in the blood is called blood sugar. Blood sugar levels are regulated by glucose-binding\nnerve cells in the hypothalamus. In addition, glucose in the brain binds to\nglucose receptors of the reward system in the nucleus accumbens. The binding of glucose to the sweet receptor\non the tongue induces a release of various hormones of energy metabolism, either through\nglucose or through other sugars, leading to an increased cellular uptake and lower blood\nsugar levels. Artificial sweeteners do not lower blood sugar\nlevels.The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g.\nafter overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dl of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about\n10-15 % higher. In addition, the values in the arterial blood\nare higher than the concentrations in the venous blood since glucose is absorbed into\nthe tissue during the passage of the capillary bed. Also in the capillary blood, which is often\nused for blood sugar determination, the values are sometimes higher than in the venous blood. The glucose content of the blood is regulated\nby the hormones insulin, incretin and glucagon. Insulin lowers the glucose level, glucagon\nincreases it. Furthermore, the hormones adrenaline, thyroxine,\nglucocorticoids, somatotropin and adrenocorticotropin lead to an increase in the glucose level. In addition, there is also a hormone-independent\nregulation, which is referred to as glucose autoregulation. After food intake the blood sugar concentration\nincreases. Values over 180 mg/dl in venous whole blood\nare pathological and are termed hyperglycemia, values below 40 mg/dl are termed hypoglycaemia. When needed, glucose is released into the\nbloodstream by glucose-6-phosphatase from glucose-6-phosphate originating from liver\nand kidney glycogen, thereby regulating the homeostasis of blood glucose concentration. In ruminants, the blood glucose concentration\nis lower (60 mg/dL in cattle and 40 mg/dL in sheep), because the carbohydrates are converted\nmore by their gut flora into short-chain fatty acids.Some glucose is converted to lactic\nacid by astrocytes, which is then utilized as an energy source by brain cells; some glucose\nis used by intestinal cells and red blood cells, while the rest reaches the liver, adipose\ntissue and muscle cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence\nof insulin). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose\nand returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not\nreturned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In fat cells, glucose is used to power reactions\nthat synthesize some fat types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's \"glucose energy storage\"\nmechanism, because it is much more \"space efficient\" and less reactive than glucose\nitself. As a result of its importance in human health,\nglucose is an analyte in glucose tests that are common medical blood tests. Eating or fasting prior to taking a blood\nsample has an effect on analyses for glucose in the blood; a high fasting glucose blood\nsugar level may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus.The glycemic index is an\nindicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates,\nmeasured as the area under the curve of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison\nto glucose (glucose is defined as 100). The clinical importance of the glycemic index\nis controversial, as foods with high fat contents slow the resorption of carbohydrates and lower\nthe glycemic index, e.g. ice cream. An alternative indicator is the insulin index,\nmeasured as the impact of carbohydrate consumption on the blood insulin levels. The glycemic load is an indicator for the\namount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index\nand the amount of consumed food. === Precursor ===\nOrganisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. Starch, cellulose, and glycogen (\"animal starch\")\nare common glucose polymers (polysaccharides). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen)\nserve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and chitin, which is made from a derivative\nof glucose) have structural roles. Oligosaccharides of glucose combined with\nother sugars serve as important energy stores. These include lactose, the predominant sugar\nin milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and sucrose, another disaccharide which is\ncomposed of glucose and fructose. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins\nand lipids in a process called glycosylation. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules\nusually use phosphorylated glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling\nit with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond. Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose\ncan be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both\nas a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into\nlipids. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of\nother important molecules such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In living organisms, glucose is converted\nto several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various metabolic\npathways. Among them, all other monosaccharides such\nas fructose (via the polyol pathway), mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose\n(the epimer at position 4), fucose, various uronic acids and the amino sugars are produced\nfrom glucose. In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate,\nwhich is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to glucono-1,5-lactone. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building\nblock in the trehalose or the dextran biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial\nxylose isomerase to fructose. In addition, glucose metabolites produce all\nnonessential amino acids, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, fatty acids, cholesterol\nand nucleic acids. Finally, glucose is used as a building block\nin the glycosylation of proteins to glycoproteins, glycolipids, peptidoglycans, glycosides and\nother substances (catalyzed by glycosyltransferases) and can be cleaved from them by glycosidases. == Pathology == === \nDiabetes === Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the\nbody is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin\nin the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by\npersistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin\nresistance. The pancreas is the organ responsible for\nthe secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose\nlevels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell\nand therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently\nhigh elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could\nbe damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas\ntries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose\nlevels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant\nto the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve\nthe same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more\ninsulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic\nburnout, and the disease progression of diabetes. To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering\ntherapy, glucose levels can be measured. Blood glucose monitoring can be performed\nby multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in\nthe blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance\ntest (GTT) \u2013 for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a\n75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's\nbody to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should\ndecrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream. === Overweight and fatty liver ===\nAn increased intake of glucose leads to obesity and, in consequence, partly to the metabolic\nsyndrome with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but not the consumption of glucose as part\nof a normal calorie intake. === Hypoglycemia management === Individuals with diabetes or other conditions\nthat result in low blood sugar often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms. One sugar commonly used is glucose, often\nin the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or\nmore other ingredients as a binder), hard candy, or sugar packet. == Sources == Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose,\neither as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and glycogen),\nor together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides sucrose and\nlactose). Unbounded glucose is one of the main ingredients\nof honey. ^A The carbohydrate figure is calculated in\nthe USDA database and does not always correspond to the sum of the sugars, the starch, and\nthe \"dietary fiber\". All data with a unit of g (gram) are based\non 100 g of a food item. == Commercial production ==\nGlucose is produced industrially from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis using glucose amylase\nor by the use of acids. The enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced\nthe acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically\nwith more than 90% glucose in the dry matter) with an annual worldwide production volume\nof 20 million tonnes (as of 2011). This is the reason for the former common name\n\"starch sugar\". The amylases most often come from Bacillus\nlicheniformis or Bacillus subtilis (strain MN-385), which are more thermostable than\nthe originally used enzymes. Starting in 1982, pullulanases from Aspergillus\nniger were used in the production of glucose syrup to convert amylopectin to starch (amylose),\nthereby increasing the yield of glucose. The reaction is carried out at a pH of 4.6-5.2\nand a temperature of 55-60 \u00b0C. Corn syrup has between 20% and 95% glucose in the dry\nmatter. The Japanese form of the glucose syrup, Mizuame,\nis made from sweet potato or rice starch. Maltodextrin contains about 20% glucose. Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, potato, barley,\nsweet potato, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize)\nis used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component\nof invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose that is produced from\nsucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolysed\nto glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical. === Conversion to fructose === In the USA almost exclusively corn (more precisely:\ncorn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of isoglucose, which is a mixture\nof glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power \u2014 with same physiological\ncalorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose\nis eight million tonnes (as of 2011). When made from corn syrup, the final product\nis high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). == Commercial usage == Glucose is mainly used for the production\nof fructose and in the production of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a sweetener, humectant,\nto increase the volume and to create a softer mouthfeel. Various sources of glucose, such as grape\njuice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production\nof alcoholic beverages. Most soft drinks in the US use HFCS-55 (with\na fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the\nUS use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass). In the neighboring country Mexico, on the\nother hand, cane sugar is used in the soft drink as a sweetener, which has a higher sweetening\npower. In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter\nalia, in the production of confectionery such as candies, toffee and fondant. Typical chemical reactions of glucose when\nheated under water-free conditions are the caramelization and, in presence of amino acids,\nthe maillard reaction. In addition, various organic acids can be\nbiotechnologically produced from glucose, for example by fermentation with Clostridium\nthermoaceticum to produce acetic acid, with Penicilium notatum for the production of araboascorbic\nacid, with Rhizopus delemar for the production of fumaric acid, with Aspergillus niger for\nthe production of gluconic acid, with Candida brumptii to produce isocitric acid, with Aspergillus\nterreus for the production of itaconic acid, with Pseudomonas fluorescens for the production\nof 2-ketogluconic acid, with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of 5-ketogluconic\nacid, with Aspergillus oryzae for the production of kojic acid, with Lactobacillus delbrueckii\nfor the production of lactic acid, with Lactobacillus brevis for the production of malic acid, with\nPropionibacter shermanii for the production of propionic acid, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nfor the production of pyruvic acid and with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production\nof tartaric acid. == Analysis ==\nSpecifically, when a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger\nmolecule, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography analysis or lectin immunostaining\nis performed with concanavalin A reporter enzyme conjugate (that binds only glucose\nor mannose). === Classical qualitative detection reactions\n=== These reactions have only historical significance: ==== Fehling Test ====\nThe Fehling test is a classic method for the detection of aldoses. Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present\nto a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I)\nsolution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, while\nthe Cu2+ tartrate complex is reduced to Cu+ and forming a brick red precipitate (Cu2O). ==== Tollens Test ====\nIn the Tollens test, after addition of ammoniacal AgNO3 to the sample solution, Ag+ is reduced\nby glucose to elemental silver. ==== Barfoed test ====\nIn Barfoed's test, a solution of dissolved copper acetate, sodium acetate and acetic\nacid is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a\nwater bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly\nproduce a reddish color and reddish brown copper(I) oxide (Cu2O). ==== Nylander's Test ====\nAs a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the Nylander's test. ==== Other tests ====\nUpon heating a dilute potassium hydroxide solution with glucose to 100 \u00b0C, a strong\nreddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops. Concentrated sulfuric acid dissolves dry glucose\nwithout blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid. In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation\nproduces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of CO2. Glucose forms a black mass with stannous chloride. In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose\n(as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal lead acetate solution, white\nlead glycoside is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking\nand turns brown. In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow copper\noxide hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed\nduring boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal copper acetate solution). With Hager's reagent, glucose forms mercury\noxide during boiling. An alkaline bismuth solution is used to precipitate\nelemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose. Glucose boiled in an ammonium molybdate solution\nturns the solution blue. A solution with indigo carmine and sodium\ncarbonate destains when boiled with glucose. === Instrumental Quantification === ==== \nRefractometry and Polarimetry ==== In concentrated solutions of glucose with\na low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can\nbe determined with a refractometer, for example in the Oechsle determination in the course\nof the production of wine. ==== Photometric enzymatic methods in solution\n==== The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts\nglucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic\nreaction (Trinder reaction) of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine to a purple dye. ==== Photometric Test Strip Method ====\nThe test strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic\nacid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer\nmatrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at\n510 nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows for routine blood sugar determination\nby laymen. In addition to the reaction of phenol with\n4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry\nat higher wavelengths (550 nm, 750 nm). ==== Amperometric glucose sensor ====\nThe electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically\nquantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV. The GOx is immobilised on the electrode surface\nor in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are\nused in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron. Cu-CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free\namperometric electrodes. This way a detection limit of 50 \u00b5mol/L has\nbeen achieved. A particularly promising method is the so-called\n\"enzyme wiring\". In this case, the electron flowing during\nthe oxidation is transferred directly from the enzyme via a molecular wire to the electrode. ==== Other sensory methods ====\nThere are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose. Given the importance of glucose analysis in\nthe life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based\non the use of boronic acids, which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications\nwhere other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives,\nwhich often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also\nother probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding\nproteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which\nindirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolised products,\ne.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors. Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that\nuse the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters. ==== Copper iodometry ====\nGlucose can be quantified by copper iodometry. === Chromatographic methods ===\nIn particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey,\nchromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography\nare often used in combination with mass spectrometry. Taking into account the isotope ratios, it\nis also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods. Derivatisation using silylation reagents is\ncommonly used. Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides\ncan be quantified. ==== In vivo analysis ====\nGlucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with 2-deoxy-D-glucose or fluorodeoxyglucose. (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer\nin positron emission tomography in oncology and neurology, where it is by far the most\ncommonly used diagnostic agent", "lZVirid-jL0": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and this is a drop roller a machine that makes drops that was made in 1871 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania we're gonna use this machine today to make some hard candy and the hard candy is a bit of an experiment in color and flavor this is about the fourth batch of the day and this is what I like to make experimental candy because the machine while it's a little stained with food coloring from the previous batches is also just right for making candy easily there is an old saying that you taste food with your eyes long before you taste it with your mouth the sight of a food or a color triggers a response which brings on the flavor and leads you to expectations and this video is about those expectations and expectations also take place culturally as we've discussed in other videos the United States sees purple as the flavor of the grape specifically the concord grape and europe sees the purple flavor and candy as the flavor for black currant so now that my hot sugars are 310 degrees i pour it out on my candy cooling table and I ask what flavor is this I mean it's not clear it could be anything and that's what this video is kind of about wondering what the visuals which you can see on the other side of the internet are and how they compare to the flavors which are on my side of the video camera these associations are well known by the people who make food and prepare food for you walk down the aisles of any supermarket and you will see the tomato sauce mostly in red and something that has blueberry in it will have a splash of blue the color is there to key you to what you can't see and can't taste outside the packaging and you are tasting with your eyes and this is okay it's because it's the way we were programmed if you think about it we must have developed food skills before we even developed language skills as a people because if you didn't know when the food was ripe or when it was dangerous to eat you wouldn't be able to you know process the nutrients you made so when something feels soft and even versus lumpy or picky when something smells nice or something looks nice you have expectations and the expectations are programmed into us earlier this year with a laundry detergent tablet we can see these expectations going the wrong way and I think this is a video about breaking those expectations let me give you an example there's something called the strip effect you see you can't taste or smell the candy across the internet but you can see colors and words just fine so let's have some fun with them and then try to apply that to candy so let me demonstrate how you're programmed with colors now I'm going to display some colors on the screen and as I display them save the color out loud for instance we're starting with orange will then do red green yellow blue pink red orange and you'll see the speed is pretty consistent when you do this remember we're saying the colors we don't really care about the words but here the words and the colors will match I want you to read these out loud left-to-right the colors that these words are we'll get back to the Stroop effect in a few moments but we're gonna go play with the hot sugar now and it's cooled off to a great consistency it's sort of the consistency of silly putty or playdough we're gonna put it through these brass rollers that'll cool it off a little bit and make it keep its shape if you'll notice we're making lots of drop rolled round candy here and an opaque red and that opaque red is gonna be important in a moment so now to get at what I'm demonstrating when I show you this next card read out loud the colors not the words but the colors and see if the delay is a little longer than last time [Music] if you did this experiment correctly and just read the colors you'll find the delay going on between when you see it and when you can say it because your body's trying to say or your brain is trying to say the word that's printed not the color of the word and flavors are like this too if you try a flavor that is red and it's colored blue unless you've been trained to recognize that like we have with blue raspberry you're not gonna end up saying or tasting in this case the flavor and that's what our experiment today is we're making drops in bunches of flavors but they're all gonna be the same color and one of the meeting I told everybody what we're gonna do they looked at me and almost as once they said that's madness and I realized our flavor assortment now had a name and madness it is and we're going to pack these candies randomly mix together so you should get some of all the flavors but what flavors some of them are going to be normal do you expect black berry in pink or would you expect an apple in pink we might have butter we're looking at doing a salty flavor and a hot flavor with chili pepper in it and other flavors with this and the fun part is we're gonna be replacing flavors as we run out so we're never quite gonna know what's in the assortment but there's always gonna be six or seven flavors I'm gonna aim for a salty and a sweetness sour and some other things in here and you're gonna have to guess the flavors it's an assortment of fun and love it's sort of combining spin the bottle and Russian Roulette and will give you hints online as we put them up so pay attention when you order but they're gonna change and we're gonna throw some wild cards into because you know April first is coming up and we're gonna have some fun with this candy thanks for watching our video if you liked it you can subscribe to us here on YouTube we have a lot more candy making videos you can follow us on Facebook Twitter Instagram and if you want our candy you can go to our website which is WWE if you're ever in Tallahassee were right off i-10 in Tallahassee Florida come and visit us in person and if you're lucky that see us make candy we don't make it every day but we make it lots of days we also want to thank the classy Rex for letting us use their music you'll find a link to their YouTube page in the description and of course to Prince Buster the God of all sky musicians thank you for watching we hope to see you around here again soon [Music]", "TPOoltEmU-w": "let's go ahead and get started thank you all for joining our September education ball we like to that we have one education law focused on nutrition throughout the year and we wanted to try to broaden that call to include something that's a bit more maybe less focused on the restrictions that I think we've all heard of over and over again but how to fit that diet into a budget and a little bit of budget I know I recently went grocery shopping and looking at some prices but was overwhelming I'm very excited and very thankful Jenny Smith on the call he's a dietician from worthless kidney centers she's being presented today notes and hopefully you were able to take a look at some of the handouts that northwest innocence has put together on the topic that I've sent up before the call if not I'll send them out with the recording as well and Jenny if you're ready feel free to take it away right so I'm Jenny Smith I'm a registered dietician I'm also a certified diabetes educator and I work at the Northwest kidney centers in Seattle area I am I'm in Kent which is a little bit south of Seattle right now and it's a beautiful day and somebody had mentioned they were staying home in the Washington DC area because of the the hubbub around the Pope being in Washington well we have the president of China here and so like all the highways have been you know shut down and read diverted and so we're we're glad to have him here but we're very happy that he's leaving today so we can get our our horrible traffic back to just horrible rather than just impossible all together like for example at our dialysis center we had a couple of people who their transport didn't come till two hours later because they were stuck in traffic on outside so anyway enough of enough of my problem okay our topic today is something that I absolutely love talking about first of all I just love talking about grocery shopping because that's like my go-to fun thing because I'm a I'm a nerdy attention and like that sort of thing but also I have a great many patients who have very limited budgets as you know dialysis is not a a high paying profession to be on dialysis so a lot of times people find themselves in a totally different situation than they used to be in like maybe they never really thought about grocery shopping and now they're also trying to find specific products that are low salt or low phosphorus or limiting potassium and you know having different fruits and veggies overwhelming so hopefully we can give you some clues on some things to do so as mentioned before North West kidney we're a really big dialysis center in the Seattle area and we have lots of different cultures and so that always makes it extra challenging to to find materials in different languages and but it's it's really fun from a dietitians perspective because I am looking at how different people across the globe kind of deal with limited food budgets so that's really very helpful and we can get a lot of clues for what we can do from that so one of the things that's on the email that she'll send out did they see I think it's like six or seven pages that northwest kidney center has put together sort of a grocery store tour on pieces of paper there's a canned good handout baking and spices low salt Asian foods baked goods dairy selection candies and snack aisle so when you go to these different aisles that gives you some really good specific things to look for that would be renal friendly and also low budget as well okay so let me get started on the regular presentation and oh my gosh we're up to 47 people this is fabulous in the spring I did a presentation and they said oh it's just going to be a few people that was 400 by the time we got there so my friend and I were just totally freaked out we had ratima ng on this so since it's online so I was just thinking imagine Angelina Jolie that's that's the person that I am on this line as you're looking so that that's close enough to what I like alrighty so dialysis diet on a budget I get a little mouth here alright so the very first thing that you need to think about is what are your goals and we we do encourage you to think about some things that you've already been told before but the basics are the basics for a reason so the very basics of really staying within your budget planning you're saving money even if you don't want to do it pretend that you're paying yourself by the money that you're going to save by doing the budget planning so saving morning money is important for everybody you know even if your food budgets not super tight being more efficient is just being a good steward for the environment there was a recent government report that said that people throughout 25% of their food purchase that was kind of shocking they were saying it was sort of like going to the grocery store and buying four bags of groceries and then just leaving one in the parking lot so I was thinking you know I might need to look at that a little bit myself so that's you know saving saving money is also good for the environment so they'll just people give you a little bit extra push to do this if you're environmentally aligned as everyone in Seattle is that's just another thing that we'll do consider that the time spent planning is also keeping you from not only overspending at the grocery store but maybe overeating as well and you maybe need to during this planning time just step back a little bit and get a little philosophical about what exactly are your goals in eating you know are you trying to lose weight are you trying to spend less money are you trying you know are you trying to maybe make a big change all together and eat more fruits and vegetables or you may be trying to eat increase your protein you know try to keep some of those goals in mind and then when you come up with your your plan then the next thing is figure out what your money budget is a lot of times people complain that you know the first and vegetables are so expensive but you know we're they should be about half of your food budget I think we kind of want half of our foods budget to be M&Ms and little snack cakes and I think sometimes I can be but the healthy food is expensive and it's just really lost things don't every go healthy food is really expensive and I just want to make sure that that you're you're planning and going in the direction that you want to go in all right so another thing to do is just to check your calendar because it's a very good idea to to write out a menu of what you're going to do and I know you've heard this from dieticians forever but let me just give you a few incidences that I've run across that I just I just think are fabulous support for writing out a menu I had a dietician friend a few years ago and she said that she made out a 17 day cycle menu for her family so she had 17 days where she had breakfast lunch and dinner and so that's not that's just a touch over two weeks and so she always had you know these same meals like during a day and she had made them so much that she in her mind had all the recipes memorized she had all of her family's favorites in there and she said they never noticed that every 17 days they had the same menus over and over and over again and so I thought that's just fabulous you know because you're always thinking oh I have to have a month's worth of menus really I think 17 days is kind of on the high side it needs to be more than seven because you don't want to fall into that every Monday we have meatloaf but if you have a kind of an odd number like a nine or an 11 or a 15 where you sit down and really come up with the things you love to eat then you can fit these these foods into you know a cycle and then you can also coordinate all the ads that you find all the coupons that you have because you know okay this is going to come up next week I'll save this and use this coupon next week or oh there's a special on turkeys this week well I have that coming up in my cycle so maybe I'll get a second one and put it in the freezer so things like that are very important you end up eating the things you love people end up thinking you're a genius because you just aren't cooking all these wonderful foods off the top of your head and you end up saving a lot of money she said even when they go on vacation she knew exactly which pans to take which staples to take and she said they would go on vacation they had a big family and they would you know you know stay stay at us a cottage or something and they ate all their meals at home saved all that money for the big family that she had and they thought it was just fabulous and they loved her food better than the things that they could eat out so that's just and just something to think about um let's see okay so also when you're doing your planning so we're looking at what's going on in your life you know do you have maybe a potluck coming up that you don't have to plan a meal for a lot of folks with their religious organizations there's a meal that maybe goes with whatever religious ceremony they have that for that week let's see another thing is look for specials like if you're a senior 55 is now considered a senior in many places which made for some people seem like a long way away but hey it's like oh I could have been done this for a few years for me now and then also look for big things up Katy mentions in the eateth slights you put together that Chenault coupon book that's a Seattle type thing but I've lived in other areas of the country and there's always these little you know retail coupon books that you can get like another thing is there's a big store here called grocery outlets and I get a little flyer in the mail that for you know every so much I spend I get four dollars or five dollars off and so let me tell you I'm grabbing all my neighbor's flyers but don't use Grocery Outlet and I'm using those whenever I can and do know when you look at coupons that often the brand-name store the store the brand-name coupons are not always the best deal but it's just something you know sometimes you can get a really good deal on those from time to time then the next thing you want to do is okay I'm going to back up just a little bit when I was talking about planning menus if you want to plan a menu just keep in mind most people eat the same two or three breakfasts over and over again they maybe eat the same two or three lunches over and over again and maybe four to seven dinners so if you're going to plan some sort of cycle menu it doesn't have to be huge and that's really enough variety for us so I thought I just mentioned that and you might also want to plan snacks into your cycle menu like adding more fruit you know planning fruit snacks in so that you make sure that you eat them ok well so then the next step is once you've got your plan you know what you what you think you want to do check out your refrigerator as I get older I used to be able to go the grocery store and remember everything that we were out of and now we have a list and if it's not on the list I don't get it so a little one of those refrigerator list things that you can stick on your refrigerator is always a good idea so as soon as you run out someone can jot it down for you I always look through my refrigerator and see what I've got what I could incorporate into something I think I want to have it's a good time to check out on the strange moldy gray things in the back that have started growing in your refrigerator look at your staples look at your herbs and spices kind of you know look under the sink make sure you've got what's your grocery I'm sorry I'm like laundry detergent and all that sort of thing some people if you have a cycle menu can even make up a pre-printed reminder list where you just have everything that you usually have and this is what my friend had she had a Xerox page that was on the refrigerator and as she ran out of things she would just circle that so she just took the same list to the grocery store over and over again she didn't have to make out a list it was just highlighted with the things she needed so it was pretty slick I was really quite impressed with her and also you might find looking through your refrigerator and also look through your freezer you might not need to shop as much as you needed to and a couple of times a year try to eat down your pantry you know try to just go through and get creative with all those odd little things that you bought during the year and use up everything in your freezer use up everything in your refrigerator so you can kind of start fresh from scratch and you don't have so many old food items around ok cooking from scratch so this is something if you aren't a cook already it's a good way to start is just a master mix so a master mix is like this quick and you know this quick is full of phosphorus since we're trying to stay away from that so we have at North West kidding me a master mix recipe that includes low sodium or low sodium and low phosphorus baking powders and other items like that but really just making a mix yourself even if you use regular baking soda or regular baking powder is going to be lower than the Bisquick because we're not putting in phosphorus powder to keep it from taking we're stirring it in the refrigerator so it doesn't it stays fresh but you can all often make some mixes from things that you buy as convenience items that you can come up with pancakes and muffins and cookies and breads and all kinds of things like that I also encourage folks to make their own spice mixes so instead of buying those little packages of taco seasoning and things like that it's pretty easy to come up with those on your own and once again there's recipes on the internet just for ever and you also can save a lot on the sodium and save on the packaging if that's something that you're looking for another thing that's suggested is to buy staples so that you can have three meals that you can make anytime so here's some suggestions and some things that you can keep on hand recipes on the north west kidney website under recipes so that you can put together like this fast fettuccine is a low phosphorous spaghetti it's cream cheese garlic parsley pasta leftover veggies or meat it's so simple you're teach your kids to make it you can make homemade pizza you can make your own crust there's just all kinds of things you can do but it's nice to have these sorts of things kind of on your master menu so that you can always have a meal on hand even if it's not planned in in there ok so some of the rules of shopping things you already know make a list dough go hungry and consider instead of shopping every week shopping every two weeks the more often you go the more often you're gonna spend money and of course everyone knows store brands are cheaper and we do want you to read labels but don't think you have to go and understand every label there's tens of thousands of items in a grocery store so just pick one thing like maybe when you go to the grocery store just take a few minutes stand at the cheese aisle or stand at the canned food aisle or stand at the snack cracker aisle and and consider which items would be best for you so what are we looking for on a label there's way too much information I think on a label I'm sure you've heard this before but I'm just going to run through it real quick you have to look at the serving size and you have to look at how many servings per container so this is a cake item it says five servings per container this just may be a little a little roll kind of thing and you're saying this was supposed to be five servings I'm probably going to eat half of this so remember that you have to look at the portion size because all of this nutrition information is based on that portion size so if you're going to eat the whole thing this cake items you're going to sit and eat the whole thing at once you have to take all these numbers times five and so suddenly that little hundred milligrams of sodium went up to 500 milligrams of sodium or those 200 calories went up to two thousand so one of my very favorites is some of the premium brand pot pies if you look at those you turn them over you go oh wait a minute you know that's high in salt but it wasn't as high as I thought it was but then if you look up at the label it might say serving size one half of a pie so who eats a half of a pot Pocky so you know these are just some things to look for so one rule of thumb if you're looking at sodium in products super simple one to one sodium to calories so this item is 200 calories per serving and 100 milligrams of sodium so this has more calories than sodium say for example a snack cracker that might for a snack item that might be 200 calories but it's maybe 300 milligrams of sodium so that's you know for every calorie is going to be more milligrams of sodium so if you if you look at snacks that way it's often kind of surprising what you can find that you can eat that if you eaten the right portion is not too much sodium so once again that ratio is one calorie to 1 milligram sodium that would be considered a low sodium product okay some cheap protein eggs are one of the best buys in the world although they have been going up lately they've been killing you know some sort of chicken thing going on but in general eggs are a pretty good deal the dark meats more less expensive than the white meat Chuck gross canned tuna frozen fish an expensive fish rather than some of the premium ones and then using plain whey protein is a way to add lots of protein to your diet without adding lots of calories vegetables frozen are actually such a good deal they have to take the most perfect things to freeze them so that they'll look perfect when they thaw so it's really you know people think that the frozen vegetables aren't as good as the fresh but I think frozen eggs it's fine to use canned vegetables they're probably going to have salt in them so you can rinse them get some of the salt off that's still up something that's true you have to it's more than just like running them under the water once you have to kind of rinse them for about a minute 11 soak for a minute so that the sodium comes out and of course using things in season so I live in the Pacific Northwest and I used to live in the Midwest I've lived in Indiana for quite a bit of my life and I've have family that lives in the south and so I've been all over and it's amazing how many wonderful farmer's markets we have out here I know in Indiana we had one in Indianapolis and maybe it was on Wednesday so around here it's a good idea to check out farmers markets but sometimes they're a little bit pricey so that's just something to think about but I do know that's a SNAP program the food stamp program often you go to a farmers market and show them your card and you can trade in some of your snap dollars for tokens or dollars or whatever they use at that particular farmers market and you can actually buy things at the farmers market with your food stamp money so I think that's a pretty cool thing so look for that in your area I was thinking it might just be in our area but it seems like it's pretty common some other tips are the prepackaged lettuces they're lovely but if you just get a regular ole head of lettuce and chop it up it's much less expensive you can often ask for some things to be cut in half so that you if you think you're not going to eat the whole head of cabbage or the whole dozen eggs or the whole squash grocery stores like to display you know their ware so that people will buy them so they'll often cut something in half for you and you can ask the butcher to take a bigger piece of meat and cut it into smaller pieces so if there's something on sale the butcher in the grocery store can you know cut it up and so that you can have it a smaller amount all the rest of it oh and then another thing I love my Asian fruit and vegetable markets in the Pacific Northwest because they are just dirt cheap I have one near my house and I might want to get some basil and it's a grocery store it's $4 for a little tiny plastic container and it's like half rotten and I can go to my Asian grocery store and it's a dollar seventy-five and it's a giant bunch and I can put it in water and I've got basil for for days and days weeks and weeks sometimes I have it even grow roots grew roots it was so fresh and I stuck in the garden so and then depending on different things you can get on the internet there are certain foods that are more seasonal and then you can kind of look for those and you know plan your shopping around there and then buying in bulk so buying in bulk excuse me is there drop something buying in bulk is a fabulous way it's much less expensive but you have to be very organized about this you have to make you have containers to put this in once you get home you date it you label it so that you know what you have so if you're very organized buying in bulk can be just very very helpful and then you also it's more ingredients than it is actual prepared food so you'll have to make sure that you know what you're going to cook out of it but for some basic things that's very nice and for the spices it's really inexpensive so this is what I had mentioned before these are what the handouts look like so you can do a little grocery store tour on paper with our NKC handouts and then there are lots of places you can get food that aren't the grocery stores so Consumer Reports and probably you guys all know this too is that grocery stores are really not the cheapest place to buy things if you're one of those folks that wants to spend the gas which is very expensive to run around from grocery store to grocery store you can hit all the loss leader things but you have to kind of be smart about where you shop so Walmart actually according to Consumer Reports is one of the lowest prices overall I thought that was really interesting beating competitors prices on 29 items other places that used to not do groceries like Target and I've noticed the town that I live in is on a major bus route and so we have lots of interesting things and my dollar store that's near my house has just an amazing amount of food in it and I found that many of my patients shopped at dollar stores and Big Lots to get some things so you have to be kind of careful you know use that one-to-one one calorie to one milligram of sodium rule because often some of these things have long shelf lives and a lot of sodium but I found some excellent deals like for example my dollar store has a low salt seasoning blend that I compared to mrs. - original and it was just like mrs. - original and the mrs. - was $5 and the low salt seasoning blend and my dollar store was a dollar and it was it was a bigger container - just one tip an excellent dip is some sour cream like a cup of sour cream and one tablespoon of a low salt seasoning and mix that together and that's a really nice low salt dip that you can serve with low salt crackers for a snack so we had a food tasting and that's what we did we use the the nabisco that has weekends and Triscuits and some other cracker that hint of salt so they were low salt crackers and then we had the sour cream with mrs. dad through the midst of my fake mrs. - from the dollar store made a really nice dip that was just a hit and a lot of people thought this is great I can make this I can take it to an event maybe vegetables instead of crackers and I can have a low-salt dip that I can enjoy - so anyway get off my dietitian bandwagon here and also Consumer Reports mentioned that Dollar General had better prices and family dollars so okay then thinking some of the things that we've mentioned before dollar stores food banks look around at your different food banks they can just be a wealth of not only just food but resources for you if if you litt find you you need a food bank don't just go in and get the food but look at their brochures often they do some magnificent training programs for you in trying to find some lower-cost things they may have gotten a big amount of some sort of commodity and they may have some really fabulous recipes for that particular commodity so it's just a excellent learning program you can also find from time to time things like protein bars at convenience stores that are a pretty good deal and then some bulk stores if you have a lot of people to feed those can sometimes be a good deal I do know that a lot of my my patients and just family members we have all decided that the big bulk stores end up selling you too much you know and if you don't have a place to store it if you live in a small apartment or something like that you know make sure if you go that you have space for it and that you're going to use the item up and you're not just buying you know giant packages of chips or something like that you can grow your own you can actually even grow your own if you've got a space as small as a pot I told you about my mind didn't but I have a basil plant that I grow I'm a really bad gardener but I can manage to water and put a basil plant in a sunlight so I need lots of basil and things so that's one of the things also a lot of programs there a lot of programs out where people have fruit trees or vegetables and they share them with food banks or there's even websites that you know that people will let you come to their yard and pick their apples or you know pick their pears or whatever they've got available so be kind of creative and see what you can find but I know that there are several programs here in the Seattle area we're kind of different than the rest of the world we do we really really recycle everything here then if you have a registered dietitian available to you ask MFA we'll take you to the grocery store we we have a program here where we often will take folks to a grocery store and it's just fabulous it's a good opportunity for us to really get to know our patients better and then we learn things you know often my patients will show me items that they found that I just hadn't been looking in that direction so that's just a really fun thing to do then I mentioned web sites before spark people has one that I'm going to show you some of the slides for that show you what twenty dollars can buy in the Seattle area there's a store called grocery outlets and you can get on their website and they do a challenge every May with their employees where they have their employees try to eat on four dollars a day using the Who Dat grocery outlets so grocery all that is like a discount store I can't get every I have one near my house my car just automatically goes there I can't always get everything that I want there but sometimes I tell myself if Grocery Outlet doesn't have but have it I probably should just eat what they've got so it's a really interesting little handout and I think it's online that you can print it off there's also several websites out there for folks that that try to navigate you through how to live on a food-stamp budget you know what to eat there's some books out called diabetes for seven dollars a day it's kind of an older book I have a book that's called feeding your family and on $5 a day there's just a lot of books out like spevak's you can get some good ideas so what I really like the subject of trying to eat well and eat cheaply and I talked to people about this all the time and some of the things that you have to kind of accept if you're going to eat well and eat cheaply are that you may have a limited selection I've had people tell me I'm never hungry but I don't always eat what I'm what I want to eat but I'm always eating something so that's a little different if you're you know your mindset isn't quite there but it's a very it's kind of an interesting little what do I want to say I feel little limit that you can make for yourself you know to try and see what you can come up with that you can come up with things that you like to eat even on this limited budget and then also make sure that if you're trying to do something like this or if you're needing to you know live on a food-stamp budget you have to save up some of your money for things that you'll use several times like condiments spices oil sugar flour butter these are some of the places where if a bulk buying in bulk can save you as long as you have places to put it okay time doing this on the phone and what feedback I don't know if you're bored if you have questions so let me show you from the spark people website this is just a fabulous you can download these slides if you want to look at these later and so you have some of this commentary but here we go for twenty dollars looks like you can get four code for fries for burgers for 2176 and or you can buy these foods it looks like there's orange juice some oatmeal some beans some sausage got some vegetarian burgers potatoes vegetable strawberries and so this is on the homemade meal some of the items that you could make out of this $20 and they have other things like this too so here's another one you could buy a pizza or you could buy these things and then those are the meals that you can make out of it like for example number three make an Asian peanut sauce with peanut butter blanch the spinach and serve the fish poached or baked with the peanut sauce over it if that interesting sounds really good and then for $10 you could buy a case of Bud Light or you could buy these things and you could cook these items okay and to save even more money so some other things I don't have a slide for this but just to recommend to be adventurous look into other food cultures for example there are just some amazing inexpensive ways to eat that are ethnic related I think Indian food is about I love Indian food and it's very simple very inexpensive the spices you get to put your own level of them in you can buy pre-mixed spices but they're just the simplest meals to put together actually Native American food is quite interesting there's a vegetarian diet but you can learn some new ideas and things to do with those grains and beans I have a couple of patients from the continent of Africa and they just bringing me bring in fabulous ideas of just some really tasty things that you can make stews and things like that Mexican latin-american food a lot of these foods are based on really really healthy rice and beans and and very limited amounts of meats which meat is one of the expensive items on your your menu and just recently I had a chance to go to New Orleans and Creole food I was looking at that but oh my gosh these are very simple ingredients and this is fabulous so well southern cooking thrown in there and of course Asian food has lots of interesting things that you can spread a small amount of tasty foods with some sauces and then we do have a handout on Asian foods that make them less sodium less look less high in sodium so just kind of in conclusion try to cut out the food waste right out of menu try it for two weeks at week and actually do the whole menu for two weeks eat all the food even if you don't like it write down what you didn't like tweak it for changes and you know see if you can come up with a tasty menu things that you and your family like and then once you start eating those things kind of over and over again you can get the recipes memorized in your head start tweaking them with the flavors that you like maybe start incorporating a new vegetarian dish or something over time and keep your budget down and keep your diet full of things you like and healthy things and so to save even more money resting your cook at home pack a lunch potlucks I have many of my my patients that live in like a senior housing situation and they will all pool some things and just have a delicious potluck you know with with things that they like to eat and then there's leftovers that people can take home and it's just a way that they can all kind of share their their bounty of things that they have and then kind of make a meal for everybody and also keeps your spirits up when you're eating with friends before you go out to eat eat a little bit so maybe you can just get by with just the atmosphere and a salad or an appetizer or just dessert and then if you carry something with you all the time like a protein bar some string cheese a piece of fruit or whatever it is you like just three little things maybe a applesauce cup and you know a half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you know something like that to carry with you all the time then you always have a snack and your tempted to do fast food or something like that and that is it so this is our website Northwest kidney org we have lots of recipes with beautiful color pictures we have sheets on there and there is my email if you want to contact me directly I can get you any of this stuff and that is it looks like there's lots of bad stuff going on so I'm questioning well thank you so much Danny feel free please if you have a question go ahead yes Charlie Connecticut hi hi yes my question one has to deal with the fact of my background is in health and wellness being a natural bodybuilder personal fitness trainer etcetera so what I was wondering is you know I grew up with the notion that whole wheat bread and grains and things of that nature are good for you we're in the kidney diet it's almost like the opposite and it's really good like learning a brand-new language now obviously there are good booze affinity with the kidney diet I was wondering you know the origin of the kidney diet like cream cheese them where just how long ago was this determined that certain foods that you can eat if a kidney diet or okay but you know other healthier foods are not okay where did that origin come from yeah let me tell you about that so what we read with you I all the time telling my hospital died my page piece with people when they come back from the hospital well the dietitian told me I couldn't eat whole grain bread you can eat whole grain bread don't worry about that so don't don't let that deter you just make sure that you look at your potassium levels the whole grains have more potassium in them and so it's a it's an individual thing so I really think that whole grains help your digestion they'll help your constipation issues that you might have on dialysis there's lots of extra nutrients in them it's only the potassium so if your potassium is okay then it's not a big deal does that make sense yeah but wasn't really one thing I'm serious about how is it this bottles my mind how isn't that white flour is good for you on the kidney violin you know white flour in general for spring you know you know good brought out that it's not good for us yeah yeah it's that same thing I think people are just being overzealous and not looking at the whole diet you know it's you have to really kind of go by your labs it's just person by person and you know really meat products have lots of potassium and phosphorus in them and we're pushing high protein but there is I have several I have many patients that are there just vegetarian religiously and they're their proteins are great and I know that they're eating you know all these whole grains and beans and things so you kind of have to balance your protein and take versus the other does that make sense I think at all exceptions if you if you actually live with folks you know that do this they there's a little bit more leeway than you know some of the recommendations that are just written down that makes sense as individuals and the thing that's gonna say to that I've noticed is that with collabs when my potassium my oestrus are well below where you know it should be it everything's great I can't afford to in essence cheat a little bit and maybe have a little bit maybe extra cheese if I want to you know in the morning that I would normally it's a little bit extra you know so then there is a leeway you know if your numbers are good you know then you have it's not as stringent as its first made out to be but and you have hello you know the you know the are sent to you so exactly right you've done like a wonderful patient that's keeping track of their body so that's what you have to do you have to kind of watch what your body is doing and your lab so congratulations you're doing it well well thank you very much thank you your answer questions if you do have a question you unmute your line by pressing star six or count six Eric I know you had raised your hand before did you have a question or was it just heard in regards to snap in the farmers market and those of you who are online I did upload with the slide the handout and actually I'd like I mentioned I found the list of farmers markets that do accept snap so you can sort the tea and I'll send all that out with the recording too but please this is the time for questions anyone else have any other questions well if no one does and feel free to break in if you do I recently went to the diabetes educators convention in New Orleans that's where I fell in love with Creole cooking but they had a presenter there that was from food banks and I was going to research this a little bit more but the food banks the network like ours is called Northwest harvest and all those networks that are connected across the country they have some education programs that are kind of you know for all of the networks together so I thought well that's a really cool resource that maybe people could look into some of those like for example this lady that was doing her programs she was actually offering a cooking class where he would cook from items and then they would give the participants a bag of the food that they had cooked a meal with so they could take it home and cook it again and this one lady has said that she had come to the class originally because she just really needed the free meal and really you know just wanted that and then came away a real advocate for cooking at home and now she is part of the program and she's helping to teach the classes and it's you know she just came from oh you know I I can't do this - I can do this so I just thought that was fabulous and so to look into some of your food banks and you know just kind of see what they have to offer so that's another I'm sorry hi my name is Mikey nee Lu just fine time what's your question my question is I'm gonna have good rafts all the time until I'm wanting to eat greens or being and my dietician is very informative she also she has your certificate in and dietitian and dietary needs and basically I'll tell her you know like I like mustard I like that show others and tacos I love green eyed more healthy before I became a dialysis patient then I do as a dialysis patient because the food is so restrictive and I'm a picky eater I don't need for food that loan like I don't like this I don't like real food I am Indian place be super careful with the portion sizes on those things you know guys what she tells me yeah a tablespoon servings me full of the greens and incorporate it with other foods yeah that clouds do when we like just that it is it is but she sure don't want to end up in the hospital with a high potassium you know I I did have a lady that she started on dialysis and her daughter came to visit and her daughter decided that her mom wasn't eating well so she made her tomato salad made her spinach salad and I forget that she was having some fresh peaches because they were in season and the lady ended up with a high potassium in the hospital before I ever got a chance to see her because like she came in you know late one week and she was in the hospital by the weekend so you have to be you have to kind of work with us you know when it comes to those high potassium things because you can't end up in the hospital if you if you overdo on the high potassium so that's kind of the one really dangerous thing about the dialysis diet but some of the other stuff you know we can we can be a little bit more flexible with so and then the court boys does it smooth is that what I mean okay for the drainage or reading when you like that yeah what how do you incorporate other foods that so so maybe what I might do is have a bed of rice and I would put you know a tablespoon or two of greens on top of those and mix it all up together so you get that green taste but it's not you know a great big bowl my dreams in life without you you're right okay so something like you know something like that that you can kind of mix thing together so the greens and what else yes this is a hit hey anybody got any suggestions for her I'm trying to think what other sorts of things are there some other kinds of green things that that aren't the dark green that you would like to mix with it all right you know I like spinach I like it colors I love broccoli I love string beans I love veggies period how about carrots could you do shredded carrots and green together blue that doesn't sound like a good taste but I'll try that I need to sit with you and and we need to spend some time together so I kind of hate to make too many particular I'll go with our Dino you authorized an email that'd be very sweet thank you welcome thank you hello hello go ahead well thank you for letting my you guys I appreciate it yeah and thank you so much any presentation yes I'm sorry do you have a question yeah this is Lisa okay from a patient at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville Florida and they were talking about the greens which you could put with it that wouldn't be so high I put cat like some other cabbage because I'm an alpha but like you take the cabbage and kind of Giuliana or cut it up as much she can I take a little bit olive oil some onions and the minced garlic from Dollar Tree believe it or not because if you get  you know a relatively inexpensive cabbage and it's cheap it's 39 cents a pound it's as high as 69 cents but it's like really cheap we can have it it's one of our good vegetables and you mix that with the collard greens and it's actually a dish that I had I hadn't had until I moved out Excel uh-huh wonderful I love southern cooking my folks are from the south so give me everything morning it right the father it down and you only need a little bit of the greens but you'll have the green face just take a little bit of the collard greens because they are high in the potassium and everything and with the cabbage it's just really good great suggestion you know it's really interesting all across the world cuisines everybody's got a got a really cool cabbage recipe pea I think that's just one of those things that grows in it it lasts all winter and people get tired of it so they start making up all these really inventive ways to eat cabbage I think the great fun with the cabbage rolls like with the ground beef and a little bit of rice and you make like a little rabbit roll and I'm gonna try but I had it like prepared out before but I driving you as many of you know like an carrots and thing I try to use the money's about good vegetables like yeah wonderful you know what and and make sure that you share those recipes with your dietitian because you'd be surprised how many other people might want to know that too so that's great yeah and it was great Colin playing my first climber I didn't know quite how to get on here because I'm actually at a hospital my brother's having a heart procedure so I met with that possible your injection so when I was trying to say how am I gonna I don't have my computer with me I do have my cell phone so it was really appreciated well I hope that goes well and at least we helped you pass some time yes are there any last-minute questions well Jenny thank you so much for all the great information I know a nice group thank you and and I want to be Angelina Jolie okay just have that image and I'll make me really happy that's what I was entirely as well yeah I'm exactly like her all right yes thank you all for joining and we'll see you next time I'll send out the recording with C handouts as well for you to keep on hand and review so they", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "dR3LWbcR1-M": "[Music] welcome to America's host Austin yes ma'am yes sir in this episode we talk everything from hemp it's all about the Terps bro oh yeah an Terps we talk about Terps and how they really affect you not just the strain and strain specific it's much more than that all the benefits yes we talked about hemp being legalized and how that's going to be a massive production for Americans finally to have that back in our soil after 80 years and we know how much all you guys love sales but not even just a sale but on weed everything so we talk about all the blowouts they've been having for the new July 1st regulations yes so we talked about everything about that transition and all the requirements and everything that California is doing to crack down on the 350 million dollars worth of marijuana that is being destroyed completely demolished not in your lungs either sorry to tell you yeah what they're just burning this to the sky of it I don't know I mean they might put in the ocean let the humpback whales little-little humping in because they've you know they've been a little endangered so it's nice to finally get back on the Mike's just us two so this episode is a lot of fun and we're about to go on instagram live yes and at the end yeah but we're gonna dancing around the house too in my feelings [Music] so it's been a while though just being you got on the mics I like it I like it because it just enables us to like show our personality you know and instead of just having like an agenda of a third person or fourth person an interviewee we have our own ways of going about stuff you know because when a person's here we have to obviously cater to them and their business and their why they're here obviously we have to respect their time sorry how have you been like in the buyers market in the last couple of weekends of buying cannabis here in the Bay Area loving it I was just thinking the other day my phone's like blowing up it's I'm like who keeps texting me and I look it's like all the dispensaries sale we're getting rid of this everything 60% off edibles $5 grams for $3 so it's been pretty crazy you're loving that oh yeah and then when you go there though I mean they were definitely a little bit more crowded the club the dispensaries mhm and you had to wait a little bit longer but it was worth it I mean how deep are these discounts like like minimum 60% holy moly 60% or more wholly discounted that's crazy because we're going through a transitional period right now as of July 1st California came out with a new law requiring these dispensaries to have everything tested and for it to be basically package compliant as well so but so when you're saying testing you're talking about like THC content no I'm glad you asked that because Cory said the same thing as I do are why are they doing this all this kind of stuff it's for the chemicals and the residual solvents and all the things that they're using to like make the flower yeah it's basically they're testing to make sure that the cannabis is clean so they didn't use any synthetic nutrients or sprayed it with any bad pesticides because of course you don't want to smoke or inhale any of that and not to go in your lungs in your bloodstream that's that's bad news so they're basically all the untested goods and all that they're trying to fly off the shelf trying to push that off the shelf because if they don't then it's getting thrown away yeah thrown away so supposedly High Times came out and said 350 million dollars worth of marijuana was thrown away or destroyed Wow wasn't the past week yeah that's crazy I wonder if that's like actually thrown out and destroyed or if that's like what they're saying they sold well from the stuff that would have had to be destroyed you know well their headline says California dispensaries must destroy 315 million oh let's be honest I don't think they're really destroying that like if you had a dispensary would you not just give it to your friend Billy Bob well here's the thing I guarantee you that they have public officials making sure that the 20 pounds of marijuana they didn't sell before July 1st has to I mean they still have 20 pounds of it that they were just like why couldn't they just keep it like I wonder what their rules are on that that was black market because they don't want that to go right back into them and they just seize it yeah Wow I mean think of all like the Coast Guard and all their Caesars and all the cocaine and marijuana and all that stuff coming from wherever they I don't know they just lock it away or burn it or destroy I know but it's just it's interesting to think like I mean I wonder if that's how it would be with alcohol like if they had you know or would the owner of Brody's liquor just get to keep it interesting yeah I wonder I wonder back and when they had the Prohibition era like if they had new laws if they had literally like drained it out and ran out like a [ __ ] senator or something or yeah who knows like it still does you're right I mean I guess you know they do track everything now it isn't like it's legal but it's government regulated so well this whole transitional period was for the seed to sale process you up to the strengthen it so now all these dispensaries have to get if they play fair I mean safe to the public so let me tell you what I think one good thing about the this transition this these new laws so instead of me going to homeboy down the street that test marijuana and I pay him an extra thousand dollars to say hey of this test at 20% THC bump that up a couple percent and tell me tell the consumer that a test at 24% THC and just because you're saying that people do that yes yeah yeah they bribe or they undercut or flour at a higher price or just a more flashier price because you know everybody looks to the tea so that and with marijuana having these synthetic nutrients most of the time that's how these insane looking buds look so lab made most likely they might not be using the best nutrients but an other case that should has to be tested now so like there's no getting around that like you have to make sure your sits in line now you can't be using stuff that's bad for people to consume which is a good thing yeah I mean but it does really really suck that all these dispensers in these small businesses are having to destroy their product just because of new laws but hey you know it's growing pains yeah growing pains and you're right I mean it's about time that the consumer benefits for a second at least and it's like are we really benefiting when these new laws are what's really benefiting us I'll tell you what we did benefit with those beautiful sales that's what I'm saying benefited off the sale but it's like if none of that stuff is tested it's like kind of almost ready to begin with yeah most definitely so you think about it I mean we smoke some weed has definitely been sprayed was not the best stuff but it's like we also live in California I can't imagine what people in illegal states are smoking in the bottom of my shirt off or even worse for sure you know it's crazy as the people in California know how to make this [ __ ] look so good people in the pocket states they're just like give me whatever you got type of deal so we've we've been on the the the cheat inside for a while if you know I'm saying you know what I'm saying you know I'm saying so let me brew regio from cannabis ca.gov what they basically had to say so as far as the laboratory testing requirements they're saying beginning July 1st 2018 a licensee may only sell cannabis Goods that has been tested and passed all in requirements an effect of the time of testing all canvas has to be destroyed if not tested before during first 2018 it's interesting that they don't specifically state what tests I mean yeah of course the people in the weeds of that stuff now but right I wish I wish that that would be cool for me to know mmm so packaging and labeling requirements beginning jr. Orton excuse me beginning July 1st 2018 all packaging and labeling must be performed prior to canvas goods being transported to our retailer so this is n house obviously which that's the way it should be a retailer shall not accept canvas goods that are not properly packaged and labeled a retailer shall not package or label canvas goods even if the canvas goods were in inventory before July 1st however for medicinal sales retailers will place a sticker on the cannabis good stating for medical use only upon sale to a qualified medicinal customer unless the statement has already printed on the package so that's already been happening I don't know and it's saying it's saying just distinguish medicinal which yeah also THC limits for edibles you already know this moment all the people the audience beginning July 1st 2018 edible cannabis Goods may not exceed 10 milligrams of THC per serving a month may not exceed a hundred milligrams per package yeah so we knew this but that's uh I mean obviously further for the normal average customer consumer that's fine for the hardcore medicinal user or recreational user anybody that's been in California this whole time that's been smoking weed and has some sort of a tolerance now it's like I'm not gonna eat a whole chocolate bar right yeah and yeah it does stink for sure I miss the days when you did have 500 milligram edibles and thousand not to say that I took those but it definitely helps for the people that do have a higher tolerance because you can just break off a bite of that instead you know right instead of scarfing down a [ __ ] whole chocolate bar that's 30 grams of sugar ba ba ba so yeah that's a very big point that you brought up but I kind of I kind of see where they're coming from because the government doesn't want like a kid to get off I mean but but there's also different proof alcohol and they just lock it up in a correct thing at the store to say to say and we have guns like but we don't require that you keep a gun in a safe away from a child right that's and like we doesn't kill you so yeah I agree that's pretty pretty I don't know what else you can do besides like a fingerprint scanner for your medical marijuana products unlike a safe like I don't it doesn't need to go to that extent it's just like a kid can't open certain pad like just with pharmaceuticals it's like just put it in something that a kid can't open why do we need to limit like yeah why do we need to go to that extent correct I agree but of course I mean I'm sure it's all money money driven know for sure for sure hopefully I mean you know it's ever-changing so it could go back we'll see yeah could just be for now definitely and you know what I think the edible this is I'm speculating here I think the edible companies like this because they have to use less cannabis and their butter or you can throw more and they get some more so why do they carry yeah exactly they just need a fork out more for the chalked up cookie dough or whatever they're using but it also kind of levels the playing field as well it's like think about how much more competition you have now instead of being the thousand milligram chokolate bar that nobody else does now everything is a hundred pretty much yep yep yep so you really think you can't even really get I mean you can get like little individual what like a 25 or a 45 but for the most part most of them are a hundred right package so I'm thinking now right that it is I don't even think they'll make like there's little forty was single-dose it'll be cut out but it won't I think it'll be a gummy that you can cut into fourths mmm it'll be 40 milligrams yeah yep so damn I was gonna say something right before you said gummy were you talking about I was saying it creates more competition with like a thousand milligrams chokolate bar yep so now the yeah definitely the distributor has to make like really good packaging and make it pop or they have to really have like something different like it works have a well-known brand that people arty already and flock to yeah Korova mm-hmm definitely definitely so you have to have a niche or a value that you had just more than 100 milligram which stinks because at these sales I got a pack of edibles and they were like little sour gummies but they were cherry cola flavored mm-hmm and they were made by somebody local homemade all organic right and it's like I would almost rat well I wouldn't almost I would rather have that than the basic kevo kirova chocolate bar definitely I agree so I feel like it's just gonna be hard because a dispensaries not gonna carry gummies coconut oil peanut butter cookies granola bars does but like they're only gonna carry so much right they own it so pushing out all the other tiny people that mm-hmm I mean this is much like edibles but the same with growing I mean same with all the other you could have like a grocery store full of audibles like that's all many types of edibles I've seen oh yeah I mean anything anything can be you can put marijuana you can infuse it with marijuana for sure but I mean you talk about undercutting the small guy I mean that's happening and growing to think about all the guys and that are growing in mindo or whatever they have to comply with the new laws and they just don't have the upfront money that it takes to maneuver their farm around to comply with the new laws you know so well and I was hearing him like Santa Cruz and stuff like that that they were regulating the counties more where they were pretty much saying you can't grow any more or you know some people were grandfathered in and it was like a big fuss because they weren't really clear they were just like ripping it away from people right so that was yeah Wayne the original 4/20 CEO was telling us about that that basically these guys money it's all money it's all money driven these guys in Monterey County got I don't know thousands of acres of farm taken away from them just because someone else had more money than them pretty much with the more regulations we get mm-hmm definitely there's going to be some growing pains but I wonder if it'll even out cuz I was a consumer like I'm saying I really believe that the industry is gonna start going more towards craft cannabis in these crazy streams that just drop you know once in the summer and you don't see him again like people are gonna be more particular and they like that it's grown without the pesticides and definitely each plant is treated with love and stuff like I don't know it I think it might get to the point where you have your master trapper yeah yeah you have your marvel read your buds and then you have your yeah crazy local Cali IPA yep yep yep I I totally agree you're gonna create that niche market to where people will will go out of their way it was instead of the chocolate chip yeah they would go out of their way to find that special product they always want but it's gonna be hard for dispensaries right now to carry those I think hopefully hopefully sure they will get to that point so right now they're just trying to sell whatever sells cuz god damn the taxes are killing them I mean they've been they done sold up it's even gonna be hard now cuz we all just bought everything right like everyone's gonna be fine for like a month at least oh definitely yeah the dispensaries right now like this next month our sales are gonna be nothing yeah and speaking of sales then a few dispensaries around here in the Bay Area they don't have anything on their shelves right now because they have nothing that's compliant yep so they literally have to shut in their doors which is I mean I don't know how why you wouldn't have prepared for that but at the same time agreed agreed I mean you obviously know that this deadline is coming up so you either gotta sell everything on the shelf or you get product that's compliant and have that transition period I mean that's that's something as a business owner and you got to look for well if I a business owner I want to put my stuff on sale before everybody else did too - sure I would I just got rid of it mm-hmm and I and I think that's what some of them did because I would see summer sale that's when we got that extra 13 from Khalifa it's a summer sale so I think that's when they were China yeah okay here we go this is this is how we're gonna start market it pushing this yeah this stuff we got in the back room that we've had here for five months that we've been waiting first bus or sale well we got to get it out here we go well I know that there's some other cool things going on like when Lauren just came to visit us from Florida mm-hmm Lauren a budtender that we had if you haven't listened at his episode one of my first few one of the first view yes she is a budtender also a consultant with Knox which is a medical marijuana dispensary in Florida one of the few yeah visited and saw some of the dispensaries here well when she went back she said that they have new batches of cartridges and CBD capsules but that they just added seven percent more terpenes into the cartridges and she said that they're freaking awesome oh that's soos and she had sent me a chart so like it tells you all the terpenes so jack career has pining and lebanon and then Sour Diesel has my cream lemon een and Cairo Filene very good blue dream has my crane and pie mean and it basically tells you all the flavors they're like pining and obviously pine so your wood mm-hmm what's uh let's take a step back and tell people what terpenes are no you're fine terpenes are basically when you open that nice jar of marijuana that you just got and that smell hits your nostrils like a bag of bricks that smell is what's basically the terpenes but each individual strain has different terpenes and these terpenes ultimately is how they affect you all kinds of terpenes cannabis is just one of the plants that has like the most insane right I mean yeah oranges produced terpenes I mean all kinds and lemon limes every every scented fruit has terpenes Oh coffee barista used to make us exotic like banana mocha and she be like it's all about the turkey she was super cool huh we would tip her and little notes instead of giving her a dollar bill or to Delilah like there's some Candyland yeah so a lot of people think okay a certain strain affects me like I like white widow right that's my favorite strain well ultimately it's not really their strain that's making me feel that certain way it's a terpenes and that strain that make me feel a certain way so science is just now finding out what well this definitely so kind of like reversing a little but I kind of named off a few of them but one of the most obvious is pining and the flavors of it pine makes sense like you're walking into a yeah but some of its benefits specifically are that it's an antibacterial anti-cancer anti-inflammatory it helps control your bronchial system and then it's also a memory enhancer interesting and then like another popular one lemon flavors are citrus and orange but its benefits are anti-anxiety anti-cancer anti-inflammatory and antidepressant interesting which is cool because I really like like forbidden fruit Clementine like the ones that have the fruity the well not only just the fruity but the orange E mm-hmm and that's interesting because I do like anti-inflammatory side effects as well as anti-anxiety and anti depressant I don't know it's it's good when you're like feeling emotional yeah I agree I agree I can't wait till we get more into the actual science behind this and then and we'll post this actually on Instagram for you guys to see because this is really interesting all the different flavor profiles and benefits and it's cool to look at hey Kiki do you love me on you Rana so I just handed a jar to Rey that is basically some it's a marijuana jar that I got in Las Vegas at a dispensary it's a little eighth green leaf green leaf and they have everything tested and it's all marked on the jar of what it is so not only is a THC they teach see a percentage the CBD the CBD and the CBD a but also they have terpene profiles on there as well and they show you the percentage of that on there so I thought that was really neat yeah so you got an eighth of lavender which is a indica strain the terpenes in the lavender oh sameen and that has 1.1 and yeah okay well no it just says 1.1 like a-- and then there's pining 2.88 - okay and then there's Meyer seem six point three one four six point three one four yeah I'm pretty sure that's percentage and that's that's really crazy it doesn't say percentage though okay well it's not Oh what do you think that is milligrams I don't think so I mean what does it say told you can figure out what the percentage is just move the decimal but it doesn't say percent so that's not percent because all the other ones say percent known I'm saying hmm that's interesting you all know it else that's interesting there's this mercy in compound if it's shown to have 0.5 percent or above it's known to have a really couch lock effect so that mercy yeah and decay and which it was which I really like that strain a lot if I could find more lavender I would definitely buy some in those Terps are in mangos the Terps are n mangos there and bay leaves thyme eucalyptus lemongrass basil it's even in hops as well cool as a signature spicy earthy musky scent that sometimes smells similar to close with a mildly sweet flavor profile that can vary from string to string but it's saying that this is common with indica dominant strains so it's pretty cool I think I I wish and I think that the marijuana industry will all go to this type of labeling well because the connoisseurs and the people that have been smoking like they some of them care more about the terpenes because again that's what the effects are that's the taste that has a lot to do with the profile right and I think that's I think that's only into the connoisseur those people like maybe if that was general knowledge people there will you know it will be because think like instead of going the dispensary for okay I'm gonna go paint today in the woods so I want like Jack Herer I want to be up blah blah blah and I be creative I'm gonna look for like two types of terpenes and I'm gonna try and see what flower they had that has those highest percentage of terpenes and I would buy that right because at this point it's just sativa indica hybrid and that's pretty vague vague and it's inaccurate right yeah so because if I grew white widow and yuca or why would I would have different terpene profiles so yeah it's really cool so obviously this isn't for the average consumer like the average consumer I want I'm gonna try and give them the basic info but as they get to like on their stuff and like in cannabis I think that they'll really get into the terpene profiles and I hope it's labeled more because I would like to know what terpenes I like right because I don't well when it is labeled that's when people will know so cuz they go home and say oh I don't realize this is the only packaging I've ever seen that all the [ __ ] labeled so shout out the green life productions in Las Vegas well yeah cuz they were doing that from the guess what you're saying yeah but I've seen some like that on dabs okay sobs are true yeah they're more tested level because you can actually take hte which is high terpene extract okay and that's what they'll do they'll mix that as a sauce like on top of diamonds mm-hmm like a interesting I did not know that hte HD so I'm assuming what they do with these carts is they have a I would love to get let's do it yeah I'd love to get a cart specialist especially a cart cartridge maker yeah so that I feel like they fill that [ __ ] up all the way with THC oil pretty much and then whatever strain they want to use whether it's forbidden fruit they'll normally take a distillate because that's in its own name distilled so many times that basically the taste and everything is extracted from that well so it yeah yeah so it's just so THC yeah that THC oils yeah I was referring to it yeah and then that's when they'll reintroduce like you're saying the terpenes are though right and that's why - I think some of the cartridges are like weird stream names or like they'll just add the terpenes that are in a jock career and say that it's jock career when that's not what the THC isn't from a jack herer flour mm-hmm they just reintroduce the terpenes right I think that's a majority of companies yeah I doing I think that's obviously more beneficial which is why it's a different high when people say oh I'll smoke a bowl and then I'll smoke the cartridge and it's just so much different right agreed Wow I would love to get honestly somebody from absolute extracts or some somebody bigger crews beeps she sells every brand like she knows everything about cartridges yeah especially someone that like makes them and like the in the process that would be cool to talk to yeah you know I love that science [ __ ] well the sales people have to know the science yep so in other news did you hear about hemp being passed I wasn't before right so so for the first time in 80 years this building 8808 zero Wow yeah so the first time in 80 years this bill legalizes him which this bill is the farm bill what which has a ton of provisions that the Senate passed but one of the big ones being hemp being legalized so we forget that hemp was actually widely grown across America and the 1800s Americans used hemp for anything from fabrics heap yep fabrics to wine to paper honestly I think paper was probably the biggest yes so our government basically treated industrial hemp like any other farm commodity until the earlier 20th century around 1937 the law defined hemp an all marijuana a narcotic drug Wow so that dramatically limited its growth obviously which because I mean hemp is the non-sena of it right but right it's the it's the cousin yeah it's the cousin that's that's the nerdy cousin that got dragged in for the assistant murder right yeah he was the one waiting in the car he wasn't the one robbing the bank yeah so in 1970 it got even worse because it became a schedule 1 controlled substance so of course nothing is gonna get past that I mean if the FDA the government says no no then good luck so yeah 80 years we can finally Americans can grow hemp on their own soil which is huge it really is a not only perfect it's a huge resource so it's gonna take away us getting foreign source hemp it's gonna allow us to make more money with more American workers so I'm really happy to see that I can't wait to see what we see in the next few years that will be made with hemp well and it's crazy to think yeah and just hemp but the marijuana industry too like how many marijuana jobs there are gonna be in the next five years definitely oh yeah oh yeah I mean hundreds of thousand once you want to be a hemp Pharma if you had a very secure job making a lot of money I mean that's sounds like a lot of fun you know yeah I mean that's this is something that a lot of people were gonna base their life off of so good on them for finally getting it passed right I would like to tell you all some like the many uses of hemp too while I'm at it yeah so hemp is not only obviously I said for fabrics but it can be used for building materials plastic alternatives even fuel so that's that's a huge one I'm not too sure if you can use hemp and like crude oil for like your car per se but I think we could eventually what kind of fuel well let's think so corn corn is like 85 like ethanol that you can put in your gas tank not your car but uh certain cars I think eventually I think hemp can get that way too huh I'm sure I can if we can do a freaking corn did you also see that commercial I forget who it was but of that the algae commercial I did that Chevron would have thought this little algae could run the world or whatever I'm like what it's like it's like the fastest reproducing like bacteria or some [ __ ] yeah weird how many more discoveries you have to make and now that everyone's gonna be able to get high we gonna be finding out a lot of new stuff and hopefully a lot of y'all will be chilling out too cuz hey you already see Trump and homeboy from Vietnam my dog Korea not my dog at all but I'm glad to see him smoking weed together y'all see you see that wait who are you talking about Trump and Kim dog home you betta not so good I swear to God me and him we India yeah all three of us that's why they shook hands cuz they finally are there you guys drop and they're like yeah we we we cool when you start everybody just like we have a world meeting and it's like a giant hotbox like at the [ __ ] United Nations I wish they put your kids inside all the adults step outside light it up fire in the hole it's like you like you say get so much done but I think everybody would be like passed out over there can't even roll up oh Lord that would be great it'll get to that point where it's marijuana it's just like alcohol so we're going through a prohibition though we are I hope it gets to the prices cuz when they had all these sales like this I was like wow it's just almost like I would be going to buy a 12-pack of beer or a fricken by cigarettes yeah yeah so 1/8 would probably last you a weekend like by yourself yeah a 12 pack or a 6 pack or however much you drink I agree it should be similar prices and it was remember back in 2016 2017 I mean right when I first moved here yeah right this country I mean there were decent they're decent prices especially when ad sales and like hey we're going through a transition say all like a weekend say oh yeah pop-up sale so I think we'll get there I hope so because honestly with the market once the market and then the growers and the producers of the edibles and all this they understand the packaging we finally get the freakin law straight I think there'll be a lot more competition which in turn will hopefully lower the prices for consumers supply and demand we'll see we're hoping so we're hoping let me tell you a few more things about him that I hadn't just remembered at the top of my dome-piece not great we used to call it a grape in the Marine Corps or grape or melon don't get shot you're great are you done hemp seeds are an excellent source of protein minerals and dietary fiber I actually use hemp seeds sometime in my post-workout shake did you know that mm-hmm did you yeah oh yeah okay well flax seeds and chia seeds are around like four or five grams per serving when hemp hearts are double they're about ten so they're really high in protein really high in omega-3s and really high in carbs so so you can well actually excuse me they're not really high in carbs they're low in carbs when she\u00eds seeds are almost four times higher in carbs so not only how they have healthy fat healthy protein they're lower in carbs there you go there's your Atkins diet just eat a [ __ ] ton of hemp seeds I know I'd love to grow a little hemp plant that'd be pretty cool that'd be super cool just grow like 20 feet high and be like it's hemp can't do nothing about it instead of Jack in the Beanstalk it's like rayon the hemp stock that's a literally climb to the top and sleep on it love you so say I want to do that when I'm went on my own land show I'm just gonna try and grow the tallest [ __ ] marijuana plant like yeah what do you how do you get you can plant a hemp from hemp seeds that you would yeah no I don't think so cuz those are what's called hemp seed hearts which I think are like de-shelled hemp seeds hmm but I'm not too sure let's try growing hemp but we'll find out right organic don't panic don't panic it's organic let's really a born in Cali or are organic or gaming today that's all you need to sell something as organic probiotics added on a resume Fairtrade organic certified organic Oh in your skills section trans fat free low sugar Lord should we do strain of the day thinking so and look out for us because we're gonna be doing a scheduled Q&A now on Instagram live so weed Wednesday y'all hear that weed Wednesday stay tuned oh the only thing that stinks about Wednesday is people at church but most of you smokin dope he ain't on Church unless you Rastafarians yeah you gotta fire in church brah everyone be on their phone anyway dude my friend was saying dude even that church

Augustine you're like walking down the streets you know shopping and getting fudge and stuff like that well all the roads are brick and all the buildings are like rock and it feels like you're in Europe or something so the church my parents got married ah has a huge like organ not a piano but a huge like wow the whole backdrop like when you walk in where the altar is is like the whole organ pipes yeah and it's like gold everywhere and like stained glass super tall ceilings it's like amazing let's classic I love it so I do like that part of it but again it does when you're so traditional it's like not relatable mm-hmm you know yeah they like kind of having like caught up with the time job of like just how to like engage people and people don't understand the old-school writing of the Bible well that's like the more contemporary Christian churches I saw a billboard the other day around here that said saying oh god in bed doesn't mean you're a Christian or something you know you're like oh I'm like a Catholic Church so just two different styles great yeah you know but as far as like faith I don't know I mean I definitely have my beliefs cool I think California has made me more open just as a person in general huh that's I would agree with you too I'm saying so I just wanted to say I was curious so so strain of the day we have a [ __ ] on what do you want to smoke you want to try the cookies or no whoa we could do that but I also have the j1 that I haven't even tried yet have we I don't think so but I was I just had that because it was a sativa but I'm down to try the cookies unless you want to do that one trap money [ __ ] I'm Charlie cookies okay all right y'all heard it weed Wednesdays if you ain't going to church you're listening to a PC on 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time that's weird to say that because we used to always say Eastern Eastern yeah 6 p.m. Eastern Time we're on the Pacific though y'all about to go to bed while we just lighten up well we tell them what we're gonna be doing on weed Wednesday at 6:00 we're gonna go on Instagram live we'll be doing a Q&A slash strain of the day smoke sesh right so if we have we will have specific questions picked out from our audience definitely see from the week before definitely and just keep sending them in a lot of the questions you're asking we try to get them answered as quick as we can just give us a time sometimes we we do get caught up with other things but y'all can ask us anything pretty much we've related even-even non weed related stuff [Music] personal stuff we may or may not answer that yeah yeah definitely I mean obviously if it's appropriate we'll definitely answer it and this is an explicit show so but I ain't gonna tell you going on in your head right now [Laughter] hey Kiki do you love me", "nyCoqupWs8Q": "how to get health food in a hospital most hospitals are hospitals are most hospitals are they have a nutritionist with a dietitian on staff the dietitian is trained by the American Dietetic Association the American Dietetic Association is funded in lieu of five million dollars a year by Pepsi coke the beverage industry the pharmaceutical industry food manufacturers so they're funding the american dietetic association iata and to be on a hospital to be the dietitian you have 88 credentials now this is where common sense comes in people if these special interest groups and companies are funding the ATA by five million dollars a year if they're doing it for a specific agenda they don't need to teach that their foods are okay to eat in moderation like peps like coke this last year for heart healthy month februari coke is now heart healthy because those little 8 ounce cans are less than 100 calories so they're hard housing which i think is a total total scam so how do you get healthy food in a restaurant because remember the dietitian is being trained directly by coke pepsi and all these big companies and pharmaceutical companies that's who they're being trained by their not being trained by other wheatgrass industry they're not being trained by the broccoli industry they're not being trained you know bavi go out and get some fresh air industry and and and eat natural foods industry they're not getting funded by that they're getting funded by the big boys then they're going in there and there's a reason why they're funding them because there's just their special interest groups that want to get their agenda across true story I was in a hospital once my friend was in the hospital I had an argument with the dietitian there because she told me that a pair and a spoonful of corn syrup metabolized the same and I said to her no it doesn't the pair has its fiber in contact they're both sugars the pair has its fiber in contact and it's and end its enzymes in contact which metabolize totally different than a spoonful of corn syrup because I was like my friends knocking heat that it has a stat then corn syrup in it and we got this debate this is their mentality she has no she has credentials which has have common sense okay people have common sense understanding when she refined something especially a boom for sugars when for corn syrup cinema taba lies totally different than a real piece of fruit so how do you get good food at a hospital well you take your own so here's what I'm taking my father day I ate a lot myself hit a lot of this watermelon taking my final watermelon I got a bag packed here I'm gonna sneak in chances are once the nurse sees all my food that I'm bringing in she's actually going to call the dietitian or do something and call a doctor and make sure my father's okay to have this I made them some salads some fat-free salads I put a little bit of lower a lot of lola rose lola rose is one of my favorite greens with tomatoes onions and a little bit of aged grape juice a little bit of aged white grape juice they call it white balsamic it's really not balsamic vinegar at all and my dad actually asks for this my dad actually asked for a green smoothie yes my dad said oh if you're coming bring a smoothie bring a green smoothie there's a half a pound of spinach in here a half a pound there's more nutrition in here that he's gonna have in three days at the hospital if using a hospital food right there look at that this is awesome so that's how you get healthy food into the hospital that's how you eat healthy food in the hospital you bring your own simple as that just got out of the hospital so I took my father all that food I took on that smoothie and on my father's a kind of person that if you make it for him he'll eat it he'll drink it he'll consume it but that's when the choices have to be made on it now that's when the choices are made for him when he has to make choices on his own Hewitt eat hot dogs and french fries he'd go to subway you know so it's really frustrating to see that my father will eat the stuff but then again just you know when it's when he has to make the choices is just it's a shame it's really a shame yep anyway so I get into the hospital of course my father ordered pasta with beef bolognese sauce and that's what he had eaten for lunch again ginger ale with corn syrup and it's sitting there then he drank half the can it's just it's just like so frustrating that you know my father knows better but then at the hospital's like they just don't seem to think anything of this so I of course brought extra food for dinner but I wanted him to have something else you know maybe some rice brown rice or maybe if they didn't have that maybe some Brown whole wheat pasta and so maybe some nice vegetables this is that so of course I called the cafeteria I called them and spoke to somebody down there and I said I'm looking for some brown rice sure we don't have brown rice I said really and y know Brown Russia was not only white rice and I said okay how about some whole wheat pasta so I'm here to get my father some whole wheat pasta with not the best choice but it's better than you know what he when he would order on his own but i would eat fresh fruit for him and he still has a big smoothie laughs so he drank this part of that smoothie when i when i got there so i'll have more for dinner the salad he's definitely gonna have so I ordered some fresh strawberries and then I I said well you know if you're still hungry maybe some some potatoes I'm sorry some mob whole wheat pasta this is like we don't have holy pasta and I said really some no whole wheat pasta and no brown rice I said really it just seems quite odd and shows no we don't have that I said so you must have like just like plain roasted potatoes you know no I no oil Angelo our potatoes are roasted with oil and and this is now three o'clock and dinner you know he's not eating dinner till seven and I said well that keen just roast some potatoes uniform without oil and shows well they're all roasted already it's like really like four hours ahead of time your potatoes are all roasted you can't like but it's just mind-boggling and my father was having a competition to my mother because my mother you know obviously concerned about what you're eating there that's nad I'm glad and I'm glad I showed up and with food and my dad is somebody goes oh well you know the dieticians here very qualified so they know what they're doing and this is back to my same point again people just assume people just assume because you're in a hospital because you're listening to a doctor because you're listening to whoever some dietitian with a DA credentials that they know what they're talking about because they have credentials they must be they must be knowledgeable they must know credentials and common sense sometimes don't mingle at all because these people are so this year might be intelligent people they're not intelligent up to think for themselves they're so intelligent they could just memorize a book and memorize and be very obedient to the school to the system to whatever to the workplace or system they're smart they memorized and they're obedient to the system and that's what sucks because these people are so misinformed when it comes to making valuable choices life life choices for themselves and for their patients that it's just it's an abomination it's just terrible it's disgusting to going back that dad the dietitian errs that corn syrup metabolizes the same effect as on eating a hole pair and this is what people believe because they have credentials and no common sense so I order breakfast for my father i order dinner for him I'm getting ready to call the dietitian and just say hey you know what I'm a little disappointed that you have no brown rice that oils already lathered on on the potatoes and thus net the funny thing was I asked the girl who answered the phone I said listen I'm trying after she said no for the first two choices brown rice and whole wheat pasta I said listen I'm looking for then I said well maybe you could recommend something I'm looking for some healthier foods that are plant-based for my father and she was oh whoa all the soups and shears and he can have a piece of meat to there's meat on there and I said no plant-based plant-based don't know no meat no eggs no fish no chicken no cheese no dairy and it's like she didn't get it she was like well you know and there's no options there's just no options if you want to go to a hospital or at least this hospital orange Regional Medical orange Rangers orange Regional Medical Center here in Middletown New York there's just there's no options if you want to eat healthy you have to bring your own food in just like I did for my father you have to bring your own food in now here's the part that sucks I have family members that live in the area aunts and uncles and I guarantee you that they will bring him meatballs they'll bring something they'll bring lasagna they will bring him something to eat because that's just what they're gonna do and this is gonna be like a whole nother like really it's like it's just so frustrating that family members don't get it that you know and last time this happened a couple years ago fellows I was bringing all this food they looked at me like I was the weird one like oh just let it heat just let it need they were whining and complaining just went in Heath why didn't eat yeah I am I mean I'm bringing him organic whole foods that are plant-based in abundance he has his own refrigerator he has everything he needs he is eating oh he's gonna he needs more food than that you know it's just it's just off uh you know and just people think that they're eating their eating healthy and they're being brainwashed by by all these intelligent people that have credentials that have no common sense", "_tsxix_j2pI": "ready to expand your flavor horizons here at the end of June headed to the 4th of July hey it's John with produce geek calm and I really hope you're having a great summer so far and thanks for watching I'm super excited to share some really cool products that I'm enjoying here at the end of June headed into early July and I want to get started right away first off it's cherry season dark sweet cherries from the Pacific Northwest are in peak season California season was such a dud because the weather but man they're there back with the fresh crop Washington fruit beautiful hmm rich flavor in the dark sweet cherries look for a bag that has no wetness on the bottom you're looking for no splits and cracks or any evidence of damage or decay and the bear and cherry should feel fairly firm keep them refrigerated rinse before eating and yes you can freeze them right in the bag and enjoy them later another cherry that I'm like super excited about this is this is some really good stuff there's Rainier cherries we'll talk about those in another video sometime but this is a similar to a Rainier cherry it's called the skylar ray and from just a milk and the skylar ray variety is firm crisp and just has a super intense sweetness they're marketing these as the sweetest chair you'll ever eat nice balance of acidity and that is that is a really good sweet cherry hmm this won't be the cheapest but this may be one of the best cherries that you'll try Skyler race look for him this summer next let's hop over to grapes everyone's talking about the cotton candy grapes yes they really do have a mild aftertaste it reminds of oh hey that's the flavor of cotton candy no they're not genetically modified no they're not dipped in anything no they're not injected with anything this is just a cultivar that lots of plant breeders are always looking for that next great variety of grape and lots of other produce and so this was one that emerged and boy it didn't really look great a lot of grapes would fall off the stems pretty easily but once it once they were tasted somebody said I reminds me of cotton candy and oh it's been a super popular grape ever since they're green seedless super sugary medium crispness hmm it's not going to be a cheap grade but wow it does really have this flavor it reminds you of cotton candy another interesting Greg you'll find this time of year is the sweet sapphire it's an elongated variety of black grape seedless it's long and cylindrical it's a really cool grape it has a rich flavor rich sweetness and a nice crisp crispness and they are just really cool to look at and the last grape I want to talk about this you won't find everywhere but it's starting to be available they're called candy snaps and oops I have washed bunch right here there's a small red seedless a good crisp pop and this kind of berry flavor like a strawberry aftertaste again intensely sweet that's that might be an up-and-comer so cotton candies and sweets a Fire's in season from the sonora region of Mexico during June and parts of July and they're available both conventionally and organically the organic cotton candy are in a blue bag the conventional and a pink bag and the sweet sapphires just look for that branding there you can't miss those long black grapes and lastly for peak season value and for me a local piece of fruit is New Jersey blueberries New Jersey blueberries our peak season they are gonna be rocking here in late June and through mid July this is or an organic blueberry I've had the opportunity to be at that farm no special varieties these are the old-fashioned blueberry varieties they've been grown in New Jersey for decades and you can expect decent berry size they're not going to be as firm as some of the new varieties but man it's just a good New Jersey blueberry hmm put them on your cereal you yogurt Bank with them freeze them it's summer and blueberry season thanks for watching stay tuned for more videos appreciated [Music]", "5xynnLBwK0g": "Jah food taster common no a jolly rancher review so I've got four different Jolly Rancher candies here yeah I cost me fifty five cents yeah but I have the

Apple so apple and watermelon get the win the very balanced it flavors also taste the steak taste like the real thing the other two grape and blue raspberry are also very intense but taste artificial so they I cannot make a reference to anything natural I ever ate a little bit - yeah yeah - Artie I dislike artificial tastes and chemical tastes so I give this to the failure okay so what you're

this is like completely different from what I usually do I'm doing a tutorial on these fabulous things and they are called sour patch grapes they're a healthy alternative to the sour patch candy and it's a simple recipe if you can't do this then I'm a prayer for you okay because it's like super easy then you cannot mess this up if you mess with something again I will pray for you okay it's grapes and then you know you post a wet grapes before you eat them like clean them off and a bowl of course spoon a plate and jello I chose lime jell-o because I felt like that would taste the best with these grapes so yeah let's get into the touch hottie uh I should have started from the beginning showing you guys how I did it so and look as messy like that looks horrible right now but you get just that what I did when I show you this so basically you take your grapes put them in a bowl and then you go over to the seat you fill it up with water and rinse off your grapes and pour most of the water out this bowl is stained it's not dirty it's like staying from over over time cooking things so don't think this bowl is dirty it's clean so yeah you soak your grapes it's not so cold but you know like clean them leave a little bit of water in there so don't stay away and then you take a grape excuse my nails guys I've been going through the struggle the real struggle of getting jail nails off without going back to the nail salon because I'm cheap like that sometimes like why am I paying you to take off what you did like but yeah you put the grape over here where you put the jello you put the whole thing of jello onto the plate you get a spoon and just coat it coat the entire grape to make sure all the sides are covered and yeah after you put the grape this is what you do me and these are just for me so I'm gonna touch it on the dishes but if I was making it for a bunch of people I would just use the spoon but it's just like shake off the excess because you don't want to miss and then put it over on a plate or the rest of them are and you do that to the rest of the your grapes and then when you're done you put your grapes in the refrigerator okay and then you put it in a refrigerator for about an hour or so and yeah you had to say in your refrigerator okay try one how is it", "G7yFfQX3R1s": "So now we're going to turn it over to Karmella. Yay, alright. Now I get to talk about some good stuff. Alright. (laughter) Alright. So we did carbohydrate counting about a year ago, actually, when I was looking at my old slides. So I thought we could kind of do a review, to kind of briefly introduce carbohydrate counting, help with some points that I suggest when we talk to patients about dietary modification and supporting blood sugars, and then towards the end, some new apps that are available. Ones that some of my patients are using, and then a newer one as well. That might be something for you guys to be able to think about recommending or maybe something that your own patients are using as well. There is so much confusion out there, when it comes to what should we be recommending to our patients? And also for the patient's themselves being confused with all of the new fads, and types of diets, and products that come out all the time. So my goal is to help kind of, work through some of that confusion and give you some basic suggestions and recommendations on how we can support patients with their diet. So, let me start with, what is a diabetic diet? There isn't one. Actually, with our new guidelines, we want to refer to patients who have diabetes, a person with diabetes. So when we talk about a diet that's best for blood sugar control, It's very similar to what we might recommend for somebody else, even if they do not have diabetes. Specifically, the goal is to support them with eating a healthy eating pattern, that includes all food and beverages that are within a calorie level that's appropriate for a healthy weight. And the dietary guidelines Kind of speak to more of an emphasis around calorie, nutrient- or calorie levels of the foods that we're eating for a healthy weight. So it includes vegetables, fruits, grains, especially whole grains. Try and encourage patients to eat low-fat or fat-free dairy products, having a variety of protein foods, not just red meat. And then oil, specifically healthy oils that include more of those mono-unsaturated fats. So that's what we kind of want to encourage our patients is to eat a variety of foods, an to be able to hit on all or most of these food groups, in order to get all of their nutrition in. But outside of that, a tool that we have when we're thinking about a meal plan, when we're thinking about how we want to counsel patients on what they should be eating, is we have carbohydrate counting. And this is an evidence-based way of helping patients understand what role food has on their blood sugars, and specifically carbohydrates. And the total amount of carbohydrates that a patient eats, can directly influence what their blood sugars are going to do. And that's really important because carbohydrates, although absolutely necessary for a healthy diet, you know, they're our energy source. They're what our brain uses for energy, they're what our muscles prefer to use for energy. But we want to make sure that we have a more moderate amount of carbohydrates, instead of over consuming them, which is what I see happen a lot. And carbohydrate counting, kind of fits well into diet recommendations, thinking about exercise and how consumption of carbohydrates before an exercise session, or afterwards can be helpful. And then carbohydrate counting can also be useful when we talk to patients about you know, if you do experience a hypoglycemic event, you know, how carbohydrates can be supportive and treating that. So carbohydrate counting is the best way in terms of helping patients change their diets in order to support blood sugars. So one of the first things that I start with when I talk to patients about carbohydrate counting, is helping them to understand how food impacts our blood sugars in the sense that different foods, and the amounts of the food that we're eating at a particular meal or snack, can have dramatic differences in what our blood sugars are going to do. The foods that we eat are composed up of three macronutrients You all know them, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. And they actually all can have an impact on our blood sugars. But carbohydrates are- is the nutrient that has the most direct or highest impact on what our blood sugars do. Proteins and fats, I'm going to go back for just a second. Proteins and fats, when consumed in a large amount, can also cause blood sugars to go high as well. And that's a lot of times what we might see with patients who for example, have pizza. And they might have four or five slices of pizza. Yes, there's a lot of carbohydrates, but there's also a lot of protein and fat along with that that can all have an impact on how high their blood sugars go, and also how high or how long they stay elevated. So this is a graph, it's not very technical. It's very basic. But my point with this type of graph is to understand that when patients, or us, eat carbohydrates at meals, our blood sugars go up. Whether you have diabetes or not, when our body is digesting and breaking down carbohydrates, our blood sugars are going to increase. So we will see a postprandial rise in our blood sugars. But what we want to try to do, is not allow that blood sugar rise to go up too high and then come down in a short time period. One to two hours. So the first blue, blueish line there that you see there is for when people have a large amount of carbohydrates, and there's not much protein, perhaps there or even perhaps some fat there, that we see that those carbohydrates are quickly turned into sugar in the body. Our blood sugars go high, and then we can actually see that the blood sugars drop pretty quickly as well, after eating. And this is what people might say when they experience, I feel really tired I need to take a nap after eating, or they might actually feel like they're having a low blood sugar you know, a couple hours afterwards. So this is something that we want to kind of keep from happening. I see this happen a lot when patients either forget to take their insulin, or sometimes when people are eating 90 or 140 grams of carbohydrates in a single sitting, and that is not uncommon. I see that happened a lot, especially when we see patients consuming beverages that have sugar in them, and then also carbohydrates in the food that they're eating. So there is kind of like double dipping in a way, because we have a high consumption of carbohydrates in a single sitting. A lot the body kind of has to work through. The mixed meal, that red line is what our goal is. Yes, we're going to see some increase in blood sugars with eating, but then we would hope that that doesn't increase too high. So one to two hours after eating, keeping that below 180, maybe below 150 for some people, and then seeing that that line kind of stays with us longer. So this helps us to feel energized with food. Feeling like we can get through our day, feel like we don't need to take a nap, or feel tired, and we feel like energized. And the energy, or the nutrition from those carbohydrates are sustaining us. Okay, so as I mentioned carbohydrates are the foods that have the most dramatic effect on our blood sugars in terms of increasing them. And anytime I start this conversation with patients, I see how the patient can immediately hear, for some reason, and I'm very careful about addressing this, is that they hear, \"Okay, well blood sugar- or carbohydrates increase my blood sugars, and my goal is for that not to happen, I want my blood sugars to stay down, my doctor keeps telling me to keep my blood sugars down, I'm just going to avoid that.\" And that's not necessarily what we wanted to see happen either. As I mentioned earlier, carbohydrates are our main fuel source, so they're what we need for energy and being able to do the things that we need throughout the day. So I'm really intentional about telling patients It's not that we want to avoid carbohydrates, but that we need to understand that a moderate amount of carbohydrates is the goal. So having some at breakfast, some at lunch, some at dinner, and how many, we'll talk about that in a second, really depends upon a few things. And sometimes it's starting out with a certain amount, seeing how they respond, and then making adjustments as necessary. These are the foods that contain carbohydrates, and that's a big list, right? There's a lot of foods that have carbohydrates in it, and so most of the things that people are eating at meals, there's going to be carbohydrates. So, quick review. Breads, crackers, cereals, pasta, rice, and grains. Only the starchy vegetables to really concern ourselves with. Other things like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, you know, they are gonna have some carbohydrates in them but such a small amount that we don't consider them in the carbohydrate group. Beans and legumes. Milk and milk products. Fruit and juices. And then all of those sweets we love and enjoy. Cakes, cookies, that sort of thing. Proteins and fats have little to none carbohydrates. So just so we're all on the same page, proteins would be meat, fish, chicken. And fats would be things like butter, cheese, oils. Peanut butter would fall into that as well. And as I mentioned, these can also increase blood sugars, but it's more if they're eaten in a large quantity, and in a high amount. So we prioritize first with patients, looking at the total amount of carbohydrates that they're eating at a single meal, and their total for the day. And then usually follow-up appointments from my perspective, going to talking about fats and protein, other suggestions, but we first prioritize carbohydrates. The more carbohydrates that you eat in a single time, tends to find higher blood sugars after meals. So there's a threshold, in a way, of how much the body can take, and for- to keep blood sugars under control. Some common challenges that I see, is that we don't fully know how many or how much we're eating at a single meal. The typical american underestimates what they eat by at least 30 percent. And that's rather significant. So a lot of people think they're eating less than they might actually be eating. The amount of carbohydrates found in food, some patients can get confused on what foods have carbohydrates, and how much? Hidden sources of carbohydrates. Another common challenge I see, is that because we talk so much about blood sugar control, keeping blood sugars low, is that that word \"blood sugar\". So sugar, is that patients instinctively look on a food label only at the sugar grams, and they forget to look at total carbohydrates. And so that sometimes is something to kind of address with them. Another challenge is that patients are not looking at the serving size listed on a food label. Which can be really different from their own personal portion size, whatever it is that they may be eating. Easily forgotten sources of carbohydrates that can actually add up rather quickly. Milk substitutes, yogurts, baked beans, tomato sauce, salad dressings, barbecue sauce, I forgot to add on here ketchup, that's another one. Orange chicken with the syrup, and the sweet sauce that's on there. Sugar free foods, protein bars. So these are some things that some patients can actually be eating, and they're not really considering impacting their blood sugars. A few other challenges that I think are just important to be aware of when we're trying to address supporting patients with diet changes, is that patients sometimes will prioritize looking in the grocery store for sugar-free products, and thinking that they don't have to worry so much about how much they're eating, or thinking if it's sugar free It's not gonna really impact my blood sugars. But I always say sugar-free doesn't mean carb free. And so sugar is a type of a carbohydrate. And helping patients understand that their total carbohydrates are what are impacting their blood sugars can be helpful, so that they're not feeling like or assuming sugar free candies is not going to impact their blood sugars. Some people responds differently to different foods. And as years and years go on, I find this more and more often happening. Because it does happen. Some people, you know, have a different response to certain foods compared to other people. So some people don't really see too much of an increase in blood sugars with oatmeal. And then I have a few people that that is, their postprandial blood sugars increase rather significantly. Even with the total amount of carbohydrates. So I think there is something to be said with that. Some patients, when they're eating new foods expect it to have the same impact on thier blood sugars as other foods they've eaten. An example is quinoa. So some people who start to eat quinoa might think it has same type of impact on their blood sugars as rice does, and it might actually be different because of the protein content in quinoa being much higher than rice. Okay. So in terms of how to carbohydrate count, we have this little bit of like a conversion factor, if you want to call it that. Where a serving of a carbohydrate food contains 15 grams of carbohydrates. Now, the reason why this is such a helpful thing to understand, is because some foods have a lot more volume. Like you can eat more cups for example, of that food before it contains a total of 15 grams of carbohydrates, and other foods not so much. So the example I give, three cups of popped popcorn has 15 grams of carbohydrates in it. Two tablespoons of raisins has the same carbohydrates, 15 grams. So reading labels is really helpful to look at grams of carbohydrates. And that's often how I kind of counsel patients is learn carbohydrate grams versus servings, but when you can give something like that as a comparison, it kind of helps people to understand \"oh, so you know, I can't equate different foods being the same volume amount, and having the same amount of carbohydrates.\" Another example, a 1 ounce slice of bread is 15 grams of carbohydrates versus a quarter of a large baked potato is 15 grams of carbohydrates. So again, volume wise, that's a lot different. That can be different. One medium piece of fruit is 15 grams of carbohydrates. So a medium piece of fruit, you kind of want to imagine like the size of a tennis ball is 15 grams of carbohydrates. Juice, it's 4 ounces of juice is 15 grams of carbohydrates. I compare a lot of times milk and juice. So 8 ounces of milk is about 15 grams of carbohydrates, 4 ounces of juice. And this is where patients can kind of have some flexibility in terms of their own personal preferences. You know, some may say \"I really want my juice in the morning time so I know that if I'm gonna have juice, I'm gonna have to be really diligent about measuring out 4 ounces, or if I want 8 ounces, I have to count that as 30 grams of carbohydrates, and then I might not have much more left over for my toast, and my oatmeal, and cereal and anything else that I may want.\" But they can make that choice if that's what they want. But to understand volume differences can be really helpful for guiding choices. This is a picture of the new label. Last year we were told that this was going to be mandated by manufacturers starting in July 2018. And now there's some discussion about perhaps that being delayed. But I'm already actually seeing it on some of our products, is this new food label. There are a lot of changes that are being made. And I think there's some good changes on here, but specifically for us when we talk about carbohydrates, is that you can see the total carbohydrate row here. And then listed below is dietary fiber, which we've always had. Total sugars, which we've had. And then there's going to be this new one, which is added sugar. I mean I think to be honest, It's a good thing. The reason I like that is that it's going to give some accountability to manufacturers. Because how much they put- how much sugar that they add to their breads, or to their cereals, is that they're gonna have to actually disclose that. So added sugars is what the manufacturers specifically added to their product. And so patients can use this to help kind of decide maybe brand to brand what's maybe a better choice for them. But this does not remove the overall intention of looking at a food label, which is, it's the total carbohydrates that impact our blood sugars. And so that's what they need to look at when they look at a food label. And again, a lot of times they're only looking at sugars or sometimes what they may do, is they may think that fiber and sugars is not included in that total carbohydrate row, and so some people will add that. And so I do make sure it's clear for patients to understand that those numbers below the total carbohydrate row are already included. So really, the only thing they need to look at outside of the serving size, is the total carbohydrate grams listed on a food label. And again, the only time I might find is compare Oroweat Bread to Dave's Killer Bread, how much added sugar do each of them have and then that can maybe help guide choices. But other than that, it;s the total carbohydrates. Okay. How much should people be eating? How much should we have carbohydrates at each meal and snack? Technically, it depends on a lot of things. It depends upon a patient's weight, and what their goals are, what their activity levels look like, you know, how active are they at work? Are they sitting for most of the day? What medications that they're on, and how far away are we at  goal, in terms of their blood sugar control, that can sometimes help to kind of decide. But for our sake here today, a really good starting point for many people is to have them start with around 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrates at each meal. So if some some people want to start there and then we have them occasionally check postprandial blood sugars one to two hours after eating, and we can see where they are, we can make some adjustments where we can say okay, well you can technically have a little bit more if you're really hungry, and you're finding that a lot less and you typically eat, or remind you that your blood sugars are still quite not where we want them to be after meals, so let's reduce that a little bit. I generally don't recommend below 30 grams of carbohydrates at a meal. I think that's too low if we go below that, and again, carbohydrates give us a lot of nutrition, energy, and fuel for for ourselves. So, I would not recommend below 30. So somewhere between 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per meal per meal. Not per day. Sometimes patients get confused with that. They hear \"per day\", but I think it's good to be clear, 45 to 60 per meal. And if you want to think about snacks, I suggest perhaps 15 to 30 grams of carbohydrates per snack. If the patient likes snacks, they find that's helpful for them to have something between meals, so they don't overeat carbohydrates or meals. That is, as I mentioned earlier, It's not uncommon for me to see three times this amount of carbohydrates in a single sitting. Especially when eating out, especially when eating out. For some patients, this could be a significantly less than what they're doing now. And if that's the case, I suggest just slowly decreasing per meal until they feel a little bit comfortable with this. Okay lastly before we get into the apps, for some people carb counting is overwhelming. They don't like it. They're not gonna do it. So instead, this is a great suggestion for visual people. When they're sitting down and have a plate in front of them is that half of their plate is those non starchy vegetables. So carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, or lettuce mushrooms, onions, any of those things. And then the other half of the plate is divided into quarters, one being the meats or alternative soy products perhaps, and then the other quarter is where those carbohydrates are. So that's going to be the potatoes, or the rice, or the yogurt, or fruit for example. So that can be just a way of helping the when you first call it \"anchor your plate\" with those non-starchy vegetables, is that they're just not gonna have that much more room left on that plate for those carbohydrates. So if they're not willing to carb count, and you want to help them to reduce their total carbohydrates if they're eating any (inaudible), this is something that you could potentially help them to kind of visually see. Myplate.gov has posters that helped this, it's a little bit more colorful, that could be also useful for patients as well. One thing I didn't mention earlier, is that anytime we start to carb count for patients I mean they're kind of grasping it, and they're counting them, and they're trying to stay within their goal, is that some of them may experience some hypoglycemia. Especially if we haven't adjusted their insulin. And we don't ever want a patient to have to cover their insulin. So eat more carbohydrates so they don't go low. Instead, we would want to work with them on reducing their insulin with the healthy carbohydrate level and helping them to not have a low blood sugar. So, that can sometimes happen. And then unfortunately if you're not aware of that or giving the patient a heads-up, that as we slowly decrease their carbohydrates, we may see that some of them may say \"Forget this. I'm just gonna eat more because I'm going to low.\" So that's something else to think about. Okay, so apps. So we've talked about MyFitnessPal before and Calorie King, and I just wanted to mention them again because I really do like these apps. And then the three new ones I have today are called One Drop, My Sugr, and then Glucose Buddy. So MyFitnessPal, there is an online and an app version. The free version is what most of my patients use. And then the premium version, I've got like three people that use it. Which you just get a little bit more reporting functions and information. But I certainly don't think it's necessary. It's rated really pretty well. There's a lot in the database that they already have within this. A program which is really great for many patients. It's not really meant or set up for tracking blood sugars or medications, though. There is one note section where technically I have had patients indicate what the blood sugars are, and  what they're taking for medications, but there's no reporting function from that aspect, and more useful for counting calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats. Okay. Calorie King, we've mentioned this before. There's that book that I absolutely love, many of my patients love it. It's super small, in a sense that it can fit in purses or in the car. And there's so much information, in terms of fast food places, restaurants, just general food items, where calorie, fat grams, and carbohydrate grams are included in this book. So it's a great reference book. And there is also an online version as well. And an app available that it does allow for tracking blood sugars as well as carbohydrate intake. So that's something that might be good to consider for some people. Okay. There we go. So now we have a newer app Which is called One Drop. It is available for free for Apple and Android devices. It has a rating of 4.5 stars, but it's only been out for a short time here, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this go up. Because, not to bias everybody, but I really like this one. This one was really fun. And I'll show you some screenshots here in a second, But what they actually did- They did a clinical trial, and they did two types of things. So the first one is that they just kind of monitored those who use the app, in terms of blood sugar control. And they found that those who were getting into it throughout the week, whether that was just once a day or actually a few times a day, found that their hemoglobin A1C went from 8.2 to 7.2 in two months time. So a 1% drop, I think is rather significant in a two month time period. But anytime patients have something that they get information from, reinforces what they should be doing, I think that motivates patients. And apps, I think are like the future. I think we're gonna see more and more of these things available for for patients. They then also had what they called their \"Experts Program\", and it's available at cost. And I think it's $20. I have a slide here in just a second, but patients can actually get coaching support from a certified diabetes educator. And in four weeks they found that average blood sugars went from 185 to 158. So it's using the app, and then getting some support within that app, with suggestions and just accountability to carb counting, and exercise, and taking medications, and monitoring blood sugars. So, it is a feature within this, which is interesting. Within the app, so you can see on that first screenshot you see that drop so they can check blood sugars, they can enter in that blue one, is their medications. Basal-bolus and oral medications. They can then measure or add in what they're eating, and then the last one, that orange one is for exercise. So this app allows you to do all four things. The middle screenshot you can see here, is that they just tap that middle circle which is this one, is the pink one or somewhat red, that allows them ti put their blood sugars in, and then you can actually get some feedback that when their blood sugars are entered, this white dot shows them if it's somewhat elevated or low. So if it were a 300 blood sugar it's going to come around a little bit more. So visually speaking, it helps people to kind of see perhaps how high their blood sugars are in a different way, outside of like an absolute number. I know it's kind of hard to see, but down a little bit lower it allows people to kind of rate themselves on how stressed out they are, how their energy levels are, happiness and confidence, or you know, their care of their blood sugars. So, there's added features within that. And then this is a screen shot I know it's a little bit overwhelming, but I played around with it and what I did is I entered in like for a day, a random blood sugar number, insulin, I entered in Lantus and Novolog, they actually have a list of medications entered, so people just have to search for that. So I start typing Lantus, find it, and so they can actually account for what types of medications they have in there. And then at the top there, is that it will average out for the day what their blood sugars are. That 100% is how much of their blood sugars is above goal. So this is 100% of blood sugars being above goal, and that 0% is below goal. And you can actually modify that, specifically within the app what your goals are, high and low with the range. And then keeps track of the total units of insulin that has been entered into the app. So you can see here, at 74% bolus and then 26% basal. And then you see it tracks carbohydrates. You just- you can either enter in directly a certain amount of carbohydrates, or you can search for the individual foods being consumed. So I searched pizza, and English muffins, and bananas and it had a lot of that already in there, so then it will also track calories which I think is really great as well. And then also for steps, and then activity time. Great color coordination, in my opinion. Really easy to see that. Some additional features within this app is there's a- they call them \"food moments\", so there are recipe suggestions and with carbohydrate count information. This okay- so it's $19.95, is what it would cost to get that experts program, access to the CDE. They have their own glucometer, where when you're testing blood sugars is that, that information is automatically uploaded within the app. So this program have a lot of features. The last feature of this that I wanted to show you guys, is that it has a reporting function within the free version, which I think is kind of nice. And so it just does it in a different way, that you can actually send these reports to- the patient you can send it to you. So they can email it to you, or whoever that they want to. This is a different one that they have available. And then, I'm not sure that you would consider this a good thing or a bad thing, but when I emailed this to myself, and then when I opened up my email and clicked on the link, that brought this to view within my Google pages, is that it then alerted me on my phone that somebody was looking at it. So it lets them know that whenever anybody is looking at the reports that they send, they're looking at it. But this is, I think a really easy graph. Good color coordination, again. It gives a lot of good information with how many times are they monitoring their blood sugars, how much in, below, or above range are they, what their insulin is, and how many units have they taken, and then their carbohydrates. So that's One Drop. The other the other one is My Sugr. So it's almost like this little sugar monster that you either make happy or you make sad, depending upon what your blood sugars are, or how many carbohydrates that you're eating. This was started back in 2007 in Austria, so it's been around quite a long time and it's the rating of 4.7 stars. For additional cost, you can get PDF reports as well as access to a CDE as well. So that has the same feature in here. Here are some screen shots. You can kind of see on the left-hand side, entering a few things I've got ten points so far. Positive points, because average blood sugars, deviation from that, and whatever carbohydrates that you've entered. But there's some good color coordination. And when you're entering in your carbohydrates you can select breakfast, lunch, dinner. You can select how you feel, you can select if you're having a low blood sugar, and it keeps track of that information. I have one patient that uses this and she really likes it. This could perhaps be used for somebody who might be wanting some fun with the type of an app because again you're, you're trying to make that little sugar monster happy. But these screenshots are just kind of features that you can add in. Again, your ranges, you can put in reminders for when you need to take your Lantus, or when you need to take your your Novolog. And you can even specifically enter in what your carb to insulin ratios are within that app. So it's kind of already in there for you. So a lot of like, individualization that can happen within this type of an app that allow people to kind of, set it up for them. This is a whole day entered in, so a little bit different type of a screenshot here. But essentially similar information in terms of average blood sugars, how many highs and low blood sugars do they have entered, and then what's the carbohydrates. I couldn't report- or I couldn't print, or show you guys the PDF reports because that only comes within the paid version. And I didn't pay for it. So I was only using the free version. But that's what apparently it looks like, so I pulled from their website. Okay, the last one, since we have a few more minutes, Glucose Buddy. So this is actually an app that's been rated number one for the last nine years, in terms of diabetes management apps out there. I also really like this app. So apparently, I could only find that it was used for iOS devices, so I could be wrong about that, but when trying to search and see, I have an iPhone, so I was able to use it But I don't, I can't, couldn't tell if it could be used for Android devices. One thing that's a little bit different about this app, that I thought could be a positive for some patients who don't always remember what medications that they're on, is that they can- you can see that little like, grayed out area \"name your medication\". So they can just write in there, or type in there I should say, what medications that they're on. So it's not them trying to find the right one It's them being able to just put it in themselves. So that could be a good or a bad thing. But, you can add in what medications again, you're taking, you can add in carbohydrate goals, you can enter in your blood sugars, you can enter in just carbohydrate value of a label that you've eaten, or you can add in individual foods that you're eating, as well. On the left-hand side though, that screenshot there, is that you can add in your blood sugars, I know it's not really great here, you can add in your A1C, your medications, I can't tell what that- blood pressure, you can add in your carbohydrates or calories, you can add in your weight, and activity. So it seems to be a little bit more inclusive in terms of what you can get. That middle screen shot is not that great. So let's go to that far right one, there we go. So this is where I was entering in blood sugars, insulin, and then carbohydrates. And so it does something similar to One Drop, which is great in my opinion, is it gets that top panel banner there which kind of shows for you what your average blood sugars are, how much insulin have you taken, what your carbohydrates look like, you can see I'm already at 500 grams of carbohydrates this day. And then what the activity is, as well. Great color coordination, I think easy to see. And navigation, I think within all of these apps, are pretty easy to kind of use, just to play around with. It does give some, they call it \"insights\" in terms of like, reports that you can get for averages, and insulins, and carbohydrates. And it can then on the far right side, also do for the week. So you can kind of see not just day to day, but then in a week's time on the last seven days, some of the information that's there. So those are the three that I played around with, and I think all of them were pretty good. Some that were- had other features that others didn't, but I think all of them were pretty good in terms of ease to use and color and things that you could enter in. But I was curious if anybody had any other apps that they used, or have patients that use, that they've liked. Maybe you guys could share with us? Yeah! I've got- you mentioned My Fitness Pal, I think it's called. I've got a number of people who use that. Awesome. Very good. (silence) Anybody else? Quick question not regarding the apps, but can you comment a little bit, what do you recommend your diabetic patients, as well as like overweight children regarding new like sodas, you know, with low calories, or a Coke Zero, and Crystal Light, and all these like new things out on the market? Sure, okay. So yeah, I mean some of the items in our food system where more calories and sugar are coming from, in our diet, are sugar-sweetened beverages. So it's a good area to address for a lot of patients, including those that are younger. So we kind of work on some of those long term healthy eating habits, and get ahead of it, or address it sooner. So I encourage patients to first switch to non calorie beverages. So as you mentioned Crystal Lights, those ice drinks that are available, that are calorie free, that are carbonated. But I also really encourage patients to try water. And to really understand that water is really important for us, and that it takes time to get used to it. People who are used to drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages, water, it's gonna taste terrible to them and they're not going to like it and they're just non going to drink it. So one way of helping them, is that I'll encourage that they either dilute whatever it is that they're drinking, that has calories in it. And slowly kind of reduce that, especially when it comes to juice. Diluting it. Or, a lot of times I'm seeing more and more people being open and liking fruit infused water. So whether they are throwing in frozen strawberries or frozen pineapple into their water, or you can actually get some of those more formal water bottles that have like, that insert. But that would be what I would suggest to help patients. But the other thing is can patients, can children have you know, some of these non-nutritive sweeteners using Coke Zero using Crystal Light, some of those those sweeteners that we have available? And as long as they're not consuming, I mean the high recommendation for safety, for like aspartame, Splenda, Sweet and Low, it amounts to a high enough level that as long as we're not encouraging all beverages being diet sodas or Crystal Light, I think they can have one a day. So the high level is a six-pack of diet soda a day before we start to reach levels that are probably unsafe for those non-nutritive sweeteners. So again, I think one a day would be fine, but I think we should talk to them about drinking water. And we've got to get used to it somehow, and it's something that's going to help them long-term. And that it's okay if it's something that they don't particularly like in the beginning, but it takes time, so. Does that help? Yes. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I have a question over here. Yeah! So, my question is in regards to hypoglycemia treatment. So like, if a patient experiences a hypoglycemic event, you know, and they follow the rule of fifteen and try to correct it, do you recommend, you know, patients eating like, a high-fat meal after they treat they hypo to kind of help prevent, to drop- you know, prevent whatever it is that dropped off their sugars? Or do you just recommend they just eat something? What do you- What are your thoughts on- What do you guys do? Great question, great question. So a lot of times, what we use for many patients is our fifteen-fifteen rule. Is if they have a blood sugar and that's technically low, or they're not feeling the greatest, is to have 15 grams of carbohydrates after they've measured what their blood sugar is. What you know, making sure that it's it's below a certain number, below 70, or 80 or 70. Eat 15 grams of carbohydrates, wait 15 minutes, and check it again. Make sure that it's coming back up. As long as it's come back up, I am okay with telling patients to have a little bit of lean protein. So maybe a string cheese, maybe a couple slices of some meat, and, but it's a small amount or they should go have their meal if it's time to eat a meal. So I don't necessarily recommend a high-fat specific item. I usually recommend that, if they have in the past struggled with after they've gotten it back up, and it doesn't stay up, is to then add in a lean protein to go along with it. But generally speaking, in my experience many patients struggle with this. And they over consume carbohydrates because they feel so terrible. And so, it's talking through some strategies on how to help them really stick to those 15 grams of carbohydrates so they're not over consuming, because now we're just, we're on that roller coaster all day long, of highs and lows. And a soda, for example, is often one that I see a lot of patients will use. They'll get a 20 ounce regular soda, they'll drink from it until they feel better, and then they go high. So I counselled them a lot on, what does 15 grams look like? Wait 15 minutes, check again, see where they're at, and then they could eat a lean protein if they needed to. But I don't always recommend it, if they can overdo it. Okay, any other questions before we finish up for today? Alright, thank you so much everyone. Thanks, see you next month.", "pWQk7cWtvhk": "hello everyone and welcome back to maybe it's Playhouse for kids we're gonna be making the Jolly Rancher great pops today so right now we have Neve you

make sure I mixed everything in make sure it's well combined any spots so now I'm gonna go ahead and start sticking my grapes in the candy I already have my Jolly Ranchers over there mixed up that Jolly Rancher candy it does get kind of hard really quick so you have to just keep working with it with your fingers if not it will stick and it's really hard to get it unstuck to stuff okay something I'm just gonna put some of that on the tip of it I don't really like it all over that's just my preference if you would like it all over you can do it that way all depends on just how you like it [Music] [Music] how's she look guys so now we're just gonna do the rest of them the same way and then if you're just looking for candy covered grapes you just do them that way like this and then you wouldn't put the Jolly wrenches on there [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] all righty guys and there you have it this is what it should look like when you are done with everything if you guys have any questions please feel free to come in and I will answer your questions don't forget to like this video comment and subscribe to this channel thank you all for watching bye", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more

show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please check out the herbal infuser calm if you want to buy

is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "U3IdxTpVE04": "hey guys today I have something a little bit different how about some old-fashioned hard candy not only made the old-fashioned way but with chili peppers hey guys how's it going to spill more back again with another hot and spicy product to review for you guys know today I have something a little bit different just like I said in the intro I have some old-fashioned hard candy made the old-fashioned way and made with chili peppers these were sent to me I've got three of them to review today these were sent to me from the chess pros handmade confections I believe I'm seeing that right chess Bros handmade confections are located I'm not too far up the road from where I live in Thomasville North Carolina let me go ahead and read what it says on their website it says we trace our candy making routes all the way back to the Davis candy company located in 1910 in Springfield Missouri the business has changed hands and names several times over the years but one thing remains constant our commitment to making quality products for our customers I thought this was really cool it says we still use most of the original candy making equipment today copper pots gas stoves wooden paddles and vintage turn-of-the-century candy making equipment you can taste the difference that quality makes now you can check them out at chess bros confections dot-com I'll put that link down in the description and they've got a fantastic website guys they not only have these old-fashioned hot candies I'll be reviewing they're three spicy ones they've got other flavors as well they've got soft candies they've got Brittles which look amazing fudge dip mixes desert mixes snack mixes gift items they've got fruit slices just a some awesome looking products so let's go ahead and get into these guys this one's the first one I'm not gonna sit here and eat these for you here on this video review but I've tried them several times they're mango habanero just look at that these come in four and a half ounce size packs but very large pieces of hard candy probably at least thirty in here this has a very very delicious mango habanero flavor it's the mildest of the three not much heat from this one at all but a really nice delicious fruity mango type flavors what you're getting from from this one I think this would be for everybody it's really not that spicy I'd probably put the heat on my one to ten scale at about a 1 out of 10 but very very delicious so this is their mango habanero if you like that combination if you especially if you love mango and fruit and you love hard candies I definitely recommend this one now this one is delicious guys this is moving up in the heat department a little bit this is their whoops their orange ghost chili hot candy look at that dragon on there and now this has a nice sweet and sour blood orange type base to it I think this is the favorite of three this has a little bit more heat coming from the Ghost Pepper so you definitely can tell that it's got more heat than the mango habanero it just kind of fills your mouth all over with with a very very to me low level ghost pepper type burn but super super delicious blood orange flavor to this one with a little more heat I'd probably put this one maybe at a 3 out of 10 oh my one to 10 scale it's kind of hard to give heat ratings for candies it's so subjective but I'm just trying to give you an example of how I would rate them for heat so maybe that will help you and then this one here guys this is their hottest one this is the one made with Carolina Reaper now if you love cinnamon type candy if you love Hot Tamales or if you love a those fireballs you're probably going to really love this one so it's got a nice cinnamon spicy flavor to it this is the hottest of the three and I think it's probably seems a lot hotter than maybe you what it is because of the cinnamon I think cinnamon candies sometimes come across as being a little bit more spicy but you could definitely tell that because of the Carolina Reapers it are in here this is spiced up probably to about a 5 out of 10 on my one to ten scale the longer you keep it in the mouth you got to give these time as you suck on them and keep them in your mouth you've got to let it dissolve a little bit and then you can start getting more of the flavor you could start getting feeling more of the heat to sum this one they may want to take this out of their mouth for a while and put it down and maybe get something to drink it may reach that level to some but it does you know heat the mouth up pretty good with that nice awesome fiery cinnamon flavor so about a five out of ten for heat on my window ten scale but great candies highly recommended once again this is the Carolina Reaper hot candy I think the favorite to want to really enjoy the most is this one this is the orange ghost chili hot candy I really loved that blood orange base and then the very mildest of all of them once again is the mango habanero hot candy so thank Texas Company out guys once again the chess pros confections calm link will be down in the description guys

from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "nktqZ2cKiKY": "so what we're trying to do is by cooking it is evaporate out the water basically and you're measuring how much water is left by the temperature because you can't get over a certain temperature because water won't get me hotter than 212 degrees so as you deal with like 5050 water and sugar as that percentage goes down the solution can get hotter mm-hmm to its maximum temperature so we're measuring moisture content at the 310 we should be under 5% water now if you get over the burning point to sugar and get rid of all the water the sugar burns caramelize this turned brown and that's very round problem his family used to do to 320 and it would get wouldn't have as much as nice of a white snow and I think that made me partially the stove just the nature of the good stuff here wheat which we switch to 310 a while back and that's what all users did you switch because I used to do you just switch this he was feeling whole himself that day music you know what I'm doing 310 well that's cool I'm in a concern two of the games like that too but it's fine hmm I can go up to about three or five on the right circumstance the candy will be hard enough it'll just be in my experience more susceptible to humidity you know because it just has more water so it can absorb less and stay hard but yeah we used to do three or five I mean hard practice what 292 something theoretically can be hard over any time not hard crack Park wall anytime you're over hard wall temperature I don't remember what that is I tend to work above us I remember what it is either I used to decent he's known as a kid making candy at home he Smith well the only thing we made a homeless fire church was that was more softball mm-hmm not hard ball baller hit while I play hard ball now all the time yes ma'am I was sure we have you're not holders that we need but we do know yeah we're about to hit the urine Tanika do tell Dante how humble are pronouncing that right basically this is doing a phase stage so it's a why god I can't remember my chemistry back from college it's been 25 years basically as it goes to the transition from mostly water to mostly sugar it changes how it behaves and somewhere around 257 degrees have you ever noticed just sort of slows down getting hotter then I want to passes that point it accelerates yeah and that point is where does this transition and that's where it transitions from a solution to a different type of fluid these two when two different materials are dissolved into one another can often behave like this this is how blue ice works so blue ice is a mixture of propylene glycol not ethylene glycol and water ethylene glycol being toxic but really tough so it's not your car's antifreeze and they're in a proportions that the freezing point is below whatever temperature one blue i3 refrigerator it's usually like 28 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Fahrenheit so when it freezes it becomes solid but it takes a whole lot of energy to make it freeze but also takes a whole lot of energy to get through that point to make it defrost so it stays cold longer and that's why you want blue ice sugar and water does exactly the same thing except it's just annoying it doesn't have a useful purpose it just takes longer to boil and then it goes young because yes snow as the temperature goes off and then it speeds up again so the atomic bonds are breaking or something that once they're broken it's like I don't actually know it's taking a lot of energy to do something but I haven't actually thought about it in sugar I've got a very large treatise on the subject that I haven't been able to slog through so the ice there hasn't been a lot of research in the candy industry but there's been a lot of research in the ice cream industry because they need to deal with the continuous process continuous process on coconut oil and with continuous process cooking you have to take into account how long you need to calculate the thing needs to move through the continuous process because they're not doing it a batch at a time you can't just wait you something else is coming behind it so you bake things longer and the continuous process thing by having it run down an assembly line longer yes who's pouring this badge Stevie's gonna be you and me or think so look I make sure them can you make sure that area is greased that's query I calculate how big it needs to be I saw the one on the right this one no they're all looking I don't see like the whole forever yeah I think I think you did the whole venue yeah there's a brad sighting we have a newcomer behind you don't be alarmed or anything yes we have a little max discovered a little dry spell just so oh I don't need don't worry about that end it's the other end okay so how do you want us to pour this as far we're still learning our lesson right no do you like to do it while it's still boiling or I just wish soon as we turn it off I tend to pop pour it so I get as much heat as possible or some flavors in the pot if it's what we call a weak one we will do that in plan sometimes you do the orange that way because it is slowly I usually pour it in the pot and stir and so that it has as much heat as possible to evaporate off that water so I have more time to work with the other one and get the end ploy off the colors now you have a gel food coloring and I usually use water based so yours has less water in it so I shouldn't have any trouble but your flavor be babe yeah yeah that's actually that's very much what I do but the gels gonna work just as fast it's not going to be any different if anything it's gonna solve problems I like that because I can mix colors more easily when I need to combine a yellow or green or whatever to make a different shade it's very hard to mix in with the jealous it's very easy to mix them just by going drop drop drop into that so I tend to use that and since i buy that by the gallon it's what's laying around it's like the wooden spoons that everybody thinks is plastic and it's going to dissolve in the candy when I make it there's a the real question is well the real reason I use them is they're lying around there are wooden to go store ice cream readily available easy to do got a little ways to go away over there in the citric are we using the citric acid today yes okay now do you have a measuring cup by any chance just sure actually do you want to do this with citric acid or without C because the stuff I made gave you yesterday citric acid in it and this way you can do it before and after taste look it's not sound good just in the first square right there it should be the right amount of I did my math right with not slow down and I'll move the bar yeah get your scraper Steve you feel like you don't know it was right I got about there it is who we meet you this tan scraper did you know how we always stuff so the host cards don't hurt hmm without the winning game man where we're moving just one you guys are gonna let me introduce you right yeah was it always this way fun times I was just like go to the grocery store put some holiday without being filmed okay right is it weird flying in not thinking yeah yeah now this is where I would just start mixing it all up and get it cooled down instead of mill this isn't a master okay let me get the gloves off now oh well just for the moment I get a little more dexterity and so we're gonna do about third third and third so this is wider than I normally do normally I do it deeper and narrower but you only have the limitation of this bar sorry so we're gonna see how this works do the choose your corner judgement usually they go all the way across but it's going to be hard to cut all the way across without it flowing out so I'm going to try to do is I'm gonna try to do that's gonna be hurt you I think I'm just gonna go all the way across you're gonna want these aren't you eventually oh this is cooling down so much faster than anything I've ever felt oh just at that end okay that's good oh this is about a third so and hopefully we won't have a problem that the sides getting cold really fast turn off whatever fan is behind me okay yeah yeah this is fighting me fast so this is gonna be the light our nose right there cuz this right here it's getting cold - too fast and this side it's a little hot okay so we think that is great for ya the sides already ready oh this is much faster than I'm used to see but that side isn't ready yet that's gonna be interesting for me to cut I should have done it the other way but don't break it oh I see haha your tabletop sticker at this end then descent probably isn't relevant for what you do normally but it's here so I'm breaking the vacuum you know I felt the table so fight so I'm gonna go about a third right here so I think we do this one first this is gonna be the pulling light and I take that drip it right over here we're gonna keep that going I'm gonna take this for the orange slices pull this over here and leave it on the hot spots I can work it a bit that's going to be pulled and this over here so I'm right now what all I'm doing is I'm folding it trying to get the cold bits and hot this mix right so why don't you start folding that I'll start holding this you see how little orange I put in there yep Steve may have another paddle please [Music] the secret is not to let it touch very long because when the paddles heat up we're gonna probably switch sides here cuz that sides warmer and this is your polling so it needs to say the warmest this is that why he kind of separated so you have the warm side Anna cool side yeah I get to use the table for an advantage of it on my table I yeah I tend to like the clear on the other coldest I'd actually this way worked pretty well because parts have to cold park is too warm and I was able to mix them but you see we got three roughly even pieces here and we're trying to get them oh yeah I tend to use the rubber gloves when it's really hot because I can handle the little cold bits on the edge but since I make a longer thinner thing I end up with more cold fish Steve I think this is about the right temperature to pull what are you maybe a little hot well actually I was about to turn it to the house so let me go over there I'm gonna put this thing in front of your here this is just a little warm I am Lauren that I should listen to brag to me oh I wonder bring that piece over here there yeah all the way back to the right and the chute soon as she's out of here I can set up a camera that's my present cook you saw my - yeah but what if you're Robert Phillips goes to the chopper there's a ya bonus for the customers like your ball of corn syrup it's a lot warmer huh we just flip it so doesn't stick to the canvas is it well elbow is that what the issue is okay I need the scissors go ahead don't tell you that if we turn the air back yes please turn your back on I'm sorry if it's getting hot but I'm used to it being hot my candy shop yeah I guess one concern is that we do have chocolate down here so let's see oh I see what you're saying here let me give this thing's fault so we're doing you got to get this to go fast or you can pulled out so I'm doing long pulls obtain the heat we can't how to get you cool yeah which means pulling quickly is the thing now we really hammered the hook to shake it loose oh you're gonna need that no not if I do it right the hammer service no I don't hammer the hook you can put crystals back in the candy you can actually make it crystal eyes I know it's not 100% likely if you keep this thing rotating so the same torque moves off the hook at a time you can put forward and backwards you distribute the heat it's sticking to the hook because hook is heated up so is that make sure you keeping the hook cool I'm not moving yeah okay so that if you do that it shouldn't stick but it requires moving fast because if you move slow you get more heat on the hook once the hook passes a certain temperature I have no idea what it is the candy I want to stick to it and to those into this metal scrapers you have a candy stuck to us oh yeah they just got hot yep okay there we go so now the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna make our try this we're gonna make our triangles by cutting this into six parts so I'm just gonna cut this in half and this half is gonna be like you want them to be about the same now we're going to just pull them out and I'm going to cut it into thirds you want the thirds to be as even as you can [Music] see this one looks a little smaller yeah I'm gonna cut this here a little bit to that I thought looks pretty even yeah that looks pretty good okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna make three triangles of the same way and I'm gonna put these over here so they can cool down because we want them particularly cool this red needs to be the dark orange needs to be the hottest of all of them actually I'm going to stick this on your galvanized so cool even faster don't you thank you oh yeah so we really want triangles to be triangles and to be able to keep their shapes this way this can actually get too cold because we're about to reheat it with the with the outer wrap and if it's not cool enough you go shape this one too and I'm rotating them to get a nice sharp edge all gonna be the same length not to be too cold the temperature differences here are much greater than in Florida we're gonna be able to do this very very quickly and this area seems like it's cool enough to keep it from getting much cooler and not to keep it hotter thank you so now this thing we're gonna cut up in a white off this is gonna be the bottom layer for the middle okay push it okay if it's a little too wide it's not okay if it's too narrow okay so I'm gonna put this right on here put this right down here by the way I usually keep a wet sponge what I'm trying to do this without it lying around glue a very damp sponge a very slightly damp sponge I can put it down I can glue stuff together that doesn't want to stick don't need it if I do this right I won't need this so now I'm just gonna pull a strip of white out and I want you to do just one I want you to take this stretch it to the same length press it down make sure it's wider than this piece of orange because if it's too long it's okay and I'm pressing the center right there making sure cuts all the way to the bottom I want you to do the same okay I want you to being about the same thickness kept two portions right kneecap oh you got too much bit I think so you do a tribe now you know we'll make you see how thick it is so what we're gonna do is we're just going to pull this longer get it to the right thickness and I'm just going to cut it to the right length I'm gonna keep this stock here I'm gonna fold in the middle flow okay there you go now you could always if you need to make it square your spatula and you can push it in or you can slide the candy to the spatula to get a straight line okay now why don't you put that right on there this side yeah press it in and wanna make sure because all the way down to the bottom if there's like orange touching orange it never looks good now we're gonna grab another one of these triangles I'm just gonna fit it in here now half of its done and I'm just gonna thicken it around now you're gonna do the other half and you're just gonna you don't have to put this white divider in because we've already got it so if you're gonna do is you're gonna put a white side here a white side here put the green in but when you make the white side I want you to pull it out like this because this will give you a better idea how much can you're using and II feel better about yesterday by the way you didn't see me make the lollipop it's a little wider because I can see it's wide enough okay yeah press it on one side loose yeah just like that now you got to do one more of these just like this by the way the utensil heating up includes the scissors that's why I always keep two or three pairs of scissors around oh this is the perfect put it in here it doesn't matter we can just rotate it around I thought this okay see how it's too short I'm gonna spread it out okay so it's gotta be the same same width top to bottom or longer it can be longer now put the top one I'm just gonna push these two together so the white pith touches the white pith nope you're just putting this right in between the two just floor it straight up and press it at all so okay so now we have two halves March our entrance and all right so I'm gonna round this one off a little bit more because I want them both to be the same width it'd be easier if we put it together and I'm just gonna together like this now you know wants that wet paper towel very damp very slightly wet paper towel might be useful right now see I'm not used to the bottom getting cold because your he comes from above my key comes from below there we go so now I'm just gonna go like this so now yeah well that's excellent now I need you to this over here whoa and you need to make sure it goes 360 degrees in all parts of it since my table is evenly heated you need to so you're only rolling it halfway you need to roll it 360 degrees and I'm assuming with that heater you're gonna have to lift it up occasionally and turn it or one spot it's always the spot is always going to be the hot at the hottest does that make sense uh-huh so now you see you see one the white right here didn't come all the way to the edge oh okay so now we have to figure out the diameter of this so I'm gonna mark that I am to here with my finger it's gonna go around to here okay so that's how wide I need my white to keep it rolling okay and now we needed as long as this piece I may have used a little bit too much white in the center so we may end up not using the whole thing thank you okay let me yeah so your heating thing is hotter in the back and cooler in the front mine's hotter on the left and cooler on the right so I'm having a little trouble converting so we're doing this we just made a little to body now putting the pith on well so it's not sticking just gonna take this goggle it we did see somebody else it's just glue you know water makes candy sticky sometimes it's a useful thing yeah okay we make this a little smaller make our life easier and to hold more heat in can you continue to roll this okay now we're gonna do the outside wrap this can be done by one person it's very difficult to learn with Walker's okay I need a measurement to know how long I'm in so you see the seam here it's a real easy measurement we're gonna put the seam here we're gonna roll it around goes to the hole you'll notice when I'm pulling it I'm lifting it up if you don't lift it up it pulls unevenly I had a thin spot you usually have thick spots over here you just cut off the fix pocket the scissor to patch the thin spot donal ever notice that looks good let's do another measurement from here to there it looks like I've got the right distance so I'm gonna see you're gonna lift that up I'm gonna slide this over and you put it right down the center mm-hmm I'm gonna put this up like this I'm putting this up like this if you notice I'm not rolling it over I'm pulling it over because I made it a little smaller there's the overlap it's it's better to stretches now the whole things now if you notice I did two things I made the outside wrap a little longer I don't always have that option but that that'll reheat the ends too we made the inside very cold eventually we wanted all the same temperature so what I did to solve that problem is the outside wrap is hotter it's heating up the inside it's evening everything else it's just something I don't show this on the video because it can take a while but just by poking the end I can tell if it's heating up or not evening everything out and the last bit here it's gonna be too cold anyway that's why I pinch off the ends that in the image listen so now we're gonna pinch it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna size it down to a smaller diameter so once you try that we're gonna roll it and pinch at the same time slowly it's not a lot of pinching is you don't to distort it too much now we're gonna start stretching it they grip the right there that's actually easiest way to do it we just want the force to go everywhere evenly just what beat your help you see how that works that got my start beautiful you know I have to keep it moving because I'll get a flat side if I don't also I'm gonna need that white chopper over there you see this little spot over here so now all we need to do just do a smooth motion and we have orange fun thing about this is another scissors of yours again start stretching this out my goal is to keep the back half I need you to help now okay you're gonna be the roller so once I put this out it's still going to be hot in there if it is hot when it um it sort of if it's hot that's out here you can just I need to roll it on currents gonna fight you because it's gonna have a flat side at first that make sense yeah I'm trying to do it on this those pads I have have some grip and definitely help the roller now when I give these to you the hot ones are going to want to stick to other hot ones right so put a hot one between two over it okay and then it won't not only want it to sit but the cool ones always keep it straight now it's your turn to pull I didn't use my chopper here's the stuff see how it got flat side here so your job is to keep the I might drop sir keep the spinning your job is to pull go to the other side of me and I'm gonna show you how the pulling works sort of like petting a cat you don't kind of tack by choking it you pet a cat by sliding your hand down it yeah that's perfect and you're aiming for good I hotter the other way this can be as long as you can handle don't worry about twisting your [ __ ] neck Indians you want us to show here and go or if you end up with too much hanging off at it we'll all go down at once why don't you wanna shortest you know characters get wedding we're making it look like something that we can would like others to choke chopper this is a sharp edge that works by the way what I'm doing is not what it looks like you're you roll what I'm doing its up swinging it all the way what we're trying to do is we're not so much cutting it is we're breaking what I mean by that it's watch this this is a non-newtonian fluid so if I get a sharp enough blow it'll just wear smoothly and straight that's kind of dull you might want to try the round end of the scissors and you have a better lock watch the other side Heil smoochy yeah if you cut it with scissors it'll be like a candy cane and you have to do that right now if you want to see if we cut it with scissors it just sucks I mean when you cut it it's oh it's gonna be fine that's the pitch but you it'll be absolutely fine but you lose a piece at the end then at the image on IV broad yeah and that could be you know one out of every 30 pieces you don't want to do that keep them rolling you don't you oh keep all rolling yeah can you come down here take this over I'm gonna give you some pictures gloves oh you got that kind of gloves - your stick just keep it rolling like this you want to do a full 360 degrees this end should be closer to the heat source so now we're gonna come down here so we actually want to do you see how that one had a little bend in it super oh so now because these things this thing's still gonna get as long as the conventions you get a flat side I'm going to keep rolling yeah gotta be in the air like that give me against the table who's against the table you're swinging fruit so what I do is I hold the thing off with my left hand [Music] and by the way the length of dispossession covered by your ability so you can't roll any wider than about this spread of your arm right it's thinner he's got a cup inner floss [Applause] are you supposed to keep rolling but I certainly know a certain point they're hard like that okay and then I tend to scoot the hard ones off because they're not necessarily in order when you alternate okay this is getting a little cold this is getting to support one of the trick is not to let it get this long yeah lots of distortion up there that's okay but back this off you see how that broke yeah not too cool at this point it'll stretch it very cool always okay it'll be chopped it's a piece of cinema sure oh you can have to keep it rolling for that I'm just gonna work around the roller it's flexible enough we don't keep the heat even doesn't take long and the heavier it is the more likely it is to flatten out [Music] now I'll tell you if you're doing something a car you can get away with doing letter yeah the more detail to design but the orange is really it's forgiving it's where we start people go go the only way you learn like anything else is doing now look at how easy is pulling it up and just cannot be what it was like pretty was a kid yeah you're this good reviewer kid oh yeah try the ground into the scissors this seems to be better you gotta let it pass through and here commute for dropping it's attached to something else should we have the fans we usually well that might be useful over there yeah oh thank you oh yeah yeah but I mean this is going off so fast in here but yes we use a fan too know what's kind of on it'll be fine they do break they break when they cool and they're not round it makes cutting a little bit slower you like the cards if you're cutting multiple sticks at a time which is the efficient way to go let's say two of them stick together go play with the non-newtonian properties to break apart well if a section becomes too cold sacrifices yeah you don't know one party to hack off of it just like every day's the same this is the same thing we should be very similar to point an oh we're just keeping it rolling you did it right to a triangular right yeah I've seen from the French guys new candy canes with squares where three each three on one side one each on the other side needle inside right no no no that was handmade ones oh let me take a lecture get a four out of it so now let's take a look in a second this is different than mine it's coming down here so let's just on my I do have an over this veto in a batch roller and I have the name of the board the trick here is to make sure all side computers yeah right so if you just go like this on the half three yeah I can't get the border to cash out okay you can do it this is pride by the way you want to get a good deal by the way it's tough at this is this is as tough as I like it when I'm doing the real detailed work because the hotter it is the less distortion you get in the middle or the colder it is the less distortion does this kind of more stays play I'm really gonna want some footage off you different all right there we go I made a swamp just the only time you've ever made arcane is over then yes the first time yeah we're gonna start cutting somewhere around here we have that metal block right there come on right there yeah so this looks like a perfect thing to use you just need a sharp edge so let's take these I'm gonna go for the cool ones to do in about two or three of those they want to break under their own weight so you really need to open the hands and the longer they are you may want to break them in half before you ever cut them so all this is just it's actually just about the perfect thing to use also so Steve those ones are so they I want use the ones ever come over there once you take them away yeah here's the things yeah so you're gonna start with one we're gonna start with not a long walk but a short so you're gonna put this over here now gonna angle it down like that and this has to hit at the right angle to this I don't care what angle you do you just have to follow it's that way exactly sideways a little think of it as scissors can do it absolutely flat it's hard to do it because your hand wants to angle so I usually find the comfortable angle for my hand to go speed and I match it with this does that make sense otherwise you end up hurting yourself if it dings if it gets chipped you know it doesn't go all the way through rotate it a little bit you're not going to get it to work on the same way you try to oh you want it's just harder to do they can't be apart at all daily I know I need an apartment even you apprentice there is a machine one is currently meeting me and all I can hope of everyone who talks about it it's pretty terrible candy that doesn't looks like you no one was made I'm not sure when I'm in the nineteen forties thirties World War two it's obviously a European it was an American make the makers name would be stamped on every possible area this is nothing there are two guys you know the one that's currently being made doesn't do a good job this one appears to but the one I have let's look at apart and suddenly tears and what scared - I'm sure I can take it apart that's I have a friend who rebuilds transmissions [Music] [Music] do you see this you see the jagged pieces it wasn't a no straight angle oops well see how you just got that turn it maybe halfway now from longer strokes and some pieces may just be set up they want to shatter yeah I don't by the way I don't wear those heavy gloves at this point I can tease dude I'm just wearing vinyl oh yeah actually it's not really when I'm going fast like I don't go but uh i neva then yeah I can't but if I'm doing the angwa power strokes as close as possible without hitting it this head tells the blade I mean it doesn't mess up the candy way your back on if you get tired let me know I'll take over I didn't have the muscles to do the damn g'day I'm creams but I have the muscles to do this oh yes make it stuff in there after a while like four funnels in it I can't be more than like five pounds or yeah I think it's just after like oh we're just discussion yeah holding that funnel for like that line it was not that long for me and it just broke me down it's actually my knees because you had on the low thing and I was crouching you know I'm afraid I have a few want to do another batch of this but I think the ribbon candies but people we're gonna want to stay doing really I got so many comments why don't you do it like her with her fingers I was wondering when you were saying fruit by the foot what you were talking about yeah [Music]", "M-_CaDRD7jQ": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended he pours it on to a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an O a V and E a y OU and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they can also twist rods into lollipops if you have any comments about the show or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows drop us a line at www.nadex.com you", "oJKnXFcpcUI": "tis I miss cannabis puree with more reviews for you today and today I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to see more just subscribe to my page please maybe like the videos let me know you're watching say something every now and I feel like I'm talking to myself but I know I'm not cuz I see you guys are watching so I'm gonna say bye now because I've got more to do I got more things to talk about I'll be back in a few seconds but it won't be like that to you bye thank you", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "vGOYds0MKpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops thank you for watching if you like this video please go to our website www.marykay.co.uk/awilliam a be lucky to see us do it but we don't make it all the time and we

you're a patreon subscriber you can also get podcasts from Greg and yes that's me and this only leaves one question why a raspberry sometimes colored blue and that is for another video [Music]", "Ph3gwfhwuSc": "today's webinar staff wellness why it matters and what can be done we're very excited to have everybody here we have two wonderful speakers today Chris peacock from healthy schools campaign and tardy Clemente from CPS office of student health and wellness and today's webinar is we've allotted an hour it probably won't take the full hour but we've left plenty of time at the end for question and answers so throughout the presentations you can chat in your questions using the questions box on the bottom right-hand side of your screen just to enter them in as soon as you think of them hit send them in and then we'll be sure to get to them at the end of the webinar um and then we also draw the webinar will be doing poll questions that will ask you to send in your responses and thoughts throughout the webinar so please look out for those also we have a lot of resources to share so at the end of the webinar worst be sharing a link where you can access all the resources mentioned during this presentation so without further ado we're going to go ahead and get started first sorry i should say my name is alex maze and i'm a senior policy analyst at Healthy Schools campaign and I am now going to hand it over to my colleague Chris peacock who is going to kick things off for us and Christy runs our official our program at Healthy Schools campaign thanks Alex so before we get started with the webinar I want to just do a quick reminder there might be a few people on the webinar who aren't currently part of the fits learn program so I want to give it a brief review of what fit to learn is and share some of the expectations for those of you who are in the program as a reminder to continue on with your booster sessions so what is it to learn this one is a free professional development program that we offer chicago teachers to help them prepare to integrate health and wellness messaging into the classroom we look to these teachers to be leaders of wellness in there classrooms and also their schools we asked teachers to implement we asked them for implementation so what that means is we asked them to model healthy behavior and then sit there healthy habits into the daily learning by integrating nutrition education and fitness into the classroom we also asked teachers to promote and share the Wellness ideas not just with their own classroom but also with other teachers the thought is that by having a support system in place it makes implementing the program much more successful throughout the school and we also like to recognize all the hard work that the teachers do when they are in school so part of our program is to recognize their efforts and honor them with a breakfast at the end of the program in May so that they know that we really appreciate all their efforts some of the expectations for fit to learn of course we ask that all of our teachers who sign up attend the full-day fit to learn session and that takes place in August and then to attend three booster sessions over the course of the school year we offer a booster session one time a month from sep tember through april and they're all based on topics that were introduced earlier in the summer or sorry earlier at the full day session such as physical activity in the classroom school gardens and then of course today we're going to talk about staff health and wellness we ask they share all their ideas and messages with teachers in their school but also to work with their principal and parents to make sure everybody's on board we offer an evaluation twice a year for participants to give us feedback on what they think is a program and then suggestions on how to make things better and then again at the end may we invite them all to a breakfast to you know really showcase and reward you for all of your hard work all right so before we get started we have our first poll question and we want to know who's on our webinar today so are you a teacher a principal a parent or maybe a resource provider or are you someone out we really like to know who's paying attention to our webinar so it looks like we have mostly teachers today which is really good alright great well we're excited that you guys are here and we'll try to keep it entertaining and interesting for the the rest of the hour alright so here's our agenda for the first half of the presentation we're going to talk about specifically leading by example we talk a lot about teachers being role models for their students so we're going to take a look at that and review how you can be a better leader talk to you a little bit about getting physical so that means movement and how do you accomplish that in your busy work schedule we're also going to explore healthy healthy eating and and kind of a basic nutrition 101 but that's going to come from terrace and she's the expert on that topic and then explore ways that you can encourage colleagues and parents and even principles to share in your excitement for being healthy and and then ways that you can stay healthy so we talked about this allow we talked about how healthy students are better learners and and we know that children who are healthy and well fed and nourished tend to have a better ability to focus they're less likely to go to the nurse's station with a stomach ache in the morning because they've been fed their attention span is is much greater and their behaviors way more manageable so healthy students are better learners and we know this but what about teachers we don't want to forget you the older we get sometimes it's more important to take care of ourselves and when you're healthy and eating right and getting exercise we know that there is an increase in overall energy so as a teacher if you come to school and you haven't been well fed or you you haven't been physically active your energy and focus could be diminished we also know that you deal with kids I think sometimes they can try patience and so if you're not feeling good you might not have the same patience you would normally have for your students if you look better you feel better so improves confidence when leading discussions maybe even with parents or other teachers and really working hard to make sure that you're really present and in the moment and and being physically fit can really address all those concerns so let's take a look at why why is it important to be healthy other than to help you focus and pay more attention at school we know that obesity is associated with many other health problems such as heart disease stroke diabetes and some cancer the estimated medical costs totals about 147 billion dollars annually on direct and indirect costs of obesity and additionally there's an increase in absenteeism lower productivity low morale social stigma all of these can carry over into the school environment what's wellness we talk about wellness we throw the squirt out a lot but what does it really mean well it's a state of optimal well-being that is oriented towards maximizing an individual's potential this is a lifelong process of moving towards enhancing ones physical intellectual emotional and social well-being so it's not just about being physically fit and looking great it's also about feeling good about yourself and being able to engage in social settings where being aware and healthy is pretty important the first positive feeling healthy is to start moving and and for those of you who are currently in the film program you've seen this lesson plan before this lesson plan is something we use pretty regularly in the classroom it's a simple strategy to get kids up and moving and it could take as little as three minutes or it could take up to 20 minutes depending on how you present this activity through 50 learn we encourage teachers to get their students up and moving we know physical movement in the classroom is easy to do it just takes a couple minutes of a day and it can be really easily incorporated into your core subjects this is one of the again this is the lessons we offer that physics that includes physical activity in the classroom by incorporating physical activity daily your classroom will not only get your students this will not only get your students out of their seats but also will get you moving as well so just a few minutes of movement can make a huge difference in your ability to focus in the classroom 10 minutes of movement throughout the day is great but it might not be enough for you as an adult it's recommended that as adults we get 60 minutes of physical activity every day and that can be a challenge so really looking for gym memberships where teachers are offered reductions in the membership cost is pretty common throughout the city of Chicago and probably all over the country and that's a simple way that you can get moving but there's also other things you can do that don't cost you anything creating a walking group or a running group and meeting in the in the morning or after school in the gym is one way to stay active if your school has a weight room may be asking the PE instructor or the principal for some special time just for teachers Zumba is a hot topic people love Zumba and there's lots of Zumba instructors who are eager to share their love of Zumba and getting them to donate some time in the class at your school is a suggestion you could try to enlist others to participate in your physical movement as well lat we also have an amazing resource in Chicago we've got over 65,000 acres of force to serve in Cook County and that's a great place to go outside and hike run sledding is really popular right now so if you're not into running and hiking lettings a good option so some really simple techniques techniques to get you up and moving that won't necessarily cost you any money alright so we don't want you to do this alone we know that studies show that enlisting the help of a friend or a colleague is key to helping keeping you on track and active and moving towards you goal of staying healthy and step now how do you get colleagues involved how do you get other people to buy into this whole idea of health and wellness well the first thing we suggest is that you survey the staff see if there's an interest at all in starting a group and working out together and staying fit we want to make sure that staff has had a bye in so by ensuring that you're addressing what their questions or concerns are will more likely enable you to have success when when you're creating these groups unless the help of others so if you have a wellness team maybe look to that wellness team to see if they're interested in participating in as well or if you don't have a wellness team establish one and we'll talk about that in a little bit you can develop an idea and then work with your wellness team to create strategies based on the needs and wants from your survey and then get started we're going to share some resources with you that you can share with your staff to help keep them motivated such as creating contest like Biggest Loser contest that kind of thing and we'll talk about that in a little bit more detail shortly so what do you think it's a survey you want to ask your colleagues what what they what their thoughts are let's explore this a little bit more so let's take in the next slide this is an example of a survey we've created for all of you to use you don't have to reinvent the wheel we've done it for you and this is a resource that we're going to share with you later on there's several pages in the survey and it really helps when trying to decide what the best program is to establish in your school some of the questions are going to focus on personal personal physical and mental health stress management financial planning parenting skills remember wellness encompasses more than just physical health it also includes health of the mind social and family health all these topics affect how we feel on a daily basis you're being the staff will help get their buy-in it makes it more likely that you will have a greater participation rate in your school wellness and again enlist the help of your wellness chance alright so here's a poll question who has a wellness champion at their school or who knows what a wellness champion is that's actually not the question doma to talk about a wellness champion in a minute but who has well as champions at their school so so far it looks like nobody has a wellness champion oh it's like I'm just kidding so it looks like we have some that have wellness champions maybe you have wellness champions who aren't quite as active or you have no idea if you have a well minutes champion in your school so let's talk about this really quick this is going to be your best friend when trying to establish a wellness program at your school so a while this champion is someone who's an active member of your school community it could be a teacher a nurse appearance full partner lunch or manager it doesn't necessarily have to be you you don't have to be the wellness champion it's great if you are but there are other people who can take that role on and they are committed to creating a healthier school environment for all of our students but also for all the staff in the school as well they leave the school's efforts to increase healthy eating and physical activity for students during the school day we love our wellness champions there's also wellness teams and so the Wellness team is pretty important we encourage principles to be part of this wellness team so that when directives are presented by people who are involved in the Wellness team it's more likely that other teachers and staff in the school will follow suit so keep in mind when establishing a wellness team we want people like principals parents nurses a couple students I mean they definitely should have a voice in some of this some of the changes that might have it at the school and don't forget about the dining manager or other staff members in your school okay the next you want to develop your idea and roll with it so you surveyed your staff you've established help from the wellness team this is the next step it's time to realize your idea and get moving and so we talked about how to motivate some staff at your school this this works really well in many schools and we know that teachers tend to be a little competitive so you can do things like start a Biggest Loser contest if you want to keep staff motivated put some informational and motivational quotes in their mailboxes if you have bending machines for staff only and there are choices in there that might not be the best it's fun to throw a little bits of information on that vending machine like for example if there's a Snickers bar in there maybe you post a sign that says Snickers bar you will have to run 60 minutes on a treadmill to burn all the calories from your sneakers bar some I know it seems silly but those kind of things actually work and help people make step back and think about the choice that they're about to make if you have staff meetings look for healthy food options so instead of the typical coffee and donuts maybe you're going to offer things like fresh fruit whole grain bagel with low-fat cream cheese things like that start a walking club share your favorite physical activity and see if you can't get some businesses in your community to donate get certificates so not asking you to spend money on gift certificates for spa treatments and manicures but a lot of times people in the community are eager to help and so they're glad to donate items to help you motivate your team so next you want to get started and what does that mean well in order to get healthy you need to know how healthy you are or unhealthy you are so here's a guide that has some resources for free or reduced-cost health screening it seems silly a lot of times you'll see things like after your physician before you start working out but it's really important to know where you're starting and then what your goal should be your doctor can help you establish that so see the has a really great program going on this weekend where you can go get a free health screening and then learn more information about the get covered Illinois program sam's club every Saturday every second Saturday of each month through October is offering free health screenings and they're on the top exchange so one month it might be men's health another month it might be women's health just go to their website and I also will have it information for you later on to access where you can go to their website check out everything that they have to offer san xavier university every year they offer a free health fair that has happened on March twentieth and then lastly we have the American Diabetes Association offering a spring Expo the Expo is actually free and then they do lots of health screenings there as well so take advantage of some of these amazing opportunities health and wellness resources this seems like a no-brainer but a lot of people aren't aware that there's amazing opportunities in all over for easy access to gym membership so the YMCA is a great place to start they have everything from swimming and running and gyms and I mean they run the gambit as far as physical activity goes cardinal fitness planet fitness and CrossFit are all great ways to stay fit and healthy if you're not a CrossFit person because that might be too intense look at look at a place like Planet Fitness where it's really low key they've got lots of great equipment and memberships are really inexpensive additionally I know a lot of CrossFit gyms that love to offer discounts to city employees so police firemen and teachers they definitely are a hot commodity at these gyms and they're eager to offer some discounts to get you guys in the door wellness appt these are great I'm not sure if you guys have explored this enough but there's some great apps that you can load onto your phone and they're really easy to use this work it is a tool that I personally use you can work out from five minutes to 50 minutes and choose your workout style so it could be circuit style you could do yoga you could do daily stretches but all they can be done at home or on the go if you travel a lot so don't dismiss these apses they're definitely there to help you stay after them fit all right and then of course we have our fit to learn resources so on this page on this web page we will post the last page that has all of the resources which also includes all the wellness fairs and then also our lesson plans so if you're looking for ways to get your students up and moving those physical movement lesson plans are on the website as well so definitely check out that link when you have a chance so just to kind of recap what we're talking about and what we're asking you to do is to really look at yourself as a role model and really start leading by example we want you to be fit so get skifter the call start moving your body when the kids get up to do a little you know maybe do a little dance midday because they're they're starting to lose their energy join in you'll you'll notice a big difference with how your day rolls and don't do it alone it's really much easier to enlist the help of friends and colleagues to help keep each other motivated and then again stay healthy so really utilizing these free resources for health fairs I know we all love going to the doctor I just had my physical last week to tell me I'm okay and healthy and so it's a good baseline to start from and then knowing what your goals are they can help you accomplish those alright so I hope that's helpful these are simple strategies that should be easy to implement and we're going to learn a little bit more about nutrition now from Satara the complete day yeah that'd be great so we're just to kind of piggyback on what Kristi was saying I just wanted to open up the webinar was talking about the importance of being a healthy role model and so I work in both the office of student health and wellness and nutrition support services and we help schools to implement our wellness policies and while none of these policies dictator have any jurisdiction over staff wellness we do have a little line in our local school Wellness Policy as kaif wellness is encouraged and so it's great to have everybody join us and just to work with Healthy Schools campaign and get the word out there so the importance of being a healthy role model is that you can really show students what it is to eat healthy and be physically active and of course we know students healthy students are better learners and and that's we don't have to prove that anymore we know it's the fact so now let's talk about how we can just be role models ourselves this is not to say you cannot have your own indulges indulgences but when you are in front of the students it would be great to eat nutrient-rich foods so fruits and vegetables whole grains make sure that you're drinking water throughout the day to show students that we want them to be drinking water instead of we know a lot of our students drink a lot of juice a lot of pop so by you modeling water that can help that remind them to also have their water throughout the day if you do want to have a sugar-sweetened beverage you know just putting it in a different container there's so many cups out there with the straws already you can pour that in or in a mug or something like that I can't tell you how many times I walk into a classroom and see a redbull container or a monster energy drink and we know we don't want our students drinking that and it you might not even be thinking about that they're going to look that you're having it and they might go pick that up later on in that day and then of course integrating movement brakes for yourself and for the students which Christie covered very well so to get just really into healthy checking we're going to talk about snacks beverages and then I'll show you a few tricks you can use for reading the Nutrition Facts label but when you are choosing a snack it's important to choose something that's high in fiber and protein and so for fiber we have fruits and vegetables all are naturally high in fiber their nature of health foods and then whole grains are going to be where your fiber is in any of your bread or cracker or other snack products and your protein will be of course in any meat or beans but then any nuts and seeds your milk cheese yogurt all those kinds of foods will be high in protein and you want to just choose lower fat items lean meats and try to limit your processed foods so thinking about ingredients the less amount of gradients ingredients the better the reason why protein and fiber are such a great combination is so I always describe it as sort of that protein and fiber are a magnet for each other once you eat something that with those two nutrients in there it takes a really long time for your body to digest them so together they're like a super strong magnetic force and since the longer they stay in your stomach the more folio feel they'll digest really slowly which is great for your blood sugar whether you're diabetic or not you really want to avoid spikes in blood sugar we want to make sure we're avoiding overeating during our meals and so when you do have your snacks it helps you to avoid what i call eat the farm so we know if you wait a little too long between breakfast and lunch or too long between lunch and dinner which many teachers do your very busy or schedules jam-packed you can go home and just sort of eat everything that you see but if you try to combine these protein and fiber nutrients it'll help you to feel fuller longer and then hopefully we won't have these binges we also want to make sure things are nutrient-dense so nutrient-dense is such a buzz phrase of buzzwords and what it means is lots of vitamins and minerals without a lot of calories the best foods for this are going to be your fruits and vegetables you're going to get a lot more bang for your buck by eating those then eating a bag of chips or a process next energy dense means calorie dense that means you're eating tons of calories that you're not getting a lot of the nutrients in there here's just a list of healthy snack ideas I definitely will not read these out loud to you but I what I think is awesome is as this childhood obesity and adult obesity craze has taken over the market has caught up which is good and bad so they've made some really unhealthy foods fit the new trans a profile that we're looking for but it also made a lot of other foods more available so right now hummus is a really big popular health food item and they have those little pretzel and hummus snack packs that you can get you can get them in bulk or you can pick them up at corner stores and gas stations and wild greens and all these stores that are normally you wouldn't have been able to get foods like that you can always get grab hard-boiled egg string cheese any nut butters so if peanut butter doesn't agree with you there's sunflower butter there's even soy nut butter at this point in time so these are just some good snacks they're easy to pack up and have in little containers and keep with you throughout the day as far as beverages so there's really only two drinks that your body needs to stay healthy and that would be milk and water and there's even a lot of studies coming out now about milk so I'm going to a conference in a few months I'll get back to you on that but for now a lot of studies do show those benefits of having milk or a milk alternative so a soy milk or almond milk because we do need calcium for strong teeth and bones and it's recommended you have three servings of dairy a day so if you love milk that would be three glasses a day but if you're not a milk fan your cheese and yogurt will get you that calcium and then you can stick just to the water water of course we know it's important my favorite thing is you know around the beginning of the new year all of the resolution propaganda that comes out and I just saw something with a woman who showed she never drank water and then she took 30 days to drink enough water every day and she looked younger her skin was brighter and better and you know hey if that's true great ah but there's much propaganda is out there I'll take it if it's for water you want to make sure you're having your water throughout the day it helps you have a lot of energy to and sometimes we do mistake feeling hungry for being thirsty so water is usually just you can't really go wrong when we do not choose water there's a lot of other drinks that are out there so whether it be energy drink coffee a soda Gatorade there's lots of other ingredients that are in there so I just wanted to point out the negative impacts that could be happening by not by choosing other drinks and so when you're thinking of bone health as you get older your bones just get weaker and we want to make sure that an exercise can help that too but you want to make sure you're not counteracting any of the good that you're doing so if you're getting lots of calcium through foods you could be reversing that by drinking anything that includes phosphoric acid which if you're thinking oh I don't know what that is it's been a lot of your brown colas so whether that's Pepsi coke root beer where diet and regular it'll have this phosphoric acid in there and then the phosphorus takes the calcium out of your bone so if there's any chemistry teachers on the phone you know that or if you think back to our chemistry days we want to make sure we're avoiding that it's also really bad for your teeth besides just the sugar and cavities the acid can hurt your teeth and then too much sugar of course we know it's not good for our pancreas our kidneys or heart can help it can hurt with those blood spikes which hurts your pancreas and then too high of sugar in your blood it goes through your kidneys and can cause some damage and then caffeine two cups of coffee a day that quiz ullin of that and caffeine has been found to have some health benefits so if you're not drinking caffeine you don't have to go out and start having caffeine but if you are that it's just the two cups and that's 28 ounce cups not if you're like me in your mugs hold 28 ounce cups or something you think you can have two mugs that's not the same so there have been some health benefits associated with that but for the most part we want to try and limit the nutrition label has a got is going to be go undergoing a revamp and if you followed it came out probably around this time last year that FDA and us wanted to update this I've seen the beginning of it and it it looks good but it guess what it's still going to be hard to read the good part is they're going to take some of the guessing work out of it but you are still going to have to do a little bit of mental math unless you're eating the exact portion or the whole container which there's going to be plenty of foods that you're going to want to eat in between there but it really is going to be your best way to figure out if it's of food that you should be having so I'm going to try to break down just some of them aspects to make it a little simpler so the first thing you really want to look at is the serving size and that's because like I said a lot of things will have a service like a candy bar a king sized candy bar is two servings I don't really know anyone who cuts a king sized candy bar in half and saves half of it for the next day so you do want to look at the serving size to figure out how much you plan on eating so you know when you're looking at the label is you have to do any of this math to figure it out and then the calories that you want to look at total calories calories from fat is we'll get to it's important to note however we do need some fat in our diet so it's not to say oh this is high in fat I shouldn't eat it if you're eating peanut butter it's going to be high in fat but it's going to be good kinds of fat so you want to make sure you're not just saying Oh move on to high in fat so you're going to start with those two things next you will move down to the fats and so this is a slide that shows that the nutrients you'd like to limit saturated fat is the south is going to clog your arteries or cause you any heart disease or heart troubles and that's going to be your solid fats and come from animal products so whether that be neat butter cheese anything coming from an animal is going to have fat rated fat not to say you can't use saturated fat in your diet it's going to be in even those natural health foods like an egg or a dairy but you do want to make sure you're watching how much of it you're eating unsaturated fat is the opposite it's going to be liquid that'll be your oils and then any of your plants Oh peanuts walnuts almonds all of those and those really have been shown and fish has this as well just to confuse you about saturated fat being from animals and that will be heart healthy it really does protect your heart and so give a good balance of these two fats you do of course want more unsaturated fat then saturated but just to be aware of that and then trans fat is really one of the only nutrients that I do try to say try to get none you really do if if you can avoid trans fat which you can because it's been only processed foods you want to try to not have any of this the problem is it does exactly what you don't want it to do it doesn't just raise your bad cholesterol it lowers your good cholesterol as well your good cholesterol is going to be increased by exercise so if you're doing really great and exercising but eating a ton of trans fat it's not really going to have those benefits that you want it to and then of course sodium sodium is always going to be a hot topic because we just eat way too much of it in the US it's in everything we eat even if you are the healthiest cleanest eater you are having sodium in your diet and so the ways you can so these are the recommendations you can see a large amount of the population is recommended for the lower amount of sodium and so find your category or wherever you're in there and almost these days almost everybody's impacted by someone in their family having high blood pressure so we all could use to be under the 2,300 milligrams no matter what but to give you a perspective one teaspoon of salt is 2,300 milligrams so you can see how you don't really get a lot of leeway here and foods that are going to be high in sodium are going to be your snack foods or any of your canned foods so I love canned beans because I don't have the patience to take dry beans and soak them overnight or I forget I've maybe am NOT great at planning meals all the time so I'm going to be getting sodium in there the same with soups it's cold outside we love our soup you're going to just be getting tons of sodium in there and do be careful especially with reading the label for a while I was going with the low sodium soup well they just divide at the serving size in half so instead of having one cup of soup I apparently was supposed to only have a half a cup of soup and they can call it low sodium so really be careful and we're going to get your kind of things to watch but it's really not you don't have a lot of wiggle room here on sodium so just as much as you can limit you want to watch that fiber so you can see the recommendations here for women and four men Americans in general don't even get near these levels and the recommendations are to increase these recommendations you'll see this when the new label comes out but I think it's going up to maybe 28 grams for women and 44 men so it's not a huge difference but it's just interesting we're not even I think most Americans get about half of this every day is that so and we're burying it so it's kind of like we're spinning our wheels here but it keeps these numbers in mind and do try to add them up because fiber can really counteract sodium high-fat anything bad that you may like binge on or put into your body I should say unhealthy not that everything fits but the fiber can kind of go in there and clean it up so you want to make sure you're having your fiber can help clean those clogged arteries cleans out your colon want to make sure go in the bathroom every day so look at your fiber and that'll have that it'll have that right there on the label and then percent daily value this is what I really wanted to change on the new label and it didn't change so it's still going to be there it's very confusing for folks because most of us don't need 2,000 calories we either need many's much less than that or we need even more than that depending how active you are so it's really just a base if you want to figure out how many calories you need every day you can go on you can google calories per day and a million calculators come up and all pretty close to accurate so don't worry one's not necessarily better than the other my plate choosemyplate.gov will tell you couldn't give you a whole meal plan but if you did have to just if you just were recommended 2,000 calories the daily value will just give you an idea of by eating the food how much of that you're you're eating if you need less calories than that then you're going to want to imagine the daily value increase if you need more of them that it will be less so it's not a perfect guide but it's a good place to start and that will still be on the label they did talk about perhaps having two values may be one for a 1500 and one for two thousand only time will tell but it's a good place to kind of look if you don't feel like doing a lot of muscle mass the ingredient list so I almost would prefer you start reading the ingredient list first over a once you get to serving size and calories than die if you don't want to bother with anything else start reading the ingredient list and really it's because the first ingredients going to show you what is the bath is the most prevalent ingredient in that food so if you're eating bread you want whole wheat to be the first thing that's listed if you are having a whole wheat bread but the first ingredient is water it's probably not holy there's probably been cut with something or it's just not going to be a substantial so you want to look at things like that awful sauce the first ingredient we want it to be apples not sugar so you want to look at in that case to see what's the top ingredients and then you also want to really consider how many ingredients there are my favorite ice cream haagen-dazs five that they discontinued but it was only five ingredients so I didn't feel so bad because I thought I could even make this it was cream and eggs and sugar and things that should be in ice cream right so I always think of it that way I'm going to buy a food if I was making this at home what would should be in it if there's a hundred ingredients and I made that it should have flour water egg and butter that's probably not a food I should put in my body so it's a it's not a perfect rule but it's a general rule just to kind of start thinking about it if you can't pronounce a lot of them maybe skip that food as well I did want to get into percent fat because this is sort of it one of the easiest ways to figure out is this the foods you should have or not and this is a good exercise you could do with your students you will you are definitely not a stranger to these flaming hot cheetos up here I know if you're in a fool you see these every day many times but a great thing to get the point across to your students is figuring out the percentage of fat of a food so what for flaming hots if you take calories from fat and / calories flaming hot cheetos are almost sixty-three percent fat and so while to an adult of course we know that's high to a child they might still be like well that's still not a hundred but then i'd like to say it as okay let's think of fractions if sixty percent of this bag of chips was filled with butter or lard you wouldn't eat it and that's really what's happening here so there's lots of fat in there and we want to make sure that they're not eating it for other reasons as well but it's a good a good exercise and then we have our baked flamin hot cheetos which of course are healthier right but you can see these are still almost forty percent fat so it's really not they're not changing the product so much that they're better for you if it's baked and so it's really we want to talk to our kids just about what can we get rid of these flamin half you know so good things to do with your students I put up some pop I should say these are not branch specific any of these types of foods I know now there's like flamin hot funyuns shalini hot cheese string so it's not just Cheetos anymore so the same with your pop here you can see in this 20 ounce and they've done a lot of labeling on products already on the front of the product if you only have eight ounces of this then you'll have a dirt you wouldn't only have eight ounces of this right we know that people are going to drink the whole 20 ounce container but you can see if you did only have the eight ounces it's a hundred calories if you have the full 20 is 250 calories this is about the size of a snack or about half of your meal so it's kind of thinking is this worth it have a whole thing of pop or should I have some pretzels and hummus and actually feel so energy drink I always say everything fifth except energy drink so energy drinks are just just nothing good for you there are lots of sugar too much caffeine it's better to have a coffee with mocha caramel with cream because at least your body can digest it and it's real ingredients instead of these energy drinks and it's just these are being targeted to our teens especially so if we can just talk to our students and if you can if you're going to have energy drink not having them in front of students it's just it's so important but you can see here the difference there's a towel they don't even sell laid off drinks anymore they're all at least the 16 ounce can or than the huge 24 ounce can but tons of calories tons of sugar and you can see they still put the serving size though as 8 ounces even though they're kind of drinks a huge can of it and then the last one to talk about is just our entered our Gatorade powerade our sports drinks and vitamin water all of these things where they are marketed as healthy and we need them if we're active and I can't tell you how many times I've been at the gym working out and I see someone just dripping sweat and they've done this great workout and they're just chugging up every two out of gatorade and i'm thinking you just burned no calories basically because you did all that work and you put all those calories back in with sugar when you sweat you sweat out water and salt remember how we talked about you eat enough salt so just put the water back in we're really not needing electrolytes unless we're like LeBron James we're a marathon runner we're or we're out there in the Sun playing a soccer tournament these drinks just should not be consumed by children or adults and the best replacement drink is really just some chocolate milk a lot of studies oh that so about the sugars and the potassium and everything and then finally just making sure we do not fall victim to these health claims where things are fat-free or sugar-free if they take something out they put something back in so to decrease fat that's them to take away from flavor takeaways the mouth feel that means sugars going in where salts going in and the same thing with sugar if it's sugar-free they're putting in more tall or fat or they're putting in a sugar replacer which is you know the jury is still out on if we should be having those artificial sweeteners or not so just being aware of this if you pick up reduced fat cheez this and compare them to regular fat cheeses you might as well have the regular fat one because you're having way more sodium and sugar and the reduced fat and it's not that big of a difference in calories so just being aware of that and comparing labels so in summary just we I think we all know the importance of being a healthy role model our teachers are doing everything out there they're teaching our schools are doing a lot of stuff you know we have food we have for our students we have activities for our students so making sure we're just having everything be healthy and that we're modeling that behavior and then for yourself just so that you're feeling your best and every day at work making sure you're choosing those healthy foods you'll have a lot of energy you'll feel better look better and then you're your students will see that and they'll have that great energy from you and it can keep everything going in our school building so thank you so much this is one more reminder i always forget to tell people about this we do have a free health curriculum on are available for all CPF staff this is just the activation code we've had this for about a year and we have grant funding to keep it for the next for this school year and then one more school year and there is a free access to something called go noodle which is a physical activity breaks but feel free go on there is k12 common core-aligned so and if there's we might as well use it and and then this is my contact information so thank you great thank you so much higher that was wonderful and i know i just learned a lot so i hope everybody else did as well and so we have about 10 minutes left so we wanted to go ahead and do our question-and-answer session and and also this is Chrissy's contact information is up on the current slide that you all see and so please feel free to send in your questions through the question box we've had a number of questions come in and and so we are going to go ahead and take those and then salford keep on sending them in so our first question either kaffir tar I can take this so Valentine's Day is coming up so what teachers do to stay in line with health and wellness and do you have any ideas for a healthy ways teachers can celebrate Valentine's Day oh my god so we have ideas and if you all have ideas feel free to chat those are way as well we'd be happy to share with the rest of the group i know that you know valentine's Day is almost as exciting as Halloween and it's that one time of the year where people are really excited to get candy especially kids and so some suggestions we've heard from other teachers is to offer instead of offering candy to look for your red fruits and vegetables and just to focus on those so maybe offer strawberries and grape tomatoes or red bell pepper these might also be fruits and vegetables that kids aren't normally exposed to and so it's a fun way to still celebrate Valentine's Day but in a healthier way I don't know if you have another yeah so we were always getting great ideas from schools and teachers and I hadn't heard that red ones already know that yeah but I think a big thing is of course we still can do like the passing of Valentine's or things the discouraging students from bringing in candy and really encouraging them to either think of all something actually nice to write to each of their classmates instead of just signing so taking that extra effort if not the candy but maybe a extra thought or just doing other fun games of like heart health and talking about things like that so that you know we always have jumped rope for heart around in the heart health month of February's so just thinking of ways that we can focus on fun and not just food but I like that red one yeah yeah um great thank you so much those are great answers so um what the next question is we're going to move right along what do we do when parents want to bring in treats for celebration so what are some ways that we can kindly tell parents or maintain the healthy classroom that I know everybody's working so hard to create we have had a lot of schools be really proactive about this and so I'm thinking specifically of an elementary school I work with who did a robocall last year before Valentine's Day to say as a reminder please do not send candy we r do we are a healthy us certified school please just send the valentines and we're going to be doing our own activities so we've had schools do that be really proactive get an email out or newsletter robocall things like that when the treats do show up or if a parent really does want to bring the treats we just explained what the policy is and then we bring up other non-food items so how many students out there run out lose their pens and pencils or need a folder need a new notebook and so and these are things that can be super inexpensive if you go to the dollar store even office supply stores so bringing in stickers or pencils with erasers something fun like that and then we've even had schools who make the day specifically for birthdays whether there's a birthday hat or a sash or saying things over the announcement to recognize the student instead of having them bring in a treat and it actually is even more special because then the whole building knows that it's just birthday or it's a time to celebrate it not just the classroom Tara I know that there are parents who are really excited to share food in the classroom for celebrations can you talk a little bit about that menu option that's now available through air mark yes so we have a healthy menu a healthy celebration menu that can be ordered through the dining center it is available it's on the CPS Google Drive so you can search I think just healthy celebration menus and anyone can access it there is on fruit tray veggie tray a cheese tray and then there's some ala carte items so granola bars and water and pieces of fruit and the parent or school can actually just put it place this order there's a phone number on the sheet and the items will be delivered to the school that day and it can even be brought to the classroom and it's a really a great way it takes off the pressure of going to the store getting everything yourself and it also is just a good way to avoid these pitfalls of where we want to have cakes and things like that so yeah that's available and and that can be for individual or classroom celebrations and then we also have the opportunity if the school is looking for a special menu for an activity so let's say Valentine's Day maybe they really want to order pizzas for the classrooms well instead of ordering your own pizzas we can switch the menu so that that day is pizza on the menu and that way it's still pizza it still as a celebration and if that's something really easy we can do for schools we usually have all the food there with a few days in advance and we can order things special as well so we like to let school know that and save your money as well you know don't go out and buy a pizza if we can do pizza and make something fun and then you can spend your money on something else to create great yeah really wonderful information I also wanted to just remind everybody on the webinar so we are going to be recording this webinar and and then we will be sharing a link to that recording and nessa slides from today with everybody so you will have access to and the next question are gluten free foods more healthy than other foods I know so I am badly gluten free not by choice and I can tell you that I you know I really take eating seriously I make a menu every week for my family and I cook almost a hundred percent of our meals every week and I feel like it's a trap like you think Oh gluten-free it must be more healthy but actually nine out of ten times their way more processed or just as processes any other process item so don't be don't be tricked by this whole gluten-free trend I laugh when I think about my mom who recently went gluten-free because of some health issues and we talked about it I was like oh mom it's great you know you feel much better you look better you might lose a little weight some people lose weight when they eat gluten free and she shows up regularly at my house with gluten free cookies and gluten free what I mean anything chips you know anything like it is processed she's all about it and so I'm it's definitely not more healthy I would say that if you're interested in going gluten-free and you want to stay healthy just avoid those pitfalls of the processed foods like just to avoid them again I know it's kind of crazy to think about but really cooking your meals from scratch tends to be the best way to address that issue and so if you can make time in your life to you know cook that it makes it much easier but definitely not more healthy i'm sure you know that yeah and even to piggyback on that I feel like a lot since it does seem like a crazed where is this is the thing now to be gluten-free and then people say oh I lost all this weight and really it's they're eating quinoa they're like eating all these great whole grains that are not processed and to your point I mean they're it's easier to lose weight when you're not eating junk food which a lot of people eliminate and then attribute it to being gluten-free but if you have to be gluten-free for health absolutely you will feel a lot better but don't think you have to go gluten free to be healthier right yeah yeah just it's the thing now great um so yeah I think we'll take one more question and so we have somebody that wanted to know specifically about green pea and health benefits and so yeah or maybe and talk about tea in general and different times patek types of alternatives yeah I am a huge fan of tea you know tons of antioxidants st. coffee has less of antioxidants too but he is great with the first to not have a caffeine you're anything like me there's a definite time where I should stop having caffeine or else I would be up all night but for the benefits of green tea and just any grill a lot of cheese but especially the lighter varieties has been documented many many times over it's been shown to be good for digestion good for cancer prevention good for heart health and so it really has those protective factors sort of like you're healthier fats and I really like to have a glass of tea or and I do have the lighter like a green tea or something like that a white tea in the afternoon I do feel as like it helps with digestion I don't know what it is in there i mean it's mostly antioxidants and then of course water but it really helps with just like moving everything along and feeling good and great for this season when people are getting sick it cannot hurt you to have anything like that so there are some things out there about taking maybe a green tea supplement or drinking the tea is going to be fine supplement is going to be water soluble which means you'll digest it in an old path and it won't i won't stay in your body any longer than having to you so yeah great thank you and we have another question that just came in wanting to know specifically about the health benefits of black currant juice so which I don't know if you know anything about that and if not maybe we can look it up and get more information out I don't know specifically but definitely can look it up but i'm sure a lot of the juices as long as you're choosing but it's not something with lots of sugar and if the first ingredient is the food itself or juice from the fruit it's going to have the same kind of antioxidants but yeah i haven't heard anything specifically with black currants but i can look it up great oh hey we do have one more question came in sorry it's good we're here is an interesting one so what about Stevie are plant-based sweeteners so yeah this one comes up a lot and I kind of go back and forth on it because you know technically it is plant-based for me and this is this is my dietician opinion and you can probably talk to just as many dietitians who have opposing views but I really think with sugar it's how much are you putting in there so if you're eating raw if you use sugar in the raw or raw sugars the left process and you're having one tablespoon a day that's 15 calories that's walking probably like from your car from your house to your car from your car to school so it's really considering how much if you're a person who would put a ton of regular sugar in then putting in a replacer will help you with calories and a plant-based of course I'm always going to be more of a proponent for plant-based and natural than the artificial but if you're really not using that much sugar anyways if you're a one packet of one there one packet of truvia you could probably adjust your own taste to actually be lower and just use very little sugar the hard thing is with CBM trivia is new and we don't really know what those effects maybe down the road you know think tab soda and nutrasweet and sweet'n low was like tossing in the 80s and then all these studies came up with that we need fat and we shouldn't have been having all these artificial see so we just I think the science isn't really in on it yet in 10 years we might know if we should be having it or not but for me with any sweeteners or sugar natural sugars it's really how much of it you're having great well thank you so much Thank You tatara and Christy for speaking today and thank you to everybody who took the time to join us this afternoon so once again we'll be sending out a link probably at the beginning of next week with where you can access the recording of today's webinar and slides so thank you so much for joining us and enjoy your evening yeah", "0DR3s3E1VwM": "first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the book yes I've never seen that car hmm yeah classic motif boy s dog boy doesn't have dogs yeah the brave doesn't have dog in sad way talks to the hound lady in the all right think so I think there has any okay let's don't bring that up yeah I'm sorry come on I'm gonna cry right into the strawberry I was just gonna say is this a good pink or should I keep lighting it up I need your strawberry you're awesome he knows you can do a strawberry but don't do a raspberry I can't wait to taste this I wonder if it's okay if everybody before lunch I gotta call my mom I want you to trust him right now no I said I call my mom okay I guess I guess that going now hmm how close did you come I guess AR purple or I mean this one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right so what do we have to do for the water bug and we're going to throw the green is that what we did

Terry okay panting adjourn it is meeting adjourned is [Music]", "4d0b-tIUsis": "let's make some candy together this is my second\u00a0\ntime making it and i am going to try a new recipe\u00a0\u00a0 i want to try to make the butter toffee so i\u00a0\nhave butter sugar corn syrup i have flavorings\u00a0\u00a0 and the tart and sour and food coloring and let\u00a0\nme show you the molds that i'll be using i have a\u00a0\u00a0 thermometer it's not a candy thermometer\u00a0\nit's a meat to my thermometer but it works\u00a0\u00a0 well and we have the lollipop and the lip\u00a0\nlollipop molds and just regular candy molds now what i'm going to do with my\u00a0\nflavors i'm going to go ahead and mix my\u00a0\u00a0 sugar corn syrup and butter and let it start\u00a0\nto boil up and then what i do is mix my\u00a0\u00a0 flavorings and food colorings in these\u00a0\nlittle cups here and i pour them in at once\u00a0\u00a0 all together once it reaches the 300 degree which\u00a0\nis crack candy stage and then i just um stir it\u00a0\u00a0 and it's done i don't know if i'm able to\u00a0\nshow you all that on here but let me try\u00a0\u00a0 this particular recipe i'm gonna use one whole\u00a0\nstick of butter two cups of sugar and maybe a half\u00a0\u00a0 a cup of corn syrup and see how that turns out the\u00a0\nmain thing is to get it into the crack candy phase\u00a0\u00a0 the first time i made myself call myself making\u00a0\nalcohol lollipops and i put too much alcohol they\u00a0\u00a0 turned out good and they did the job they actually\u00a0\ngot me tipsy but they were soft like toffee okay the butter's melting i'm gonna\u00a0\ngo ahead and pour my corn syrup\u00a0\u00a0 that i have measured out already\u00a0\nhalf a cup and then the sugar um\u00a0\u00a0 i am using a stainless steel sauce pan i got it\u00a0\nfrom walmart for like 12 they say the best one to\u00a0\u00a0 use is aluminum and then the second best is copper\u00a0\nbut this one worked just as fine it worked perfect go ahead and put the sugar up and i'll\u00a0\nshow you when it comes the butter is\u00a0\u00a0 boiling let me get the sugar in\u00a0\nand then i'll show you that boil so you also must use a metal spoon go ahead and\u00a0\ngive that a stir real quick just because i want to\u00a0\u00a0 get that sugar dissolved so it can start boiling\u00a0\nup and then i'm going to check the temperature\u00a0\u00a0 i put the top on i'm gonna let it get the boil\u00a0\ngoing and um then we'll put the thermometer in\u00a0\u00a0 the digital thermometer and i'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand get my flavoring and food colorings ready\u00a0\u00a0 i want to make two different color\u00a0\ncandies so i'm gonna after i get\u00a0\u00a0 this to a certain temperature\u00a0\nbefore i pour my flavoring in\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna actually pour half of this into\u00a0\nhere so that i can um you know get two flavors while that's some boiling up we'll go ahead\u00a0\nand put our sticks in this i'm gonna have to\u00a0\u00a0 use the smaller sticks i'm glad i got some oh\u00a0\nmaybe i need the smaller sticks for holidays\u00a0\u00a0 yeah let me get my small sticks one more got the\u00a0\nsticks in and on these i think i'm gonna put the\u00a0\u00a0 candy in first and then the stick as it starts\u00a0\nto harden these does not require stick let's go\u00a0\u00a0 check on the um boiling mixture so it's boiling\u00a0\nup and what you do is you don't stir it you just\u00a0\u00a0 let it boil but let's go ahead and um see what the\u00a0\ntemperature is i have to get it to at least 300. let's see how fast it's going to change\u00a0\nit's going fast it's 144 158 170 already 180\u00a0\u00a0 89 always getting on up there okay i'm gonna\u00a0\nlet it get to 300 and then i'm gonna separate\u00a0\u00a0 it let me get my flavors ready i didn't do that\u00a0\nyet but i'm about to but this is moving fast\u00a0\u00a0 okay someone made this with strawberry and the\u00a0\nsour tart and we're gonna put a little red in that\u00a0\u00a0 make some red candy i hope that's enough\u00a0\nand this we're gonna put a little green and at once once this reach let's check this again saying 95 let's check it see how fast it moves up and i wanted to burn you got to get\u00a0\nto about 300 that's going pretty fast let me turn the stove down a\u00a0\nlittle bit once that's all 247 when i get it with 300 guys because i'm\u00a0\nusing one hand oh it's getting up there\u00a0\u00a0 and i'll show you what on\u00a0\nhow i put these flavors in but anyway you get the idea let me get that stirred and i'll be back\u00a0\nand then we got to pour it in and the molds okay guys it definitely got the correct\u00a0\nstage um perfection it started like\u00a0\u00a0 like setting like hardening up\u00a0\nreally quick let me show you\u00a0\u00a0 first time i made it in get the heart cracks\u00a0\ncandy i can tell it did not because it has\u00a0\u00a0 all these little pieces that is hard and\u00a0\nstringy so i'm excited about this the flavor show you the end results before i show the\u00a0\nresults i just want to show you i'm gonna have\u00a0\u00a0 to figure out but these look pretty good these\u00a0\ncircles but i'm gonna have to figure out a way\u00a0\u00a0 to get this stuff in here smooth so i can have\u00a0\nmy proper shape i noticed that it works better\u00a0\u00a0 than the silicone mold i just tasted like\u00a0\npieces from the end guys and this is a very\u00a0\u00a0 very good flavor so if you want to ramp up\u00a0\nyour flavor and your hard candies add butter\u00a0\u00a0 along with flavors and sweet and tart otherwise\u00a0\nit'll just taste like sugar it'll be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 with different colors but it'll\u00a0\njust take like sugar and water so these are the final results and they\u00a0\ncame out really good as far as the texture\u00a0\u00a0 and the flavor came out amazing these are\u00a0\nthe first ones that i made with the alcohol\u00a0\u00a0 they didn't come out so pretty but they were\u00a0\nperfectly flavor i put them in a refrigerator\u00a0\u00a0 and they're a little bit harder but they still\u00a0\nend up being a toffee like texture before you\u00a0\u00a0 finish eating it but it's delicious and\u00a0\nyou can actually feel the alcohol in it\u00a0\u00a0 these definitely got to um crack\u00a0\ncandy stage the green is really good\u00a0\u00a0 but the um red i put a little bit too much flavor\u00a0\nin it that flavoring is really concentrated so you\u00a0\u00a0 have to be very very careful and light-handed\u00a0\nwith the flavorings but that tart sour that\u00a0\u00a0 you can be heavy-handed with it i really like the\u00a0\nflavor of the green but i'm getting better at it thank you all for watching please\u00a0\nlike share and subscribe and have\u00a0\u00a0 a wonderful day night evening morning\u00a0\nwhatever time you're in at the moment", "rvn0xep-EsY": "hey guys Shayna here so today I'm a bit of a different video I'm going to teach you how to make homemade hard candy I'm gonna making watermelon flavored umm I've tried this recipe or a similar recipe once before and I accidentally burnt it so I'm hoping this is going to turn out a bit better I got a candy thermometer for Christmas I love candy so I'm gonna try to make some and I'll show you how to do it for your ingredients you will need two cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup you'll need one teaspoon or just one small container of candy oil I am using watermelon flavor you can use whatever you'd like and if you'd like I'm going to put a touch of red food coloring in it you're also going to need a saucepan a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and a candy thermometer so we're going to start off by mixing in the water the sugar and the corn syrup you are going to put it on a medium heat in the saucepan once the sugar is completely stirred in and dissolve into the water then you're just going to let it sit no stirring and boil until it hits between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit also make sure that you can zoom over to does not touch the bottom of the pan it has to be taking the temperature of the candy not the pan the mixture is just starting to boil but about 100 degrees to go make sure that you don't have it on too high of a temperature because you don't want to burn the sugar one thing with candy making is that you have to be quite patient it takes a while to boil if you have a gas stove that is better it's best to have constant heat on it it works on your ways but it does take a bit longer be patient we're now getting quite close to 300 degrees if your guys can do oil to make it flavored when you put it in be sure to keep your head away from the pan because it will send up some steam and it is a very very strong okay you have to be quite quick when you stir it together and make sure you take it off heat first that smells delicious drops are red that looks so good once everything is all mixed in you're going to have to pour it very carefully onto here you want it to be fairly thin you can also use lollipop molds if you have them I'm just going to make hard candy that we can snap later let's hope this works crazy color okay we are just going to let this sit now make sure it sits at room temperature you don't want put it in your fridge and afterwards we are going to break it apart and taste it looks like it looks so good and smells delicious well cuz stringy it is I don't know if you can see that what's quite hot still I've got such a nice flavor can't wait till that's hard one quick tip while this is cooling make sure your candy thermometer you clean it off completely so there's no like little chunks left because otherwise next time you make candy there's chunks you're going to get stuck and the candy will get stuck to the chunks it just it won't work properly so make sure you clean this very well hot water works good okay so the candy is hard now so you're going to peel it off and just break it to pieces and make sure you put it in a continuous a good seal on it comes off so nicely there you have it this is a very simple recipe maybe a bit finicky and it takes a while but how to make just an old-fashioned kind of standard hard candy uh I will leave the link down below where I found this recipe if you'd like to try to make it and yeah I will see you guys sometime soon thanks for watching watermelon I love candy you can replace sleep with exercise so his suggestion was sleep for six hours instead of eight and use those two hours to go for a run or bike ride get some exercise", "Nlsm81WzS5M": "[Music] keep sucking [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] keep on sucking and now cricket season

welcome another session of inc okay we are on week number eight and today's is food planning food pyramid this is classic and this is english for seven my name is mrs your english teacher today's objective able to classify the food according to the pyramid food food pyramid what is the food pyramid it's the way nutrition range is different food we eat and how good it makes to our body so on top of the food p damage we have the oils and sweets so that we do not need to eat that food too much we have to consume less of oil and sweet then we here the daily products that include milk cheese butter yogurt ice cream that we need to consume in moderation also we have the protein protein is the one that we obtain from the apples or from vegetables like for example meat red meat poultry and also a vegetables that produce protein okay then we have the veggies that we need to ingest out of vegetables to be healthy like lettuce tomatoes cabbage eggplants and different vegetables and fruits we have them here in the same category as veggies because they are good for our body so in the examples of fruits we have watermelon grapes strawberries apples oranges beer then at the bottom of the food pyramid we have the grains the grains include rice potatoes some products made from corn and from fur like bread but we have to be careful and eat them in moderation let's check this video about food pyramid [Music] welcome to the colorful so what our health delicious is is of scientific research foreign is vegetables fruits grains the first plant-based group of vegetables in spanish professionals like cauliflower mushrooms is is yes is is a fish eggs yes yes yes is [Applause] yes [Music] is i yes is yes is foreign extra disease and so that's my health effects over the top of the pyramid a diet saturated with trans fats of choice avoid sugar interests and soft drinks and energy drinks these are classified as discretionary actions is is is which can lead to an increased risk of diseases such as is is is okay excellent video now that we have a general overview of a healthy and unhealthy food let's check the vocabulary you have that vocabulary on page 24. let's check the words bread practice repeated at home bread cereal pasta rice fruit orange gray apple watermelon pineapple strawberry pear cherry vegetables lettuce carrot cucumber tomato cabbage meat poultry chicken fish lobster cream beans eggs nuts milk yogurt cheese fat oils sweet and junk food what do we need to do with that vocabulary okay you have an activity here in your book in your module okay what do you have to do you have to label classify the different words that we have here in the word bank let's check the words from the word bank fish lettuce apple yogurt chicken beans onion lemon cheese chocolate candy and spaghetti this is on page 25 page 25 from your english model so you have a word you have to do with this word you have to use this them in the correct classify them in correct food group we have the first group bread and grains and seeds then we have one two three four five six different groups the last group oil fats and sugar what do you need to do you have to classify each according to the food group for example fish fish that's meat and seafood then i write the word fish in the second column i have lettuce lettuce that's vegetable then i write lettuce in the vegetable column apple that's a fruit then i write there in the correct column yogurt yogurt that's milk and dairy so i write yogurt in the column of milk and daily chicken beans onion lemon then i have to classify you have to classify each of the food from the world bank in the correct fruit category okay let's continue i like i don't like food today's grammar is using the word or the verb like i like this is what you want what you prefer i don't like this is something that you don't like you don't prefer it you avoid using that you avoid eating that so let's check this video about i like i don't like [Music] um yes yes i do yes i do do you like donut juice no i dont popcorn yes i do do you like popcorn pizza nope yes yes do you like banana soup [Music] nope okay in your grammar module you have the grammar structure the singular and the plural i like banana you like banana he likes banana she likes banana plural form we like banana you like banana they like banana then we have the question forms and the answer the same as we practice with the little song do you like spaghetti if the answer is affirmative yes i do do you like broccoli if the answer is negative no i don't do you like onion no i don't do you like pizza yes i do yes i do what about if we ask another person the question yes like jewel jewel do you like pizza you is gonna say yes i do yes i do now let's talk about healthy and unhealthy in the first video we saw the food pyramid and the recommendation in that case that's what pyramid and recommendation was for australia but what about healthy food is good for everybody in the world so we can follow those recommendations too let's talk about healthy and unhealthy healthy is something that is good for our body unhealthy is something that is bad for our body so for example the pizza is delicious i like pizza but pizza is unhealthy for my body eggs eggs are healthy for my body vegetables and fruits are healthy for my body they are good but what about potato chips are they good no potato chips are not good for our body so potatoes chips are unhealthy let's check this video which one remember all healthy is bad hamburgers [Music] which one is healthy healthy means good wow which one is is unhealthy which one is healthy meat [Music] chips which one is is it cheese which one is yes healthy [Music] yes which one is it orange juice oh that's just good yes which one is healthy yes hey what should and what shouldn't i eat should and shouldn't shoot is a model auxiliary this is a verb that we use to give advices and recommendations and suggestions shoot devo shouldn't not oh you should exercise every day yes this is good for your body he shouldn't drink much soda no coke that's unhealthy recommendation when should i eat junk food no junk food is bad for your body junk food is another word for unhealthy should i eat junk food like french fry hamburger and pizza no you shouldn't okay we have another extra task and this is a healthy and young food rescue let's talk about that in details during class remember you have to practice exercise daily you should exercise daily this is good for your body here we have a list of common exercises and different sports in your english model this is page 28. we have some sports in english american football archery athletic baseball basketball boxing cricket cycling football soccer golf hockey polo rugby tennis swimming volleyball remember that you have a task with this you have to select five different sports write a brief content about them a brisk summary and then illustrate that's your task for this class okay remember you should eat healthy food you shouldn't drink much soda bye [Music]", "BhBnkbvzuCI": "[Music] so [Music] 308 it is 308 extra trees what's the temper of the table we got uh between 100 and 110 what's on the other side the other side of the table 104 one same it's like 100 between 100 and 110 okay do you know what it was last time cold it was like 98 oh yeah and it cooled off really fast yeah so this time should be better yeah it's trying to be a little bit better we've got everything i guess hey sure i am watch your head oh screw this on the other side and the ball's not over there oh that's not important i'll do my best [Applause] that's good watch they're going to be perfectly even i'm going to feel kind of done with the air i'm just kidding i feel dumb it smells super banana right put a whole hand of bananas in here it already smells very behind me whoa gloves are going to smell bananas [Music] that's it you already put it all in i should have wished i missed it how many shots you have to put into that 1.75 and then max putting in seven and a half seven and a half yeah i guess that's why it's not as strong over here wonder why i totally smell strawberry yeah no i feel like it's not as strong as a banana which i feel like is extra strong well you know one of the one of the flavorings is twice as strong as the other one yeah i still smell strawberry though it's pretty well you guys haven't tried it yet have you joe did you try basically i had a piece yeah yeah how was it it's good nice juxtaposition flavors well balanced as all things should be we should take a temperature reading between the two and the kettles yeah i mean you gotta assume that the other one on the main stove is cooler but i mean warmer yeah i don't know for sure yeah oh that's cool yeah i'm pretty sure this one's colder yeah yeah i mean it'd be nice to have that on all this so is the the bottom of that double boiler not quite as warm as the stove then well it's that and um we lift this off and move it and that's still sitting on the cut the cast iron ring over there which holds a lot of heat yeah and uh the conductivity of copper is really really it's the most conductive metal so it cools off the fastest so when we take it off that and move it to there it's going to cool off quite a bit yeah by at least like one or two degrees i mean i don't want to get too difficult according to my calculations it's like 3.7 oh exactly every time oh wow no wonder we're having so many cooling problems do you believe me yes very believable oh what calculation stinking spoons that'll do you perfect [Music] do you guys think it is uh evenly split or uh not really probably no one's sure if they just just took more time to fill out and that's actually going to get there this if you look at that i think the table is not quite level because this end is usually thicker it's actually so i guess you guys could invest in like a scale to put underneath to make sure it's always well that's not that important also i guess you would also have to know how much the other one weighs because it's not always going to be the exact same yeah we could like fill this up dump out like exactly half of how much we put in and then mark the kettle but even that and the kettles are different weights too you have to take that into account it's a whole thing is it a whole thing or a whole kitten caboodle i like being alone it's fine just uh come out when you need a hug we'll find terry for you we know how much she loves giving hugs the people who don't know my mom that well because they don't know in real life i've seen my mom reject hugs from family members yep can you count them all oh no like i i've seen i've seen people ask my mom for a hug and my mind goes no [Music] she doesn't really dance around it just goes no yeah we mcdonald's we got pretty good at saying no [Music] um your kingdom look looks good yeah are all your loyal subjects doing your dirty work well i could still uh just bring this off but you're just bringing off stuff that looks clear so you can't really what to see much of anything oh you might be able to see it you see that one line disappear yeah cooled off a little bit but it's way better than it was before yeah yeah last time it was just i could see how cold it was even even me the guy who doesn't make any candy and his eyes are closed all the time yeah that sounds cold the last one actually did sound really cold though yeah you like you picked it up and you put it down the table is like yeah that one's coming together a little bit watch max open up i guess they can i almost said openers but he doesn't really want to use it i got to tell you okay have you ever did you ever play with legos when you were a kid never never ever not even your house with you yeah so so you wouldn't understand no do you know like it's like the gray piece and like you click it on it's got the two pieces you click it onto a piece and then you can bend it to get them up yes i never even used that thing like i i can't listen are they really yeah that's just not right lego i'm disappointed in you yeah remember those giant legos the what do they go clothes lego yeah oh sure he just loves building with him right next to the train set you know i guess wood it's kind of like legos for adults wood yeah yeah just make whatever you want although legos are also legos for adults dude i'm telling you every year for christmas i'm like well i hope there's a lot guys yeah logos are awesome yeah that was like my thing when i was growing up and uh i was subscribed to lego magazine same here yeah did you get the bionicles uh comic uh yeah i got a couple of them yeah yeah and i was trying to i think i remember telling my sisters and my parents that my animals because i was like they wouldn't it wouldn't say bionicle on here if it wasn't a word oh boy show me show me in the dictionary define bionicle these robot things it's a nickel that's made out of bios wow okay so just a heads up joe this this next batch the corn syrup is pretty soft so what's up the corn syrup oh yeah i don't know if that'll have an effect does temperature have much to do with that or that's humidity i think yeah but we've had some batches that are like wicked wicked soft and other batches that are you know you get the water really cold yeah yeah nice and icy and um i don't know if you guys do but i like to shake the excess water off too because sometimes you get more water on your hands or yeah for real yeah when it's sticky i put more water on my hands if um if you have too much water you form a layer in here and then that'll like eat away at the the invert yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yep all right so in one of the last videos that we posted somebody commented wait so putting water in your hands makes the corn syrup not stick to you but then you put water on the candy to make it stick to the candy yeah and they said how does that work i said magic we can put uh the kettle over there that we do for the banana and the lemonade that we usually do you can put water in that pour the candy before it's hardened into there and it won't stick to the copper kettle right this is madness joe it is madness water how does it work absolutely nothing who needs one again water's overrated it's about electrolytes it's what plants crave it's great all right i'll be back you guessing my age yeah i could never remember i know that you're always a few months younger than me and i'm 48.48 what am i younger than my dad yeah hey dad you got five bucks yes we'll give it to you later yeah this seems a little bit warmer than the last this is a little warmer than last time i was going to start with my caramel here oh i'm calling for a new carpal stirrer more sugar in candy this is the broccoli sugar so don't oh my god did you as soon as it touched it was like yep let's go find a scoop wow got even lighter hey steve hey how you doing buddy good you need a hammer yeah i got a little piece stuck on here how could i tell i because of the way it is oh that looks nice [Music] do you know why we hit the hook with the hammer why the vibration loosens it from the hook oh cool wow isn't that amazing i learned that from from the old country the science guy he will not be denied you've been in that room too long buddy humans i remember talking is it coming off no it's still stuck there come on steve work your hammer man i thought you were worthy okay little joe's getting tired dad yeah it's still warm it's a good color i'm thinking tired i got this i could do this all day long and that side [Music] there it goes i think you got it all right good you know one more one more [Music] oh i got a little bit huh so close [Music] that's not too much so are they about the same temperature oh no this one's a little warmer remember when we were pouring these out yeah and i said uh let's dump a little more i shouldn't have said that no they're about same size oh yeah if you kind of squint at it and turn the lights down they're like the exact same size yeah turn the lights off yes close your head you better turn a little less just believe what you want [Music] to switch for this one sure what do you mean you want to pull this one this up extra banana just the way we planned it get your hands up all i can hear in my head was get your fingers off of my butterfinger we'll probably put it up on top of this if you need it go back a little bit further i would i wouldn't put a lot of it but the bottoms would so yeah this thing's plastic yeah [Music] what do you think it does seem a little more strawberry right yeah yeah because it's a little bit cute yeah it just like pops a little bit differently yeah because a little see-through it seems almost like strawberry jelly is there anybody in the planet who doesn't like a piece of toast with some butter and jelly on it like strawberry jelly specifically not something that i ever eat but still delicious did this uh hmm that color difference it's not too different or it could just be the first couple pulls cause you know the car will change a tiny bit yeah uh when i make candy we have been going like every other like i'll first i'll throw it on the hook and then i'll oh yeah he didn't do all the hard work yeah yeah i see what you did there i understand i i am almost 30. yeah we had a lot of youngins next that's it he's only 30 since he's 26. right i've been almost 30 for 15 years dude when i was your age i was almost 40. all right so back off yeah i should be a little bit more understanding well when i was 40 i was 50. oh that he's been 40 and he's not even 30 yet yeah yeah you almost have two friends named bill and ted yes i'm going to pretend like i i i get i get it so like i've never seen that movie huh yeah where do you meet him um they're at a different school you have a girlfriend kevin yesterday [Music] so but people have asked us many times before where they get a candy cutter like that and we usually answer it saying if you find out please let us know because we don't know we just basically inherited these i think that they have friends yeah steve says we just talked about this yesterday because we made ken yesterday he said he always keeps an eye out for those things on the market the last time he saw one six years ago oh yeah he hasn't seen anything that's not burning yeah i mean i guess if you're if you're good with metal you could make one i'm sure i mean it's just like hinges and blades i don't know metal stuff but blades yeah i mean if you can fabricate i mean i'm sure that you can figure out most of anything it's not exactly like a modern model no different book dude you tape like six kitchen knives together you can make one of these at home and you can buy those from them like custom with like as many blades as you want different size spacers they've got those things where they mounted them on a like a table with a motor and they just kind of like push this whole giant tray through oh man it's an accident waiting to happen it's all it's like you know it's an industrial candy setting so they've got it all all the safety precautions in place most of them yeah it's it's pretty safe after like the 37 things that got caught up yeah we should put a guard on that imagine like going to work and you just ask your boss like so is that pretty safe like yeah so is that pretty safe oh so your birthday's coming up huh hmm you ever had banana ice cream uh made out of bananas made out of bananas yeah just frozen bananas blended yeah it kind of makes like a big cream okay but i don't know if i'm gonna eat ice cream bread yeah well yeah because if i'm gonna have ice cream i wanna have like cookie dough or oreo or peanut butter and chocolate i'm a stalker for strawberry ice cream i mean yeah like if someone offered to cover i'm not gonna i'm not gonna deny it yeah that's not my favorite choice yeah see i do like ice cream but i'm not much for like cookies and cream and all that well this is coming someone who doesn't like sweets you know what do you know about sweets yeah a little bit i've had ice cream before did this get smaller a little yeah i think it doesn't do that correct i think the heat might have melted it oh okay yeah yep oh can you see what you're doing real quick dad no no this is also a table too huh what's the temperature of the caramel 190. oh wow it's also because obviously that doesn't have to get tempered so it goes through the funnel right so it has to be like pretty hot to go through with them yeah cool stuff have fun brush turtles hey craig i'm not really sure that these are that sharp we just quickly yeah i'll give you a scale of one to ten how sharp i think it is the louder you scream the sharper i guess i'll take this this almost looks like um the first batch almost looks like a cheesecake-ish kind of color yeah see i i think they both kind of look cheesecakey yeah this one's definitely not good yeah it'd be a good color for the strawberry cheesecake though yeah yeah strawberry cheesecake i think would be great flavor like my mama i know was threatening to do cheesecake of all different types of pumpkin cheesecake yeah well i was just saying i think that would be good i figured the pumpkin flavoring was like the pumpkin mix or whatever i think that's why we don't want to do it outside of the season because we can't buy more pumpkin spice right but uh but yeah those were all really good yeah i think you know everybody knows that i'm not the biggest fan of chocolate but cinnamon over chocolate do it good work kids try our best strawberry first i flipped it over and got the banana that's kind of cool that like it's like a sandwich where if you eat it upside down tastes like a different salad i was afraid i was only going to get bananas because i just ate three bananas maybe we should try the fancy connection here well i cleansed my palette first by standing on my head that's yeah i i just read an article about that that gets all the blood out of your tongue totally works well you gotta stand up really fast oh is that how you do it so what do you have to do like a handstand to a flip or like you just get up really fast and then a somersault you've done an arab fast in a plie yep you do that right mm-hmm i'm gonna say this is a good combo yeah i um viewers or subscribers ideas do strawberry banana yeah yeah i had never heard of this flavor combination a few of them asked but max kept whining or whining i couldn't take it anymore well you wouldn't let me throw away the banana flavor i just had to stare at it didn't i get new banana flavor yeah but the old one smells really good too take it home with you okay i'll put it in my car there you go banana bread it's just flavors flavors it works good in the radiator oh does it hey it is glycol based is it's good in the radiator yeah i mean my regular antifreeze tastes pretty good so very sweet right right right blue is sure a little more sweetness i just put gatorade in mine build up a tolerance no one will ever get me but you know every time somebody's trying for very professional taste duster yeah i already gave it 10 vegans yeah wow 10 whole vegans and i think steve's giving it an 11. oh yeah well he was only giving it one thumb up yeah he definitely gives it two okay i like that's eight out of eight vegans yeah so max it was a good call on your part are you happy now yes were you happy before yes okay good so so what we did here didn't really change anything for you all right this is going to go on forever hey guys littlejoe here reminding you to like the videos and subscribe you",

horizons I thought what's something I've never done before and that's meat candy now was thing I was thinking back to when I was a kid we used to have these these flat hard candies that were about I don't know four or five inches by an inch and I'm really thin they were covered with plastic and you peel the plastic off they were delicious there was a cinnamon one that I used to always get at our local well it was a pharmacy that right down the road that sold candy and I'd get him there and they thought you've got to be able to make those at home right so I went on the internet I found four or five maybe six people who showed how they make rock-hard candy and I thought I could do that so I took these recipes from different people and sort of combined them and everybody had their own slight different way of doing it though it's all pretty much the same thing and so right now I'm gonna go through how I made some cinnamon rock-hard candy you need sugar I use two cups of sugar for this recipe light corn syrup you're gonna need about two thirds cup about 3/4 cup water is necessary and the flavoring I'm using the cinnamon oil that my wife got from somewhere and doing the powdered sugar for the very end a few other things you might need is a candy thermometer and parchment paper don't use wax paper the wax might melt parchment paper is better okay in my saucepan first I'll add the corn syrup that very thick sticky corn syrup follow that by the sugar that's 2 cups sure and the water with a food coloring just for style turn on to a high heat initially you want a high heat to really get this boiling quick but you have to keep stirring till everything's dissolved you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want it to start burning to the bottom of the pan remember you're a high heat once you get it to a good boil then you're ready to turn down the temperature of Bin's come out to a medium heat and now we're gonna let it simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes and this point we want to use our candy thermometer and now the goal or what we have to do here is get this concoction up to about 300 degrees that's called the hard crack temperature or something like that it's just a little over 300 degrees you can see our temperature's rising quickly but reality this took almost 40 minutes to get to the right temperature and of course a little coffee while we're waiting and our temperature continues to climb to get that's hard crack temperature and I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I kept stirring because I was afraid it would stick and burn and all that stuff and it didn't seem to hurt it we're almost there you can see it hard crack has been reached [Music] okay so we immediately removed from heat we can take up the thermometer this is where we add our flavoring my cinnamon oil I'm gonna add the whole bottle to this and almost immediately the whole house is filled with that cinnamon flavor you can smell it everywhere and you've got to stir it quick because this stuff gets thick and hard next we'll take a baking sheet covered with our parchment paper and we're gonna dump it right on there this thick gooey mess don't get any on you kids have your parents do this that kids don't try this at all because this is very dangerous very hot sticky mess 300 degrees and is too bright to your skin and burn you pretty bad if you're not careful and that's it now we've got to wait for hours before we can break this up and put the powdered sugar on and so we're done it's been four hours since I poured the concoction onto my pan and the nice part is it'll peel right up now look at this it's almost like a clear piece of glass right every so this you should just break it into chunks and look at that broke up nice and now what they say you have to do is cover baking powder because it's still sticky and though I actually like it like that the candy and remember it wasn't covered in baking powder but that had that plastic the plastic over it so I'll cover it with baking powder baking powder add some sweetness so I don't think it needs it and it'll get rid of the stickiness right and so you end up with chunks and all different shapes and sizes and now [Music] pretty tasty does remind me of those fire sticks I you see it as a kid and cinnamon always goes well with coffee so [Music] but it does plastic containers save it for later thank you for watching I hope you appreciated this I tried something new today and I sure enjoyed doing this maybe I'll do candy again in the future find another handy recipe if you've got a candy recipe you think I should try it let me know let's see if we can do it otherwise this is jeff saying so long okay [Music]", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "AaGHDrI4EEM": "do you remember the old-fashioned candy with all the bright colors and cool images well I do and I thought they were beautiful to look at very Christmasy put you in this season but you know what they never really tasted that good these are handmade candies and it takes a lot of work to get those images in place seems like all they need to do is upgrade their flavoring and add some citric acid then they'd be delicious well unless you're making cinnamon or peppermint I don't know maybe I've only had the cheap kind because I'm looking in this magazine and these look fancy so I decided since it's my birthday month I'm going to order just random things that I wanted to try and I've watched this YouTube channel called lofty pursuits for a couple of years and it's always interesting to watch how he makes this image candy so I thought you know what I'm gonna order me a couple of these packages to see how they taste it took about three weeks for the package to get here and just when I thought they might have lost my order it showed up in my mailbox and of course I had to start digging right in because I was really curious about this package it's called Thanksgiving leftovers and it's supposed to taste like Thanksgiving food and that is very strange so I had to try it each 2.75 ounce bag costs $5.99 and they come with one of these fresh packets to keep the candy from getting sticky this package is the variety pack and I thought it was a good idea to get this one because then I can try all the different flavors and look at all the cool designs they come in different shapes and sizes somewhere kind of skinny and some are a little bit wider they start out hard in your mouth and then they dissipate where you can crunch them without hurting your teeth that's because of the air that is incorporated into a portion of the candy when he pulls it on the candy hook this one looks like a mug of root beer and I believe this one is a tutti frutti he adds citric acid to a lot of his fruit flavors and it really amps up the flavor and he won't know this one is called police Fox and it was inspired by Doctor Who and it looks like a little TARDIS inside this is a yummy raspberry flavor ignore my fingernails I teach elementary school and I just do my best these are black currant drops and I haven't tried black currant before I don't think but anyway these turned out to be my favorite it was the Thanksgiving leftovers that actually made me bite the bullet in order from lofty pursuits this time couldn't imagine how you could make Thanksgiving food tastes good in a candy so we're gonna try these he made a bunch of image candy and it was so successful that it sold out so quickly that he made it into drop form and he calls them leftovers to be sold after Thanksgiving this one was either cranberry or apple pie and it has sort of a cinnamon eat flavor there's also a merlot in there some I think this one was the buttered corn and it tasted okay it had a buttery flavor with a touch of corn this one I'm pretty sure was peach cobbler can't really go wrong with peach cobbler this one is honey baked ham and yes it tastes like you're sucking on a piece of ham and it sort of lingers in your mouth for a while too I didn't like it at first but it kind of grew on me this one has to be the pecan pie and it was really sweet and caramel II it was okay I guess but this one had to been the stuffing and I could not even finish this one I think it had garlic in it and celery powder I don't know if I got all the flavors that were available but I think this one was a sweet potato casserole and my husband recognized it right away and he liked it so that was kind of a fun little adventure for the taste buds I put them in a candy jar with a couple fresh packets and they didn't really last that long because we ate them pretty quickly so a big thumbs up for lofty pursuits these are fun beautiful colors and some wonderful flavors so I highly recommend thanks for watching", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "SfBJ-VyVLl0": "this is a recipe for hard rock candy the kind fat are bite-size pieces that are covered in powdered sugar the first thing you'll need to do is to pour some powdered sugar over some parchment paper in a baking pan and spread that out and make grooves in the powdered sugar you can make the grooves as little or as big as you want in a saucepan for 2 cups of granulated sugar one and a half cups of white corn syrup and one and a half cups of water now this is a pretty big recipe you can have the batch if you want a smaller amount but I decided for this one I'm going to experiment a little bit by using some different flavors now wipe down the sides of your saucepan with the little wet towel to help keep it from sugaring I made the batch big because I wanted to use watermelon cinnamon and a nice oil which sort of tastes like liquorice I'm also going to use green blue and red food coloring and citric acid to make the watermelon sour now this is going to cook for about 30 minutes gives a candy thermometer or a laser thermometer till it reaches 300 degrees i heated up 2 extra small pans and separate them out into three different portions one two three in the first little pan I'm trying out some a nice oil and I'm not going to use a lot of it because it's just a small amount and it'll steam up a little bit I had it a couple drops of blue food coloring and mix that up pretty quickly whoo and then I added some cinnamon oil and this steams up pretty good and be careful with the cinnamon because it can get really spicy and it also can seem up a lot and I'm gonna color this one right so if you want to make the three different flavors you have to work pretty quickly and so this third pot I'm making the watermelon now if you want to make it sour out of touch of citric acid but at it only when it's a little cool because you don't want the citric acid to burn otherwise it just completely ruins it the watermelon oil turned it pink for a while but then it turns yellow so I added a little green to make it some type of color once you have all your flavors mixed pour them into tubular shapes over the powdered sugar and when the candy is still just a little soft but starts to harden up you can use a pair of scissors and make little bite-sized pillows they're a lot smoother on the mouth then the broken cracked kind the powdered sugar helps keep the candy from sticking together this is great to make at Christmas time for little gifts or just to suck on whenever you need something sweet but don't want to eat a big old candy bar anyway thanks for watching [Music]", "DiLc2xUQxWA": "[Music]", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "X4iquNQgpJg": "[Music] so here I have the grapes I have them soaking in some cold water and vinegar and then I'm going to let them soak for a few and rinse them off and boom Gill has some cream so I never seen anybody do these grapes before with like sprees or nerds so I want to try something different so I have those candies as well as Charlie Ranchers and warheads and then we have sugar and corn syrup and you're going to also need water so you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of sugar 1/4 a cup of corn syrup and 1/4 a cup of water so you want your mister to get to a good boiling point like a rolling boil when it starts to slow down that's when you want to pay attention well you want to be paying attention majority of time but when you hear it slowing down that's definitely when you need to pay attention you want sure mister to get to about two hundred and ninety degrees so at this point I'm going to chop down my candy basically granulate my candy I'm gonna do that with three other sets of candies I'm gonna leave the nurse alone because they're pretty much smaller and that's where we're gonna continue to do and we're almost done so definitely look at it to make sure it's the consistency that you wanted here I had to end up grinding it some more it's to get it to consistency than I want it and there you go so I am not washing it in between uses because if I was to wet this it would be a complete waste and all the candy would be stuck now at this point we are adding in the goods the flavor so I use tropical punch they see me adding in my white gel color and then I am going to add in my blue out of my white first this so it can make my secondary color very vibrant all right so now we're ready to dip so I have all that candy to the side up right I'm gonna take that skewer with the grape on it put it in roll it and roll it in the candy and it's just that simple ladies [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so at this point I needed Siri Mount Mike and email me not candy melt but my candy concoction and Here I am at a better angle so you guys can see me a lot clearer so here I am I'm pushing down they came to solution down so that edged up the pot so I'm going to take this great as I said I already had them prepared on the skewers it's going to take to secure dip it in the candy and roll it sometimes the great soil falls all you have to do is take your skewer or your toothpick press the bank don't press it all the way through irelia my god previously said I like to cover half of the great if you would like to cover your full grade you can all right now I'm just gonna take it and roll it and a candy I don't wanna Simon gonna take the off the squirt that's a little problem came here but you can pull up and we do have those no problem Oh drier very quickly miss pulled off so I'm going to pull this off the skewer and then I'm just gonna cover that all in it candy look at that [Music] [Music] so here I was getting a little paper towel off my grade and I'm gonna dip it it don't do what I'm doing here I don't want you guys to bring yourself I've been doing this for years and I know I can get a better better handle of the grain by doing it like that but please don't do this if it's your first time LT KB or making candy give yourself a raise [Music] that I uses we're an oil strap of much flavor she also has other flavors in make sure you guys click that like button subscribe comment and keep on following I got work [Music]", "-7N80ptxDCk": "hi everybody it's Brad with big family homestead and in this video we are making candy sweet awesome simple easy candy so let's get to it that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "5Sg7WP8ai_M": "today kevinator I have two different Jolly Rancher items to try for you they show

make up one more batch those all air bubbles it's actually oil bubbles suppose from das orange they've already been added the Flavor Flav now the neat thing about this is I don't have to change the flavor all over the table he don't have to be a flavor saver literally a favorite shape itself that's what I call my mustache meet the flavor savor gosh did you save any flavor yesterday yeah what you save baby baby baby for later mmm-hmm one o'clock so there's tomorrow flavors be easily be done with this by I think you a330 hmm cuz then I can pack some up and put it on the shelf I just wish I knew somebody with a camera that could take a picture of that pile when it's all mixed up with a pretty cool shot and every batch is different so this won't be yeah and that the batch we're doing today will be different from the one we did we're like what two weeks ago one week ago this and usually yeah usually you guys only do one one day of hard job yeah and then it sold out in like what two weeks maybe less is the interweb people the interweb people I liked a lot but if you could take us still yeah that would be swell cuz you're the guy how'd you know I have a camera looking right at me see you had to take things are not moving pictures you take still pictures no I can't stand still for you well be accurate representational like all ours well you did that a purpose on purpose fishing for compliments we better try really hard then hey Brad to the bone I'm gonna take my stride how do you feel that I just cleaned these petals off to the tune of jingle bells okay let's see how much color I can get on the table this time choppers got month did this duck yeah you're right it will hmm I didn't wrong this time I hope so okay if I need any tech support did you get left and right sock on today I got check my feet first [Music] you're good good things don't get sugar good thing boy boy thank you didn't get away from you and every done I mean it all hard candy yes no chocolate we mean it oh yeah except for Saturday yeah that's already been oh yeah and then maybe like another day next but then that's it oh yeah are you guys still doing more peanut brittle okay then the only reason we didn't do more recently is because we don't have anyone to put it hmm don't have any room to put those big cases so we're gonna pack that up because basically we made three batches we solved that already huh so make three more but we knew we had to make more don't don't see chocolate-covered peanut brittle because then that's all they're gonna want cuz that's like the best thing ever it's true but don't talk about it cuz some think you should take it hopefully by the time you see this vid it'll be made yeah they're gonna want that for sure mm-hmm I bet last year normally we do like a half a batch covering chocolates to say 17 pounds ish this year we measure just do a full batch not mess around cuz if Craig does a video about it actually if you are out of town I'll just do an iPhone video yeah and what do I put that in the drop box sure email to me video will drive I think can hold up to 10 to 15 gigabytes and I think email isn't gonna handle that much well I think if you try to email it'll automatically sent to Google Drive if you try to do it through your Gmail account okay so Senate through G that makes sense because I already be on my iPhone anyway yeah yep until you do it and then I'll be able to edit it on my new laptop that's coming in today yep and when I'm out of town I can still work on the youtubes I love my job well I think you probably love your boss the best yeah you're the best boss you ever had mm-hmm you really get you yeah I really do and I don't mean to get all sappy but thank you thank you guys for watching all my ads and whatnot because if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be able to do what I do that's true you'd have to go to work where you wear pants yeah you know hey I'm wearing pants cause it's cold it's only because I have to shoot a video and I'm just adding and why I'm not going anywhere today yeah that is a big strength you can make a two-tone snap that was plenty joke I don't think dad got it what he's ignoring it's kids busy working wasn't hearing was listening I wasn't listening for what I was hearing the size of this one is that supposed to go in the hookers the other one beside whatever Oh try to take it easy and you Steve do you make anything out of it any shapes I'm gonna try to do one live never done before squid start yes Wow the leg Patrick yeah that's a good thumbnail it could be a turtle - what do you say a ghost to be a ghost yes yes alright where I put them hmm that's fine I just wish I figure out you're gonna be on the hook yeah that's all Bolger wasn't ready yet you never gonna be on the hook all right so I'll go downstairs to make sure the none shall pass hey we're on the hook right now so once we get off the hook you guys can go pass the stairs oh you guys can come down here and look at it oh yeah we just we just can't go pass through here cuz the candy is very hot we don't want to burn you guys and we don't want to mess with the candy oh yeah we're shooting a video for the youtubes do you guys mind be annihilated and I'm 1 in 9 States oh my god so you do that by my hand I see a lot of they do it would like machines right here crisscross and stuff wow that's cool go at em machine the thing is what you're thinking of right yeah yeah we wish we had one yeah sure dad does especially right now right you got teleplay Brutus I'm gonna face cinnamon sniff the air oh yeah boy check the flavors in there yeah their most recent one yeah can you dance sentiment or some sort of spice but we did do a bunch of spices before this one this is a fruit flavor it's it's a flavor really okay I'll let you near the tablet orange cream maybe at orange yeah Ranjha - do you need a tap there Steve yes okay I guess I can take it off all right you guys are free to leave the stairs Stryper cute oh you guys some walk over here to whatever whatever angle you guys want to see from my gesture I just need a space to go on here just those things that doesn't carried away a little bit yeah thank you really he can't handle it anyway so you put one of them on the side and one of them kind of like on the point yeah though you always do know what you want Hey they do what they want yeah he's an adult allegedly very orange and getting the candy canes would be made the same way and said of a chopper you just use those scissors to chop it off and then you have somebody over here just make a hook I'm just gonna put it in to exit all that stopping it doesn't matter if they got mixed in with the other ones and try one in a minute it's a little bit hot you guys think would be more high-tech than this upstairs with like oh they're making candy downstairs Brenda go soon yeah you guys ever been down here before I have when I was like you guys come pick up school tours I'm sort of the school tour yeah didn't you say when you were little you would comment school tours I convinced my one of my teachers in ninth grade different actually came those for a food nutrition class I came to my house for a field I did

Fahrenheit stuff medium hot tincture boiled down beforehand approximately 20 minutes very low simmer till it's just barely juicy this is sat it's a little bit dry use a pot scraper to get it out candy trays lightly sprayed with Pam small packet of jell-o ready put some in the sugar as it's boiling not all of it just some pock scraper is very effective especially in the stride out state do not lose the pot scraper I have a rata added the first amount of tincture that I showed you the other amount is waiting just gonna do some bubbling and boiling you don't have to stir it constantly but it's a good idea to stir it regularly already at 2:26 this candy thermometer has a cover that has a guide on it candy on the right hard crack 302 Fahrenheit I was previously only going to 250 275 which got you somewhere between fall and soft crack the fall is going to be chewier the hard crack is going to be just like a hard candy it'll start looking a little bit frothy that's alright it's normal just keep doing the stirring a little bit we're already at 236 within a couple of minutes try to scrape the edges every once in a while to keep it all incorporated it's going to get a little bit thicker keep going we're almost 300 first put the teacher in still won't but it'll break down with stirring it turn down a little bit we got a little too hot out of jell-o try not to fling it around in the pot that's pretty much what you put on the sides you're not going to get off keep it on the heat you can lower the heat a little bit keep it on the heat so that you can keep stirring the jello in just be in the pot looks like like super sure to get all the edges and top bottom so you know you got all your jello and your team's you're mixing okay scoot over you did hurry to try and get as much of it out of the pot as you can before it starts doing the stringing crap nothing but once it's in the tray let it cool a little bit where you start spreading it other ways you get that so it's best to try and pour it across this mold as best you can so you don't have to mess with it a lot still a little warm spreading that as it gets cold or cooler it's easier to just push around where you want places where it slowly I'm just kind of try to get rid of the lines these are it's not a big deal for your personal use but if you're gonna sell it these are harder to deal with it's not square it's harder to make them all level just don't look as nice but if you're starting with this tray you will probably get closer to looking nicer like that rather than the partial pour where you don't really know how much fill of your mold you just on a poori so these are a little bit thick and sloppy looking you try and mash them down but as they get cooler they're just gonna snap off Chrome's like that", "Xm5vD98KKQU": "Welcome to Rosie's Tea Party Show. Today we're going to do sugar coated grapes. This recipe is really easy for kids. First we need purple grapes. You can use green grapes but it looks prettier with purple. You'll need two kinds of sugars.  The crystals and the granules. These are the crystals.  They're bigger.  You \n can get these at the bulk food barn. Or where ever they sell things to decorate cakes. These are sugar granules.  This is the \n sugar that most people use for baking. There are two ways to make the sugar stick to the grapes. One way is with egg white. The other way with apple juice. Some people don't want to eat raw egg white. That's why I'm going to show you how to do it with apple juice. First I'm going to show you how to do it with egg white. This part you might need a big person to help. My cousin Guppy is here to help. Hi Guppy.\nHi Rosie. I need some egg white.  Can you help me?\nSure. You hit the egg on the side of the bowl. When you get a crack, you put your \n fingers in and pull the shell apart. Perfect! You get the white part and the yolk. This isn't exactly white but they call it white. The white part is what we need.  We don't need the yellow part. So we need to separate these two Guppy is going to help me separate them. I'm going to use a spoon that has holes in it. You have to be very careful not to break the yolk... or else it won't come out as easy. You want to let the white part drip off. We don't need the egg yolk so let's put it in here. Pour the egg white in the big bowl. CLUNK! \nOoops!  You're not suppose to put the bowl in too. Take a bunch of grapes... dip it in the egg white... and then... put it in the crystals Don't they look pretty? Now we're going to show you how to do it with apple juice. Pour some juice in a bowl... We're going to use the green grapes this time. We're going to dip it in the granule sugar. Make sure you get it well coated like this. They look so yummy! These grapes will be perfect for our tea parties. That's it for sugar coated grapes.  Bye for now. Hey!  That's for the tea party!  Stop eating them all! Ay. Yummy!", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "P6PJeQHZ_sM": "hi I'm Margie for Marjorie's candies and welcome to my kitchen today we're going to make old-fashioned butterscotch hard candy and what you'll need to get started is two cups of sugar a quarter of a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of butter and I melt that before I get started 2 tablespoons of water and 2 tablespoons of vinegar and I have a little mold and I can pour some to make some little squares of butterscotch candies and then I have some sticks so I'm going to use for lollipops and you're going to want to put a little butter on that matter of fact I'll do that right now with my little knife what I have here is how can we help you in the end it is lollipops also take a little bit ok so I'm going to add this to my pot first of all that's the bottom of course I think it will just TSP and I took out and then I'm going to in here is two tablespoons of the water and two tablespoons of the vinegar then it's a quarter of a cup of corn syrup Eddie and the sugar that's two cups of sugar one of the little corn syrup that was stuck there okay with a spoon I'm just going to gently when I make candy I think I've mentioned this before I always stir from the outside and to keep the to keep the crystals of sugar from sticking to the side of the pot you really want this to come to a boil before and I'm sorry you want the sugar to melt before it comes to a boil whenever you're making candy sometimes when you have butter it's a little hard to tell but it could pick up your spoon you can usually see this see if there's a the butter color okay you have close and you see if you pick that up and look you don't really see any crystals in there and I don't suggest that you run your fingers through it and try to tell if you could feel them because this is pretty hot so now it's going to come to a boil we'll let it come to a boil and you're going to this this one's going to go up to 300 degrees so you want to get a candy thermometer so you know after that means that before it burns actually you'll be able to tell that made about 300 we don't get it off the stove it will burn so that as hot as your kid is ever going to get a lollipop okay now you want that little bulb that little red bulb will be under the water under this solution and if you don't think that it is that it pretty much is I'm just going to boil up a little bit still you can layer thermometer flat the other direction like this and just watch it every so often just pick it up this is reached 300 okay all right so we'll take this off I'm actually going to let it just rest for a few moments rather than pouring the opposite and when you pour it on it's a little bit thick if you don't wait if you wait a little while to get it looking a bit darker and it will pour better so I'll just let it cool okay so now we've waited a little while you see how it looks a little darker and it's nice and some looks nice and smooth so I'm going to pour this into the Train I really went over this the butter because it is very very very important that you butter it because it will if you have it if you have a straight I mean an offset spatula it works fantastic on these models okay you just want to make sure they're all filled up okay okay so that's very good so we can set that aside just to get cool it takes almost a half an hour really the coolant possibly and then I'm going to take lollipop spoons and we're just going to make actually I'm going to make a little if you hold it really still it'll just make a circle and you don't need it to be tremendous okay and you put your Spears stick and just give it a little a little twist there we go okay and you just keep doing that hold it real still and they will get see when you wait a little while for you can give it a little roll you wait a little while gets a little bit thicker so it just holds up a little better rather than spreading way out wait even longer just it gets even it gets even thicker I'll wait a moment for this and I'll show you some that it even thicker a little sick or even probably could spoon it out that might be a little bit better maybe not that will spread out some you know it looks pretty bad okay just take your two things in okay so thank you very much for watching me do this and you're pretty good let me know what you think about them", "lDp71mK1mz4": "aim Allegiant how y'all doing today I'm here today to review something a little bit different Rico crown sour cherry hard candies I've never seen this before and then like I said I was that Cracker Barrel another country store name and a whole bunch of unusual chains and stuff that I've never seen I got a handful chains of snacks and sodas or pops I should say I thought might be interesting this was 99 cents which is still a little price usually need to be about 50 Cent's but how prices are nowadays and there's been around since 1953 I never seen the first time I've seen it before though made for my counter candy huh now Great Neck New York so let's go in homeless and they said these are individually wrapped I'll try one of these hard candies something individually wrapped is pretty good okay Wow okay okay cool and then in terms of wrap in here I don't know how many even rajul candy started their mind meals like life savers I remember they used to have stuff for the bet and they'd give me a many give you like a thing of like in this type of life savers or something like that and this is what the individual wrapping looks like pretty cool it's got the regal crown right there in the traditional wax paper okay remind me still takes me back to life let's talk about the army before and Kingdom was contraband in the basic training and also well not that much after that you know I mean the IT and stuff but I mean Bay Street it was contraband and people were getting they said you're a lot to have cough cough so people were buying up the Smith Brothers cherry cough drops I don't know that's what this is gonna taste like darn they had like they're wrapped and in rap but they had like a big little blocked with wrapped in a wax paper something like this and then you have like two coughed up some cool so here's what it looks like let's see if it's any good kind of like what you expected to taste like you remind me of the Smith Brothers cough drop a little bit but those were more bitter with the more a little more medicine taste is more like a candy type thing not bad I'm not good at reduce our candy review why not I give I give the roll crowd sour cherry hard candies mmm seven times pretty much what you think it'd be I get Danny Green so

caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "7ByIlrav5o4": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi y'all we're gonna do THC infused strawberry starburst cannon shoes start with

but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you where the [ __ ] is another [ __ ] guys please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it cuz always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime so don't forget the follow up [ __ ] over on Instagram this cannot underscore me cannot under [ __ ] score me alright so if you don't like the word [ __ ] mother pregnant you should probably go to another [ __ ] sample I'm gonna just tell you that [ __ ] right now alright so hitting my little uh my extreme cubing dad my weed man came through the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive that is because it was smoother than the dog [ __ ] you started on back in the day so get the [ __ ] out here so you don't get a little cannabis taste just you know manna lemon woman up and grab you chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and

This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "FYsqZXHVnI8": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida where we make hard candy today we're gonna make some crystal flour candy this time in the shape of a sunflower this batches flavor will be honey this was made originally as a custom order for a wedding but we like the results so much we thought we'd show you it and start making it at lofty pursuits for a little while [Music] the table were pouring the hot sugar on is a special table from the late 1800s it was made specifically for this and we're going to be stirring in our food coloring and adding it we're gonna do this before the table cools the candy down to the point we needed to we needed to behave like a clay not like a liquid we use small wooden spoons to stir in the food coloring and let the water boil off that's in the food coloring this keeps the candy from getting sticky our color pellet today will have three colors brown yellow and green this is a part of our crystal candy series that we started earlier this year [Music] none of the candy is cooled a bit we're gonna cut the colors apart and then fold them on the cooling table to even out the temperature within each piece [Music] sunflowers are fascinating plants and they have attracted the attention of everyone from painters like Van Gogh to scientists one of the reasons I think people like them is they all face the same way in a field it's not one sunflower it's a bunch of them that are amazing and they all face the same way because they are Gila tropic this means they follow the Sun so as they turn to the Sun they all turn in time with each other to like a slow dance of flowers and their petals all open up and they're out they are looking at you sort of like faces and this is one of the things that make them cool and we're gonna try to capture this in our candy and now it's time for me to use the candy makers hook on this I'm gonna take the yellow candy fold it over and pull it again and again to trap air bubbles this is gonna change the nature of the candy it's gonna change its texture and increase its surface area with these little air bubbles this makes it taste better when you eat the candy it's also going to make the color brighter and while it doesn't appear so on this video yet the brightening happens after the candy cools off it's more noticeable the color change when I pulled the brown sugar because I'm going to need to Center the little seeds to be lighter than the outside and when I pull that you'll be able to see its color change as I pull I [Music] mentioned earlier that I needed some green candy too and I haven't made me yet I'm gonna make it on the heating table you see I need such a tiny amount of green if I try to make it on the cooling table the color would spread and I'd end up with more green than I could use so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a little bit of a hot clear candy and add just a drop of green food coloring in it I've done this too a pocket inside the candy and I'm going to fold that over again and again with the pocket sealed and it's gonna sculler this candy besides the sunflower being the only flower that has the name flower in its name it also has other peculiar characteristics it's actually not one flower but a group of flowers if you think of it each flower only makes one seed and a sunflower has a Fibonacci sequence of a spiral of seeds in it when it's done and we end up having multiple seeds in each seed as a flower and those are tiny flowers in the center of the head of the sunflower the yellow petals we think of as the petals of the sunflower are called rays and each of them are a special type of flower in themselves multiple flowers on the flower head I'm making the center of the flower out of a group of cylinders the center of the cylinder is pulled lighter Brown candy and the outside wrap is a dark brown candy the nice thing about candy is I can do multiplication with it in other words I'm going to pull one long log out and cut it in half and keep on pulling it and cutting it it'll get thinner but it'll make all the cylinders that I need and they'll all be roughly the same size [Music] and now to make the raise around the head of the sunflower I'm gonna do this by making one large block of yellow gonna put some clear on one side that's gonna act as a spacer to differentiate the different petals then we're going to take two cold triangles of clear and they're gonna shape the top of the petals as best as I can now I'm only going to make one giant petal and then I'm gonna stretch it and cut it in half and then I'll have two and I'm gonna continue to repeat this until I have enough to wrap around our seeds [Music] you can try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.ppsd.com flowers are native to North America there are two varieties native to South America and because of that it's become the state flower of Kansas but it's been exported and it grows beautifully in some other countries it's actually the national flower of the Ukraine and the Ukraine over there grows more sunflowers and produces more sunflower oil than any other country in the world [Music] all the fluff to do is put on the final wrap but it went into the final wrap I make a clean square edge and I add my green so when I roll it up will have a stem on our sunflower I know I took some liberties here with the brown sunflower seeds real sunflower seeds are black if they're used for oil and blocking gray striped if they're used for eating but gray doesn't show up well in candy and I thought the brown would look better and now to our new piece of equipment to Thomas Mills batch roller well it's new to us they started making this model around 1895 I've got a catalog page from an old catalog from before it and when I found that I was very happy it has been able to do what it was advertised to do back in the late 1800s increased my productivity we can now make more candy with the same number of people and what it does is it rolls the candy it does the job that I used to do there is some templates I have located under those mats I used to protect my table feel carefully you'll see that we're getting ready for candy cane season and those are templates for making candy canes we're not going to be using those today now we have to pull the log of candy into Roth's and I've been calling them rods but the industry term for them is canes this term was borrowed from the glass industry where canes a glass were pulled and cut into beads using a similar technique called Miller Flores I want to take this time to apologize to you for not putting on a video lately we've been very busy making candy and we've been doing a lot of work preparing for a Kickstarter campaign which is now over and was quite successful we're gonna be traveling around the country to shoot some really cool candy making videos for you and if you didn't know about the Kickstarter campaign and want to find out what we're gonna do just go to Kickstarter and check us out I want to personally thank you for all the unbelievable support through that Kickstarter campaign we're gonna be able to do things I never thought we could afford to do thank you so much [Music] the last step of the process is to cut it into pieces and then we can go for the quality control check fortunately I have a group of people here who are happy to volunteer to be my quality control checkers [Music] I think this may be the first time that when somebody saw my candy up close they were actively unsure if they should eat it or just save it as a piece of art [Music] we appreciate you watching our video today if you liked our candy and want to try it for yourself you can go to our website www.youtube.com and Twitter too and if you ever come to Tallahassee we'd love to see you in person we call our candy public displays the confection because we do it in front of the public and you can come ballet we don't make candy all the time but we do make a lot of it and you can see us make candy in Tallahassee thank you for watching you", "xFUysDX_TWI": "hey Kenan mommies I'm just checking in I had the other B H oh but I think it's what it's called I can't remember this very moment yeah so no I overlay my favorite it was really really really chewy like it was a hard candy than a soft candy which I mentioned before is not my favorite which if you're into her candy she might be your thing but as some of us mentioned it even look kind of awkward when I was eating it like it was definitely a little big for my liking overall the medicated aspect of it I mean I didn't really get a lot out of it I don't know maybe if her candies are not my way to get medicated it seems that the brownie has been the only thing that's giving me a really good kick yeah I also have a really high tolerance I've noticed so that could be the other reason why but if you ever lower lower tolerance maybe these could be something that you could try and let me know if they work for you because they definitely didn't really work for me whatever reason but I'd love to hear your feedback on it and if someone else had a different experience maybe let me know I don't know very odd it's not even like I was eating a whole bunch before that they would maybe get absorbed I did also mention that I am on my period so that has been known to have a little bit of an effect with females well a lot of effect apparently because apparently we need to smoke a lot more and consume a lot more when it is her time of the month for whatever reason thank you mother nature but yeah overall they were bad I went about get them again no probably not um as I said I'm just all about the soft I just keep saying brownie I really wanted to be a brownie apparently it's the fudge I really really like the fudge so far that has been my favorite but yeah I have a few more things to try so stay tuned and hopefully I'll be able to get some more stuff and keep reviewing I also do have another exciting interview coming up possibly later on early next week I'm in the process of kind of putting together that review because it's a little bit longer and I'm kind of getting that one together but I'm first gonna do an unboxing of it yeah stay tuned and if you have any questions or any

you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true and stay unique bye Mase hope you enjoyed the video my friend", "MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and

we'll check you guys out on the next video", "seNQ8rexqKM": "[Music] untamed fruit flavor Jolly Rancher [Music]", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below"}
