{"frtCoP6TLas": "[Music] [Music] what's good YouTube family it's a boy CBG smoke doctor back with another review today's review is gonna be on the final call from stick live and this is a premium flower guy so we're gonna see how premium it really is alright so for everybody that is in quarantine thanks for tuning thanks for watching the videos guys I know you guys are kind of bored at home probably with nothing much to do so I'm gonna try to get job guys as much content as I possibly can hey guys so with that being said let's get into the phosphate lung for fun finally a kid we go guards so this is the packaging okay which I like I love being able to see the flower mmm now this one has a nice strong smell I mean but it smells very very very sweet you spit this out here so y'all guys could get a good look at it okay so now the smell is building in the moon smells really first - so I had this full moon Wow and it still hasn't dried out I had it for about a month maybe I think ma'am guys so because these are one of my personal favorite companies when I are smoke I'm not on Canada gonna review for you guys this has been about my personal favorites I mean all the flowers are consistently good so you have to find out if this continues the trend cuz I haven't smoked this one and I gotta see I just opened up the better so let's get right on into it so as far as this flower here we've got that green but do we got that purplish color it's a it's an awesome smell only thing like I always say it could be turned a little better I like the size of the nose these are nice guys as you can see this one is one of the darker ones with lots of purple in it but it does smell great alright so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do tarragon some close up so y'all can see this for yourselves [Music] okay guys so y'all have a chance to view it just as I do right here in front of me so the flowers not that bad looking like I said I just wish to trim games a little better but I can't go play the bar you're gonna test out the quality so let's get some of this gonna run some of this up and once again this is the frosted line from fern Valley oh hey moisture level seems to be on point where as that is not dry and it's not too damp so the moisture level is great no seeds were in this batch here so that's a flux and I just got to let you guys know guys I'm doing put the information on the bottom video check out the price for these viii it's unbelievably does I need to go check out prices head to the website check out the prices cuz they do a really well with the pricing guys alright that's another reason why maybe you know listen man I like to I like to order from those guys when I'm not shooting telling me man save me some money so here we go guys gonna load up the glass pray [Music] that's nice giggles Oh change guys lost in love yeah so it had a sweet floral smell to the flower and when you light it in you're smoking it has a fresh citrus citrus taste to [Music] the smoke is a heavy at all this nice and smooth anybody that likes that a really small smoke this way is good really small as you can see it's no dark dank oh no but I'm getting tons of flavor it's tasty bats it really is a tasty smoke [Music] oh yeah but what I like about it the effects is almost meaning like those three poles that are took off the fight I'm already feeling it right spot Carmelo my body started to warm up just a little bit [Music] yeah yeah very very smooth that's very smooth I like this mm-hmm nice and tasty with the smoothness to it but it still hits so I like that a lot guys so good job to my peoples all that are valid forms as flowers definitely one in the top down I have to remove that Chardonnay and I have to remove the Chardonnay have to remove the Chardonnay from our second best because this one is like a complete balance a laptop a CD stood still my top choice got a CBC name delicious guys delicious step frosted lovin is just under has a nice amount of CDP in it so that guys that you know so for France I mean suffer from whatever it is you suffer from whatever right and of course is in the desert when 3% easy threshold that means legal that's wise alright so CBD smoke knock this signing out right now so I'll see you guys soon peace you [Music] [Music]", "qgssYNSMheg": "hello everyone welcome back to my video in this channel today I'm going to show you how to comfort round 2 cups so the question is a Coastie cups how to confer it alright here's the question accounts equals how many cup alright this is the question section now we are moving to the formula before we answer the question we need to know the formula so we use an us standard for the formula between owns in cup so one fluid ounce equals 0.125 cup you need to maybe you need to remember that but I don't I don't ask you to my because if you already understand the concept then there's nothing need to be remember memorize I mean alright here's the answer section first we write down the question again like arms equals how many cup and then this is the formula just like what I wrote before one ounce equals 0.125 cup and this is how we answer the question first to aunt to answer this question first we need to put this formula 1 ounce I call this number 2 here alright so this is the formula and then because you have a right here then you must put the egg in the left side of the equal sign and then in the right side of the equal sign so you multiply 1 ounce with a and 0.125 car with a alright so 8 times 1 equals egg bounce and 0.125 cup time a equals one cup so this is the answer of the question that's all it's very easy right alright everyone thank you for watching my video please if you like this video if you loved this video

excited today about what we're gonna do is anything I've done in a while it's winter time late winter here in south Louisiana and the fishes just not the best right now it's going to get a lot better soon but right now it's just tough well a great thing to do in the off season is to figure out what your lures look like underwater we all kind of wonder that as we're fishing right you wonder what are the fish seeing what's making fish hit what's making them perhaps not hit well getting some lures on a swimming pool will teach you a lot about how your lord looks when you do certain things with the rod not only that but how different weights of jig heads and and different lures look differently underwater well today we're going to show you some of that I'm gonna put some GoPros in the pool I'm as excited to learn what you're gonna learn today is anybody because this is going to teach me as much as it's going to teach you and I can't wait to do it so what we got here is a long punching rod got braided line on it nice and strong and what I did is I tied it to a stick inside of a traffic cone on top of the traffic cone I have a clamp with a GoPro I'm gonna lower this into the water and that will provide us a great perspective on how these lures look underwater now look this pool hasn't been used in months it is loaded with leaves it looks like a swamp but at least the water still clean so that's going to tell us all we need to know I'm excited to do this I really can't wait alright so I got the camera on I'm just gonna lower it into the water [Music] [Music] I guess the hardest part is going to be getting it angled correctly yes it is there we go perfect all right that's gonna work it's gonna work well [Music] here in south Louisiana everybody fishes soft plastic paddle tails with various jig head weights very popular weight is 3/8 ounce because it really kind of works well in depth of 10 feet or more maybe even eight feet or more but I've definitely found over my career that lighter jig heads work better in certain situations so I really want to see how a bait looks differently underwater jig depending on the heaviness of the jig head so I'm starting with the 3/8 ounce jig head this is a limbo sliced colored matrix shad one with a real bright color bait so you could see it underwater so let's see how it looks [Music] all right so obviously we're we're recasting right now is about four feet that's not exactly real-world if I was fishing for feet I would never go with the 3000 you can see how that beach is barely hops off the bottom this is how my rod motion would be if I was fishing this bait I would not be moving at much at all I'd just be kind of crawling it [Music] all right so what everybody knows is that fish tend to bite a lure on the fall so you want that lure falling as long as possible and slowly as possible so it's really tantalizing on the way down so I'm gonna do I'm a cash right in front of the camera lens so you can see this bait as it's falling and see how good it looks and that's the look that you really want so now we're gonna see how differently the lure looks we put this exact same bait on a 1/8 ounce jig head all right so here we go with the 1/8 ounce a lot lighter jighead let's see how it looks in front of the camera okay one thing that immediately jumps out at me and I wasn't expecting this this bait is falling so slowly with this 1/8 ounce weight that the tails not even flapping on the way down I almost kind of think that's gonna hurt you [Music] look at that it looks almost like a dead stick just falling down on the water with a lot less tail action now a positive is that when I do retrieve the bait it stays up and falls much more slowly so there is a longer duration of the fall than with the 3/8 ounce but the tail action again is just not as good even on those Falls the initial fall as well as the hops all right so my research is definitely paying off and I got to tell you my hypothesis is proven to be a little bit inaccurate because I thought what was going to happen is that this law is gonna look a lot better on a 1/8 ounce than a 3/8 ounce and it really kind of doesn't it doesn't look as good now the fall rate is a lot slower and there will be times obviously that's going to help you but I like that tail action on the 3/8 ounce and you know this dissipate in general has a great deal amount of tail action so it's not like it's just a stiff bait that needs a lot of weight to make it move so still it's going to be some trial and error with fishing locations obviously you never want to throw a twenty thousand in swift current areas or in very very deep areas and I have had fishing trips where we did much better on on lighter jig heads than on heavy jig heads but I don't know I think I kind of sold the 3/8 ounce short a little bit I'm uh I'm more client to use it in the future even a little bit shallower water alright so it wasn't planning on doing this I was only going to do an eighth and a 3/8 but my mind is so blown I want to see what happens on a quarter ounce so we're gonna go right in the middle with a quarter ounce weight and see how that changes the motion of the bait all right first cast with the quarter ounce I'm truly excited to see what happens here Wow okay not a lot of tail accident on that either definitely better than the three than the one eighth but not like we had not like we have with the three eighth not at all really really slow fall and look let's be honest it's not only the tail action of a bait that attracts bites it's also how you work it but that tail action definitely can be a difference maker on tough days [Music] okay so let's see if the next axiom is also this Peru everybody knows breed has no stretch Manos got a lot of stretch so when you're fishing with parade a slight movement of the rod tip it has a big impact on the bait fishing with mono you can be much more whippy with the end of that rod it's gonna have less of an impact on the bait so I'm going to make casts with braided line of course I got a fluorocarbon leader tied on gonna make some other cast with monofilament and see how the motions of the right tip impact the bait underwater you [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I think I know what that footage is gonna show but I'm gonna discover it when you do I can tell what I'm feeling here when I'm fishing definitely that mono is way spongy err but how much does it really affect that bait underwater all right the last pool check is gonna be weight of a jig head under a cork I am a big believer then use an extremely light jig heads when fishing under a cork because that bait falls so much more slowly looks much more like a shrimp and I think almost all the time speckled trout and redfish even bass and our coastal marshes I think they think they're feeding on shrimp even though what we're throwing them our paddle tail soft plastics you want it falling as slowly as possible but I really want to see I'm excited to see how quickly these baits fall with the various jig heads so what I'm gonna start with here is a quarter ounce really nobody fishes a 3/8 ounce under cork if you do that's really overkill but I got a quarter ounce here what I generally fish myself is a 1/16 ounce so I want to see the difference and how that looks underwater let's go check it out [Music] [Music] [Music] man that was so much fun I learned a lot just even watching the Lord's in the pool but I really can't wait to get home and check out the footage now obviously I had one of my tenants of my fishing philosophies kind of blown or at least I think I did I'm gonna get home and see if I did but another one was absolutely confirmed no doubt in my mind fishing those lighter jig heads under corks is a lot better now guessing the underwater footage is going to show that this bait was producing no tail action on this one sixteenth ounce jig head look at that jig that's tiny ooh tiny but I don't think it matters because I think again that the game fish in our marshes or thinking that that is a shrimp not a minnow or Kruk or anything trying to get away from they think it's a shrimp have you seen a shrimp falling in the water column it doesn't have a whole lot of action at all just Falls and then every now and then it'll pop and that's what happens when you pop the cork it that bait jumps up and it just barely falls you got that heavy jig head on there it's going down much more quickly yeah you might have a little bit of tail action but I think that slow fall in the water column is that what really inspires them to feed my philosophy anyway I'm gonna get home and see what all this shows well that's it hopefully you enjoyed today's video if you did please subscribe to

"primary arms reached out to us and said hey have you guys tried out our 1 to 6 and 1 to 8 by 24 a CSS riflescopes we said no but we'd like to and so we did so these have bullet drop compensating for 556 308 5 4 5 & 6 5 Grendel has a CSS reticle they're very cool stick around and we're gonna tell you all about [Music] well first we'll take a look at the 1 to 8 this has got a 30 millimeter tube has 1 to 8 power magnification as a 24 millimeter objective diameter and a 30 3.2 millimeter ocular diameter field of view is a hundred and ten feet at a hundred yards at one power and 14 and a half feet at 8 power it's got one half MOA clicks has a hundred and forty MOA of elevation adjustment also the same in windage it's ten and a half inches long weighs nineteen point four ounces with the lens covers it has an illuminated reticle that's fast focus eyepiece second focal plane it's waterproof nitrogen purged fog resistant fully multi-coated it's made out of 60-63 aluminum uses one cr2032 battery to illuminate the reticle the reticle is visible even if the it's not illuminated has flip up covers included and has a lifetime warranty that's right and the one two six which is very similar is actually going to be about a half inch shorter it too has a thirty millimeter tube Bandler as i said before this is a 1 to 6 X the objective diameter is 24 millimeters with the ocular diameter being 33 point to the exit pupil is going to be 9 to 4 millimeters eye relief three point three to three-and-a-half inches which is really good we like that longer eye relief field of use 110 feet at a hundred yards 19.3 at a hundred at 6x click values on this are gonna be half an inch as well total elevation of adjustment and windage are gonna be a 140 MOA the weight of this is 18 point 1 ounces with the lens covers it has a red partial lumination fast eye focus it's also second focal plane waterproof nitrogen-filled Bob resistant fully multi-coated again the same 60-63 aluminum and also uses the cr2032 battery we can take off the knobs for the wind and for the elevation you'll see underneath the windage we actually have a spare cr2032 battery which is very cool has no special tools needed for this half click mo a very nice firm click so you know exactly where you're at on this on the opposing side we do have the set intensities for the illuminated reticle on this you're gonna find that on this model that we have 11 clicks of intensity let's talk about the acss reticle here we've got the manual here and over here on the right we have an auto ranging thing now this is gonna this is assuming that your average target is 5 foot 10 inches tall and if you put his feet right there then if he's that tall then he can ride this ride but he's also at eight hundred yards that would be seven hundred yards that is six five four if we move over here we see that the reticle is 18 inches wide and at a hundred yards it's important to note that all of this will be done it at full magnification any of the calculations so at the highest power it's a second focal plane so this would be the point is our 100-yard zero and then we have our three hundred yards zero 400 yards zero five hundred yards six hundred seven hundred and down to eight hundred yards now this compensates for a whole wide range of rounds that would fit into those trajectories so the average targets chest is 18 inches wide if we can also come over here and these will also correlate to 18 inches so if the targets obscured you don't know how tall it is but you can see how wide his chest is you can estimate the range by holding this up here and then you just pick your zero here these are wind drifts these dots that's assuming an average wind this turn the page here talk about moving the target these two dots on the reticle would be for leading a vehicle or a person moving at 8.6 miles an hour running speed this would be 3.1 miles an hour would be to hold to the outside of the circle these dots are assuming a 5 mile an hour wind so there's a lot of function packed into this reticle I like it alright so we have mounted up the 1 to 6 with the a CSS reticle on the opt of view of ghupat Ron mm so you can look through this optic with us and you can see now this is the 1 to 6 it's it's very clear edge to edge we are at 1 power you can see the reticle you can see the dots you can see that we have the reticle can get lost in the darkness and that's where the beauty of the illumination comes in turn on the illuminated reticle and we can see all of our things we are at 1 power looking at the 100-yard range right now I'm gonna zoom in to the 6 power which is the magnification that you would use all of your ranging features you can see we have a torso sized Gong there and about 18 inches yep and then let's tweak that up to the 200-yard gone so we could use that precise chevron in the middle yep we're tagging that probably like the horseshoe chevron it makes for a great fast target acquisition you can clearly see the dots on the left and the right for a leading edge if your target was running away from you at about nine miles per hour if my Gong's are running away we've got problem but we've got the tools to take care of it if they are exactly so this is the this is a one two six there's the reticle we're gonna have Eli go up there once again this isn't mounted on a rifle this is um this is mounted just on a camera mount Eli's gonna go up there and we will see what a person size target looks like through the reticle so he is about at 160 yards and that is what the reticle looks like we're gonna switch over to the 1 to 8 and take a peek through it alright so now we've switched over to the 8th power now you can see that the on the 8th power just the circle and the dot are illuminated on this on this 6 power it was all of the bullet drop compensating little staff there this one is just the dot you know one thing I really like about these Bob the hole 1 to 6 or 1 to 4 they're just really versatile and because if you just leave them on one power they operate just like a red dot with lots eye relief and really forgiving about eye position exactly and then we have the option actually on this one zooming in the 8th power so yeah 8th power it doesn't seem like a very significant amount of magnification but when you're looking at a man-sized target through this reticle on this scope it actually is pretty significant you'd have no problem making your precise shot that you needed to make if you had a miscreant that needed to be eliminated that's right let's turn this one down now one thing I did notice on the 8 power Bob is well I can't see it now I did notice a little bit of fishbowl effect at 1 power but I don't I don't see it through the camera right now but I could see it a little bit when when it was on the rifle now we're just gonna zoom in back to Eli and there we have the one to eight so we can tell because we have this little chart here we can tell that he's closer than he's either he's either a giant or he's closer than 400 yards because of our scale over here and he is taller than the the 5 foot 11 or 5 foot 10 average he's what about 6 - yes shoulder width is about 18 inches we'll turn the illumination off so you guys can see the reticle in its native state clear grill ass it's bright just a little bit of fuzziness at the very very very edges for the price point though it's pretty negligible even to relieve and mention anything but it is there so we have to say it but you know for about a $300 piece of glass it is pretty pretty phenomenal for what it is let's look further out and some longer ranges perfect all right so we've got you lay out there at about 500 yards and we put the reticle at his feet we can see that look at there the 500-yard hash mark is right there so if Eli was a bad guy then we would transfer that over here and we would use a 500-yard hash mark there was wind we would shift it left or right to the dots according to the wind he was traveling we'd also lead him but that's a that's a pretty handy feature right there if [ __ ] ever hits a fan and it comes to it if there's a bad guy it's a handy handy reticle so also here we're gonna judge how wide he is so 18 inches if we just use that 500-yard hash mark that's how that's how wide it is and that just covers it so that works pretty well so we're looking at the eighth power and here's what it looks like five hundred yards at one power we're gonna switch over to the six and do the same thing alright we're looking through the one two six right now the bridge is five hundred yards away Eli standing on the bridge we're gonna cruise increase the intensity now already blew all the way to six power there we are and once again we'll use the the range-finding reticle over here and put the bottom hash mark at his foot and the 500-yard hash mark is it about his head so then we've ranged him at 500 yards and then we have holdover hash marks that would correlate with that pretty impressive how accurate that is it is it's a that's a it's a dandy radical really now we're looking further out and a thousand yards and such that's a quick look at the a CSS reticle through the primary arms 1 to 6 and 1 to 8 let's take it into the woods where it's nice and dark so we can take a look at that reticle in darkness let's do it and here we are in the darkness of the forest just getting an idea of what this reticle looks like in the dark if you were in a forested area and needed to see a reticle as opposed to let me turn it off here it's very hard to see unless we have a white background but if we're looking through the forest it's a little bit difficult to see that reticle but we can turn it on and now we have a clear view in the darkness of where our bad guys could be hiding or a deer or a deer you know this has technical implications hunting predator all sorts of stuff that this scope can be used for very versatile and pretty clear we're gonna back this down or sorry increase this up just looking through the forest and here we are looking through the one to eight in the darkness of the forest and again you can see how the reticle can get obscured in the dark but by turning on the reticle you can see how your target can be easily acquired whether we were out here looking for a bobcat or a a bad guy hiding in the woods he would have no chance of escape using this a CSS reticle [Music] I've never only had experience with 1 to 6 and 1 to 8 you know I've got 1 to 4 exact 1 to 4 and I'm a big fan of that because of the reason it it works almost like a red dot so one power quick target acquisition right BAM but being able to increase the magnification to like 4 power which would be equal to an ACOG has always been a beauty in a deal and so that's been my go-to for quick defensive firearm right having the ability to zoom into six or eight kind of transcends that from close range to and now we can reach out and poke targets that are that are further out four or five six hundred yards exactly we could see today when we were looking at the footage of Eli when he was down five hundred yards away mm-hmm you know that was Anibal target that we can know we could definitely take and it illustrates s reticle and the functionality of it really nice so you know there's always kind of a debate or a thought if you're gonna go with adjustable turret knobs and and adjust the scope or a bullet drop compensating reticle this makes it really nice because it has a tool to estimate the range and the bullet drop compensating reticle all in one kind of a deal it makes it quick and handy and pretty easy to use you can use 18 inches long it's a body of a coyote for for a hunter from shoulder to hip on a on a larger game those kind of estimations are just really functional yeah it's the versatility whether you're a 3-gun shooter just somebody who's going out to the range or a hunter or somebody who's looking for something for home defense the 1 to 6 and the 1 to 8 definitely cover at all with the versatility of close-up or long range which we shot it saw today when we were shooting 160 yards and it was just a phenomenal scope for the price I think that they're they're a really versatile scope and they're affordable and a lifetime warranty and put out by good people so I think that I think that they're definitely worth considering if you're gonna be purchasing a scope for your AR or whatever exactly so if you've got a three hundred dollar budget you're trying to staple below keep in mind the primary arms 1 to 6 and 1 to 8 it covers all the bases hey folks you can't take back a bullet and you never ever want to wish you could so always follow the 4 basic safety rules whenever handling firearms that's right stay safe shoot straight like it and subscribe we'll see you on the firing line thanks for watching [Music] [Applause]", "ZpbLICGmIis": "hello or even one today no it's not today it's tonight tonight we're going to answer a question about math about okay stuttering measurement how many grams in an ounce okay actually already uncensored well here's the answer okay for everyone's pounds how many grams do you get okay hist equation is answer so one ounce is equal to twenty eight point three four nine five grams well let's make a question and answer it so maybe it will help us to remember that question or health hey here's an example question oh man how much is how many how much is ten ounce okay okay let's answer the question so the first thing that I need to do is to put ten you'll find it from here and multiply it with one ounce because this is amps okay and then you put it equal sign and then how much scrums that because you have ten your life must have two in the right as well okay thirty ten and we multiplied it with the basic formula just like we do with this one okay we do just the same okay tamp apply wait the number okay now to apply once equal to tan tan hours is equal to two 83.4 I'm sorry for 9.5 gram well that sounds of the question if you have any further question or anything that you want to ask me feel free to give it on

you want to go ahead and like share subscribe all the sort of good stuff if you want to support the channel and anything else I do help me buy more bullets go ahead and check out some of the links in the description but let's go ahead and talk about one of the most excellent optics if not the most excellent budget optic that you can get it's a low-power variable zoom which is pretty much my favorite style of optic and that is of course the utg I believe it's the Accu shot they're one to eight by 28 now let's go ahead and talk about a couple things that make this really really excellent so I picked up this entire package as you see it right here for 134 dollars including their mount now the mount by itself is like 40 45 dollars depending on where you're buying it from so that with the optic for 134 dollars is absolutely insane and to put my money where my mouth is I bought two of them so I have two exact ones this when you're actually got a little cheaper this one here I got from extreme tactical while they had it on sale the whole package for 125 dollars so I paid on on average about 130 dollars for these guys you can still find them for 135 like I got this guy for but generally speaking if you go to like OpticsPlanet or something else they're gonna be selling them closer to 200 dollars with shipping which is way too much or not to much I definitely think they're worth it for that money but you can find them a lot cheaper with free shipping on ebay 434 dollars you can go to extreme tactical and get it for like 120 hundred 25 right now so currently the price that they're selling for these guys is pretty crazy I would say it is the best deal on an optic if you need a low-power variable zoom that's not a 1 to 6 this is a 1 to 8 that will get into all the technical specifications of it in a little while so first up let's go ahead and talk about its features this is of course a 1 to 8 which gives you an immense amount of options it's probably the best overall magnification range for an AR style rifle unless it's a long-range precision error build like a 20 inch AR 15 or 20 24 inch ar-10 something like that where you're doing a lot of long-range or a competition shooting or something like that 1 to 8 gives you a huge amount of versatility and in 0 to 500 yards it's pretty much the best one optic solution that you can get now of course you can spend more money like a 1 to 10 or even in some cases like a 1 to 12 which is kind of a nutty range but you're gonna be spending a lot more money on those sorts of things and a 1 to 8 is perfectly acceptable for a 0 to 500 yards even out further you can definitely make shocks a lot further on steel man-sized targets that sort of thing for a long-range precision shooting you want a little bit more magnification on there when you need to be very precise with where you're putting those bullets at long range but for 0 to 500 very functional accuracy 1 to 8 is absolutely excellent for getting the job done now as you saw in the intro I have taken both of these rifles and both of these optics out to 500 yards very very easy that both very easy to get set up and get on target at 500 yards these are both MOA or sub MOA rifles with the right ammunition I use Mac tech 168 grain sierra matchking or Federal Premium I pretty much interchange them as the same round because they function the same out of both of my guns so 0 to 500 yards that's really how I use them I live in the western US I'm sorry western Washington specifically and it's really really wooded and so finding a place that you can shoot 500-700 or even a thousand yards it's very very difficult so you don't need an uber amount of magnification 1 to 8 is perfect and having that 1 X that really low end allows you to do up-close stuff as well as stretch it out to you as far as you need to a sensor now something to mention is when you get those very large magnification ranges like 1 to 8 1 to 10 you are going to start sacrificing other things in order to fit that into a single package and so we are going to talk about some of the downsides of that some of the other features of this guy really quick are we do have 36 colors for the reticle and you have a memory system on the back that you can access by pressing a couple buttons it's mostly useless I pretty much just stick to red or green but some of the colors actually do show up brighter and then some of the other ones so kind of figure out which one shows up best for you and then just set it and forget it the 36 colors is a gimmick but it's kind of there so it's interesting but not all that interesting it does come with a integral sunshade that's built into the front so it has an angle to help cut out some of the sun's reflections not really sure if it's needed but it is there it's not a quickly straight to design because this is a 30 millimeter tube with a 28 millimeter objective lens so it actually does have a little bit wider of a front end then you're like 24 millimeters or other things like that on your normal scopes which is nice that it does have that on there it does make it look a little bit less clean than your other lpv is but it still has a good overall look it is definitely actually a little bit more bulky here in the back end because it has that 36 color module back here where it changes all the colors the battery compartment is right on top very easy to get in and out of it is only filled and it is waterproof at least as far as UTG claims though I haven't tested I have taken doubt it and rain and haven't had any issues with it though I generally don't have any issues and just a light rain with many optics that I've tried it does have really nice zero resettable turrets these were extremely easy to get set up a non-target ziering with these guys very very easy it comes with all the hardware to reset them you've basically taken allen key loose up the top pull it reset it and then lock it back down you're good to go the clicks on here you can pie here are very very tactile very easy very very smooth as well especially for the low price range most the time they're very mushy and they're not they're not to precise thing but these are actually really really nice really tactile really audible have really good feedback on them and they actually track very accurately so the other day a couple days ago I took it out and I wanted to do a specific tracking test to see how well they actually track return-to-zero how when I adjust them if they actually adjust accurately and so just a couple days ago I went ahead I took this guy out and I did a tracking test with it so the ammunition that I was using for it was wolf ammunition wolf 145 grain it was just what I had on me I didn't I didn't want to take out my really expensive animal just to do a tracking test with it so I did the tracking test at 50 yards Isay rode it so I had the dial reset to zero shot a three-round group very tight again we're only at 50 yards then I raised it 10m away and the group raised five inches shot another three round group I dropped it 20m away and again it went down about 10 inches this time then I raised it back to zero sent it to the right 10m away moved over to the right about ten five inches moved it left 20 then you had of course the group on the other side a nice little group and then reset both dials and it was perfectly back in the center another three-round group and it pretty much just overlaid right on top of each other so as far as I can tell it tracks very accurately I'm not going to say that it tracks perfectly accurately every single time but it was incredibly easy at 500 yards in the videos that I have of this guy I haven't released the video of that guy out to 500 yards yet but adjusting them to zero what 500 yards was very very easy and very manageable so I wasn't really worried about oh it's not going to track accurately at that distance that I'm gonna throw my zero off and not be able to find where I'm hitting again it was very very easy to adjustable its to hit where I wanted to adjust the reticle and all honestly the tracking on here is much better much more accurate than a lot of other scopes that I've had that for the round the three hundred dollar price range I thought I missing everything it takes a long time for it to get there so now one of the things that you don't get when you throw one to eight magnification inside of a inexpensive platform is you don't get something that's slim you don't get something that's lightweight so you are definitely sacrificing in that way for instance this optic is over 10 inches it's about 11 inches long it's fairly bulky on the sides and in the rear here for the 36 color module which is again kind of a gimmick not really useful at all it is heavy at about 21 ounces by itself so almost a pound and a half by itself now the amount that it comes with is their true strength platform mount it's a great 70 71 I think it's t6 or t6 5-1-1 aluminum it's a very very strong durable mount especially for the money it has a excellent three screw mounting system that locks down into the rail and of course into the side itself so it's an excellent mount it hasn't moved whatsoever with this you could probably take a hammer - and you wouldn't be able to budget at all so I really like that about it it does also add about an inch and a half forward on your scope so you have a lot of options in terms of where you put it depending on how limited you are for rail space and I relief [Applause] now something else about the mount that does kind of go with the overall downside of the system is that it's really heavy it is a lot of aluminum on there which does add to its durability and its toughness but it's also of course going to add weight so it's a question of do you need to add that much weight to your system to for durability or why not you can definitely go with a lot of lighter mounts that are gonna save you a couple ounces on the top of your gun which can or cannot be a big deal depending on your situation now if you're using this as mostly a Prohm gun or you know just shooting out of the back of your truck or you know you only put around stone every now and again probably not a big deal but it is something to mention that this is not a small lightweight package so keep in mind you are definitely sacrificing the light weight of your build so if you already have a heavy ar-10 like this guy and you throw this optics set up on top even though it's only a one to eight it's not a super huge package like a full-size scope it is a lot of weight on the top your rifle so it makes this guy into like a ten and a half 11 pound rifle so now let's go ahead and talk about some of the other things about this guy that I really like so another thing that is excellent about this guy is the eye relief so the eye relief on this guy is three and a half to five inches so at the 1x which is what it's at right now you have an immense range of where you can put your stock or where you can set it up what you can be against where you can be putting your rifle whatever angle you're at and still have an excellent field of view the eye box is also very very forgiving especially at 1x so you can move your head left and right and up and down and still get a decent sight picture out of it it's of course nothing like a red dot you're never gonna get that open red dot look but it's pretty good especially at 1x but then of course when you're flipping it over to 8 X or I box is going to tighten up a little bit and it's going to move forward actually so that's when you're gonna get into the three-and-a-half inch range and now at the three-and-a-half inch range you still do have a good amount of forward and backwards motion but the left/right up/down all that sort of stuff on your eye box really tightens up but you still do have about an inch where you can move your head forwards and backwards and they'll have a really good sight picture so for this guy here depending on different setups it's really versatile and can go on pretty much anything so you could throw this on a really short compact build a little bit longer heavier build and you'll be pretty much good to go and of course you do also have a lot of options when it comes to the mount itself and how far you can put the optic forward depending on your situation in your build there's really only a couple of the things that we need to talk about when it comes to this guy specifically is the reticle choice this is of course a second focal plane rifle scope so if you just have to have a first focal plane you're gonna need to spend a little bit more money but this guy here is a second focal plane so that reticle is not going to change size when you cycle through the zoom ranges this guy here that I have is the BG full reticle it is the most useful reticle that they have they have like four different ones I want to say they have a mil - a mil dot a circle dot which is more of a CQB style so at 8 X it's probably not super useful and then they have this guy which is the BG 4 reticle which is designed it's a BDC so it's a ballistic drop compensation reticle it's really really open it has a very crisp 1 MOA Center dot so it's very usable out to 800 a thousand yards on there especially if you're shooting it like a 10-inch steel plate like I was so even at 500 yards it's still very very precise more than precise enough fold I'm doing with it and on top of that around your Center dot you have a lot of open space so it's very crisp very clear and very easy to put that Center dot right where you need it now on top of that when you do illuminate your reticle it only illuminates that Center dot now it's not incredibly bright but in most situations that will still show up in the day unless you're like staring into the Sun where it's super bright out then you probably won't be able to pick it up very well but in most situations it is going to be slightly illuminated and show up a little bit brighter than the rest of the reticle and of course being by itself allows it in my opinion to be a little bit faster when it's not quite so cluttered around the area and then you have also of course the windage adjustments on the left and right and of course on the bottom as well now this one specifically is set up for a 5 5 6 out to 700 yards I want to say now you can do the calculations and kind of adjust that so your 400 at this zero is actually 357 with your AR 308 or you know whatever sort of setup and barrel length that you have you can plug it in there and so you can figure out where your actual drops are instead of what they're listed on here for their 62-grain 5 six out of a 20-inch barrels when I think they have it setup for it is of course a little bit more complicated than if the reticle is just set up for 308 to begin with but it is something that you can do if you're used to doing that or have some time to play around and plug in some numbers so overall really liked that part about it now let's talk about the last thing that really is kind of the make-or-break for a optic like this so that's going to be the glass clarity overall it's light transmission and its edge to edge clarity so let's go ahead and start with the worst offender of that and that is going to be the edge to edge clarity now when you're at 1x like this you are sacrificing a little bit just because of the limitations of the optic itself so at 1x you are going to get a slight fisheye effect around the edges of the optic so when you're looking through it at 1x especially at very close ranges like here in just a little room you're gonna notice that the edges really kind of blur and kind of work the edges a little bit the edges a little bit sorry and so at very very very close range like within 10 feet it can be a little bit difficult just because when you're moving the optic around it's going to kind of warp the hole in it now the center is very flat but the edges is where most of that warping occurs an accurate way to describe it is it kind of looks like you're looking through one of the original GoPros where it's very wide but it has that huge kind of fisheye effect to it it's kind of like that not quite as pronounced but you are definitely gonna notice that around the edge of the reticle at 1x on top of that at 1x it's actually very very zoomed out so it's not of course a true 1x there really aren't a lot of true 1 X's I've never actually seen one there is still some warping and adjustments of the edge of the image versus just your naked eye but this guy is actually very close so at a hundred yards you're getting ninety nine and a half feet of your field of view which is actually really good anything from a hundred two hundred and ten is really good anything above 110 is pretty much excellent and I don't actually know of any optic off the top my head that does anything more than 120 but a hundred for a budget or value optic is really good and a lot better than what you're going to be getting out of a lot of Cheaper or even some more expensive optics so 100 is really good anything above 110 is pretty much excellent and you're pretty much gonna be good to go with so 100 is definitely adequate and it's definitely enough it is still kind of a soft one so it's more honestly probably a one-point with a little bit of a fisheye effect on it and of course with that fisheye effect that one you do lose some image quality at the edges of the reticle itself or sorry not the reticle the edges of the optic itself so when you're looking through the glass you're not gonna have perfect edge to edge clarity now the color on there is really good it's really accurate in the center everything is very bright and crisp but you are going to lose some of that when you go onto the edges but when you take this guy out to eight which is of course its maximum magnification you are going to minimize the issues and the image becomes completely flat though you do still have some loss of clarity towards the edges though it's much more minimal and much harder to tell now when it comes to an 8 X versus a 6 X so I can 1 to 6 versus the 1 to 8 the 8x is definitely a lot easier as longer ranges for instance I took this guy out there with my 16 inch ar-15 which has a 1 to 6 on it and this guy here at 500 yards much easier much closer definitely much simpler to put it the dot exactly where I want it and take that shot so overall when it comes to image quality and clarity on here though you do lose something on the about the outer 10% of the edge of your image on the inner 90% which is the vast majority of it that you're going to be using it is very clear and crisp and I haven't had any issues with it it's very comparable with other budget or mid-range optics so you're definitely not losing a lot there it's just on the edges where you're going to have a little bit of a loss of clarity and that sort of thing and especially at 1x is gonna be a little bit more pronounced but generally through most of the other ranges it's going to be very very good now when it comes to performance on this guy I'm not to say that the lights satis efficient on this guy is very very good it is a fully multi-coated optic I believe it's emerald coating on this guy and it's really really good the color on it is very flat there's not really any tinting to it so at low light which is in the second half of the intro that you saw it was pretty much at dusk so the Sun was about to set pretty dark out and this guy here performed very very well at 1x pretty much it's almost exactly like a red dot just because that Center bright when it's dark outside is very very bright and very pronounced so it makes it very easy to put those rounds exactly where you want it so when it comes to light transmission I would say this guy here is excellent when it comes to optical clarity I would say that it is very good in the center about the center 90% of your image and you're gonna lose something on the outer 10% you're gonna get a little bit of warping at 1x as well so keep that in mind but overall the image quality on this guy I would say is very good not excellent not superb you're definitely not going to compare it to a high-end optic and say oh this is pretty much the same this is definitely does have some downsides you're gonna get that when you spend only 150 $200 on a one to eight but for what you get and what you pay for I don't think that there is anything that can beat it for that price point or even double that price point so I don't think you can spend three hundred three hundred and fifty dollars and get a better optic than this guy with of course the same capabilities of one two eight one last quick thing to mention before we wrap up this video is that I have taken these guys out on about a dozen outings or so and I have put hundreds and hundreds of rounds to them probably not a thousand yet but we are in reaching that point and they have function very very well they have not lost zero they're very easy to zero with different loadings especially taking out to longer ranges doing anything else you need to do with them so durability on both of these because I did buy both has been excellent on top of that utg does have a lifetime warranty so if you shoot this guy out and it breaks you can send it in and they will replace it for you for free so all that being said I'm gonna stick with it I think that this is the best optic for the money I don't think you can spend less money and get better I don't speak to think you can spend like two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars and get a better optic setup than this guy now you might be able to find some that are lighter something that does more for you but overall this package and the amount of capabilities and versatility that this guy has is excellent for the money and actually pretty excellent in general so that's pretty much it for the video guys those thank you so much for watching I hope you all enjoyed and I will of course see you guys in the next one peace off hey you yeah you what are you still doing here the videos over wires doing here like share ed subscribe or don't the choice is yours but if you do subscribe thanks ed I like pizza peace off we have two in the red one in the bottom so I threw too low on that one but this guy here both in the red", "OksBIvXvSoI": "what's going on YouTube this is Brent Jewison 31 and this video to be talking about the a CSS or advanced combined sighting system now before I get into that let me tell you a little bit about myself I'm a staff noncommissioned officer Unites States Marine Corps I've literally served my whole career as an instrument first employed in 2003 where I took part in the initial invasion Iraq then redeploy there in 2004 where my unit engaged the Mahdi army led by Makarov solder and then job cemetary then deployed in 2011 to Helmand province Afghanistan where we served there now during that period of time from virtually the start of the Global War on Terrorism to present day I've seen our gear equipment weapon systems even our uniforms change always for the better in my opinion one of the greatest battle implementations and enhancements to the individual instrument has been the addition of the ACOG scope to our rough are right now when I first deployed in 2003 I had an m16 a new service rifle with a fixed carrying handle just Ironsides no any optical enhancements nothing we had one possibly two designated marksman that had m16a4 service rifles with ACOG scope on them and there was one one or two perpetuate like I said when I redeployed there in 2004 the update number to about one guy per squad my deployment 2011 to Afghanistan every single Marine had an ACOG on his rifle in addition to that we had a cogs on machine guns a cogs on automatic rifles the whole nine yards oh just short I had a freaking ACOG on m9 pistol virtually every weapon system that we have in excess wrinkle has an ACOG on even the small rockets have a [ __ ] hump so that particular piece of gear has gone it does leave the balance for increasing I think what is a big person that has been the fact that an individual brain can look downrange and he can get an estimation on that target just by utilizing the hash marks that are built into the reticule that system alone has been leaps and bounds enhancement to our ability to fight the enemy not to mention the quick acquisition with the four-power fixed optics and just it increases the individual individuals of marksmanship capabilities you know guys that couldn't shoot worth the crap with our sights to now engage targets with an ACOG that much easier so with that being said the acss actually spoke to the guy who designed this his name is Dimitri he works for primary arms and believe it or not he actually watches this channel so I was talking to him on the phone and you know he mentioned his user name and for you those you guys that are subscribed and you're always watching my videos and comm anyone not you probably know by now that I make an effort to try to reply to everybody now as my subscribers has gone up and whatnot in order harder to keep up with that sometimes I overlook comments sometimes I miss them but for the most part I try to reply to every single one you guys at post oh so that'd be a sale when I was talking to Dmitri on the phone he mentioned what his screen name was he said that he was a longtime viewer and whatnot and when he told me what a screen name was like oh yeah dude I know that guy you definitely comment self all the time so you know that's that's pretty interesting the fact that you know here's a guy that watches my video or watching my videos and now he's you know he's a designer of these reticule so I had a long conversation with him and he started telling me about this a CSS reticule and I pretty much they took the best features from the acog the reticule that's used in the acog original a child and enhanced it so he literally took the a cogs ridicule and then there's a ladder system on the side which is based off the original pso-1 scope that's used on the SVD so let's look at the are Co on the PSO one real quick and talk about the features and influence of reticles design the PSO one use the bullet drop compensation much like many of the mod combat optics we see today additionally the optic featured a built-in rangefinder in the bottom left of the reticule rangefinder was calibrated to 1.7 meters this presumably being the height that the Russians determined was the average height of a man the range finding scale in the PSL one is graduated from two hundred to a thousand meters finally estimated range to your target you simply place the feet of a standing human target on the bottom line of the scale you would then match up the head of your target with its corresponding line this example I have here our target is approximately 250 meters away in this example it is approximately 600 meters although this is a simplistic method it is fairly accurate way of estimating range I want to remind you guys with the acronym kiss which stands for keep it simple stupid now moving forward a bit we look at our modern-day ACOG or our CEO used by the Marine Corps this was probably one of the most battle-proven optics in modern times and like I said in my opinion one of the greatest battle implementations during the war on terrorism it is a true combat optic this is a reticule for the current issue our Co Marines have been using this reticule to slay bodies for virtually the entirety of the global war on terrorism object is a fixed for power and has a built-in bullet drop compensation for the five five six from 100 to 800 meters much like the Soviet era PSL won the RCO incorporated a way of estimating range by utilizing the hash marks on its reticule the principle of this is that the average torso of an adult male is approximately 18 inches so you can estimate a personal distance simply by matching up their torso with the corresponding hash mark on the bullet drop compensation ladder the hash mark that fits the targets torso gives you a system aid and range in this example right here this insurgent is approximately 400 meters away in this example these approximately 600 meters after determining approximately how far your target is we would simply just engage him using the corresponding hash mark that you range them with as you can see the potential for this optic and being able to detain a fairly accurate range estimation rarely increases your chances of being able to hit the enemy you're engaging before we had this capability the number one method used by an individual marine infantryman to estimate distance simply to envision how many football fields that were between you and your target now since the eight cogs adoption the success is ultimately led to every weapon organic to the infantry line company to be outfitted with some type of a cog variant every m16 and m4 in the Marine Corps inventory as an RC o every m249 and m27 IAR has an sto and n 240 Bravo FM Gio's all three are superb warfighting optics and ridicules the SDL ome MgO optics have slightly different reticles than the r co but even those do not feature all the enhancements of the ACS s ridicule so now that we have taken a look at what the ACPs s reticule was derived from let's take a look at the reticle itself and see the influence those two optics had on as well as the additional enhancements that make this reticule in my opinion possibly the finest most utilitarian warfighting reticule available today first let me start by saying that this reticule is currently set in yards not meters believed that they are currently working on a meters version of the reticule if it's not already out there and available when talking to you Dmitri who's the creator of this reticule he said that the two biggest reasons for missed shots during sniper competition were one incorrect range estimation and to wind the reticle tackles both those issues so let's go ahead and take an in-depth look at this ridicule at first glance of this thing you probably can already see the similarities between the PSO one and rCOS ridicule so let's dive into the weeds here because there's a lot more to this reticule than just combining the best features of both those optics first let's look at it like this the maitre stated that the reticule is really two reticle than one with the top being for more close quarters engagements from zero to 300 yards in the bottom half being medium range engagements between 400 to 800 yards top of the reticle features a big red horseshoe design this is for quick target acquisition at close range with the primary arms one to eight optic that I'm going to show you guys later on in this video when optic is set to one it operates pretty much like a red dot with a big red horseshoe really draws in your eye making for very quick engagements just like the a child's reticule as several features that assist with range determination of your target reticle is set for the average adult males torso of 18 inches for 0 to 300 yards the inside center of your horseshoe your target is approximately 200 yards away at the bottom of the horseshoe your target is 300 yards away now look at the vertical drop competition ladder and you will see that it's just like the RCO match up your corresponding hash mark with your target torso the one that fits is the estimated distance to your target now in addition to using the enemies torso to estimate their range you also have the feature that was inspired by the PSL one and that is the vertical ranging bracket at the bottom right this bracket is set to estimate range by height which is set for 5 feet 10 inches tall which is the average height of an adult male simply place the standing targets feet on the baseline and match up the targets head with a corresponding line in this example here this insurgent is approximately 400 yards away so moving on from range estimation I want to go back to the top of the reticule and talk about these two dots to the left and right of the or shoe these two dots are calibrated to be where you would hold when engaging a man who is sprinting while holding a rifle it is said that the average man running with a rifle moves at a speed approximately 8.6 miles per hour so essentially what you do if engaging an enemy that is within 300 yards you would place that dot on him and once the round is fired he and around will connect the same spot so this reticule has completely eliminated any math or desk work that needed to be done when you're trying to figure out how much you should lead when engaging a moving target additionally with the same concept you can use the outside of the horseshoe to engage a person walking which said that the average person walking with a rifle is approximately with 3.1 miles per hour to do this you would simply place your target on the outside of the horseshoe when you fire your target will have moved right into the rounds path this protocol also has pre placed dots which are calibrated for where you would hold on the target with a five mile-per-hour crosswind at its respective distance now obviously if your wind is greater than that let's say 10 miles per hour you simply just double the distance or if it was less than that you could close the distance in any event it completely takes the math and guesswork out of it it makes for one hell of a combat object so that pretty much sums up my piece about this a CSS reticule this reticle has even more capabilities than what I have outlined here so I encourage you all to check out some of the other videos that I've linked below kurta gan has also produced a TA 31 variant featuring the a CSS ridicule in it in my opinion this is the ultimate combat optic unfortunately for me I currently only own one optic that features this reticule and that is the primary arms 1 8 by 24 you guys are familiar with primary arms they have a pretty good reputation for offering quality optics at a significantly lower price compared to some other bigger name equivalent optics as I said before this is a 1 to 8 magnified object when you set it to lowest setting which is obviously the one it is pretty much servicing the red dot with that large horseshoe it really facilitates quick target acquisition for further away engagements you can adjust magnification level all the way up to 8 I'm going to go ahead and put some rounds downrange with this bad boy down we mountain this object to my daniel defense and 4v5 which features a 16 inch barrel and a mid-length gas system additionally I'll be firing standard 5 5 6 ball 55 green m193 ammunition my first string of fire is going to be my video I'll be shooting at the 100 yard line with my optics magnification maxed out today I'll be shooting center mass with the tip of the Chevron this will be the first time mounting and firing this optic okay so this was me they're on at 100 this was my first ring of fire my second and then a third screwdriver so if you good enough for me I'm going to push it back to the 200 yard lines now and see how we're hitting I set up a silhouette and then I'll put C and shoot target on top of the chest so we'll do it that way but maybe I'm we're going to push it back to 200 now and see how this object performs at the 200 yard line my second string of fire is going to be just short of 200 yards probably around the 180 yard line or so because I wasn't completely at the 200 I decided to use the tip of the Chevron to see where exactly my impacts would be so looks like I'm hitting pretty low but uh you know the Greeks are pretty good I think anyways so I'll go back just my point aim a little bit nah see how we do on my third string of fire I'm going to go ahead and use the bottom of the Chevron which is supposed to be where your point aim would be for 200 yards judging by my low impacts on that last ring of fire I say the ridicule is pretty spot-on to the bullet drop compensation well there we go second-string fire put the typical Chevron just up here on the top of the triangle brought it up a little bit but in a way it was a kill shot in my book so you know it's a what count nothing's outside this chest area it's uh maintaining a pretty good group here so you know for the price point yeah it's pretty good freakin optics you know as when you compare to the say an ACOG that costs over a grant and they're getting essentially the same reticule but better in this for this package right here so excellent [ __ ] optic excellent freaking optic and definitely worth the money I think so yeah lastly just for fun and to see how easily it is for me to score hits with this quick acquisition horseshoe I'm going to do a little running and gunning one flyer letter not pretty good let's say you to include this video over the a CSS Rachel and the primary arms wants to read by 24 often let me tell you is 100% certainty that the a CSS ready joke has my stamp of approval I hope it's in the next generation of Mariko are SEOs capability is that it brings the table is just phenomenal well personal story 2004 uh spike in the job cemetery was day two we were sitting on the defense we're just on the outskirts of the cemetery where the cemetery ended and where the city began and I remember watching two guys run out of the building and in that time that I saw them they were only exposed to me for about three seconds I had to process how far away they were I had to raise my weapon and acquire my target and then I had to estimate what my lead was going to be on them all that in three seconds all right based off my observation I admitted they were approximately 300-400 meters away so I made my shots that hit them I don't know but if I had an AC SS reticule all that guesswork would been eliminated I could have put the six six dot on them for a moving target and my chances are hidden those guys would have been greatly increased so just the capabilities and that this thing brings a table or just or just profound so one hundred percent has my support awesome piece of gear hoping the Marine Corps adopted outstanding so again guys hope enjoyed the video thanks for watching you got any questions post them below I know Dmitri watching my stuff so he he might actually see your question and answer it alright if I can't answer thanks for watching guys and don't forget we the common", "KusQ9H9gETM": "hey everybody Carolina gun guy here so just a disclaimer before I get going if you've been shooting shotguns your whole life this video may not be for you what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a look at different types of shotgun shells show you what's inside of them I got a slug I got double-aught buck all the way up to eight shot right here so I'm gonna take a look at different ones and show you what's inside but I'm also gonna tell you how many pellets are inside because I sat down and counted them and I kind of have a good idea so stick around if you have an interest in shotgun shells and you want to know a little bit more about them and we'll go through and have a good time South Carolina gun school is more than just a gun school with over a dozen classes including pistol rifle shotgun concealed carry and vehicle tactics you're guaranteed to find something for you if you're anywhere near Greenville South Carolina check them out at SC gun school calm this chart shows standard sizes of shotgun shells all the way from triple op buck to number 12 which is birdshot you can see there's not much difference between the sizes the diameter is the size of the pellet inside the shotgun shell so double-aught buck is 0.33 inches number eight is 0.09 inches that's how big the pellets are the difference is incrementally smaller like you can see between bbbbb and B no I didn't just have a stroke but between the triple B it's 0.19 inches then BB is point 1 8 and B is point 1 7 so it doesn't change that much I'm gonna focus for this video on the double-aught buck size 2 4 6 and 8 birdshot so now that you saw the chart I'm not going to show you what I have here first I have a slug a slug is just a 1 ounce piece of lead you can see it's hollow toward the back but it's mostly solid towards the front like from here on out the 1 ounce piece of land that will just be shoot out and it's pretty straightforward just like a large bullet that comes all your shotgun shell shotgun next I have double-aught buck right here and the bullet itself the shotgun shell itself tells you there's nine pellets in there you can see it right there so you get nine pellets and this is one of the reasons that a shotgun is such a good idea for a home defense gun because you do get nine projectiles with each shot if you don't believe me ask your Biden put that double-barrel shotgun and fire to blasts so the next one I have are all birdshot and I'll leave the shell in there so you can get an idea of the the pellets so that is a number two shot number four six and eight you see the pellets get incrementally smaller as you go up with the eight next to the two so you can see how small those pellets are don't need thirty rounds to protect yourself by shotgun so this is just me shooting my targets I've playing card stock targets I forgot to mention earlier than the anatomy of a shotgun shell if you're standing one up you got the case with the primer then you have the Gunpowder and then a wad which is like a plastic piece which separates the the powder from the actual pellets and then you have the pellets of soph at the top so I just shot this to the two four six and eight shot walked closer and you can see the size of the pellets that the spread that they make so that's the 2 4 and this pellets gets smaller and smaller the holes get smaller after you get closer as I go along because the pellets are so much smaller but it's time to get to that eighth spot and I'll do a quick close-up to show you the size of that wad hole and it sounds dirty now I sat and counted the number of holes in each target so that would give me a good idea of gonna move pellets in each one so this is the two shot right here and obviously you got the parts where the wad goes through so there could have been some pellets in there but on the two-shot there were 129 individual holes so about 130 to 140 pellets I think on the fourth shot I got 154 now remember the 2 shot was the larger shell to 3-inch shell so on a two and three-quarter inch shell there's probably gonna be a little bit less but on the four shot there were 150 four and little holes in here by the time you got the six shot there's 264 little tiny holes and on the eighth shot 363 that I counted all together and you can see right there where I did my double-aught buck it was grouped pretty well you got the 9 hole from that buck right there so overall these targets or these pieces of paper about I don't know 24 inches by 36 inches so they had a pretty good spread they're each about a foot and a half out and I was surprised to find 363 pellets in the a shot and since I had to open up all the shells is no point in let the powder go to waste thanks for watching guys I really appreciate it I hope you found something interesting here if you did give the video a like hit that subscribe button I really appreciate you guys watching my videos so take care and God bless", "iN63V5NDLMs": "I was going to do another question and answer video but I really didn't have any there's any really specific questions about create X so to speak some people are confused about mixing ratios and things like that you know your typical 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 all that stuff what's what and how much and how to do that and so I'm going to try to explain that real quick this is my test piece I was doing and I use just a regular opaque blue and I poured some into some little bottles and then I mixed one with future and I mixed one with them create a center but I mix them at different ratios with the with the create X thinner I mixed it two to one two parts of paint to one part of the reducer the first number is always the paint always always always always the paint that's the industry standard just think of it this way the first thing you pour in your bottle is your paint that's the first thing you you always go to is your paint okay then you add your thinner or reducer so just remember it in that way the first number is always the paint and I've seen people get that backwards and wrong that would cause a major catastrophe because you would have double the error so it's real simple just the first number is always the paint the second number is always the thinner or reduce you now on the future I mixed it one to one or half and half one part future or one part paint and an equal amount of future one to one but don't worry about percentages and all that just think of parts is the easiest way to do it one part is to two parts out or two parts is to one part that makes it a lot easier you're not having to worry about amounts announces and this and that really that's not important you kind of mix by how much paint you think you need to make now you didn't get cups of all different sizes that have these graduations on it and I've seen her people get really messed up on this but this is actually very very simple you know this happens to be a big cup this is a 32 ounce cup and up to here is 24 ounces of paint that's not important these are these are your one your two-part mixing ratio bars here and it makes it really simple if you're mixing one to one you know if you're mixing like I did with the future you know one part paint to one part future or thinner then you would fill the cup up to us just pick a number you know however much paint you think you need say you need about this much paint or somewhere in here and I'll just go to the two so you would fill your paint up to the two on this bar that's your paint bar this is your thinner bar you would leave that paint in there and then fill your reducer up to the two you always match the number you know if you're feeling if you're going to put all the way up to four and paint then you would go all the way up to four leaving that paint in there and add that much reducer you always just match the numbers you don't pour in pain pour it out and then think that's I'm mixing a two to one so I need to fill this two to pour it out and then fill it to one or you don't remove the paint from the bucket you actually fill to a specific number these are just general guide numbers these aren't ounces or nothing these are just numbers that you can match the apparently took depending on how much paint you're willing to mix if you're doing two to one two parts paint to one part thinner or reducer then you again you would just simply fill up to how much you roughly you think you need and I'll say I fill my paint up to three then you would fill continue and fill up to three with reducer and that would give you a two to one or two to one mixture same but four to one you want four parts Hank to one part thinner you would fill to a random number say five then you would put your thinner in leaving that paint in there until you hit the five on the thinner bar and that would give you a four to one ratio mix and it's real simple you get to three parts and it's not much different it's just that you have three components you have a resin or a paint or a clear your second number generally is your hardener because that doesn't change if you're say you're using the matrix clear it's four to one no matter what it's always four parts clear to one part hardener so it would be confusing if you did clear then reduce it and then try to guess what your hardener supposed to be to match to get back to where you're supposed to you know your four to one so I would always I always do it in the way that you mix it this the same is with the two-to-one you I always mix if I'm doing a three-part clear I always makes the clear and the hardener and then reduce it to the consistency that I want so if I want to do a matrix is for two one four two one you know so it'd be four parts clear or four parts paint one part hardener and then if you want to add one part thinner you would go to that line so you would go if you're doing a four one one or let's say you're doing a four one two four parts I'd go to pick a number of just generally how much I'm wanting to end up with you know I want to have maybe this much material when I'm done that's three so I would go to three with the clear leave that in and then fill up this high with hardener and then fill up to here with a reducer and that would give you a 4:1 one or two excuse me ratio and hopefully that's clear I hope I'm making that clear you don't pour in paint and pour it out and then pour in reducer poured out you know nothing like that and you don't get goat-like for one one you know it's not like that you match the numbers across and that gives you that ratio you know it's you would always fill whatever you fill this to you're going to fill your other components to that same number four four four two two two six six six always the same number just remember that same with the two part four four four four four four that's going to give you your different ratios so I hope that that's clear the main thing to remember is when you write down ratios are you telling somebody your ratio or you're reading a ratio it's always paint thinner or paint hardener which is a set you know that's unchangeable or clear hardener thinner you know and just think of it how you an easy way to remembers think of how you mix it you don't typically pour thinner in a bottle and then add paint you always pour your paint and then you add your thinner to the desired consistencies I'm going to put up a video later on hopefully the day of what some pain and stuff and just what I'm doing and I'm kind of think I have an idea of what I'm going to paint the color I've been working so many hours and I'm working two jobs essentially so I haven't been able to do much of anything but anyway hopefully this clears some stuff up talk to y'all later bye", "5BLR-G98-8Q": "Hey everyone! This is Greg from Chemical Guys, and today I'm gonna show you exactly how to\ndilute your detailing products so you can get the best result on any job. There's two types of products: ready to use and concentrated. A lot of our products at Chemical Guys are\nconcentrated, and that means that they can be diluted. Now, what is dilution? Dilution is taking a product and mixing it\nwith water to water-down the product to get the right\nratio so that it works properly. It's a lot better for you as detailer and\nconsumer because we don't ship you water. We can ship you more product in a smaller bottle, and you can dilute it on the job. Dilution ratio is really complicated for some people, and a lot of people don't understand it. So we spent the time to make this awesome\ndilution ratio chart. This gives you all the dilution ratio measurements\nin ounces for any size container that we sell here at\nChemical Guys. We made one for 16 oz, 32 oz, 1 gallon, and\n5 gallon, and we gave you all the ounce dilution ratios\nfrom 1:1 to 128:1. This is a great tool to help you dilute products\nand make sure you have the right ratio to clean any type\nof job. Dilution ratio can be a little complicated,\nso I'll break it down and show you how it works. Dilution ratios are usually set up with two\nnumbers with a colon (:) in the middle. Those two numbers can be anything from 4:1\nor 64:1. This means that you're mixing, let's say at\n10:1, that's mixing 10 parts water to 1 part product. That bigger number is actually the water, and the smaller number is the amount of product that we're mixing in the bottle. Now every size bottle is different, so you\nneed to do the math to get the right dilution ratio for that size\nbottle. For example, let's dilute a 16 oz bottle 3:1. If you have 16 ounces, use that as the base\nto figure out the calculation. We take our ratio: 3:1, three parts water to one part concentrate, and we add those together. 3 + 1 = 4 Now we take the size of our container, 16 ounces, then divide it by the number that we added\nup together. So that's 16 divided by 4. 16 ounces divided by 4 is 4 ounces. Once we have that number, 4 ounces, that's the number for our \"one\" part. We take our bottle and fill it with 4 ounces\nof our cleaner or detailing product in the bottle. Now to get the ounces for the \"three\" parts, we take 16 ounces (the size of the bottle) and subtract our \"one\" part, which is 4 ounces. 16 - 4 = 12 That 12 ounces is the amount of water we use\nto get the right ratio. 12 + 4 = 16 and that fills up a full 16 ounce bottle. You can do this for any size container, like\na gallon, which is 128 ounces, or 5 gallons, which is 640 ounces. You can use this for any size container, but we set up our chart with the 4 bottle\nsizes that we sell at Chemical Guys. If math is a hard subject for you, you can easily use the chart by finding the\nnumber you want to place the dilution ratio at. So in a 16 oz. bottle at 8:1, you add 1.8 oz of product to 14.2 oz of water. It's super easy to do, and it makes diluting\nany product quick and easy. I'm gonna show you how to dilute the product\nin a bottle. We're gonna use a 3:1 ratio of AllClean in\nthis 16 oz bottle. Dilution ratios can be done in any type of\nratio. We give recommendations for specific product\ndilutions, So if you want to dilute your product 10:1,\nyou can easily do that. If you want to dilute it 4:1, you can do that\ntoo. You can even adjust your dilution ratio for\nthe job at hand. If I'm using AllClean here with a 10:1 or\n20:1 suggested dilution ratio, I can use it to clean something dirtier with\na dilution ratio of 3:1 for more cleaning power. I have an empty 16 oz. bottle here fitted\nwith the Perfect Pour EZ Fill Funnel. I'll screw the funnel on so I don't spill\nany product, and dilute it 3:1. So let's add the two ratio numbers: 3 + 1 = 4 so I'm gonna do this in quarters. I'll fill the bottle up a quarter of the way\nwith AllClean. That's about a quarter.. then I'll take my water--this is regular distilled\nwater, and dilute my product with the other three\nparts. This gives me a good ratio of 3:1. You notice I didn't spill any product because\nof my Perfect Pour Funnel, and I can fill it up right to the top for\nthe right dilution. Now our product is ready to go. I only have to add a sprayer, and then I'm ready to go detailing! Dilution ratios are super simple, and that's why we took the time to make this\nchart: so you can dilute any of your products in any sized bottle. You can make a full gallon, or a full five\ngallon pail, and use that ready-to-use solution whenever\nyou want. I'll put the link to this chart right in the\ndescription box in this video, and I'll put a clickable link right here on\nthe screen so you can print out the chart and put it in your garage, shop, or mobile\ndetailing van to have it ready to use whenever you need\nit. That way your dilution ratios area easily\ndone just by using this chart. We put a lot of time into making this chart\nhigh quality, so you can print a big version and place it\nin your shop along with our Detailing Flowhcart, and any other information that you can get\noff our YouTube channel and website to help you detail faster and\neasier. We hope you like the information! Check out our YouTube, Facebook, Instagram\nfor more information about Chemical Guys and the awesome educational\nfootage that we put on our YouTube channel. Always remember to have fun, stay clean, and keep on detailing!", "8GqvWDRK5fw": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everyone walsh here from thin line defense and today we're going to be continuing our low power variable optic series by bringing you a review of the primary arms plx 1x8 with the acss raptor m2 reticle this thing is absolutely crazy and i can't wait to show it to you it's really on another planet as always though i want to thank primary arms for providing us with all the optics we need for this low power variable optic series and to wheeler tools for giving us all the tools we need to install these things the right way so they don't fall off so previously in our low power available optics series we reviewed the primary arms one by six in the second focal plane and first focal plane just as a small refresher for you in first focal plane that's the one where the reticle actually changes size as you move the magnification so this means that the first focal plane reticle works through the entire magnification range whereas the second focal plane reticle only really works if it's in one x and then you can use it at the hundred yard or wherever your zero is at and then at 6x is the only one where the actual reticle bullet drop markings would be accurate during our second focal plane versus first focal plane it was really interesting that the entire team actually preferred the second focal plane better in a one by six but we did all agree that as the magnification increases that we'd all want to move into a first focal plane so let's see if changing to a one by eight changes our opinion the one by eight raptor came heavily requested by all of you viewers and i even asked you which version you wanted to see if it was the slx or the plx and all of you said you wanted to see the plx version in order to understand more about what plx is it's important to understand there's actually three different tiers for all primary arms optics the first is the slx line or the silver line now this is actually what we reviewed when we did the one by six second focal plane and first focal plane this was in their silver line now this is in their budget tier which is more entry level i really think this is perfect for 90 of all consumers and then there's the glx line which is their gold line now this is a little more expensive but they then they come with some really cool features and then you bump up to what we have today which is the plx line which is the platinum line now this is not budget in any way shape or form and it is not entry level this thing is absolutely crazy and it's on a totally different level so i tell you what let's unbox it let me show you how cool this reticle is then we'll set it all up take it to the range and i'm going to show you some of the awesome stuff i can do with this thing it is crazy so here we have our plx 1x8 look at this platinum series box even the box is ridiculous i can't wait to get this thing out though let's take a look at it let me just get the lid off so wow look at here look at this whole presentation this just the box itself looks ridiculous wow so here we go platinum series they're not playing around here all right let's get this optic out of here though all right so what there's something hidden over here on the side we'll take a look at what comes in there in a second let's pull this optic out of here nothing else in there take off this rubber band and then the rest of this plastic can come off wow this thing is hefty wow that 34 millimeter tube that's pretty big but look at how nice this thing looks it's just looks amazing i love all the detail it has look it has this quick release cap so it's a little bit different than the slx line but it does look really nice and then the front has the same caps we had before flip up and flip down and they stay in place so i really like those i've always been a fan of that and the magnification turns pretty cleanly i don't think it's too stiff or too loose it's pretty easy to move around i definitely like it could use a throw lever though i'm gonna need to get one of those and as you can see the turrets here move by one mil they actually they actually have locking turrets and you could turn it counterclockwise to move the point of impact up and then clockwise to move the point of impact down the clicks are nice and audible and you just unlock the turret like we said you can change it to the right or to the left and lock the turret back down then we have the diopter also and as you can see here the diopter is also nice and smooth it has a good bit of resistance so it's not just going to spin randomly and then we have the light illumination as you can see there are actually off stops in between each one and a night vision setting an n1 and an n2 in case you're running any sort of night vision and needs some illumination but i like having the stops in between so i don't have to go all the way around just to turn it back off again alright so let's see what came in this little pouch then here all right so it looks like this is a comes with an extra 2032 battery so i forgot to take a look inside here ah yeah okay so there's just a regular 2032 you can see how to place it in there in case you go to replace it and now we know we have an extra one and then the tool that came in there also is so that you can actually set the zero stops on this so we'll get the tool out of the bag and we'll take a look at it so here so here we can see you just loosen the actual caps and then you can lift those caps off so that you can reset them and push them back on and lock them down so it would be at a zero position when you locked it back down and then you can just tighten it and then it would be at a zero position in case you need a reference as to where you were at if you were making a bunch of adjustments or something then you could do that for the elevation on top of the windage so let's see what's in the instructions then we go through this all right well we've talked about a whole bunch of this stuff we've been through most of the features of the optic itself but if you want to see some instructions here on what they are this is what it is then we have how to achieve a clear reticle picture make sure to do this to set the adapter so you see the reticle clearly there are some different elevations and zeros you need to set so pay attention to this when you set the optic in order to make sure the acss markings are accurate for you let me go over some of the reticle illumination so this talks about how we can set the turrets to zero like we just mentioned a second ago with the tool and it shows us how the each adjustment adjusts for 0.36 inches at 100 yards so 0.1 mils per each click and then shows you how you can use a reticle for close quarter shooting we'll talk more about the bullet drop compensation and the wind holds when we go over the actual reticle uh how to do target leading there's markings for that horizontal ranging we'll go through that when we talk about the reticle in detail and then also the ranging ladders which show you how to arrange a vertical target so this is pretty cool alright so we'll go through all that in a second and here's the actual specifications if you want to know all the details of the actual optic if you need to measure anything it looks like that's about it all right let's do this thing okay so be careful here this optic and some of the others in the glx and plx line actually come in 34 millimeter tubes so most people have a 30 millimeter rings as the standard so just be careful when you're purchasing these to make sure you're getting the appropriate rings for them the 34 millimeter gives you a few advantages with the bigger tube it gives you a little bit better eye relief and it actually allows more light to come in so you can see more clearly but it comes at a cost this thing is a chunk look at the scale here and you can see it weighs 27 ounces and that's without the mount with the 34 millimeter mount we're at almost 35 grams for the optic that's seriously hefty if you're used to a red dot all right let's mount it up most of you have seen this a few times so i'm going to blaze through it all right let's get the mount out and get the actual tool we need now remember though you can't actually torque this down properly there's no torque measurement on this tool and what's interesting is there's very specific torque specifications for the hex nuts and for the cross bolts so if you want to do this properly make sure you use a torque wrench i use the wheeler fat wrench it's awesome so we'll set that up for when we install it so for now we need to remove our previous first focal plane optic my first focal plane then we're going to install this mount finger tight and then we'll go ahead and take off the top caps we'll just quickly remove these and then remove each of those top caps so we can put the optic in place make sure it moves freely put those top caps back on and then we just want to reinstall those screws finger tight then we can set our eye relief and just make sure that we have some free range of movement moving it forward and backwards set that eye relief good to go then we can torque it down use the proper torque values then you can use a level just to make sure it's straight before you tighten everything down use the proper torque value on our wheeler fat wrench and then we are ready to go and shoot it [Music] all right now that we got everything mounted up let's take a look at the reticle and put it through its paces now i did say in my first focal plane versus second focal plane video that i did prefer the second focal plane reticle uh due to the way it works and having the horizontal and vertical ranging plus also with the illumination i will chime in here and say that the 1x8 acss raptor m2 is my new favorite reticle let me show you why so the first focal plane second focal plane reticles are pretty cool when you zoomed in the first focal plane lets you see pretty clearly and the second focal plane had both the horizontal and vertical ranging but then when you'd zoom out the first focal length was too small and nothing actually worked on the second focal plane that's where we used the raptor m2 reticle here we also have the vertical ranging and you can see where all the indicators are for your range markings so you can easily mark your target or you could still use horizontal ranging to mark your targets indicated on the bullet drop indicator now what if you had wind as with the other reticles you can easily adapt for this such as a 7.5 mile an hour wind you would put between the 5 and 10 mile per hour hash now in our close quarter engagement the 1x reticle is so small but the raptor m2 is a much larger reticle so that makes target acquisition very fast like a red dot it also has an illuminated center so lighting up against their black shirt or black background is easy the reticle also allows for a moving target so you can follow that target if they are moving from right to left with the reticle so enough talking about the reticle let's see if it translates into actual performance so due to the ammo shortage there's not much ammo so i'm have to get creative in my training so i made a little course in the backyard that i'm actually going to train with this optic on and let's see if it translates into realistic performance on actual live fire so some of the first things i have to tell you immediately is how much i love the 1x illumination now i'm a red dot guy so my brain likes to chase the dot so the reticle on the 1x is super bright and easy to see and not only that but at 1x it causes a horseshoe like design with the dot in the center so it's very easy to see and very easy to transition between targets i found that i could see it easily and i could rapidly transition from one target to the next i am absolutely loving it and then when you zoom in you get an even larger reticle that has all the bdc markings and you can see even clearer with the amazing glass that it has so my thought process is i'm going to spend 99 of my time training on these targets and then we'll go out to the live fire range and i'll just use live fire in order to validate my training to see if my training out here on these simple targets actually translates into realistic live fire results so i'm gonna go put the training in but let's go out to the range and go zero this thing so i got a pretty easy way to zero what i do is i just bore sight first and you're gonna wanna go and align the reticle with the bore sight and then once you have that you can go and make your first shot and then once you have the indication of where your first shot landed then you lock the actual rifle down make sure you get it firm in position and then once it's locked down you change the elevation and windage so that your impact then moves to the actual bullet location so here i'll lower the elevation and turn so the actual reticle is now sitting on the impact position this will then set us so our we are now zeroed at one shot and here i go and take a shot at the metal gong just to make sure we have everything where we needed to and we're good to go so i will say that some of you probably have your own crazy ways of zeroing but having so many optics that we review and have to zero with limited ammo i find this to be an extremely efficient way to zero all of our rifles and optics together i do have a horribly bad habit of turning the dial the wrong way so if i need to go one click to the right i turn one click to the left and then i look at it like wow i need to go take a shot and i need to go one more to the right and i then i turn the dial more the wrong way so i really like this method because it just alleviates my own error from it so now that we're all zeroed let's go see if that coursework we did in the yard actually translates into that live fire performance let's start with some up downs [Applause] so again the targets are easy to see there's really no difference we're still kind of doing dry fire here all right let's run the course with live fire and see how we do so i have to say the optic just transforms me as a shooter i am incredibly fast now we did a lot of training with it and it kind of goes to show you that you could practice with a whole lot of dry fire and then just validate that training with very little live ammo i found that reticle to be so useful where it would just horseshoe around exactly what i wanted to shoot at and then i could transition to target so quickly this reticle is awesome but we're only seeing one part of it i'm only really using it at 1x so tell you what let's stretch this thing out go to 6x or anywhere in between let's just go straight out 300 yards let's go right now so shot after shot after shot i was able to just ring the gong on the 300 yard just like i was shooting at the one i would even say it was easier to shoot at the 300 than to even shoot at the 100 because i'm zoomed in so far and the glass is so clear and it's just so easy to see it's completely simple i think it's it's scary easy so tell you what let's go over my pros cons and whether or not i recommend this optic so let's start with pros my absolute biggest pro on this optic is the reticle i just love it so at the 1x it performs a lot like a red dot it's actually extremely similar to my holosun 503g which is my favorite red dot i think that's one of the best ones but what's really cool is it has the same design at a 1x so my training just kicks in and i can just use the same training that i've used with that red dot i just absolutely love it and it's easy for me to see because it's a little bit larger you have much better illumination than we had with the 1x6 first focal plane and then you can even zoom in at any magnification range so with one to six yeah there's a pretty big difference between one to six but it's not absolutely crazy at one to eight i can see pretty clearly with this hd glass out to a thousand with zero problem i would love to see if i can even make that shot but being able to see it and recognize that target is very easy the glass is absolutely amazing but we haven't even started talking about the reticle as you zoom in as you move in further into 8x you not only have your normal horizontal ranging but then you can clearly see the vertical ranging so it'd be easy for you to arrange any target i really really love this reticle i think this reticle is what makes this so great even compared to the 1x6 first focal plane second focal plane i think this is one of the coolest optics i've ever seen so with every pro there comes a con and this one has a few the first one is going to be the cost now some of you who use nightforce optics may be like oh that's nothing the cost isn't anything but for me it's just like an everyday tactical shooter this is quite expensive but i do see where some people come from where it would be easy for me to get an expensive optic and then i can just transfer it from rifle the rifle as i upgrade or change my rifles i would always have a good optic and i never really need to change that out so i do see that mindset now another negative is the weight this thing is pretty hefty at almost 37 ounces but the thing i found the most interesting is it never actually affected my performance i never felt that i was slower because the optic weighed too much because it's so far back i'm not really having to fling it around it's just kind of staying there on the top of the rail so while it's a negative i didn't really find it to affect me at all so the last con i want to talk about is parallax now this isn't necessarily a con but more of a public service announcement now i want you to be aware that this does not have a parallax adjustment nor do most one by eights or one by ten so why that's a problem place your thumb out in front of you like you're going to aim with it right but then move your head and you're going to start to see that that reticle your thumb you were using actually moves so why is that super important because without a parallax adjustment you need to make sure that your cheek weld is perfect and not necessarily perfect but consistent so if you don't have a consistent cheek weld you're going to be extremely frustrated when you go to zero this rifle because it's not the rifle or the optic that's going to be off it's going to be your head placement that's going to throw that shot off and it will frustrate you incredibly so if you're going to use this optic you need to train and you need to have the skill sets to actually use your rifle consistently throughout every shot you're gonna fire with this optic because otherwise you're gonna throw these shots off so do i recommend this optic holy hell do i now i have to say this is the first optic i've ever reviewed at this level so i don't have a whole lot to compare it against to say like what super high tier is it better or worse than i have no idea um i will say that that price tag would absolutely sting um but i would want to have this optic and i would probably have it as one of the few optics that i even own because then i would never need to upgrade and i could always just put on a new rifle later so i hope you had fun with me learning about this absolutely ridiculous optic big thanks to primary arms for letting me play with something this cool and to wheeler tools for all the gear we needed to install it we're actually going to take a small pause from our lpvo series to review a couple red dots to include the vortex uh-1 also known as the huey and we're actually going to look at some really good budget options in the sig romeo 5. then we'll actually revisit lpvos by comparing what our team thinks about lpvos versus red dots i think that's going to be really cool and some of you are going to get really angry so we'll see how that goes all right everyone thanks a lot we would all want to move into action", "NK8djQdiL5s": "hey everyone i'm mike from northern ridge designs and welcome back to the channel it can be difficult sometimes to get a bubble free epoxy finish especially on wood slabs but in this video i'm going to share some tips with you that will increase your odds of getting a perfect epoxy finish on any wood slab project so let's get started what you're seeing here is an 11 foot long l-shaped walnut bar top with some great character as you're seeing in this knot with a crack there are also a few issues we need to address such as sanding out these oil smudges this bar top was actually in place for a while unfinished also when it was put together i i don't know who did it but the the seam here is kind of a large gap there's also a large chunk of bark missing there we're gonna have to touch both of those things up before we do the epoxy pour this particular knot hole with a or not with a crack in it it's kind of soft but the epoxy should should harden that up it'll be perfectly fine the coolest feature of this entire slab is this bar conclusion it's just huge and it's going to be awesome filled with ocean blue metallic epoxy have to get all the soft and loose bark kind of picked out of there but it's definitely going to be worth it in the final product moving on down you'll see a couple more we have a couple little divots and holes and things that we're gonna have to remove some of the bark and some of the loose materials so that we don't have anything loose and we can fill all the voids with an ocean blue metal can finish the whole thing off with an epoxy finish that just lays right out like glass here we go step one you need to remove all the loose material and i'm going to start with the large bark inclusion and as you work your way through here you need to go nice and slow at the beginning things are going to pop out in large chunks as you're seeing here these came out really easy without much effort whatsoever and i'm going to go through first and make sure i get everything that's loose and easy and then from there i'm going to start picking and trying to find stuff that's a little tougher to get out perhaps just kind of checking along i don't want to remove any kind of wood i don't want to mark up the the wood that surrounds it and mess up that beautiful grain but i definitely want to get anything that's soft or loose out of this void because again we are going to fill this with ocean blue metallic and i just don't want to have anything that's going to move over time so although the video speed is is sped up here i'm going pretty slow and just kind of poking and checking with my little pick here and it's kind of a long process it takes a little time but in the end it's just going to pay off so here we have kind of the final product it's cleaned out you're seeing a lot of little rough edges that's that's fine the epoxy is going to fill in this void and it's just going to pop along with that awesome grain from the bark inclusion as you're probably noticing the bark inclusion went right on through that edge of the slab so had to be kind of careful not to break that chunk of wood off really don't have to repair that but the epoxy is going to have to go up through that void from the top right on out the side so here's a couple more spots that will be filled with the blue and i have to chip out and pull out anything that's loose so what we're going to do is we're just going to jump ahead to the blue in place and all these voids that i have removed the loose material and man that stuff really pops that ocean blue metallic uh as you can see i over filled all voids that way we can sand down flush and there won't be any divots or low spots although you get a little leeway with that with the epoxy finish i tried to keep a lot of the blue out of the crack because we're going to be filling that with a more natural look with sawdust and glue to help fill that in but not make it stand out so much that there's a large crack there and as you're seeing along the edge here this stuff is kind of loose to work with so i used a chunk of mdf i had laying around with some tyvek tape to help hold that epoxy in place as it cured this is a 15 minute quick coat epoxy so it's pretty loose but you have about 15 minutes of working time and you really have to move so once i took that off now what you're seeing is kind of the sharp edge along along there that'll be that'll be sanded flush and that's going to look really good in the end so here's a look once things are sanded down it's as you can see it's a little white but that's from the sanding once we put an epoxy coat over it it's going to fill in the actual scratches that are left on the epoxy and you won't be able to tell also kind of looking here the crack has been filled with some wood glue and sawdust i also took a chunk of walnut bark and fixed that corner sanded it down to make a little better match so there's just a couple little spots of blue here and there that soft knot hole we're going to fill that with epoxy as well and harden it up and there's the bark inclusion so it ended up looking pretty neat all along there and once we get the epoxy on that on that grain around the the blue is just going to be really awesome this is where it becomes pretty obvious that you took your time and filled all these little voids to make sure that you didn't have places where epoxy is going to seep out we're going to get started with our first seal coat and seal coats are what make the difference between a glass-like epoxy finish on wood and one that's got a lot of dimples and bubbles in it what i'm going to do here in the first seal coat is i'm just going to move this product around the wood and let it soak in it's filling all the natural little holes and grains of the walnut each seal coat's going to be about one ounce of epoxy per square foot it's not a ton of material but it's super important that you do this each seal coat will look better than the last one because you're removing some of those areas where the epoxy is going to seep and bubble some people they like to for whatever reason just pour one coat of epoxy on top stand there with a torch for hours on end and still you're gonna end up with some bubbles and and divots in the final product the difference between that and having a glass like epoxy finish are the seal coats in this particular project because it's for a customer and i want a perfect layout i'm going to do three seal coats to make sure i get all of those little voids filled with the epoxy plus we're dealing with the live edge that has bark on one side so i want to make sure that i take my time and brush the epoxy into all those little nooks and crevices along the bark edge i'm using a squeegee to move the material around now i'm coming along the front with a with a short two inch paintbrush to kind of rub that that epoxy in and what's going to happen as this epoxy starts to self level it's not going to level out perfectly smooth because i'm using just enough material to to to kind of spread around and seal off all the grain but it is going to move a little bit it's going to go over the edges so you kind of have to constantly keep going back and forth and rubbing out the drips with the brush both on the bark side as well as the smooth side you're probably noticing here i'm using my hand on the smooth side of the bar that's perfectly fine i'm just trying to smooth out those little drips i just don't want a super uneven edge but it's going to be a little uneven that's just what the seal coat is i'm going to torch it again i'm probably going to do three or four passes with the torch in total this is going to be kind of the most in-depth seal coat that i show you i repeat this process two more times before i do a final flood coat now the difference between a seal coat and the flood coat is that the flood coat has a lot more material actually three times the material i use three ounces per square foot and that's going to get a self-leveling agent okay but after one seal cope this is what you're left with from a distance it looks pretty good but when you get up a little closer you're going to notice all the little imperfections such as all these little bubbles now if i just poured one coat stood there with a torch i would still end up with these because it's the bubbles caused by epoxy soaking into the wood grain and it's going to be a constant thing until the epoxy dries so this is what it is and i'm going to sand it down using 220 and that's all you need to do just kind of lightly sand it i'm going to pop all these little bubbles with the sandpaper and it's going to look pretty ugly luckily the epoxy this is the beautiful thing about epoxy it's going to fill those little scratches here you're seeing some some pretty large little voids that are just going to keep pulling that epoxy in if you didn't do the seal coats you'd never get those filled so this is after the first seal coat and it's it's kind of ugly right now when you get down to it switching up to a top view here get a little better look at my sanding process i just have 220 grit sandpaper on a five inch orbital sander in the description you can see the link to the sandpaper and tools that i'm using but i'm just kind of lightly going over it i just want to see all the imperfections i'm not trying to sand this smooth by any means or sand it flush i'm just trying to make sure that i'm going to get good adhesion with the next layer of epoxy if you pour epoxy right over a smooth hardened surface of epoxy it doesn't have the mechanical bond that is necessary so by sanding with just 220 grit there's little tiny scratches caused by the sandpaper that the next layer of epoxy can grab onto so here's kind of a better look this kind of puts it in perspective as just how uneven and and kind of ugly for lack of a better term that seal coat is the bark really soaks up that epoxy on the first seal coat after that it's going to be less and less material being soaked into it but it helps to smooth out the naturally rough bark there you can see it's kind of a low spot where that soft knot was around the bark inclusion there's the one really big divot there that showed you a little bit earlier it stood right out even when the whole thing was unsanded and between seal coats after i sand it i'm just going to wipe the whole thing off with blue shop towels i'm also going to blow it off with an air gun here kind of looking down the table you can see all the imperfections this is the second seal coat just going to use a squeegee to move the material around and there like magic all those little scratches disappear first time you do an epoxy project and you sand those seal coats you feel like you're just ruining it but really that epoxy it needs those little scratches from the 220 grit to mechanically bond itself to its previous layer and you don't see the scratches at all just looking here even without torching it it's a crystal clear finish and that blue is really popping out of that dark walnut just like the first seal coat i'm going to move a an amount of material that was one ounce per square foot around and around trying to fill in those voids and i kind of keep it moving so that it keeps sinking into those little those little dips and nooks and crannies i'm going to start pushing it over the edge and then i'm going to come through with my brush brush it into the bark as well smooth it out on the backside torching as i go you can see a little bit of cloudiness there and that's just the the epoxy has some bubbles from the mixing so second seal coat has dried at this point you know real close there and you can tell that it looks a lot better than the first seal coat heck some people might even be happy with this at their own home bar but this being for a client i'm going for a glass type finish with no sorts of undulations i guess when you when you look down the epoxy here i'm pointing out just a couple of spots that kind of being sticklers they won't really film with the with the epoxy and what i'm probably going to have to do to those spots is use a burn-in stick now it's another product for another video but with the seal coats you're going to eliminate 98 of those a burn-in stick is just kind of a hard wax that you melt into the spot and it fills that little void and then you can just put epoxy right over it's color matched to walnuts so you can't even tell it's there here we've sanded the second seal coat looks a lot better than the first one most of the little bubbles at this point are out of it there's just kind of some low spots and some high spots but the final flood coat which you're seeing here will take care of that the final flood coat is self leveling it's an eighth inch thick when you pour it on the material and it's going to level right out so i'm going to get right down low and you can see there are no dips and divots or bubbles of any kind i went ahead and did a third seal coat i saved putting that in this video because it's quite redundant it's the same exact steps that i went through on the first and second seal coats if you're curious what the final flood coat entails i have a couple videos that show that process but involves an eighth inch square notch trowel and again you're going to get a perfect finish following these seal coat steps you just can't find any imperfections the bark took that epoxy wonderfully and it smoothed the whole thing out so people aren't going to catch their clothes on any kind of sharp edges or anything and looking down the bar i mean you just can't be happier with the way that this laid out there you have the final product if you take the time to do a few seal coats on wood slabs you're really going to help set yourself up for a great end result hopefully you found this video helpful and if you have any

swingers of the male persuasion today we're going to demonstrate the notorious bolo round these requests poured in after we demonstrated Tim Hamilton's dumbbell and barbell slugs Wow I did have a lot of thumbs in my opinion these two rounds rated very high on the badass scale this one passed sideways through Kevlar body armor also made out of machined steel the dumbbell round had very impressive results rather than tumbling through the air these maintain an efficient aerodynamic profile until it strikes flesh then it begins tumbling causing maximum damage now let's take a look at the bolo rounds or macho gaucho these exotic rounds complete with their exotic price are restricted in some parts of the country oddly not in California costing around four times the cost of a traditional foster slug let's see what makes me so special let me use a clear chet ight hole with a clear overshot card on top to keep everything held inside inside we have the projectile itself riding in the shot cup of an mg42 style wadding normally used for steel shot the projectile consists of two lead balls connected with a metallic cabling that's easy to pull apart the lead balls measure roughly 1/2 inch in diameter or about 13 millimeters and when spread apart the span is about five inches or about 125 millimetres and there you go Europe now stop blaming me that you were not taught the imperial system while the weight of the projectile is a hefty 36 grams the weight of the powder load is rather light weighing in at only 17 grains don't you love all these crazy measurements welcome back to fledermaus errs hey today we're out here to try the macho gaucho this is around from fire quest that is supposed to be too heavy lead balls connected by a piece of cable so we cut one of them apart to take a look at what they with inside before we shoot them this idea came to us from you guys after we shot Tim with machinist we shot his dumbbell rounds and we had a lot of suggestions about shooting around it was two balls connected by a chain well the chain doesn't exist but two balls connected by a little piece of steel cable we're going to give them a try and see how they work our theory is that two balls crammed together with a cable are not going to separate out like they should and go fly-in downrange with a nice stretched out cable in between them as is shown on the picture but I think the two balls are going to probably stick together and just kind of keep that cable crunched up in there well let's give it a try and see what we can find how will they fare on the lead plate it so those things buried themselves into this lead plate not very deep but still impacted and as you can see on camera their little tiny steel cable fibers where one ball is stacked on top of the other ball with the cable smashed in between the two of them well it's accurate to you know it was yeah 20 yards maybe 20 yards and aiming for that little button okay oh I thought they would have used little piece of sticker in a nice little peephole there look at that and there's a cable all mashed up inside okay we have a low resolution with very high frame rate of 38,000 frames a second but we can clearly see that there is absolutely no separation of the two balls you're actually touching when they impact sucked oh boy okay 22 yards 29.9 go boys hit it in the door boys okay yep you hear that fat yeah here is the projectile as we found in the Kevlar now it's important to note that we were able to pull these balls apart so there is no fouling or nodding of the cabling to prevent them from spreading on their own now looking at the high-speed footage of this shot we could see that the balls have spread maybe the thickness of your thumb in this shot there doesn't seem to be any external force that would actually cause the balls to spread apart so let's try to influence that a little bit the way we'll do that is install what's called a rifle choke on the end of the shotgun this should provide a little bit of thin and a triple force yeah rifle choke in there now we'll see if that has any effect on it okay we're gonna find out if these are effective against drone attacks oh my Oh big splash out there right software hit the DDI maverick and the maverick phantom one it would have severed it severs the wires sever the wires just so we can shut it down we're just trying to shut it down not destroy it now one of the balls you can see hit right there and it's a pretty big big ball they're bigger than the in a doubleheader out there so you can see that one hit right there and tore the body out of it and the other barely skimmed that arm right there and ends up tearing the wires out from underneath well I'd say we effectively brought down this drone at 25 yards yeah okay Dukey top here is your review of your drone that you sent me that I couldn't even charge up because you sent a European plug thank you using the rifle choke had no added effect to this the balls again had very minimal spread hey well decapitate a ballistic guilt gummy bear hit it look at him Wow steel splashes okay again the balls are touching and you have to ask is that's so bad well yeah because we were promised cheese cutter like performance and we expected to slice this gummy bear made out of ballistic gel completely in half and this thing just behaved like a low-power slug what are you are 18 yards who knows who she's talking all on a vaguely Asian reporter ready I'm ready Wow solid I was both balls please they they crew the thing was probably worth at least 1995 somebody online will tell us that it was worth a thousand dollars yeah it was worth it though she evidently took one of the forehead one of the balls I don't know what organization every time we predict what happened we're completely wrong when we show the I see footage I say I'm ready for chips into the road hot shot now as I often say slow motion does not like again the balls had almost no separation and instead of slicing the doll in half we just got kind of a mediocre impact with it what's into that impressive now you got to look at the bright side at least these rounds are accurate it would have really sucked if we missed every shot okay I'm ready macho culture oh I don't know I see one good hold on there I'll say mr. senator of the blue they obviously tore apart because we've got a bully impact hole here and the yellow out here this one kept the cable with it you see it did a little whiplash thing in there so it cut all the way through it cut all the way through if you come around the backside it a nice little flash okay now you can also hear I don't know if you can hear on camera but this one hit later than this one too there was a little bit of a zip sound to it so the cable slowed it down I think a little bit this was shot at about 35 yards and I want to be the first one to say that Greg was wrong the one with the cable attached actually hit first and out of the six rounds that we fired this was the only one that had a catastrophic failure the bubble round definitely has a nasty reputation but it's got a reputation that it really doesn't deserve it's a pretty low power round and it definitely doesn't function like we would expect it to with the cables spreading out now just adding more powder to it to make it more powerful probably would have worked against the design we saw that one round actually ripped the cable out of one of the balls so we probably would have seen more of that occurring just from the stress of trying to propel it much faster now ballistic machinists CNC machined steel slugs are the real deal and he is actually going to begin sewing these pretty soon and I said it because a lot of people have asked this if Tim sells the round side we have tested in some of our videos and it's kind of gone from a hobby into a potential business for Tim so that's really good news for him of course machining a slug out of Steel is a lot more expensive and time-consuming than just casting something out of lead so I'm kind of surprised he's able to price those slugs at such a competitive price I hope you enjoyed watching this video we

reloaders it's fortune cookie 45 else they come in two for the hot lead zone and many of you know that I am currently loading a bunch of these Russian slug loads using blue dot powder but I've also used a regular paradox before and this is a superbly accurate slug also shoots one whole groups big holes slow at 50 yards and a good load for this one is anything from 33 to 40 grains of blue dot but then I've also shot a bunch of these Russian hydrant slugs and they do very well with 40 grains of blue dot also but anyway but the other day I was answering comments on the fly and one of you out there had a request for some reloading data because I've been doing these videos in the Russian slugs but he isn't loading Russian slugs he is loading the old Lee ki dr slugs now so here's a close-up of your Lee one ounce key drive slug and they call it the key Drive because of that little partition there in the hollow base but there is a smaller or rather shorter 7/8 ounce slug and you see the balance of that of this slug is such that it rolls on to his nose all by itself so anyway one of the commenters out there had a request for more loading data for these slugs because he didn't quite appreciate the loading data that Lee provides and he wanted more loading data so I was gonna go ahead and find some loading data for him and sorry to say I didn't catch his name because I was doing all those comments on the fly and made a note that we wanted to do a video on the reloading data for the seven eighth ounce Lee slug but I missed the name so if you're out there to go ahead and post the comment and we'll make sure we get your name into the description of the video has many of you have come to know the superiority of a bore riding design with low bearing surface coupled with an integral wad that is constructed specifically for slugs that has a superior gas seal gives performance and accuracy that we cannot get with other systems such as what we've had to put up with for years and that is loading a li slug or other slug into a trap wad that was never designed for slugs in the first place designed to shoot shot at 1,250 feet per second and we're asking for these wads to shoot slugs at 1500 feet per second and the problem is anytime you have pedals on a sub o type idea where the pedals were never designed to be a sub oh the problem is that the pedals can strip and anytime a pedal strips or even degrades during firing you lose a lot of the accuracy plus the compression zones are never tough enough to handle of slugs so we've been doing Jerry Rings for years instead of proprietary designs meant for slugs and that's why the Russian systems have been working so well but suffice to say these systems still are popular because they are accurate enough at Short ranges say at inside 50 yards to take gear very well and hog in this kind of thing so because of all the shotguns out there and because of all the Lee slug molds out there there's still a lot of interest in loading these slugs in case you're wondering I found that the regular winchester not the substitutes but the regular winchester double a 12 wad is a very good wad to use with the Lee slugs so let's take a look at the lead reloading data that they provide with every slug mole they sell and here's the 1 ounce data and notice that one of the favorite loads there is 49 grains of blue dot that's a lot of powder just think about that one pound of powder you can load about 140 shells and that's it so here's the data for the seven eighth ounce least life from lead and you notice there's not a whole lot of powdered choices there we got a Kurd five and Hodgdon Universal and HS six and then a Kurd number two not a lot of choices so I don't blame the commenter for asking about more data for the 78,000 now that happens to be James that's loads of bacon over at the reloaders Network he's helping the holdup by background but all of you slugs shooters out there I strongly recommend that you get these two periodicals one is the Lyman shot show reloading handbook and the other is the BPI slug loading and filled application manual these are not expensive you'll use this information on a regular basis now in the Lyman shotshell reloading handbook you go to the section about slugs and you'll see a lot of loads for all different kinds of hulls and powders and all this kind of thing but the problem is that for slugs the Lyman ChaCha reloading handbook only gives loads for the Lyman foster slug and a Lyman 525 pellet slug well we can use this data and kind of extrapolate and substitute in the leaky Drive slugs but the problem is 7/8 ounce is not represented in the Lyman shot shop reloading handbook what you have here is is a one-ounce slug which is the foster slug by Lyman and a one in 3/16 sound slug in the Lyman 525 pellet slug sometimes we cast that pellet slug and it actually winds up more like 1 in 1 quarter ounces which is still a fine wait for a slug but the data doesn't really help us for the 7/8 ounce unless we extrapolate that we could do that but there's a better way and go to the section on lead shot which you see there lead shot now this is shot not slug but shot we can use this that's 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch in gold metal plastic cases fold crimp that's kind of very much like the holes that we use the load slugs which is the straight wall straight wall three-piece cell holes but let's go ahead look at this data now and you'll see that we can use tightwad red dot clays 700 X wst which is a target powder for shot shells made by Winchester this is a 7/8 ounce low recoil load all these are here are low recoil loads and then if you want more velocity we didn't go with the 7/8 ounce high velocity loads with this data and all the pressures are within semi specifications on the end there well some of you out there may be asking is a safe to use shot data for equivalent weight slugs and let's examine this question so the best way to answer that question is go to the BPI this happens to be the 6 Edition slug reloading and field application manual a very good manual doesn't have a whole lot of pages to it but what's there is very useful now the neat thing about this manual is that it does have data for the exact Lee 7/8 is key Drive slugs so here is the 1 ounce data right there including the pressure velocity that's the 1 ounce and you see all the powders are available there including the beckoned powders that's a imported powder but it's got green dot and has got clays and 700 X so it gives you a lot more choices for your one ounce slugs so there's your one ounce and here's your seven eighth ounce leaky drive sluggin I really like that green dot loaded now here's an interesting thing that you won't see in other reloading videos or shooting videos and that is take your BPI data that's 7/8 ounce leaky drive data and you go with the red dot load here 22 grains and that gives you a pressure of 10,500 psi which is 1,000 less than the maximum the Sammy take that as a maximum load and we're in business there then go back to our Lyman shot saw reloading data so here's your Lyman shot shell reloading manual and your 78,000 no recoil loads and you notice the red dot charges there are anywhere from 17 grains to 18 grains and there you have your starting load for your seven eight hours logged so we're from that two twenty two grains there's your starting load of 17 grains and your maximum load of 22 grains we're in business and by the way for those of you out there who want to use the exact wad that's in the BPI loading manual for the seven eight ounce leaky drive slug this is the wad that they recommend for all those loads it's the l0 78 wad from BPI not bad ten dollars seventy nine cents or two hundred fifty those they'll last you a couple of hunting seasons if you look at this wide it's got good design here you want a good sturdy compression zone here that will compress in a straight line you don't want this thing to go cockeyed as the round is firing the gases are pushing by and perhaps are causing the back end to get distorted and then this collapses in an improper way instead of a straight line collapse that's what you want that what you're looking for in a wad for slugs that's nowhere near as important for shot charges although for shot charges also we would like that but it's not as critical for slug accuracy it's critical so once again these two manuals are almost essential for slug reloaders the Lyman shot shot reloading handbook and the BPI that's ballistic products slug reloading and feel application manual now there are two major places that we would go to get our shots shell reloading supplies and equipment one would be the reloaders network and the other is ballistic products incorporated so over at the reloaders network we can get some real good stuff there especially the Russian slug molds now you could order those directly from Russia but then you don't really profit by colluding with the Russians and not only that but who knows what they'll do with your data and your credit card and other information you might be sending over there much better to get the Russian slug molds the Russian proprietary wads that are very important get those from real owners Network because we'll just go ahead and let James over there at the reloaders Network let him collude with the Russians but he's colluding with the Russians for us and I don't know about you but I appreciate that a whole lot anyway but over at the real owners Network also get all the fine nick ross products and that is like the the hall of vice the nick ross rolled printer and he also makes a very nice shell conditioner right here and a skiver all very handy to have if you check out the real owners network store mosey over there you can find a lot of interesting stuff the other great outfit to get all of our shots show reloading supplies and components is ballistic products incorporated and that's a fine come the out of Minnesota the Minnesota is a great state that's a battleground state we're going to be hearing a lot about Minnesota all through the year 2020 with the big elections coming up but anyway hello the Jeff officer Greg and Danny over at that fine site taofledermaus you wanna know about shotshell slugs and shooting them and all kinds of targets in the great outdoors that Visalia California they got some great ranges down there where there's this a lot open land and and long roads that shoot down the long roads and all this kind of thing fine sight fun and get a chance go ahead and check that one out if you haven't done it already most of you have by the way did you see recently how Jeff was down in some organic sludge water almost like sewer water wading around in there all because he needed to pick something either and and make the good video for us that's incredible and then officer Greg and Danny are getting themselves all beat up doing the slug those heavy slug loads that's above and beyond the call of duty as far as I'm concerned more power to them except maybe I should say less power to them now this manual doesn't just have data in it has all kinds of fine articles on how to's on doing the slug reloading and reloading shot shells just like the Lyman shot shot reloading manual a lot of great articles in their ballistic products has the biggest selection of wads you'll ever want to see imported ones also they also have their own version of the whole vise and their own roll crimper and doesn't have as many pins as the Nick Ross one but they work also you might want to check those out but look at this they have this stuff called wad slick which when you coach your wads with that by putting in a plastic bag with a little bit of this and you know you kind of shake it your wads go into your hulls a little bit easier and without distortion that's a material that's quite interesting if you get the BPI wads slick and you get a lot of it it's very economical all you got to do is take your bottleneck cartridge cases and just dip it into that wad slick and you've got the inside of your next lubricated nicely and it's easily removed even with a puff of error and works real well to keep your necks from stretching during resizing procedures a little tip you don't hear Bob from anywhere else anyway BPI is a great source for primed new empty shot shell holes for doing your slug reloading and makes it real easy because you got brand new hole to use and it's cheap like could be like less than ten cents for a primed hole and you don't even need to pay hazmat if you buy your primers for your shot shells and already primed hulls I especially like their Fiocchi with a 16 millimeter brass base that's already primed already skived ready to roll primp the feel keys they're like $12 for a hundred and they're already primed and if you need wads they got everything you need they got obturator wads they got wads that are fiber and also nitrile card wads and all kind of spacer wads and over shot wads a little thin discs that you could put over the top of your shot not only that but that's great for your slugs also some of your pointed slugs that are hard to roll crimp you put one of those over shot card wads on top of your slug and then roll crimp right under that you're in business then you got all these nice wads that are one piece now they've got hole trimmers in case you need to shortening your holes but I recommend that you go ahead and roll crimp because you just roll crimp it down you don't have to worry about trimming of your a holes and that's where the Nick Ross roll crimper comes in four pins like that well because there are so many shotguns out there and we have our own shotgun hunting seasons and all that kind of thing the interest in slugs shooting and also buckshot shooting we can load our own buckshot loads too but that's another subject for another video by the way doing good business is good policy I like leaders that are good business people good businessman or a good business woman and lying is bad business don't you think bye for now", "HJuW_bbZpZc": "okay in today's video we're going to talk about how many are in a cup well some people start to ask bodies anything I'll answer this question I'm doing a big search and research favorite internet and upon the answer from the Google which I got one cup is equal to accounts right well actually he's under extend for I mean the standard is of a u.s. thunder okay so one cup US dollar is equal to eight plutons in u.s. Kandra well I think that's all thank you for watching", "17b-GEBXCZw": "how to measure butter when we purchase butter we purchase it by weight and it usually comes in a one-pound box like this it might be a box that is this shape or it might be another shape but each box then contains four sticks so before we can measure we need to remember that sometimes when we measure ingredients their dry ingredients and we measure them in a certain way and we measure liquid ingredients in a certain way and butter is a solid ingredient so we're going to measure it the way that we measure solid ingredients another thing to remember since we're talking about weight we're talking about how heavy it is so if you see a measurement of pound or ounces we're talking about how heavy something is when you see cups tablespoons and teaspoons we're talking about volume which is how much space the item occupies and we're going to compare these two so we're going to start with weight and we're going to look at pants so one pound of butter we already said was comes in a box and sticks and there are four sticks in one pound of butter and so our sticks of butter I'm going to have four of these in one box one pound so each one then would be 1/4 of a pound so one pound is four sticks so what if we just have two sticks then we've got a half a pound we've still got each stick is 1/4 of a pound we put put them together and we have a half a pound so two sticks is a half a pound now what about volume what about cups remember volume is how much space it occupies and we're talking about cups and we're gonna be talking about tablespoons so if we have our four sticks here remember our four sticks are still one pound and each stick is still 1/4 of a cup of 1/4 of a pound but for volume our one pound is the same as two cups so each stick is now a half a cup so when we take two sticks together we get one cup and then these two sticks make one cup giving us two cups so 1/4 of a pound is the same as one half of a cup of butter and one half a pound of butter is the same as one cup and one pound of butter is the same as 2 cups weight how much it weighs volume is how much space it occupies one more volume measure that we look at when we look at butter is tablespoons alright and each stick of butter is eight tablespoons if we look at our real stick here you can see the tablespoons are clearly marked on our stick of butter and there's clearly eight of them okay so one stick of butter is this it's still a half a cup but it is eight tablespoons if we just have four of those tablespoons then we have a fourth of a cup if we just have two tablespoons we have an eighth of a cup okay so how do I measure out 1/4 of a cup for my recipe I've got a whole stick of butter I just need 1/4 of a cup well we know that the stick is 1/2 cup so if we want a fourth of a cup we're going to need 4 tablespoons because a half a cup is 8 tablespoons so for 1/4 of a cup we're going to need 4 tablespoons well if I count 1 2 3 4 we just need half of it so how do I do that pretty simple we are going to cut it with a knife so we take our stick of butter we count over 1 2 3 4 right through the paper we cut it I'm gonna have to give it another cut to get all the way through the paper on the bottom and we have 1/4 of a cup or 4 tablespoons here and 1/4 of a cup or 4 tablespoons here so if my recipe called for 1 tablespoon or 2 tablespoons I would simply count the tablespoons on the package and I would just cut here for 1 tablespoon or I could cut here if I needed 2 tablespoons but butter is simple you cut it with a knife", "-0YOcPgLsH8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright guys went back today with another high value LP V or low-power variable optics review from Swamp Fox and this is one of the most requested companies I've had this year for me to take a look at you know their scopes or their red dots now OpticsPlanet was nice enough to send this tomahawk out to the channel for us to try out it's a second focal plane one to eight with a bullet drop compensation reticle exposed turrets and illuminated reticle the price point of this guy right now is actually on sale at OpticsPlanet for 329 I had that coupon code 704 tactical for 5% off your order this puts it right in the price range of a lot of the vortex and primary arms optics but this one has some features and it also doesn't have some features that some of those other ones have so let's talk about the specs and features it's performance out of the range and what I think about this compared to some other LTVs on the market I also have this optics sitting in a swamp fox mount and OpticsPlanet also sent the mount out to the channel now it shifts the optic forward just a little bit allowing you for the proper eye relief on your rail section you can see where I have it mounted if I had to ship it back it would be a little bit awkward to shoot this optic without extending my stock beyond the point where I feel comfortable so an lpv optic like this I always suggest an offset mount this particular one again is the swamp fox independence mount for the 30 millimeter rings and it does shift it forward it feels like it locks up incredibly solid that nothing walk loose and it also has some really nice mounting hardware on the sides to lock everything into place and it has these extended hoods right here and I believe that just helps get a little bit more traction on the optic itself so a very solid mount and the best thing about this one is is it's on sale for about forty six dollars so that is pretty cool there's some other options available but it is a high value mount that I can absolutely recommend so let's start off by talking about the basics and as we do that I want to show you guys the side right here because this details a lot about the optic and if for some reason I can't leave some information in the description below you can kind of pause this and look over it it's a 1 to 8 by 24 millimeter it's got a half MOA click adjustments and it is sitting on a 30 MOA tube and this is a second focal plane optic meaning as you zoom in and out the reticle stays the same size and honestly for LP V's most of the time I love a second focal plane radical because when you're at the 1 power setting the reticle is still really large allowing you for CQB shots and the illumination to take effect on the edge glass reticle allowing you to make quick target acquisition z' but when you zoom it out to the 8th power setting it's still large that way you can see all of the different bullet drop compensation z' at different distances so that is what I like about this optic that it is a second focal plane optic the next thing I want to talk about from that list of specs and features is the fact that this is a 30 millimeter tube and it gathers a lot of light shooting this and lower light scenarios works really well and I had no problems gathering light then it goes over to some of the other features I want to talk about like the turrets themselves and the illumination knob the turrets themselves are very exposed they stick out very far and have very nice cuts and texturing to them and you listen to the clicks so they're very audible and tactile and the clicks are done very nicely overall the fit and finish on this optic is very good and I would expect that for the price range of about three hundred and twenty nine dollars now here's a problem that I've seen with the turrets as they are not locking turrets and since they are so exposed large and have these knurlings you can accidentally bump them and click them over that is why resetting them to zero is important which I still need to do on this one so that is something to consider if you're using this for like a combat style or three gun optic and you're going off barriers if you bump this you may knock it over a few clicks I haven't personally done that but that is something to consider the illumination op is very nice and it has positive detents so it does kind of clip in the place and again you have some very nice neroli and texturing right here it takes one cr2032 battery now the battery life is not going to be amazing on these things if you are about to go to a competition or use a personal defense I would definitely regularly check the batteries but that is with pretty much every single lpv because you are emitting on to an etch glass reticle and it just sucks up the batteries it's not like one of the LED emitters on a red dot moving back this one has an adjustable dial / to focus everything in and it has a one to eight throw now this is cool because most of the options come with a throw lever that bolts on and without a throw lever it would be really difficult to kind of throw that from the 1 to 8 but I really like that so you can put it on the one power setting get a wide field of view then quickly zoom in and use that bullet drop compensation reticle to make your shots at a distance now that we've covered most of the features let's talk about its performance glass clarity down at the range as well as how the bullet drop compensation actually worked the glass on this is insanely clear it is a very good set of glass on this optic the one power truly seems like a 1 power so you can use that glass up close and the edge clarity is very nice also I was shooting this guy at 300 yards and the glass allowed me to pick up the target perfectly you may see some slight distortion because of the camera picking up a lot of the grass in front of the optic but I can tell you guys looking down this optic it is super clear and I hope that the intro gives you some resemblance of what the optic looks like looking down but again you've got a camera looking through two lenses before it finally gets to here and there is some distortion but the glass is crystal clear on this optic very nice for the $325 price point the reticle itself is also very nice and it is explained very well for different types of bullets and the drops accordingly and the instruction manual so you guys can see the different marks and the MOA settings and you can pause this if necessary if you want to gather any more information about the bullet drop compensation reticle I can tell you this from 0 to 300 is where I shot this optic and it was dead on using that bullet drop compensation I was knocking out half-size silhouettes at 300 yards no problem whatsoever with this alpha shooting sports upper assembly so in summary guys this is a solid optic with a lot of very nice features there are some cool things like the included throw lever and overall ease of use with the controls that I feel like are a little bit better than some others on the market now some others may have more intuitive reticles for specific bullets like the primary arm specifically tailors the reticle for different cartridges if you want a more do all bullet drop compensation reticle this is not necessarily designed for specific cartridges rather than MOA based setup and it gives you rough estimations in this booklet now all of these optics that I've reviewed in the past the best thing to do is kind of go rewatch those videos and get your own direct comparisons some people may be using this for three guns some people may be using this for long-range to mid-range shooting and some people may be using this for CQB only you know what fits you best I can only cover the highlights and the highlights for this guy is the fact that it works really well it holds zero the glass clarity is nice the BDC reticle is very slick and it does have some very nice features like these turrets and throw lever with the downfall of the fact that you could bump these turrets and knock them loose since they're not locking also Swamp Fox is gaining a name for itself a few years ago this may be more of a a newer brand but it is proving itself in a lot of different places so I am really beginning to trust this brand especially after using some of these products so I hope this gives you another high value option for an LP V that you can add to your ar-15 that will not completely break the bank but again it is a little bit more elevated at the $329 price point thanks for watching guys and thanks again the OpticsPlanet for sending this out to the channel for us to try out have a good one", "WL-gmu4-nbE": "[Music] similarity and right triangles okay we're talking about in right triangles things that are similar all right if you have a triangle let's say you have a right triangle if you draw the altitude which we know an altitude in real life is like whenever can you see that now great all right altitude in real life is whenever you're measuring something from a distance straight down to the ground we go without you of a plane you go from a plane straight down and to the ground that makes a 90-degree angle okay so and our right triangle which looks nut here as good as mother if we draw an ounce to from the hypotenuse really right there which means it makes a 90-degree angle these triangles we formed are similar to each other and they are also similar to the whole triangle okay good so let's try to label this a b c d all right let's call the similar triangles triangle ABC what did that first a b c now every other triangle we're going to try to match up with with that trying pause gonna talk all right first thing always match up we put a first it's our hypotenuse let's do that okay you saw pockets there let's do this triangle square second triangle is your third triangle okay the right triangle here is d all right and then the right triangle here is d as well I'm sorry yes three for that third triangle all right now it's final match with V in this triangle that match with V and this next triangle angle a is what matches up and then in this triangle it's going to be angle C all right and then the last one we have to match up with V steel over here I'm sorry I got ahead myself Betsy alright and then the last thing last ankle would be safe from the big triangle look at this triangle over here that would be a no would be IEP and then over here I think I've jacked this whole thing up but what you're gonna do is you're going to match it up okay with all the angles and it matches up with goody-goody gumdrops I could educate y'all so well in such a great way all right whatever that's pretty easy once you figure it out they'll have annual measures that will help you measure that match everything up I did not do that however so next section or not next section the next part the last part of this need to learn is called geometric geometric mean okay it means two numbers like a times B equals their geometric mean which is X same geometric mean equals x squared okay so if you want you to write it this way square root of a times B equals our geometric mean either way it's fine okay but you need to have those alright goody goody gumdrops let's try with some numbers okay instead we've got four and nine we found the geometric mean four times nine equals x squared 4 times 9 is 36 what do I do to your to the squared square root so B 6 equals x that's the geometric mean let's do it for 6 and 15 or this happens to be my birthday all right so 6 times 15 is 90 equals x squared you get the square root also top they're going to want it simplest radical form so we do the square root of 90 we know 9 goes into a square root of 9 square root of 10 squared of 9 is 3 police grove with 3 square roots of 10 and your answer okay and that's all you're looking forward to you must remain last thing you need to know on a need-to-know basis is how we can find the geometric mean the reason I even touching the geometric mean is so you can use it in right triangles okay now let's give us a bigger out training run like this okay right triangle all right label everything Amy we'll call it an a/b it'll call this whole length see it was drawn altitude right there we have an X Y and H H height that's one x and y all right now let's see what this term is says the length of the altitude to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the geometric mean of the lengths of the two segments of the hypotenuse okay so that means that this altitude right here is the geometric mean of these two parts that make up top honors okay so let's say now another thing you might not have known is that the legs like the legs right here they are the geometric mean of the hypotenuse and that height but my sense no I'm sorry I'm apologizing the legs of the triangle are the geometric mean of the side of the hypotenuse right next to it and Bob - itself okay so a squared equals x times C make sure I told you that right yes I did all right now for B it's geometric mean it would be a geometric meaning of the side next up which is y times the whole thing which is C okay that's pretty much it not too shabby let's work some problems together some example problems okay I'll leave these up here hi well a mark mom because you need to learn that's where the line is throwing in the pool we're not swimming what okay she's that kid is my camera beautiful all right let's say this is our X right here oh my Z I have to bear with me I can't read so I'm just going to looking for patterns and stuff plus my books isn't books in French so it's like a double negative does that make sense okay I'm still about even really I'm just talking about listening little - okay - and this will be X I believe don't know BC okay that'll be easy cuz I want to go next I'm stupid okay and then Y and then tan I'm sorry for that 20 minute intervention where else thinking about what I want to do okay so let's say I want to find all these measures okay let's see we know these two and we know that this is the geometric mean of these two so we did two times 10 which is 20 and we get the square root of 20 because we already did x squared now I did a skipped a bunch of steps all rewriting equals x squared that's 20 and then we divide by screw to get that okay so that's the square root of 20 which we do simplest radical form that's going to be 2 times square root of 5 but I'm illegal like this okay because that's what I want to do and I can do it everyone's on the map keep sure now you have two right triangles here right there and right there so if you want to do Pythagorean theorem to find that at the vagary do Mathon that it's if you wanted to okay or we can do what we just learned okay now we just learned that if I got the leg of a right triangle right here then this and the whole thing which we know two plus ten is 12 that's going to be our geometric main stuff okay equals Z squared that's 2450 square root of 24 the simplest radical form which is 2 times the square root of 6 and you're done so 2 times square root of 6 I guess I should write this 2 times root 5 and we do the same thing for y y equals water sorry the geometric mean of 10 and 12 8 120 so y equals the square root of 120 it's simples radical form for that and we get see you got a number who cares I won't do it and peace", "z4ReV_UKKzw": "this video is intended for a mature audience if you are not a mature audience then do not watch this video so I got lucky recently I found a dispensary location I shot that pretty regularly they decided to close that location and they were getting rid of some of the flower / the cheapest I've ever seen and I'll show you the receipt here because like it's so cheap I got an ounce of flour you'll see on here 28 grams of a sativa dominant strain for 25 cents okay after-tax it's 27 cents for 28 grams that is less than a one penny per gram that is the absolute cheapest flower I have ever seen I mean it is so cheap I have to go back again they were doing a limit of one per day on the house and so I went back as many times I couldn't only ended up being 2 ounces but I got this for a basically the cost of a gumball and then an ounce of sunflower and it's not nice is definitely the best I've ever seen so we got two rounds this year we're gonna take a closer look at then we're gonna get into it here but I mean they're obviously if you're building the cheapest week you ever seen you're not getting rest you ever seen them but that is not gonna stop me from driving it up and letting on fire [Music] okay let's take a closer look at this [Music] and I've been on a CVD pretty quietly it's really nice to plant some CBD flower but this looks good I would buy this every time I saw it for a quarter even I mean this is not the everyday price but if they happen to the crazy sale like this was a basically giving it away I'm gonna go get it that one's the good meds and then this one in here is the Terps this one is a sativa dominant strain I believe it's higher in THC but it's also higher in Leafs and stems not bad died I would seriously buy this every time for that price oh you couldn't turn this down because you can do so much with an ounce of flower but I've got a few pieces out let's crack into this let's get some of this going [Music] okay I need you to drop a comment right now and whether you think I can or can not smash five bowls in a row I packed five and I'm just gonna do one take of this probably speeded up so comment now if you think that I'm gonna be able to all be able to smash five-foot-two Monroe [Music] [Applause] [Music] well I didn't I totally bought this as I thought like I would like it she did not I'm

legal smoking age leave this video now anyway doctor uh dr. strange has got a strain called CBD dog it's a quarter ounce it's like seventeen percent CBD um but like 22 percent cannabinoids it's got oh I'm just kind of decent decent amount of cannabinoids in it this is $21.99 I believe but just the looks of these buds it's very nice just in the pack so we're gonna dive right into this review and you'll have a look at it good smell but immediately what I notice is just how dense and hard the buds look you know they're they're a break I mean I'm squeezing it I mean able to crunch it those are dense buzz trim jobs great that's some great trim but I'm squeezing on my way mmm that's excellent an excellent smell is good slow to me smells more fruity and berry than the purple lifter did um exactly what its kind of smelled like all right like this is I just saw these few little mugs up here this is 1/4 ounce now that's the same cold around go around now 9 grams 9 grams these things are I mean they're like rocks I'm just solid this is that you mean you've ever smoked some of if you ever got ahold of like AMOG from the Blackwater had smoked seed of the smoked CBD coms got it too but um you understand what I'm talking about on dense buds it's like Little Rock's almost but um they claim the strain is seedless to boost the grinder out real quick was the space community was really really good I enjoyed it you know to me it was like a nighttime high not one of us was on this was just the shape when I've rolled something up and it's just a little left forward off in this uh my

they're like anyway right here he weighs and grind him up 1.0 fourth of gram that's a gram but I pop this little spell off but I mean you can see I can get you to focus if I get to focus it's got a good snap to it very very dense buds very dense it does have a fruity aroma this is my first time smoking CBD dog o CB dog is really how it's spelled the purple lifter last night was definitely a different definitely a different high or both having to look at there's a different you know in part of the wrecks with fluffy own light and fluffy no seeds looks like a good strain I'm wall I'm gonna

uh all the different attachments onto my new heat press so i've had lots and lots of questions about this um and i want to show you it's pretty easy it's pretty straightforward um but you are going to want to know how to do this so that you can take advantage of the fact that you have an eight in one heat press so um if you have join me last week i did an unboxing one of the big reasons that i decided to finally get an eight in one is i have multiple size heat presses i have a different press for mugs a different press for hats just a regular press so this will help me to consolidate in what everybody has at some point is an unlimited and not an unlimited amount of space right okay so here's the thing the press comes like this um it has this cable which is attached to the top platen so that needs to be plugged in i'm gonna just take the whole cord out so that i'm not fighting with it but it will come with a power cord which obviously you need to use um at all times okay so i'm not gonna plug it in today because we're going to be working with it but this is how the press comes it has this coil here that needs to go into [Music] the um connection on basically the base this is where the heat is going to be provided this is where the control is okay so every attachment that you have is going to have one of these cables that needs to be added so if you if you have one of these presses and you get power to it and you're like why isn't it heating up which just speaking from experience the reason is because you need to do this okay so you also have um this is the mug press okay this is one of the sizes of the mug press this part is separate you'll see it has its own cable so for this one you literally can just keep it right next to it and you need to attach it so that's all that works for that now the mug press as i said the mug press does come with multiple size um attachments and multiple shapes so if you're using a tumbler if you're using um a smaller mug if you're using a mug that's you know contoured um you'll have you'll be able to do all of them so i'm just going to show you um all of these these are all of for the mug press okay so in order to use them use one at a time you would take actually put this to the side a little bit and there are these four screws right on top of here that you unscrew and that's where you just will replace the um size of the mug that you're using this one's these are stuck tight on there okay oh that one's red oh there we go okay all right so you just unscrew them and then this pops right off of there okay and you would replace it with one of these others okay so this back a little bit but from underneath squeeze it together [Music] and slide it on there okay and then put the screws back in all right now you'll see this one has its own cable okay so this is pretty straightforward for the mug press let me just get these back on here okay so this one would allow me to do a larger size and i don't know if it tells you the exact size on the actual um attachment or not but it does tell you in the little guide that comes with it the different sizes okay i think there's like an 11 ounce and a 16 ounce and then a mug one and okay so pretty easy right and then this goes into um here when this is so your press itself needs to be powered on and this needs to be connected and that's how the heat works okay so let's get the mug out of the way now i'm going to move this so that we have a little bit more room okay um you also have these two these are plate plate presses okay plates as in like dish plates okay so what you need to do to use these these actually attach to the larger system up here so what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn this now in the top of the heat press and you probably can't see it but your press is going to come with this large screwdriver and in the top of the press you have two holes and it's where you can access these screws okay now i'm going to put this down so that my top doesn't just flop away and you see what i'm doing this is sort of awkward so let me back you up a little bit more anyway those screws are very important okay because what that does is it allows you to put the different attachments on and off okay all right so let's take this off there's only two of them hold on to the screws you don't want to lose these okay and the reason that i you saw the reason that i um put the press down is because watch what happens oops you gotta get that screw completely out of there i can't really see what i'm doing because i'm trying to give you guys the angle okay so that screw comes completely out too okay so i've got those and then when i lift this up i'm able to take the top plate of my press off what that allows me to do is then use this to attach the various size mug plates so it has these this one has its own screws on here and you don't need to undo them there's a spot in here that you literally just slide it this one looks like it needs to be loosened a little bit so that i can slide it just gonna okay you don't need to take them completely out but it's like a larger spot and then it can slide i don't know if you can see that and then you got holes at the top and you can tighten it okay so that would be you can do that for the two plate presses and then you're just using the bottom what you normally do but again you need to plug this in okay so that's where the heat comes from and you have two different sizes so if you have like a bowl that has a flat bottom you can use this if you have a plate same thing only one can go on at a time okay now you also have a hat press i'm going to take this off again you don't need to completely unscrew this because of the way this allows you to just pop it off all right so keep the screws screwed in there somewhat so that you don't lose them okay now i keep everything in this basket this is a 12 by 12 basket just to give you an idea then you have the hat press the head press comes in two different pieces okay so with the half press you actually need to remove this base as well so underneath here there are some like butterfly um screws and you're gonna unscrew them i loosened them a little bit yesterday while i was fooling around with this so i can tell you guys how to do this but you need to loosen them if you are trying to do this and that's really tight get like a um um not a wrench a pliers and you'll i'm going to show you the screw so you can see in a second here okay so it's like this little you probably can't see that these are what's there okay and there's two of them so you're going to do that on both sides you're going to undo those again keep them close to you okay now when you do that this bottom part comes off okay okay so you don't need that right now i'm gonna put these to make sure i don't lose them it goes on the top okay so then you have the bottom part of the mug the hat press so again the half crust goes together like this it can't you know because your hat the brim of your hat or the top part of the hat it has you can see it has these two cutouts that goes right on the same screws and you're gonna use the same butterfly um i i don't know the name of these things it looks like a butterfly to me and you're gonna put that on there so it's nice and tight keeps this in place okay all right you're gonna do that for both sides and then you're going to put the top on okay so i'm going to turn this to the side again this top piece has these two screws that are sticking out they go in the same part okay and we'll screw those in using the screwdriver that they gave you okay keep it back so it's tight okay and again you plug the cable from the hot press in because this base the control panel is where all the heat comes from and then you have some control over um where this comes down and the pressure obviously but that's how that works okay so those are the eight different things the regular flat press it's 15 by 15. two different size um plate presses that makes three four different size mugs that makes seven and then the hat press is eight which is why it's called an eight in one so again now you need to put this thing back together look this is not something you're going to be switching out you know oh i want to make one hat now i want to make one shirt now i want to make i would do you know as you know you spend your time wisely obviously but if you're going to do a bunch of hats and stuff do them all at the same time okay okay take this off you might be able to get away with just taking one off let's see yeah okay all right and then we have to put we have to put the um regular part of the press back on all right so the only thing that's totally separate is that mug press but it still requires this part of the press to be powered on okay so now i just need to put this all back together let's see if i can do this this might be a little a little awkward here it is easier if you only take one of these off and tighten because of just you know your hand it's just hard to fit your hand under there i saw see a bunch of you guys texting or commenting it's difficult to see all right so let me just but i want to put this all back together because i wanted you guys to see how you know pretty quickly and easily this is possible to do now yesterday when i was putting oh there we go okay um now these are back ordered right now because they've been so popular so they have come in teal pink um coral and white they're exclusively from swing design they are 449 regularly 49 499.99 um but they are back ordered right now and should be shipping it sounds like in late march early april um as you guys know with the pandemic things have been very crazy production wise manufacturing and shipping so many delays um okay so while i do this i'm just going to scoot this down so it makes it a little bit easier on myself to line this up i need that back like that excuse me and then just screw this back on here and then you have to do the other one too excuse me all right and whoops you gotta fit your hand in there and again this screwdriver which comes comes with it okay i really didn't understand why they were giving me a screwdriver until i started swapping out the um parts and then i then it made much more sense okay all right so now we are back to normal and you have the cord that you want to plug in okay all right so i know a lot of you guys were wondering like how did you do all that um you can obviously this video will be on on silhouette school's facebook page under videos it'll also go on um youtube shortly it populates over there very quickly and automatically um so if you ever want to come back and watch it or if you're wondering like what is this press but that's exactly how you put that stuff all together and soon we'll start doing tutorials with this it's pretty fun it's pretty straightforward and easy and again if you're short on space and want to do lots of different things you know heat pressing or sublimating on multiple types of surfaces where a flat press is just not going to be enough but you don't have room for three or four separate presses this is a good economical option plus if you have an issue which i did yesterday with i couldn't figure out which of these screws you can there's customer support um and you can contact swing directly to ask you know for help with this and that's not something that you'll probably be able to get directly on amazon or anywhere so okay you guys i hope you have a fabulous day see you soon",

Its high-protein, low-carbohydrate combo works\nwell in diets and it\u2019s often more appealing than just eating vegetables alone. Many customers prefer to buy an 8-ounce chicken\nbreast. For some of them, it is enough for a week,\nwhile serious athletes could consume it in a single day. According to different sources, an 8 ounces raw chicken breast contains around 50 grams protein. After cooking, however, 8 ounces of fried\nor baked chicken breast contains about 70 grams of protein. If you need very accurate data, carefully\ncheck product labels before buying any product. I should admit that nutritional facts about\nthe same product differ in available databases and on supermarket shelves. Almost 80 % of the calories you can get from\n8 ounces of chicken breast come from protein. The remaining 20 % of the calories are fat. If you are not a fan of chicken breasts but\nstill want to take advantage of their beneficial protein, you can replace them with chicken\nthighs. The thigh offers enough protein with the additional\nbenefit of providing more nutrients. It is also cheaper\u2014you just need to deal\nwith a bone when preparing or eating. Another alternative is shrimp. You will get around 50 grams of protein and\nonly 4 grams of fat eating 8 ounces of shrimp. Salmon is also a good replacement for chicken\nbreast. A serving of 8 ounces of salmon provides 46\ngrams of protein. It does contain a bit more fat than chicken\nbreasts. Does it provide enough protein? On average, 70 grams are enough to provide\nyour body the amount of protein it needs per day if you lead a sedentary lifestyle. According to the Dietary Reference Intake,\npeople need 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight every day. This number is the recommended requirement\nof the human body to operate and prevent protein deficiency. However, your body requires more to exercise\nintensely and also during low carb diets. In these cases, you even need to double your\nprotein intake.", "rEXifo3mqYE": "hi my name is Evan English from Old English Outfitters today we're going to talk about how to read and understand all the numbers on the end of a shotshell box [Music] from the time I was about ten years old I was spending time in the field with my father I was also spending time in the store here learning about safety about the about the technical aspects of firearms so I kind of grew up in the field grew up in the store at the same time one of the things we love to do together was shoot shotguns whether it was out in the field hunting birds hunting game over our dogs or whether it was clay bird sports where we were shooting skeet or trap or sporting clays so as we did that I had to learn what the right things were and try to choose the right ammo for the tasks that we were about to do those numbers are important that we're about to decipher one to choose the safe load for your shotgun to make sure that you're doing the right thing based on the tolerances of your shotgun and the second is task-oriented we want to make sure that we're choosing the right shell to match the tasks that we're about to do whether it's a light target load for target sports or whether it's a heavier load for hunting game we're gonna make sure we're choosing the right amo for the task the first number we're gonna look at on any box of shot shells is going to be the gauge if you look at the gauge here this is a 12-gauge the most common gauges are ten gauge which would be bigger and then twenty 28 and 410 which should all be smaller easier to remember this that the larger the number the smaller the gauge the smaller the number the larger the gauge for the purposes of today we're going to talk about 12-gauge it is the most common gauge that we use here in the United States and chances are that most of you are using a 12-gauge at some point in time or another 12-gauge eni's this gauge needs to be matched up with your gun barrel somewhere on your gun barrel it should state what gauge your shotgun is if it's 12-gauge if it's a 16 gauge if it's a 20 gauge if any of these gauges you need to make sure it matches up with this gauge the second number that you'll see on the box is the length of the shell this is the length of the shell after it has been fired so as you're looking here at two and three-quarter inches if I were to pull one of these shells out that's part of this box of ammo two and three-quarter inches would be the measurement after this shell has been fired if you were to measure it empty comparatively the longest 12-gauge shot shell would be three and a half inches after its fired these are both the same gauge but very different chamber lengths you want to make sure that this matches up to your shotgun if your shotgun has a maximum chamber length of three inches then you can shoot up to a three inch shell in your shotgun you don't want to shoot bigger than that if your chamber length is two and three-quarter inches then this is the maximum length shell that you can shoot in your shotgun safely some people have argued that I can put a three-inch in my two and three-quarter inch chamber and that is true it will fit in there but when you fire it it will open into the forcing cone and cause extra pressure so make sure you match that number up the third number that you see here is the velocity the velocity that's on this particular box of shells is 1220 feet per second so that's gonna give you some idea of how fast that it is moving how fast it's moving its payload which would be the shot charge this is the next number but the velocity also gives you an indicator of of its overall power of the shell on some boxes you'll find a dram equivalent on this particular box of target loads you'll see a velocity here but then on this you'll see the DRAM equivalent DRAM equivalent is a kind of a throwback to the age of black powder a dram was one sixteenth of an ounce of black powder and it gave you an indicator when you looked at a dram equivalent to the amount of power or energy that that show was storing up we see it more directly related to the velocity these days than we do the overall power but it is a function of both of these numbers so that dream equivalent will help you a little bit but it does not tell you the whole story the velocity may tell you the next number that you find on this box is the payload or the shot charge the amount of shot that is in the shot shell these particular ones are one and a quarter ounces this target load that you see here is announced in an eight and if you were to take a magnum load in a three and a half inch turkey load you'll see that that is two ounces so comparing these three numbers ounce and a quarter ounce in an eighth this is about 10 percent 10 to 15 percent less however this is a much longer shell and it's a whole lot more almost double the target load another 30 percent 33 percent more than a standard field love these are important numbers the higher the higher the shot charge the more recoil on the backside where you're standing and also the higher the shot charge depending on what shot size you're using but also means more pellets going out the end of the barrel there's a good balance that has to be found here on shot charge because you want to make sure that you've got enough shot charge to do the job not too little not too much you don't want to endure a bunch of recoil this particular load would not be that fun if you were shooting 75 to 100 rounds in the Dubb field one day or shooting at clay Birds whereas a lighter shot charge might be much better for for us the way you don't need a lot of energy or a lot of shot and you want to be able to shoot a lot of shots without enduring a bruised shoulder the last number that you'll see here on the box is the shot size shot size is important because it tells you the size and somewhat the weight of the shot that you're shooting as we look at the shot size this one is they've given us icons that this is for hunting it's showing the pheasant a squirrel a rabbit so we know that this is a they've given us every indicator that this is a hunting load but many people don't know what those are as I'm looking at the this particular display I can see that it's showing me some some shot sizes going from trip alot buckshot all the way around to be be at the six o'clock position here and then wrapping back around up to the number nine shot back up here at almost 12 o'clock showing me the smallest shot most of your target loads are gonna be in this seven and a half eight nine shot most of your hunting loads for lead shot are gonna be in this 6 5 4 5 being a great balance between sixes which just got a little more shot and fours which gives you better penetration so that's kind of a ideal balance you'll see most hunting loads in this range twos fours bb's those you don't see a lot of those anymore because of changes in waterfowl hunting but these used to be very big for waterfowl hunting probably 20 years ago so if you look at these here you'll see that those are bigger these buckshot loads you'll find those used in defense loads or for something to reach out very far you won't find a lot of these in a shell so for instance a double-aught buck you might find nine pellets in a 12-gauge shell and those are what you would find in a say a defense loved this trip a lot double out there and the the 30 32 caliber range and and then these are much smaller diameter loads so coming back to reading the box where we started we've got the shot size and it's going to be based on what you're trying to accomplish with that shot shell will determine the shot size that you choose so in review coming back we've got the gage make sure that this matches up with your shotgun the chamber length also make sure that this matches up with your shotgun these are really important for safety you don't want to put a 20 gauge in a 12-gauge 12-gauge chamber it might go off it could cause a very unsafe situation the chamber lengths again make sure that the two and three-quarter inch will work in a three inch but not vice versa make sure that you're shooting the right length shell that is your gun is suited for it choosing the right power is important you want to make sure that you choose the right velocity the right power shell to go with your go with your task that you're trying to accomplish so this is a very task-oriented number also the shot charge making sure that you've got enough pellets going out the end some people like to get more velocity and less shot charge so these kind of bounce one another here and then the last number the shot size this won't make a difference for any of these others this only has to do with your intended use and that's how you choose the shot size one of the last things I want to dispel before we before we stop is the whole idea of high brass low brass the reason for high brass on a shot shell has to do with back in the days where shot shells were made out of paper and they had to have a higher brass on them in a higher power shell to make sure that the black powder didn't burn through the paper causing the shell to separate inside the gun today we do it still put the higher brass or the higher collar on the [ __ ] on higher power shells as a visual indicator and as a helpful note for those choosing the loads lower power would be lower brass or lower collar again not necessarily limit burn throughs but still important as a visual indicator and helpful to let you know which one to choose for what tasks well that's about it for today I want to thank you for joining us and for watching this video if you like what you saw

grams and ounces right so a gram is a metric unit of weight which is 1,000 of a kilogram that simply means that 1,000 grams make one kilogram and ounces is a unit of void that equals 28 point three four nine five grams now grams kilograms milligrams they come from the metric system whereas ounces is used in the US now in order to convert grams and ounces the conversion factor that I like to use is twenty-eight point three four nine five now as I said earlier one ounce is equal to twenty eight point three four nine five grams right so if you had to convert grams to ounces you will divide the amount in grams by twenty eight point three four nine five and if you have to convert answers to grams you multiply by twenty eight point three four nine five example how many Ounces are there in ten grams that means you're trying to convert grams into ounces and in order to convert grams to ounces we need to divide by twenty eight point three four nine five s that's the conversion factor so ten grams divided by twenty eight point three four nine five the answer you get is 0.35 another example how many grams are there in five ounces so this time you are trying to convert ounces to grams so you have five ounces multiplied by twenty eight point three four nine five and that will give you 140 one point seven four eight grams now I've also stated the formulas there's two formulas that you can use first one is for grams so grams is equal to answers multiplied by twenty eight point three four nine five and the second formula shows ounces is equal to grams divided by twenty eight point three four nine five so you can either use the diagram I show Oh make a note of this formula and learn these formulas to convert between grams and ounces and you need to remember the conversion factor these other conversion factors as well what I like to use twenty eight point three four nine five because I find that easy to remember and you can change the decimal places as well I'm using two four decimal places you can use three or two or even one or even and that's up to you so remember this diagram and you should be fine right in the conversion factor twenty-eight point three four nine five let's try some questions number one convert 12 grams to ounces number two how many grams make up seven ounces and number three if a bag of potatoes is 1,000 grams how much is this announces so number one convert 12 grams 2 ounces so 12 grams divided by 28 point 3 4 9 5 gives you zero point 4 2 3 3 ounces number 2 how many grams make up 7 ounces so you're converting answers to grams you multiply 7 x 28 point 3 4 9 5 gives you one hundred ninety-eight point four four six five grams and the last question you converting 1000 grams to ounces so one thousand divided by 28 one three four nine five to give you 35 point two seven three nine ounces and that's how you convert between grams and ounces so here is the diagram against Gramps to answers you divide by twenty eight point three four nine five and answers to grams you need to multiply by twenty eight point three four nine five I've used the conversion factor to four decimal places it's up to you how many decimal places you would like to use thank you very much for watching please share and subscribe for more", "gHtAjwzntQQ": "hello what is up everyone it's the silver Spartan back from another video so today I'm gonna be talking about gold specifically as opposed to silver I'll bring up silver a little bit but as you can see right here I have $1,300 in cash I have one ounce of gold so this is one of the Queen's beasts one ounce gold coins this is the red dragon of Wales staring nein nein nein nein fine so 9999 parts out of 10,000 fine you know focus on this thing there we go yeah so one ounce of 2017 I really like them because I don't I thought there's wasn't a lot of extra premium I was paying for somewhat collectible coin but for the most part it's just wait one ounce of gold at the end of the day so right now the spot price being at just about $1300 I believe it was one thousand two hundred ninety nine or something when I last checked so it's pretty much right about here and I thought that I'd have a little discussion on why you might want to have a gold versus $30 so what a lot of people don't realize when they go to see you is that even if you save a lot of money over time it won't really matter if there's a lot of inflation taking place so for example a lot of you might know how the price of goods has gone up over time if you'd notice how a while back you could buy a soda or a hot dog or a movie ticket 20 years ago for way less than you can buy one now just because of inflation the value of each dollar that you own is decreasing every single year so that's something that's not necessarily true for gold well gold does have years where it goes down for the most part over long periods of time it will relatively keep up with inflation if not beat it so gold is a better investment when it comes to storage of wealth money is a better investment it comes in terms of savings so while this is a way to save more dollars over time if every time you make $100 just put it in a stack and that's just how you're gonna choose to save your money opposed a gold um over time inflation will make the value of what you have go down but if you invest in gold as a long-term storage as long long-term investment I don't know if I want to say investment necessarily I think I would like to say wealth storage because at the end of the day gold and silver I've made videos on this and lots of people don't love them but at the end of the day gold and silver won't make anyone rich and I know that's gonna anger a lot of people that follow this that our hoard and gold and silver thinking that the price is going to go to the moon and that they're gonna get crazy rich but the end of the day gold and silver is not gonna make anyone a rich rich rich gold and silver are going to preserve your wealth so as inflation goes on gold and silver prices will likely steadily increase to somewhat keep up with the inflation and it's a way to store your wealth so that that $100 that you have today you put it into $100 with the gold which these things are slightly more probably about 150 but here's a 1/10 gold coin so the spot person that would be about 130 but you probably end up paying 140 150 I'm not really sure off the top of my head what they're going for but over time the value of that asset should pretty much stay even so that in 20 years from now let's say $100 now is worth about $300 then just due to inflation or $100 now is worth the hundred and twenty dollars that depending on inflation because nobody really knows what exactly inflation is gonna do that one ounce of gold about 110 thousand gold to relatively stay stable with that inflation rate there's a chance it would be lower and there's also a chance that it would exponentially beat it but for the most part gold and silver should be used as a wealth storage system and that's the same thing with silver in that lots of people think that if fiat currency basically goes dead if 20 years from now let's say that these are worth nothing people just no longer trust the backing of the federal government with paper money of use the end of a the just paper and for example China and Russia and all the other places are hoarding gold they're increasing their stockpiles while the US with Fort Knox we don't really know how much gold is really in there but there's lots of people that believe that we've been heavily depleting our gold resources so there's a chance that the US doesn't really have a whole lot of gold to back up a lot of monetary currency that we have and as a result people may not trust the fiat currency that is this over a long period of time which would lead to the dollar being devalued even more exponentially and people switching to gold and silver see if his safe haven assets as a way to basically use them as currency in trading in the event that something like that would ever happen where the economy switches from a fiat currency based system back to a goal and silver based system like it was for thousands of years up until 100 200 years ago depending on where you are you you again you really won't get rich which is the thing that angers a lot of people because at the end of the day the you may be better off than a lot of other people when it comes to buying things but everyone's pretty much gonna be screwed in those situations that when the economy collapses in such a grand scale like that so I tend just to look at it as a very unlikely event that that whatever happened in fiat currencies basically phased out going back to a gold and silver standard but it's something that a lot of the people at investing gold silver like to look at so I thought I'd bring it up but for the most part what I wanted to bring up that I believe is this at the end of the day won't make you rich and a lot of people might not like me saying that but this on the other hand will most definitely not and you'll likely lose money over the long term whereas if you compare one ounce of gold to $1300 today I'd take one ounce of gold almost every single time and that's just because it was long run since I'm not planning on spending either of these over the long a little long run I believe that in ten years from now or 20 years from now this will be I'll be able to sell for more than I will have value with this and that's because over time since the a limited supply of gold and there's only however many ounces in the Earth's crust and however many ounces that we are actually have accessible to us to mine there's a limited supply and there is a growing demand every single day with more and more people being warned to the world and especially the fact that other countries such as China and Russia seemed to really be stockpiling it so this won't make you rich I know said it again the end and a lot of people are gonna go to the comment to be mad about this but at the end of the day it will preserve your wealth and you won't lose out to inflation and you'll likely keep up with that if not slightly beating it and that's what's been seen over the long term when one would invest in gold it beats inflation somewhat but mainly you're investing in gold not to make a lot of money but to not lose money over the long term so let me know what you think thanks for watching make sure to subscribe for more videos coming soon I want to be trying to release one or two a week at least and leave a comment below letting me know what you think also just to throw that in right now if I depict gold over silver yeah it might anger a lot of people I'd probably pick silver as an investment right now just because I believe the gold and silver ratio at the moment is currently 85 ounces tawanda I might do a video on that sometime soon but as of right now the price of one ounce of gold can buy you 85 ounces of silver so I believe that Silver's are much better investment at that time in my opinion again so make sure to do your own research before you ever invest in precious metals and determine what you think is the best thing to buy but I pick silver ever gold at the moment and gold and silver both over cash at the moment that's just my opinion anyways again thanks so much for watching peace out", "l0Umw8g7cQo": "[Music] what's going on guys today we're at the ranch this is our property we have them South Colorado Springs we live in our trailers kick it great views great place to grow pot smoke down all right guys this is the press we are going to be working with today it is a 12-ton rosin press [Music] you can go air compressed or there's a manual option we're gonna go with the manual route today just because we don't want to mess with the air compressor we haven't ran it in a while so we're gonna go with the manual group so we're gonna power it up here it's a little bit difficult to see but we're gonna go ahead and set our temperature [Music] we're gonna be running it at 222 degrees Fahrenheit for this press and we're gonna go ahead and set both our plates that temperature as you can see then we're gonna wait for this bad boy to heat up and we're gonna go press some weed these presses usually run about $1,500 but we actually got quite a good deal and got it for a trade for a pound of weed so usually around 1500 got a fair economy all right everybody here is the weed that we're gonna be pressing in to rosin this is some of our homegrown wheat it is actually four different strains we got some granddaddy purp elephant [ __ ] and EOG tangerine Kush we're gonna try to get about 10 grams of our bud into this puck press and this is what we're gonna be using to press down our weed we're gonna grind up our weed and fill this up and once this is all the way fill you [ __ ] give it a twist and that will tighten it and you put this lid on you screw the lid on and I'll compact all the weed into one nice little puck for the press [Music] alright guys so now that you've seen how that process works we're just gonna fill up and grind up a bunch more weed and we'll see you when that puck pressure's filled up we forgot our big grinders so [Music] alright guys so we're just gonna screw on the lid here and now we're gonna press all the way down into a nice compact puck [Music] dance seven point six minutes all right guys we want to get to ten grams for this press so we're gonna go ahead and put the puck back in and repress the weed to try to get to ten grams [Music] alright everyone here is our new puck [Music] alright guys so the total weight of our puck is 13.8 grams so we're about three point eight over but we wanted but that's alright half an ounce you can see right up here is where we're going our we'd it's a pretty nice setup we'll show you inside in a different video all right we're looking to upgrade that right now so we'll show you the full loop setup when it's all finished we're about there on both of them it's hard to see but both are about two twenty two so we're gonna get the puck in she's ready to go all right guys we're broke as [ __ ] we're using the nonstick just great value parchment paper it works great for this that's all you need we're gonna go ahead and get our two pieces ready [Music] though here is our half of an ounce puck and we're gonna go ahead and put it the press there it is pressing it 222 degrees for roughly in banana half paper good make sure it's centered so we just manually press it together and should get a decent yield from this all right guys we're gonna release it we're gonna take this inside and scrape it oh yeah we got some little dirt here that's right oh yeah [Music] your [ __ ] dabs we're gonna go ahead and take a few so I looks like a good size tab a today's video thanks for watching those are [ __ ] rosin fresh we're gonna take these dad's right now [Music] yeah", "wG8289gnTk4": "what's going on everybody welcome back and we're going to talk about some more lpvo for your life today in the way of this rhiton one to eight by 24 right here if you don't know what an lpvo is it's a low power variable optic which means it's in the lower magnification spectrum and it is variable by this throw lever right there i want to give a huge shout out to all of my subscribe stars your support is absolutely awesome and it's a tremendous help to the channel everybody else here on youtube i really appreciate you guys as well the subscriptions the likes and all the comments down below definitely help the channel grow we're going to talk about all the good stuff in this raiton one to eight here but before we get started today's sponsor is hidden hybrid holsters today's video is brought to you by hidden hybrid holsters bringing you that sweet sweet leather for your holster needs or just a little something to keep your pants up in the way of a belt now whether it's for a dress or occasion or whether you just prefer leather against that sweet sweet supple skin of yours if you're in the market for a hybrid holster today check them out at hiddenhybrinholsters.com or in the link in the description now i know a couple of you have already seen that dirty mustache on my face here because i completely cannot grow facial hair and i'm still trying to do it so back into this raiton and the low power variable optic thing so who's using lpvos well pretty much everybody everybody from competition the military law enforcement and just those of us out there on the range having fun but we want to say shoot something a little bit further out than like what a red dot is going to give us the capability to do now the lpvo like this one to eight here from raiton is meant to be that kind of all-around one optic that you're gonna have because you can go from one to eight power and you can take those longer shots now there are people that say offset mount like rmrs or even smaller optics on there so you can leave this on a higher magnification and basically as you're shooting you can kind of just transition you know just flip it a little bit to the side and then you can really work those close-up shots with a true one like an rmr or something rather than having to flip this throw lever back and forth very very popular in not only the tactical but the competition shooting world as well now when it comes to lpvos there are many different brands and many different magnification levels uh this one being one to eight by 24 what does that actually mean to you well this is your ocular end this is your objective end because your objective would be down there right this is where you're going to look that's where it goes through generally the bigger the objective end the better light transfer you're going to have and the 1 to 8 is going to mean the power levels and the 24 is going to be the size of that objective lens and then you have the tube size which is pretty much always going to be 30 millimeters or one inch now as far as this rhyton goes there are a ton of different brands out there with a ton of different magnifications this one specifically is the 1 to 8 by 24 like i said and i've already explained what those numbers mean the magnification and the size of that objective lens now this one specifically is second focal plane which means that it's going to stay the same size and the parallax is set at a hundred yards and it does have 11 steps of illumination so what is the difference between first and second focal plane so basically as you look through this optic this is how i remember it first is fancy second is simple and what i mean by that is first focal plane is fancier because that reticle will change sizes as you magnify now second focal plane is simple because it's just there and it doesn't do anything and that's just kind of how i remember that so now you know a little bit more about an lpvo and specifically this rioton let's see how it performed out there on the range [Music] so [Music] now that you've seen some of that good range footage we're going to go ahead and get into this thing and talk about those detailed specifications now we're going to talk about the positives and the negatives what i think about is there anything i would change in there make sure you guys are subscribed to the channel definitely turn the bell notification icons on it's that little bell right down there leave me a comment down below on what your favorite optic company is because i'm really curious what you use and why we're going to go ahead and get into these specs right now all right we're going to jump right into this rayton one to eight here we'll go ahead and take a good overall look at this thing and then we're gonna get into those detailed specs so you can see the overall build quality of this is nice i've had it out to the range several times now and it's holding together well it seems to be durable although i have not gone and thrown this thing off of cliffs or out of helicopters you've got your typical windage elevation and then your brightness setting knob right here on this side which is also your battery compartment for that illuminated reticle you do have the factory throw lever here and this little knob is removable you just unscrew it so you can adjust that from one all the way up to eight power you do get your lens cap covers here and then of course you do have your adjustment for your eye right there to get the crispest reticle you can based on your eyes and the current status of them so let's talk about what the measurements mean on here which we kind of discussed 1 to 8 by 24 and that's always going to be signified somewhere on that optic right there across the top and this one you're basically going from one all the way to eight power your ocular lens which is where uh excuse me your objective lens because this is where the objective would be that way which is downrange is 24 millimeters that's what that by 24 means and then your ocular which is where your eye would be which is why they call it ocular is on your end of this all right so those detailed specs what are we looking at here so this is uh 6061 t6 aluminum good quality stuff there we're all used to that 100 fog proof waterproof and shock proof tested up to 1200 g's which is good that's a lot of what optics are tested to these days we do have 11 brightness settings and you can spin this and go from zero all the way to the highest or step it up notch by notch either directions which is a very nice option half moa adjustments which is roughly a half inch at 100 yards pretty sure we all know that does come with that throw lever natively installed which you can see right there and that is also removable so all the technical stuff um let's go and talk about that parallax fixed at 100 yards tube diameter very common 30 millimeter second focal plane so remember simple same that reticle size does not change that's on the fancy one which is the first focal plane fully multi-coated lens in there so that's going to help out with the reflection it's going to help out with the fogging all of that good stuff on there has that low light enhancement stuff as well now let's talk about viewing so as we look through this optic from our ocular end out of the objective lens here at the lowest magnification we're going to have 105.8 feet of total field of view now as we throw that magnification all the way up it's going to shrink down to 13.1 basically think about that as your eye when you're just staring at when you're looking at something your eyes like this when you squint to see that fine detail you're seeing less around you as you squint your eye that's basically what your optic is doing as you throw that magnification up our eye relief is about three and a half inches so that's where your eye is going to want to be to get the most view through that tube range of adjustment 102 or 182 moa our total length is going to be 10.87 with a weight of 19.3 ounces you're also going to get a cleaning cloth for this thing so let's talk about this thrill over here so like i said this is native it does come in the package some optics come with them some come without them it is removable it's it's not bad it's pretty standard overall the coating on this is nice a little bit reflective as you can see on the light but that's pretty typical even a little bit of reflection off my upper and lower you can see that it does not have the say lockable style turrets where you can zero it then you pull up just kind of adjust it if you need to push it back down i left these unchanged from the range zero the other day because i wanted you guys to see this so basically what you have to do is you zero this in you make your adjustments and you'll see that little white dot right there now then what you have to do is take this off and you take it and move it right back to the zero that's right there and then you have a zero but you don't get the option to have the cap have markings on it pull it up and then turn it to dial your dope on the fly you actually have to take the cap off then screw it back on which is some people like these some people don't completely up to you your battery housing is right here for that illuminated reticle so let's go ahead now that we know all the specs and you've seen this thing a little bit up close let's talk about what i like what i don't like and if i would change anything on this optic well now that you know those specs let's talk about the positives and the negatives here so the positives on this right on the zeroing process super easy half moa adjustments the build quality seems to be good i've had it out to the range a couple times now i've not had any issues with this thing at all when it comes to the glass and the reticle that's what most people want to know about in this price range of about that 350 to 400 range i feel the glass is on par with everything else in this class now it's not going to give you that 2500 3 000 night force glass or light through there but in this price range i found it to be clear there wasn't a lot of healing there wasn't a lot of you know obscuring on the edges or you know miraging or anything like that it was solid for what it is we have to remember the price points of things when we're talking about reticle clarity glass having 11 settings of brightness on here with the ability to go right to the highest one if we need to or kind of notch it up if we you're starting in low light and then going into bright light that's nice because not all optics give you that now let's talk about the things that weren't so positive some of it's a negative and some of it may be a wash first up so we do get our little throw lever here which is a positive but this throw is so much tighter than a lot of the other lpvos i've used i mean it's very very stiff now some people may like that because you're not going to accidentally throw it over but me this thing is a lot more difficult to move than other ones not that you can't move it but it takes a lot more of a you know concerted effort to do so compared to some others or maybe in the same price range or a little bit higher now the biggest one for me is probably the no lockable turrets so there are different kinds and styles of turrets these one you have to unscrew you adjust it and then you change it back to zero once you've dialed it in and then other ones have it where you can pop this up after you've zeroed it and you can turn it and then lock that turret back down you don't have the option of this one you just unscrew and then you dial in whatever you need screw the cap back on some people like the lockable turrets like i do and some people are just fine with the way these ones are and that's really going to be a personal decision but that was just a little bit of a negative for me now the only kind of semi-negative thing is you're definitely not going to get a mount for this optic at this price range some optics in this price range do come with a native factory mount they're generally not the best so plan on spending some extra money on a good mount you definitely don't want to throw a good optic on a cheesy cheaper mount that just may not be the best for zeroing that optic so that's that may be kind of a wash for some people but i don't think a lot of people take into account when you buy an optic like this one and spend 350 bucks on it you're probably gonna spend at least another hundred or so on an optic mount all the way up to three to four hundred dollars on an optimax depending on which brand you want to go with now other than that i think anybody wanting to spend that you know three to four hundred dollar i think this is a solid choice for you ultimately that's going to be up to you whether you want to spend that much maybe you want to spend more maybe you want to spend less or maybe you just have a brand preference that is not the right on name it's a decent optic i haven't had any problems with it and it seems to perform very well out there on the range so that decision is going to be left up to you i just wanted to give you the facts and my opinion on this which is for the price it's a solid optic now one of the coolest things about it which is definitely a positive is this thing has a lifetime no questions asked warranty it doesn't have to be registered you don't have to be original owner you basically call them you send it in and you get a brand new off the optic no rebuilds no re-refitted nothing they just send you a brand new one in a box which is pretty cool and i think a lot of companies in this price range are doing that now specifically because vortex and ryton i think us optics most companies in this price point are doing that again a huge thank you all my subscribe

how to convert basic problems to grains like grams milligrams - grains and then I'm going to take that and apply it to dosage and calculation word problems and as always you can access the worksheet the quizzes and the other dosage and calculation series over here or in the description below so let's get started okay before we get started solving our grain calculation problems let's go over some basic concepts first thing the Roman numerals a lot of times with grain problems the question will be written out maybe with a Roman numeral so you need to know the most common Roman numerals used in these problems for instance like this problem says grade X equals how many milligrams a lot of people are like what in the world is X X is Roman numeral for 10 so it's like 10 grains so let's get over these basic ones that you want to commit to memory is a lot of times it has a bar written over it or has two dots may not have anything it means a hat so 0.5 is s I means 1 s s again means 1/2 so it'll be 1 and 1/2 D means 5 X means 10 and X V means 15 now whenever I solve these problems I use dimensional analysis analysis so the magic numbers you want to remember when solving these problems are the following because this is going to make your job a lot easier is this one grain equals 60 milligrams and 15 grains equals 1 gram all we have to do is plug those in and we can get our answer depending on if we're trying to get two milligrams or grains so let's get started with doing some basic conversions ok this problem says grain x equals how many milligrams we learned that X is Roman numeral 10 so let's set up a problem using dimensional analysis so 10 grains equals how many milligrams because that is where we're trying to get to and we know from our magic number that one grain equals 60 milligrams so one grain equals 60 milligrams and grains cancels out and we are ready to solve so multiply everything at the top and everything at the bottom and then divide so 10 times 60 is 600 and carry or 1 over and 600 divided by 1 is 600 so 10 grains equals 600 milligrams okay let's do our next problem two grains equals how 2 grams equals how many grains okay so let's set up a problem two grams equals how many greens and we know from our magic number that one gram equals 15 grains grams cancels out and we're ready to solve so 2 times 15 is 30 Terrier 1 over and our answer 30 divided by 1 is 30 so 2 grams equals 30 grains okay let's solve our next problem one-fourth grains equals how many milligrams a lot of times these fractions trip people up but all you got to do is just convert it to a decimal that's how you do it it's a lot easier but if you want to queue in a fraction you can but 1/4 is 0.25 0.25 that's what that is so be 0.25 grains equals how many milligrams that's where we're trying to get and we know from our magic number that there is one grain in 60 milligrams grains cancels out we're left with milligrams so 0.25 times 60 equals 15 and we're carry our one over and 15 divided by one is 15 so 15 milligrams one-fourth grains equals 15 milligrams now let's look at some word problems okay the first problem says doctor orders armored thyroid grains 10 by mouth daily your supplied with 3 milligram tablets how many tablets will you administer per dose so what we're solving for is tablets per dose that is where we're trying to get so what's right where we're trying to get trying to get two tabs per dose and remember the Roman numeral X means ten so let's just write that out to help us remember so it's ten grains is where we're trying to get so let's set up our problem using dimensional analysis okay okay so the doctor orders 10 grains is one dose and we need to convert this to milligrams because that is what we're supplied with 300 milligrams so how many of that of those tablets we're going to give so we need to convert grains to milligrams to get there so we know from our magic number that one grain equals 60 milligrams grains cancels out okay so we're there but now we need to apply these numbers to what we're supplied with and we're supplied with 300 milligram tablets so 300 milligrams equals one tablet hey milligrams cancels out we're exactly where we need to be we're in tabs per dose so let's solve 10 times 60 times one is six hundred and one times one times 300 is 300 and 600 divided by 300 is two so we're going to be giving two tablets to equal that 10 grain dose that the doctor ordered this problem says doctor orders Tamil one gram by mouth every six hours as needed for pain you're supplied with five grains per capsule how many capsules will you administer so we're trying to get two capsules per dose solution draw it out where we're trying to get caps per dose okay so let's set up a problem okay the doctor ordered one gram one gram is one dose and we know from our magic numbers that one gram equals 15 grains because we have to convert to get two grains because that is what we're supplied with so one gram equals 15 grains grams cancels out so we're converted but let's see with what we're supplied with how many were actually going to give so it says five grains equals one capsule so five grains equals one capsule we're there we're where we need to get we need to get two caps per dose so let's multiply everything at the top and at the bottom and divide so one times 15 times one is 15 and one times one times five is five so 15 divided by 5 is 3 so we're going to be giving three capsules per dose this problem says doctor orders a liquid suspension of aspirin 180 milligrams by mouth daily you're supplied with grains v / 2 MLS how many milliliters will you administer per dose so instead of trying to solve for tablets or capsules we're trying to figure out the liquid amount in milliliters so that's where we're trying to go is milliliters per dose and look we have a Roman numeral in here so what does the mean it means 5 so in other words this means five grains celestials write that out to help us five grains per 2 MLS that is what we're supplied with okay so let's set this problem up and saw okay the doctor orders a hundred and eighty milligrams per dose and we know from our magic number that 60 milligrams equals one grain grain milligrams cancels out however we're converted but we have to yet two milliliters per dose because we're supplied with this liquid suspension and we need to know how much to pour out in this cup to give the patient of aspirin so there's five grains for every five in every two MLS there's five grains of aspirin so five grains because that's what grain V meant equals two MLS and grains cancels out and where we need to be milliliters per dose so we're ready to solve so 180 times 1 times 2 equals 360 and 1 times 60 times 5 equals 300 so 360 divided by 300 equals 1.2 MLS per dose so that is how much we're going to pour out to give this patient of this aspirin this problem says doctor orders diazepam 5 milligrams IV every 6 hours as needed for agitation you're supplied with grains ISS which again means grains one and a half per 2 ml vial how many milliliters will you administer per dose so we have this vial of diazepam and we're going to we need to draw up some in our syringe to give this patient so we're trying to get 2 milliliters per dose and remember i SS means grains 1 and a hat 1 and 1/2 grains or I like to put mine in decimal so 1.5 grains per 2 MLS okay so let's work this problem okay doctor orders 5 milligrams so 5 milligrams equals one dose and we know from our magic numbers that 60 milligrams equals one grain because we're trying to get two grains because that's what we have on hand so 60 milligrams equals one grain milligrams cancels out where we need to be but now let's apply that to what we're supplied with and what we're supplied with is 1.5 grains per every 2 ml so every two milliliters we draw up in that serene just want to have 1.5 grains so one point five grains equals two MLS grains cancels out and where we need to be we're milliliters per dose so we're ready to solve so 5 times 1 times 2 is 10 and 1 times 60 times 1.5 is 90 so 10 divided by 90 equals zero point zero zero point 1 1 1 repeating and we'll round that to zero point one so zero point one milliliters per dose is how much we're going to give this patient of diazepam per what the doctor ordered this problem says doctor orders morphine one eighth grains IV every four hours as needed for pain you're supplied with a vial that says two milligrams per ml how many milliliters per dose will you administer ok so we're trying to get 2 milliliters per dose so let's write our goal milliliters per dose and I like to convert my fractions 1/8 to decimals so 1/8 and in decimal form is 0.125 so that's how many grains we're going to give if you ever need to convert fraction to a decimal real fast what you can do is just divide one into a and that gives you your decimal form ok so let's set our problem up ok the doctor ordered point one two five grains so 0.125 grains equals our dough so the doctor ordered and we know that one grain equals 60 milligrams so one gray 9 equals 60 milligrams rains cancels out now we got to get how much we need to draw up in our vial because it's in milligrams per ml so there are 2 milligrams in 1 ml milligrams cancels out and we're where we need to be in milliliters per dose so we're ready to solve so 0.125 times 60 is 7.5 and 1 times 1 times 2 is 2 and 7.5 divided by 2 is 3.75 so 3.75 milliliters per dose is what we are going to draw up to give this patient okay that is

what's inside one of these Winchester Super X 1 ounce rifled slugs so I'm going to try and cut it open and take the slug out weigh the slug and weigh the powder charge just so we can see what one of these typical 1 ounce rifled slugs are composed of alright let's try and cut this thing open all right we got our shell cut open now so let's just go ahead and pull it apart and see what's inside so there's our one ounce rifled slug it's pretty hollow in there I'm sure most you already knew that though there's the nice little rifling grooves on the side of the slug so that's the actual one ounce rifled slug and then right underneath that we have a really thick piece of cardboard and I believe this is referred to as nitrile card I think this one is actually really thick though so I'm just gonna actually go ahead and measure it real fast that way any of you shotgun reloaders out there can see just how thick it is so it's measuring it 0.197 of an inch or 5.01 millimeters so that's nitro card is about five millimeters thick and that sits right underneath the one L slug and right underneath the cardboard it looks like we have a wadding I think this is actually referred to as a gas seal since it doesn't actually have the things on the side to hold shot in it's just used to sealing the gas for the slug I guess I'm not exactly positive on that either and that's it underneath that we have our powder charge so we had our rifled slug our piece of cardboard and then our gas seal in its exact order here now let's weigh the slug and see exactly how heavy it is okay just the slug by itself and that's coming in at exactly 436 grains I think one ounce is 437 grains so we're actually just one grain short of a 1 ounce slug but let's see how much the gas seal and cardboard in everything way also so just the cardboard 14.1 grains and the gas seal alone is 38.8 grains and all together gas seal cardboard and slug four hundred and eighty nine point one grains so all of this is actually being shot out of the gun four hundred and eighty nine point one grains now let's see how much powder we have in here I couldn't get it all out there's a couple flakes in there still they just don't want to come out they're stuck in there really good but what did come out weighed in at 30 7.1 grains and what's left in there is probably just a couple tenths of a grain so it might be thirty-seven point two or three with the rest of that so we might as well just say it's about 37 grains of powder and this powder actually looks really familiar to me I have a pound of its long shot right here and if I'm correct I'm thinking that that's what this powder in the shell is here so now I'm just gonna pour the powder charge back into the shell so there's our 37 ish grains of what I believe is longshot and now I'm gonna pour some of my actual long shot here into the tray just so we can see how similar that's powder looks and here's the powder that came out of my long shot container and the powder we put back in the shell so that actually looks pretty much identical to me so I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that's the charge in these Winchester 1-out slug shells 37 grains of long shot and how much does the entire shale components all together weigh though the entire shell is five hundred and seventy eight point seven grains so now we've got just a couple more things to do let's measure exactly how wide our slug is right here on the rifling grooves it's coming in at point seven two five except right here we're getting a measurement of 0.7 to seven so it just depends on where I put the calipers because there's all these ridges and stuff obviously but I'd say it's safe to assume it's point seven two five roughly now how long is it it's coming at point six eight five and a half so it's actually wider than it is long that's kind of funny and our hollow point is so inside our hollow point it's point one two seven and a half that's the width of our hollow point but anyways that's all I can think of to go over so that's all that our winchester one ounce rifled slugs consists of a 436 grain lead rifled slug our five millimeter thick piece of cardboard and then our gas seal underneath that and that is all being propelled by what I assume is 37 grains of longshot but anyways that's all thanks for watching you", "IrvEHVn-fks": "How many ounces are\nin 6 pounds? So we have 6 pounds\nand we need to convert them to ounces. And if you don't know it\nalready, you'll know it now, that there are 16 ounces\nper pound. So what we want to do is we\nwant to have pounds in the denominator. It's in the numerator\nright now. So we want to divide by pounds\nand multiply by ounces. Maybe I'll write it out. And I just told you\nthat there are 16 ounces for every 1 pound. So if we multiplied these two\nexpressions, this pounds will cancel with that pounds, and\nwe'll just be left with the unit of ounces, which is what we\nwant, and we just multiply 6 times 16. So it works out unit-wise, and\nit makes sense as well. If we have 16 ounces per pound,\nand we have 6 pounds, we just have to multiply\n6 times 16. That'll be the total number of\nounces we have. So this is going to be equal to--\nwhat's 6 times 16? So if you take 16 times\n6, 6 times 6 is 36. Carry the 3. 6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So 6 times 16 is 96. You have this divided by 1 here,\nbut that's not going to change anything. And then all we're\nleft with in the dimensions are the ounces. So 6 pounds are 96 ounces.", "o8AXullC95M": "[Music] [Music] did that look familiar to you well if so then you are absolutely not alone a lot of people have problems converting recipes from things like cups into grams and vice versa so today I decided to share a few tips and tricks on how to achieve this very effortlessly and I'm gonna provide you with a list of conversions as well as tips on how to measure ingredients properly and finally I wanted to discuss very very quickly the pros and cons for each measuring system so let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so finally a quick word about the pros and cons I myself tend to go back and forth between using my cups and using a scale and you see this in some of my videos it really depends on what I'm doing for example if I'm making a caramel sauce I tend to be very precise so I'd like to use a scale for such a thing so if consistency is important to you and you want to achieve a perfect cake or cookie every single time then I suggest that you use a scale and measure things in grams so that you get this exact same amount per batch but if you're looking for a rough estimate of what goes in a recipe for example a chocolate chip cookie where you roughly want 2 cups of chocolate chips but if there are a little bit more nobody will mind then definitely use cups using measuring cups is a very visual way of measuring ingredients this is perfect for getting kids involved into baking because they love just how interactive it all is cups are more fun I have to say that so I personally love using both professionals prefer obviously the scale because of the preciseness and consistency that you achieve per recipe but kids and people that aren't getting into baking certainly like using cups so it's really up to you and what you're trying to achieve so that's it for me today I hope you found this useful and if you like this video you then click on

you're given two and 1/8 pound equals how many ounces now you know that and 1 pound they're going to be 16 ounces right so go ahead and figure out the relationship from going to pounds 2 ounces go ahead and figure out what's relation to 1 into T with the x 16 yes so take a number of pounds that you're given two and 1/8 right and you're going to multiply that by a team all right let's do that two and 1/8 times 16 now let's rearrange estill that way it's a little bit more eye appealing so 16 will be re-written as 2 - number one right and um okay and two and 1/8 would be rewritten and improper fraction so the easier 12 plus so 2 times 8 right plus 1/2 times 8 15 16 plus 1 is 17 over 8 times 16 over 1 right um go ahead and see if you have any comment right with 1588 they have a greatest common factor of 8 so divide both by 8 8 divided by 8 is 108 yes 16 divided by 8 is 2 17 times 2 is 34 1 times 1 is 1 34 divided by 1 2 3 4 so what 2 and 1/8 ounce equals 34 ounces", "_7CGqem7AK0": "[Music] hi guys this is Tilly from cleaning and teaching welcome back to my channel today we're going to be looking at doing a plan with me in my trendsetter for the month of January so really quickly if you did not watch my last video please take a minute and go look at that and it's called what happens when my spread goes wrong so make sure you go check that out because let me do a little quick check with you guys when I started planning in this planner and you guys know I was using my live life lovely or like this lovely planner yeah I was using my life is lovely floral planner as my home planner and my trend setter pages as my social media planner and I felt like that was going to work for me and then when I started planning in it it was just is so much almost redundancy to the point where it makes no sense to do that and I say that because I'm basically going to be doing some of the same things every single week and then I thought about just creating some stickers with checklist on them and then I'm like no I don't really want to do that so then I started thinking how can I make it work for me and then I started to realize that I have a monthly layout that will work really well and I decided to switch it so yes I Franken planned but I switched you have to find planner piece and find what works for you if something doesn't work change it fix it we spent a lot of money on planners and you want to be able to use them versus not use them at all so let's go ahead and jump right into it okay so what I did and let me just tell you in my Franken plan you will you remember seeing my home planner this page was my first page after 2018 yearly the yearly scope of 2018 then you saw this but I moved it to the back because it's my social media if you recall I had this hustle divider here so I wanted to make sure that I kept that behind there this is the envelope for my budget planner my budget planner came next behind this today's divider and then came my trendsetter so I'm putting the trendsetter back here in the in the front where it belongs behind all this pages and I'll be using this as my home cleaner so I'm gonna go ahead and pop out the dashboard as well as the monthly view and the first set of checklist and the inside pages so we're gonna set up all three of the let's start with our dashboard for the month and I'm gonna zoom in just a little bit so you guys can see what I'm doing all right so this has a setup planning watching cooking eating drinking going loving dreaming filling listening okay Big Ideas celebrating this month birthdays this month and holidays now I'm probably gonna cover up celebrating this month just because the holidays are already down here and there's nothing that I really celebrate on this month and then in my personal planner that's what I'm going to be keeping my birthdays so there's no need for me to use that either [Music] and the next thing I'm gonna be going into is my quote super book and I mean - like motivational make a choice take a chance see a change that's the one we're going with I like that I'm sticking with this pink thing here and what I'm going to do to kind of make this pop a little bit is to pull out that mini sticker book and if you guys did not know go see this flip through but the mini sticker book has these gorgeous like little confetti pieces and silver and this colorful one so I'm gonna grab a couple of the each so I'm grabbing up some Fanny one and I'm gonna grab a silver one from the same spot so it has the exact same shape I'm gonna put the silver one on this side up here and then the colorful one and this side over here how cute is that loving it alright so in January alright what am i planning in January I am planning in new 2018 planners what am i

I'm listening to one motivational book this month okay um so I'm gonna pull out my date sticker book and I don't wanna use I'm just going to use this clear black sticker that says the 13th and I'm gonna put it under working it's a 13th and then the 15th time 14 days this month and I'm going to put right here tres hunting and I'm off work on the 15th so I'm gonna put that there all right so I still indicate what I have going on that makes me super busy so that I will know ok so this is the dashboard all right now let's look at my month a month is going to represent will not have household miles like some big things going on but since I used those clear stickers these these foiled stickers out of the trendsetter book I'm going to use them and my monthly spread I'm gonna just grab this one and then I'm gonna grab that same one out of the silver Toyota side ok and then I'm going to lay that there and there and I'm gonna grab quote and I'm going to get this quote out of mine today's

going to deep clean one particular thing okay so I'm going to use my tiny sticker book which I absolutely love and I'm gonna grab the housework stickers in the pink and I'm going to deep clean on Fridays so I'm gonna put one here here here and here okay so each week I'll be deep cleaning one area those are my deep cleaning tips and then the other day that I want to indicate for the month is going to be what I am going to be decluttering and I don't think there's a declutter sticker at least I haven't seen one see if there's one I'm gonna use these little push pins I think they're super super cute I'll show you guys what they look like of course how gorgeous is that right so I'm gonna use the pink one just to kind of stay with me I'm going to probably be cutter orange Saturdays but I'm only gonna do clutter once a month I don't want to like just bombard myself with decluttering so I'm gonna declutter main closet okay all right you know if I figure out something else that I want to use my I figure out something else that I want to use my monthly spread for I will definitely do that in February and continue to update so now let's go ahead and look at to set up a monthly tracker here okay so I'm gonna work from left to right and I'm starting with the top three okay so I wanna declutter I want to deep clean and I want to find a weekly cleaning routine okay so my monthly habit tracker is just going to be weekly cleaning I can't really do deep cleaning so I'm gonna do weekly cleanings I'm gonna do um meal prep and I'm gonna do cooking cuz that also has to deal with home okay so Muncie goes I'm going to just grab an icon sticker it's like in the original watercolor sticker book it has some hearts what I see okay yep I use the asterisks and I'm gonna use I want to stick with kind of this color scheme so I'm gonna use this hot pink and from one of the goals I find that if I said to me I don't accomplish each I'm gonna sit three three months he goes I missed a sticker up so [Music] because in my dates stickers and I'm she's the clear ones I actually meet use the smaller ones I use these that's perfect so I'm gonna put one and I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so you can see what I'm doing so I put the number one on top of the ashtray and the number two on top of this one and then the number three it's going on top of this one okay um you know to self I'm just gonna use a coach count your bully this is gonna be the cold I'm gonna be using thank you and I'm gonna place that on under the notes of subsection I'm gonna place count your blessings right there in the center okay and then I'm gonna keep with it things that I've been using these gorgeous colorful and foil stickers and if you guys know that they are the exact same shape the two that I'm pulling so I'm gonna put the count your blessings at the top and the silver at the bottom I like that how cute is that okay so my monthly goal is to clean something everyday okay um my second goal is to tackle clothes because we have lots of clothes and my third is to declutter closet number one okay so on my checklist I want to find a workable schedule so find a cleaning schedule weekly cleaning routine okay I also want to remove clothing not worn and I'll donate those I want to pack up Jax is six months clothes I know I want to remove cabinet clutter and reorganize my cabinets and I spelled it wrong so what do you do we spend something wrong you grab your washing and I'm gonna grab just this dark blue washi here and I'm going to cover that up where I says cabinet make sure is

let's check them out Aguila was actually nice enough to send some of these over a few months ago for us to sample and it got cold outside so I was gonna wait to a break in the weather and we've got that we have two barrel lengths a 12 and 19 inch what you see in front of you is my 870 SBS and then we have one of the SAS 12 semi automatics I've tested these before off-camera and they won't cycle the SAS action but we'll just run them one at a time pro kleh no digital is always 10 to 12 feet it's approximately 55 degrees outside today let's do this we'll grab the 870 SBS first usually with these shorter ones you're gonna run the action pretty fast then I'll feed 708 791 840 to 810 [Applause] [Applause] 8:15 763 786 900 they count wrong 890 now we have a sass 12 semi-automatic shotgun this did have a 26 inch barrel and I think I might make it a short Brill shotgun project not sure so I cut the rail down to 19 inches I might try to thread the barrel for chokes or something 9:43 9 1996 t 823 69 24 998 well there you guys have it basically these are subsonic out of both barrel lengths they do claim 1250 on the box I don't know if that's out of like a 24 inch or a 26 inch or 28 inch 12 gauge barrel we didn't see that with our typical short barrels here again I like to thank a Gila for providing us with ammunition and tests we've tested their 5 5 6 9 or 308 and there's nine-millimeter stuff runs pretty good again thank you all for watching until next time catch you at the range", "qkkZVs9neCI": "hi there it's shel and clint is outside guess what he's doing yeah he's cutting wood so he's probably tired every time he comes in i'm like what happened what uh he's fine i told you to please use extreme caution but such a beautiful day today i haven't even just wanted to sit around take a nap or anything like that it's kind of like spring i really want to play you know in the weather so but and i guess the gas guy just called it was either when i made a trip outside or um earlier i'm not sure when but um showed like an hour ago so and he said i'll be up there in about an hour so he should be here anytime so guys we are going to work on this until i am distracted uh clinton just say hi and to tell you guys he's being careful i think he's getting tired of me saying what happened what happened okay of course i didn't get all my stuff i'll be right back so i went outside and grabbed my um stencil i felt well i'll use this one got back in the house realized i needed something else from out there so i yeah so some people use stencils to cover up white pages if you don't like them and you know i try to do double-sided papers now but of course sometimes we don't get them but like this one we have that on the other side i love that i think that turned out so cool so i am i need to mail this this is going to somebody i just haven't got it in the mail yet she doesn't mind though it's a gift a gift unless i get a prettier one yeah so the guy's here right now that's so funny yeah so the guys here did i already say that i don't know making sure i was thinking oh i'm gonna go tell clint because he's outside the bark and stuff which isn't as dangerous as using me maybe he'll take some cats i'm kidding so he's gonna don't know if i should go out about it you think that's got this right he'll call me if he needs me it's funny our answer machine doesn't have our time on it you know and uh it's like saturday but it was today i don't know how to set it but our phone had the time on it okay see i don't want a lot on here because i still want you to be able to draw right on it whatever and you know what is that dry i don't want it smearing like on this other page so it's distress oxide if you guys are familiar with that i am let me just grab a piece of blank paper put it here it kind of feels wet still but it's because of the ink it is it does take a little bit longer to dry so just decorating a little bit i do want to pull out my um what was i saying i don't know but i do want to get all these decorated you know i know what i was saying something but my brain this is the distress oxide this one is wilted violet i really like that distress oxides i think they're really pretty that's not not a fan i don't have much much luck with this i should have brought those little brushes in leslie i think she sent them to me they're easier to use with stencils because you just kind of there we go that's cute let me see what paper if it's going to be like on coffee dye paper i don't think i need to put anything on it okay and then this one this one will be kind of fun i'll just kind of go like over the center hey hello use my fingers you could use your fingers couldn't shut what a mess wants to show the guy let me show you what we're doing i kind of like the idea of it kind of coming through one side he's like oh well how are you guys hurting have people to talk to you know sometimes when we're on locates these little old people they will sit and talk your ear off and we always sit and talk to them because you know we know they're lonely so this guy's probably talking to clint because he's like oh man this guy's lonely let me show you what i'm doing man that's too funny i don't know what he's talking about now that guy's loud i can hear him in here hundreds and hundreds i hope he's not talking about dollars for our gas hey i made it work guys of course my hand's all goopy of course did he hurry up and bring it back in no okay i think we got all that one though i should pause it shouldn't i yeah what's the point what is that one let's see this one yeah there's a little bit of i'm gonna go get that from him i'll be right back okay guys so i got my thing back and he the guy was leaving so i just stood at the door and he said that what we should do is just get the small get some more small ones that we have and just fill those up for backups because it would cost hundreds of dollars i already had this one didn't i and because they're gonna have to pipe it and all this stuff so he said it's just not worth it so everybody came out to see it because the other guy was like i don't know come back in a while so next time we go over to durango and that'll save us some money because i think they're only like 40 bucks each i told plant we should get three of them and that way when we're on our third one take the other two in to get filled you know i mean i'm not gonna need a lot though when i went out earlier it's still really cold out there so you'd need it just to take the chill off there so yeah that's what the dalio is so when we go over take this one and then maybe we'll buy a couple when we go to somewhere that they have them you know hi gracie yeah i had to wash my hand and look at it it's still purple but yeah he was talking about the about hundreds of really hundreds and hundreds gracie you're gonna get purple all over your cute little fur oh here's a baby girl there's a baby girl there's baby gracie mom she's really petite kind of like sugar was yes she was and she get kisses i'm on the nose i'm gonna go away okay go away honey there you go pull up there okay so yeah that is where we stand and i mean the guy came all the way from cortez but it was really nice because poor thing though that's an hour round trip you know that's okay though i'm sure he doesn't mind and to plant you know it's a blessing that he came out because then we're not spending all this time waiting till may or whatever to get a um heater out there when it kind of defeats the purpose i really want to get out there so yeah may have like 100 gallon tanks at um home depot but they're as tall as i am and then i was gonna wonder if he could film you know but he says then you have to lug it off all the way down to the store and i said just get smaller ones so now we know that's kind of cute i wanted something a little bit different my hands are so pretty and purple so purple okay oh i love that don't you guys just love that one so fun yeah chris just out there debarking right now he's using his carving i think a carving knife but i did get him a new carving glove because he had cut his so it's not here yet though there we go those are kind of cute is that it nope i have one more let's see nope that's it cool didn't take long for something big and pretty so now i am going to go wash my hands so i don't get ink everywhere that i don't want it okay guys so you know what okay sorry i checked to see if um yesterday's video is done uploading but when my computer shuts down it pauses the video from uploading so in that case you guys would not have seen my question about whether or not you want to see me gluing this in or sewing these in so i'm just going to sew them in uh clamp sewed around the edges and we're going to put these guys in here i think i want that one first it doesn't really matter to me okay just to show you guys uh we ordered i ordered some more of this thick it's supposed to be thick fabric the um interfacing if you guys find any thick then let me know i ordered it this time off of overstock.com so now i got to figure out a way to get my money back because it's not what i'm looking for so and i already have too much of other stuff that i wasn't what i wasn't looking for so i am going to put six inches here and then we are going to just fold it over but this is one of the really thick ones that clint had and the people i ordered it from it's no longer selling it and this one is really thin so i don't know why they're calling it heavy weight because it's so it's not heavyweight so i'm kind of bummed we may have to find another way to to do that you know and then clint just makes these six by i mean eight and a half no nine nine or nine and a half by fourteen and then i come in at six inches so like mom has written and said if she does one over 14 would that work you know yes mom it would work just makes a bigger spine which isn't a bad thing so i think she's working on something so today we will be at the doctor's office checking clint's finger he did kind of look at it and he was kind of concerned it might be clint did when we were cleaning it it might be uh infected but we think it might have been the petroleum jelly that they put on they put like a piece of fabric on it that's covered in petroleum jelly so that his uh doesn't stick to the to the tear okay so and then that is look how full it already is usually mine you know you can touch this the side because of my papers because when i first started this i was putting way too many papers in it and i think i'm gonna have to either glue this or burn it i don't know if it will burn but we're gonna try gracie's riled up okay so i am going to fell out of my book okay but you know i'm glad that that guy came because he knows more than we do and which one could have already done that if we were thinking okay you know what i'm going to show you guys today i'm going to show you how to make a template so because i usually have those on hand so i never really make one so i'm just gonna use this we'll see see if it's the size you made it to be approximately the size of your i know honey size of your spine so this one i'll measure it and see let me trim this real quick i know i'm using that paper and i'll probably wish i hadn't but so that's about right okay so i'm thinking you know i haven't shown you guys how to make one from scratch so one and a half and he made it 14 so 12 it should be two inches i don't know why it's not but it's not quite the yeah it's just one and a half gracie please honey i know honey show grandma your belly grandma see grace's belly maybe clint's getting tired and he'll want her okay you gotta go play honey i know look at her she totally she's gonna say innocent but she's not let go let go okay no oh graceland oh where this is gonna go in the center she's in my box now so yes we are moving out there we're gonna go get those as soon as we have time it might be next week though because i don't think anywhere near here sells them so okay so you have your piece you have your spine i did check that didn't i it's not quite yeah it is too but if it's not perfect like this size i just kind of you know put it in the center so that's fine so let me show you what i do do i have this i have this very simple but i was just thinking if i have shown you guys and i've made over 100 junk journals so that tells you how many i have in here but thankfully they're pretty much all the same size so let's use oh she went she ran away okay so what you want is we're gonna have two on here so you don't you want like the center and then you're gonna do a certain inch from the center so say we're gonna do half an inch on either side let's just say that and see what that looks like yeah i think that will work so i'm just going to line this up let's line it up on here just for you guys so like i would put one here don't want it there and there or doing one over here let's do it over here so just like a quarter of an inch from either side and then the same thing just kind of you just want them to be you know somewhat centered i actually don't want that both i think that'll work it's a little bit different than what i usually do so just kind of so let's see i don't know where his smaller ruler thing is so let's see and then do it that looks here yeah i mean these rulers are neat to have if you're a quilter but it's definitely not necessary we just have one because you know that's crooked okay why is that's crooked that ain't gonna work is it okay michelle figure out what you're doing michelle you're not teaching us nothing okay is my paper crooked my paper is crooked okay so i'm gonna do it right here okay that's what it is my paper is crooked i think so anyways you just want your spots you know lined up see that one's off too oh i didn't line that one up right that's one reason i just use the ones i've already made because another right you know i'm going to see if i'm going to like that or not because you don't want them too far apart but i mean we still have like a quarter of an inch on either side no i'm going to redo it i don't like that okay michelle michelle okay let's do this one i'm just going to trim this one down ah you guys that's one reason i do not like to to make um templates because for one thing it takes a while and for another one it um let's see so eight and a half by two is four and a quarter this one's already have a fold i thought well is that right perfect it's a little bit smaller but that's okay because it doesn't have to be all the way up okay so let's try this again sorry guys i know i know let's just do you know what let's do this easy let's do a half an inch from either side making it too complicated aren't i cap it in from that side and half an inch from this side that looks right right okay and then of course we know where the middle is so i'm making it way way more complicated than it needed to be my brain is got a hundred thousand things going okay i tell you guys sometimes i just overthink things and it doesn't have to be 100 perfect but you know just adjust over early okay and then go ahead and do that and if you wanted to you could just fold that down about an inch inch and a half gracie no you're not helping mama not helping mama at all and i'm just going to line that up make sure it's pretty straight about in the center i'm just making sure everything looks very straight all right most important thing is you put top because if you don't no matter how much you measure it's not going to work out for you so i like to use an eighth inch though um hole punch though if you decided not to that's not a problem because you could just use your um i want to check that video you could just use your um fall and punch a hole to me this is just easier i think i got this at a yard sale so why not use it i think i even listed it in my favorites okay so i'll be right back okay sorry guys um the video for yesterday is having a hard time so it's gonna go up late it looks like it's already one but by now you guys probably already seen it okay so i'm just gonna position this in the center of where i want this to go hi guys by the way sorry here's client i've been i told him he's not working i told him you're probably getting tired of me saying what happened he's like nothing if something happened i would tell you before the door shut yeah i told he said he cut his but he didn't damage his phone but he said he kept painting whenever he looked at it he'd think reminds me of niles and he's a big guy tall and yeah i was thinking oh that's cool i mean i said yeah michelle was going to throw up every time she looked at it no it wasn't throw up it was pass out oh i thought you were on upchuck no it was just i couldn't the world was spinning i couldn't look at it told him i said heck it didn't even hurt didn't even hurt what i did he said his lord hurt like hayden that's because he has all his feeling in his huh i guess yeah i'm sure that's a big part of it but jesus yeah you guys don't know i'm sure most of you know by now but tried to chop his middle finger off but they thought they were gonna have to amputate but he's fine okay guys so now we are going to see i made that harder than i should have made it sorry guys somebody's gonna watch that and say really michelle why don't you just do it like this just making sure you guys are paying attention and she turned it just for you guys so i am doing it just for you guys whenever you make a mistake it's never just a mistake on our end it was just it's yeah a lesson for you guys we are going all the way through our crazy all the way through our um signature because if you put like a fabric clip in here it might be upside down on the other side so pay attention to that because you don't want to have to redo it so even though you think oh everything's right side up i've done that this way you want to make sure it's right side up all the way through okay that looks pretty good like that okay so then but yeah she's been over here and no gracie no clencer do i need to babysit yes oh yeah yeah i got about 20 of them be barfed so wow you've been doing good yeah i probably got about 40 length pieces of wood i'm nice yeah 40 or 50. got a lot done yeah i figured he would i figured you were like really fine i've been doing this for five years you'd think you'd trust me just one time it takes that's all okay so then those lines that you made across that's where we're gonna mark yeah i was updating them on the no gracie go see daddy i was thinking about making uh i had some really nice wood for coasters out there i was looking at that's the right size yeah they might go you never know yeah finished you'd finish them won't you oh you mean sand them in there oh god yeah then they're pretty where's my spots that i eat hi grace what are you doing brad okay let me look again see it i know i'm marked i'm a good girl yes i am daddy okay whatever she's been a good girl i wouldn't need a babysitter i know right again you just want to make sure it's coming right out yeah she is being so honored today and i know it's because i'm let's see if i can you know hold it at a sharp v and it goes straight through the back of the spine and that's what you want if for some reason you went like out the side then just re-gather it and try again because it's easier to do that now than later okay so we have a couple of needles put two of them in here so one this is nylon wax nylon thread that's my favorite for sewing in signatures it doesn't stretch it's caught stretching doesn't it yeah that one stuff i had was horrible yeah yeah yeah and you want a uh kind of dull needle it's just easier you're not poking your own holes that way so and then we want to go in the hole that's going to be in the front i saw some pretty um like different stitches and stuff on pinterest today i was thinking you yeah just different fun you know different ways to right decorative sorry i don't know where it is yeah are you doing a different one are you doing something oh i'm not doing a different now but maybe yeah i might try something different where was that that's talking to me i can't focus that's right through here somewhere there it is okay i always go middle bottom gracie lane middle top get over here well and usually they're napping right now so i don't know why i don't know she's awake unless she heard me talking yeah i know her make sure everything is i can't see it on this fabric so it's kind of like there we go now you just have to kind of finagle it you watch the dumb fish you like the grace did i go in there i didn't go in there maybe i pulled it all out i don't know i'm doing that one i'm having so many problems today yes it is okay good yeah and of course you want to make sure it's straight up you know right side up she don't want to watch them nope she's too grown up for fishies now right apparently so okay so let's see i just double check back here make sure it's nice and snug give it another tug see that didn't take long did it making all those mistakes for you guys all my regulars are probably like whatever michelle she's blowing smoke guys no clint came in while i was checking the to see what the processing was doing and he's like can you redo my my finger i said can you wait until i'm done with this video yeah i feel like i'm so oh well i think it was um with gracie and having to stop and do this that this and the other then so again just i always just go through because if you put and one thing i was going to tell you guys is the envelopes we made i'm just going to put them in here i haven't figured out exactly how but i'm not selling them into the um signature i love this not beautiful gracieland i have my spray bottle if i need it i will use it she can be yeah because didn't he say he would have to bury something gracie yeah i'd say buried about 10 foot away oh yeah he's gracie do wine i'm thinking gracie lynn quit chewing on that does somebody want a cat i'll give you a fence cat i can't have my grace gracie that is not something to eat on let go let go just reach over and grab your water bottle should leave oh that's a good idea gracie grace sitting there playing tug over oh you guys i haven't had a nap either which i haven't really i think it's good it feels like spring i'm not really that tired so that's a good thing okay guys we're gonna try it wish me luck okay it's the right way i have top on the top so let's try this again uh animals i tell ya well we're gonna buy like two have three of those things and keep them up oh you have to call somebody i don't know i'm gonna go grab one wipe things through my hands you just want to make sure it's oh the white it's really out of the that's how you're going to get that like right on the spine sometimes i just kind of pull clint said i stole this from him by all but he's probably right okay i hope i got those right double check okay so two i need to get a container or something put in there for my extra needles uh yeah the mess i had today is kind of like when i first when i first did a um junk journal i talked about this every time but we uh you know what i was gonna look and see if there was any hair or anything i don't see anything i've been trying to keep her keep her away from the thing but yeah um the first time it had like six signatures and the lady who was doing doing it did uh and you guys know who it is if you've been a while but it was a paid course and she just did one big string for six signatures and to do the you know um sew in all of them using that one big string well if you get it upside down then you have to cut every single one of them out and start over so this is my favorite who was it uh mobile home um oh okay okay oh okay when did you tell them hey buddy yes just don't tell longs not want to deal with him but yeah and then so i turned it turned one upside down so then i had to cut them all apart and redo them so and then you after you put them in you glued it down so this is just a headache so that's why i do the three stitch pamphlet stitch three whole panel stitch it's mine of on my choice yeah that one stuff didn't work okay finish this part where is that the mouth can you do the ounce and see what that's on uh where's 45 uploading well i want to see if it sticks or not we'll see because that should be about right okay and then of course i keep all my stuff in one organized chair i'm not really organized but i don't want to have to look for it any time no and since i have this and then i ordered extra so i thought i was ordering two but i was ordering two sets of two so always put my stuff in here even a pen that way i don't have to look for it and then my template so i want to use that on another one you can do that okay guys now what you've been waiting for i don't know if it has enough but i want to decorate the cover so i'm gonna tie this i know someone said she wasn't sure about that but i'm not going to just like slap it on there we're going to decorate it so that is a little bit tighter of course i still have more decorating inside but i've been working on that and i kind of want to see what it's going to look like so i did put it like on lace oops i don't cut that piece off and then i have a needle in here but i think i'm gonna like that and then i was thinking oh wow i like that yeah i kind of um you know made it look nicer than yeah than it had been yeah i really do i really really like it so i made it more like it should be and then i was thinking and i i don't know if i'm going to do this or not let's use this as oh my god i can't believe you said that woman and he had a perfectly good fabric scissors right there in arm's length oh that's just wrong that just hurt my heart didn't you i did i'm sorry yeah i knew but i was thinking i don't know really it go away you started it i was thinking oh i always talk like that woman actually i think did that hurt yeah the amish book i'm reading today the little girl said i'm thinking and she's like oh no i was laughing oh gear i was thinking oh but i was thinking that i would like to like pop it up somehow so i was thinking maybe you know like something underneath just barely sticking out okay buddy i don't know hon what do you think let me see i'm just like something like this just little bits peeking out from under it yay or nay honey i really think it's better the other way without that what kind of but then it does kind of blend in it does blend in so you really can't well let's just try one slow stitching like a ribbon around it oh yeah i have that plan too but maybe i wouldn't need anything if you did that see i was thinking like just folding the pieces and popping them under there i don't know i mean i understand where you're going i don't know yeah i just don't you're just not sure what i should do yeah exactly i mean i think you're on the right track i just i don't know well and i do have like dark purple uh ribbon yeah that i considered that's kind of where i'm leaning that you could whip stitch it on there huh okay let me look and see what i have done i know what well i do have an idea out oh i probably don't have any i was thinking what if you used crochet thread and just kind of weaved it around well i did have this and i thought you know maybe i could just do oh maybe that would work too is just kind of loop it yeah that'd be better underneath it done what do you guys think tell me now tell me now you'll be like thanks a lot michelle that's kind of cute though actually let's look at that if i kind of marked it maybe with your pen uh yeah your marking pen uh it's i don't think i picked it up i think it's right there you know what i could just do it on here maybe that's what i'll do is just this is like glue it so it's popping out like that i like that let's just try it i mean surely i can rip it off right let's see what see what my people are saying i'm trying to read their um thoughts from two days from now yeah can you check that because if it's not going up any higher than we need to push the 45 percent matching which is what it was i'll go first thank you well and it just they just fixed it he was out here two hours i mean for two hours the other day okay so if i do it like this and i just want it just like half an inch showing i'm just going to put a little bit of glue until i know for sure that's what i want to do i don't have to go all the way out or end yeah the other night was a friday night they fixed it after their time off so oh i kind of like that okay well let's keep working on it and see what we can come up with i want to cut it every time and i can come back and glue that down i just want to see what i want to do yeah it was kind of funny though watching reading the um promised book and one of the amish people said that oh god what do you think i think i might like it yeah i like that better where it's just a little bit yeah and i'll put loose all the way around it yeah okay well let me cut all those that way i don't have to keep trying to get my fabric i don't know how many i need so i'm just going to cut them all right we'll stop there yeah so he said that if we got those that big one that we'd have to cart it down or whatever so i wouldn't want to do that i was hoping they would come up and do philly you know well i think we'll go with the little ones well the other guy good other company country when they get theirs we'll just to go have them do one for us oh you think so yeah because they say you didn't have to have to do a pipe yeah yeah we could do that well if that's the case we just need one more instead then two i was just gonna plan on using those from now on i'm using fabri-tac here just because i want to make sure and for the dry time i just didn't want to have to wait on large leather glue is it working now oh good so it must have been that well and i haven't been on my phone or pad in a while so i have that on facebook as long as it's working yeah so i sewed it to that piece of lace like i'm sure you guys noticed that instead of gluing it and i tried to give it like some dimension i think i heard a kitty somewhere talking to you is he over there in your lap yeah no i'm sorry this would be easier if it wasn't um wrinkly but don't work yeah because he said the other guy said if we would be able to just put it right beside you wouldn't need all the pipes and stuff that's true i forgot about that okay so let's try it and i'm just doing like half an inch to my finger i kind of like that what time is it it is just kind of guessing about where i want them to pop out so i'll just hear you guys oh that's horrible it'll be cute when i'm done i think you were on the right side yeah i didn't really like the fabric so i mean i had already planned on putting like a ribbon or something and like as an accent but i think well here well i'll tell you you guys are still getting the word out about sticky crap yeah you've been talking to him on facebook facebook well no sticky crap yeah on youtube who was it she said she went to the store and was asking the lady about the stuff and the lady couldn't understand what she's talking about and she said you know that sticky crap the lady's like oh i know exactly what you're talking about i have such bad influence what what you know that sticky crap a sticky crap that you used to put fabric together oh i know what you're talking about that is funny i don't know what you guys think too much going on what do you think is that too much well i this one's out too far um let me see before i put the other ones on because i can take them off right now if i don't like it what do you think i like it it brings it kind of ties it in okay are you not liking it i'm not sure well like i said you could always just we if you have the smaller one just leave it in them well maybe i don't need so many of them you know yeah let's kind of rearrange them and see maybe i have too many of them and that's why i'm just putting a little bit on them right now just to kind of i think i might like that better what do you guys think where it's just a little bit of uh where it's not so because i took them off here here and here okay what do you think about those and then maybe one right here sorry guys i have no clue what i'm doing but i know you guys like to see videos like this my thought process which could be a scary thing okay i like it i think i'm gonna go with that it's not tons but it's enough to kind of like clint said you're kind of weaving in your your ribbon okay i'm not done yet so don't freak out on me you guys don't freak out on me okay we're gonna glue it down you guys ready for this oh michelle no i'm gonna put it on here here here and we're gonna double check that i have it going the right way that would not be a good thing with it i got stuff all over my finger thank let's just double check that my signatures are going the right way okay that would be my luck uh-oh okay guys here we go wish me luck i really like that actually i think that's really cute and i really just wanted to use this um like vintage sewing of the um iris that's what inspired this you know okay and then it does have a little bit where you can kind of give your iris a little bit of movement just kind of making sure that's how i want it before it starts drying it's kind of cute i like it okay and then make sure there's nothing on here that's gonna get all over the place i've had these to kind of maybe dress it up that's cute maybe we'll kind of put those like around the edges i wonder if i got a long enough piece oh that's pretty guys i like that oh perfect i just cut me a piece when i went outside earlier so this piece glued that together or something it's just not working and then maybe like under i kind of like that start at the bottom we'll see i might make a total mess out of this one yeah it'll work out on it well i wasn't necessarily meaning for you i was thinking about my friends saying that man that that glue i tell you is pretty goopy yeah it is that fabric so we're just kind of position it wherever deleted it i think the whole thing went down because it's not even at the block oh yeah it's at the bottom sorry it looks like our internet's messing up again check her phone gary's not gonna be happy if i love that what do you think of these teardrops oh yeah it looks good do you like it really just saying that can you go over there and push the um google ball you know what i'm talking about don't you on the bottom almost done i don't know why it went down though hope you guys are doing well besides better than me hmm i must reduce we'll see you guys have to let me know what you think be nice that's really cute i don't know what do you guys think let me bring it up i like it i think it turned out really cute trying to make sure you know it's well attached which i can do after it's really dry and then i was thinking i got these really cute charms today i know okay i got these here that's gonna be cute i think and i thought well let's see what we have because we could hang one make it look more like a love and be loved never ever give up live your dream that's a possibility i think on a silver one believe in love it might be all oh here's love love laughs i think i like to live your dream they're all those four or five then we'll just kind of tuck that in there somewhere so i have a bold pen is that weird i don't know i think it'd be cute just tuck it in there hi arby what

watching be sure and hit that subscribe button give this video a thumbs up and we will see you guys in the next video see you soon bye bye guys you for visiting tech teams you", "MIQnlx2yylA": "[Music] hey everybody welcome to rubber toe rundowns and i'm your host roberto in my rundowns i share with you details about accessories or techniques that go into the pacific rim speedway diecast track this episode of rubber toe rundowns is sponsored by slandman customs be sure to click the link and check out all of his 3d printed accessories for diecast tracks [Music] hey everybody today i'm going to be showing you a custom build that i made for one of our friends over at chaos canyon for their upcoming five stage rally tournament so i'm super excited about this because normally you can't get five tracks for your car unless it's like a multi-track race so head on over to chaoscanyon.online and check out chaos canyon rally 2021 call for entries there's only a couple left available he's having a modified side and a stock side where you can either send a stock car or rent a car but i picked the modified side now the thing with this is it had to be one of very specific listed castings so chaos wrote down the very specific cars and out of the cars listed i chose the audi quattro so that's what i'm going to be modifying today max weight 45 grams and it had to be decked out like a rally car but i could not mark the door of the roofs because those numbers will be assigned and given by chaos canyon himself so let's get started look at that so i'm starting out with the red audi sport quattro i really like this casting i've seen it's done well on the chaos canyon track previously wheels aren't too bad but a lot of room to work with and let's make this a sporty little rally car shall we let's check out the weight stock weight is 36 grams so i have about nine grams to work with which not a bad deal all right first up i'm going to take my 5 64 bit and drill a pilot hole and if this is your first custom build video that you're watching i drill a pretty deep pilot hole because it makes it a lot easier to pop that rivet out later and anything and everything i use in this custom build video and others i actually put a link in the description below yeah look how deep deep that pilot hole is then i'm going to take the 9 64th inch drill bit and drill out the rivet and look at that pops right out nice and clean because i've already drilled that deep pilot hole i notice when i don't do the pilot hole it's a lot harder to get that rivet to pop out well not a lot harder it's just i risk drilling the plastic chassis by going too deep with the bigger bit look at that nice and clean and everything i do use in the video will have a link below in the description so let's separate the bits the chassis the interior the windshield and there we go there's the body nice clean holes on those posts so next up i'm going to put a little drilling oil a little cutting oil one drop into each post and by doing this what i'm doing is the pilot hole wasn't deep enough so i'm going to take that 5 64th inch bit and just make it a little bit deeper and just so the bit doesn't heat up and seize i'm just going to put a little drop of this cutting oil on each post just to make it easier and after doing a couple of these custom build build sorry custom build videos i've improved my lighting and camera angles so you viewers can actually see a little bit better on what's going on so i hope you guys and gals like it if you have any suggestions of anything to improve on i am more than happy to engage in conversation in the comments below also if there's a car that you would like to see me customize and mod put that in the comments as well most of these cars that i'm building are for tournaments and so i am also featuring the tournament as you saw in the beginning of this video so if you are having a tournament and you would like monster motorsports to send you a car let me know and here we go this is a 256 tap again tapping is just preference everyone has their own preference the die cast metal is soft enough to drive a screw into it but i just like the ease of tapping and using a screw and driving it into an already tapped threaded post and i have the tool anyway so i'm gonna use it so here we go nice finished up you'll see here nice looking threads on the inside easy peasy lemon squeezy all right what's next ah yes we're going to strip the body with citrus strip now this was asked in my last video if you can use it on plastic so i'm going to make a point here you should only use it on wood metal and masonry surfaces only for those cars that have plastic bodies do not use this method so i'm gonna pour about a tablespoon of this stuff this stuff's easy to find at lowe's or home depot places like that and it looks like it's about time for me to replace this little plastic container this is actually a lunch meat container so they're i just buy lunch meat that already has these so i don't have to go and buy them extra so once the lunch meat's gone i have the container left so yep we're gonna just spread this stripper all over the inside really well man i am spreading that really really fast the advantage of movie magic right there and then spread it all over the top and the sides make sure you get the front and the back too so it strips it really well so i'm going to seal that up put it away and let it go sit for about an hour so now the big part of this video is painting so here is my little 1 to 64 inch driver that i'm going to use because the vehicle must have a driver and i got this one from haven sun from pw racing he loaned me this driver because i didn't have any so as you can see he doesn't quite fit so i'm going to cut out this part of the interior so his legs can move forward and sit nicely into place so i don't have to cut the figure at all so i'm going to grab my little plastic sprues and as you can see there's not much to cut so it actually goes fairly easy and quickly to clear out this section here all right there it is now let's see if this driver will now fit in the driver's seat come on get in there i don't want to break him he's got his arms are fragile and if you know where fragile where that movie reference comes from put it in the comment below lookie there fits nice nice i like that and as you can see it's not going below the interior so i don't have to worry about that now normally i use these tire weights one quarter ounce and a half ounce but i don't have a lot of room to remove the interior so i'm going to use these smaller tungsten weights which i also got off of amazon and these were shown to me by daddy g from g4 die cast racing and this is nice little heavy weight in a very small and compact package very dense so these are real easy to hide up you know between the wheels and stuff like that so here are the weight differences the one-quarter ounce tire weight adds about six grams and then the half ounce tire weight is about 14 grams and the tungsten cube that weighs about 4 grams so so i've got a 4 gram a 6 gram and a 14 gram so i really can't get the quarter ounce in there without significantly cutting out the interior but chaos is all about how the car looks and being realistic so i think i'm gonna put this tungsten weight in the middle middle back right here so let's see if it if there's a spot for it on the underside of the interior so right there i'm gonna put right there it's a little bit further to the rear than i would prefer but it's gonna be easy so i'm just gonna super glue it into the back and right there look at that movie magic so it's nice seated it's centered and a lot of the derby pinewood derby racing they make it right in front of the rear axle anyway so we'll see how this goes because chaos is going to have a lot of jumps and stuff like that now i'm going to prime it i like to use army painter primer i'm going to use the matte white and the reason why i like to use army painter primer is because it's a very very fine mist and it goes on super even so here you can see i primed the interior sorry it's with the lighting it's going to wash out a little bit it's kind of hard to see the details but yes it goes on very even and i really like it it goes on a lot more even than just regular spray paint you get at a hardware store so here's the driver figure which i painted white and you can see it's actually 3d printed so you can see all the the layering but he's also got a harness a safety harness so i'm going to paint that separately as well sorry for the shaking it's just trying to hold this little guy super close to the camera here's just a little shake so here we go i like to use again army painter brushes i like to use a very fine tip here's the product code if those are interested and again i'll put a link down in the description below and you notice these don't have round handles they have these have triangular handles which are a lot more easier to hold and get a grip and i really really like them i also use a mir americana acrylic paint very inexpensive goes on a lot of services i think i get those like for a buck and a quarter at hobby lobby and then army painter shining silver metallics i like i like the metallics from army painter because they they really do uh pop so we're gonna start with some metallic silver because i want to paint the roll cage of the interior so i'm just going to take and again you see i only put a little dab onto the paper plate and i just use the this is actually the the larger of the two brush tips that i have let me just take my time and just get the entire roll cage painted silver now the armbead painter takes a little bit longer uh to dry so we'll just fast forward here and there you go nice shimmering silver look i've tried the silver in the acrylics and it just doesn't shine and shimmers as much as the the army painter so now i'm going to take the acrylic orange and i'm going to paint the seats because i like basketball color leather seats i saw it once and so i'll never be able to afford basketball leather seats in a car so you know what i might as well paint them in all my interiors so every car that i build and submit that still has the interior this is one of my little signature things to do is i actually paint the interior so you can see it through the window let's see how this looks finished so there you go nice basketball colored seats and i also paint the shifter and the steering wheel because you know those would be leather covered too in my opinion now there's little some black accents these are the bits that you can actually see through the top of the hood i'm not a car guy have no idea what these are other than some kind of air type vent going in or out if you know what these actual pieces are on the real audi quattro put it in the comments below i'd be very interested to hear what what these this part of the car really is so i want to you know make those stand out and since the interior's not black anymore so i want to paint those up so there you go got the seats the roll bars the shifter the steering wheel and little under hood accents painted on that so now let's paint the driver so i'm actually going to paint the helmet uh pink so i think i'm always going to stick with drivers figures that have helmets because i mean that would just make sense um i'm going to keep the racing suit uh white because that way it just reflects light better on the inside of the interior and then i also as you can see here i painted the safety harness red and zoomed in yeah it looks jacked up as anything but it's super super tiny so that's the best i could do but i'm i'm happy with it so now i'm going to shade or wash the interior and the figures what this does it adds a tone to all the cracks and crevices to help bring out the details so here i'm applying it with a brush that i don't care about i have a pack of brushes that are just cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap and because this is kind of like a varnish this wash so it ruins brushes like crazy so it gives it a nice weathered look but it also brings out the details as well especially in the seats because sometimes seats the interiors on some castings they have some really nice detailing in the seats so this wash will rest into the cracks and give it more definition and then on this white it gives it a nice little sun weathered look a little little dirty look so it doesn't just look super super uh brand new and i just make sure i get everything that can be seen through the windshield and there you go it's a little shiny because it it just went on there but as it dries it it turns to more of a matte finish so there we have it nice little weathered look and now we're gonna do the driver and what's really cool is once once i put it in the drivers where his eyes are you really can see um his facial features now sorry that the footage is a little blurred this is like zoomed in at 300 percent just to give you an idea of what i'm doing but i'll give you a close-up once i'm finished here so again making it look a little dirty so it's not as white here we go let's look at that here's a little bit more clearer picture so see you can see how the wash fills in in the cracks let's get come on focus focus well probably if i wouldn't move as much but yeah just gives it more of a realistic look and feel and you kind of see his nose and where his eyes are in that helmet as well so i'm going to put those off to the side and let them dry and we're going to go back to the body that's being stripped as you can see it actually came out really nice and this was actually only in there for about an hour and a half really doesn't take very long uh some castings the paint comes off really quick others just take way way longer so there's the bear casting and as you can see there's still some rough surfaces so i'm just going to hit it with some steel wool this is for two purposes one it kind of buffs it out but if there's any residual paint from the original paint it in those cracks it also gets those out as well so there you go you can see it's nice and shiny and smooth so here's something different normally i wait until the very end of the build to dry lube the car but the graphite gets all over the paint job and the body and everything like that so now what i've done is i've reassembled all the bits of the car i have not screwed in the screws yet i just kind of hold it all together and now i graphite it so i use this hobby lube put a couple shots right there on the axle now i'm pushing up with my finger from the bottom to get that axle to come up and hold the other tire in place and just use the acid brush to tap it to get it into the area between the wheel and the axle then i'm going to push up and back and forth really really hard and really aggressive i'm not going to be gentle with this at all because i really want to work the graphite into those little imperfections on the axle now i haven't tried polishing axles yet um i'm just trying to keep things smooth and streamlined and see how they go both tires have been graphited and as you can see they're spinning quite a while there this video hasn't been altered in speed so i'm really liking how smooth and how far those are running i'm just going to keep spinning them it's just it's just so satisfying after you dry lube a vehicle and it just sits there and spins for a really long time it's really really nice all right here i've painted the body i use tester's extreme lacquer and so i primed it white with the army painter and then the metallic pink from testers and i've also given it a couple clear coats of very wet um finish so gloss finish there so there it is just two rattle cans i don't airbrush i just rattle can it now it's time for water slides these water slides i get from mr poffler from rust belt customs and rust belt diecast racing so normally this monster motorsports label is is one line and it's long but it went too far the car is not long enough so i just cut them in half to put one at an angle and then one along above the rear wheel so i kind of like the look of that so these tweezers and this third hand help a lot as well and then using the cotton swabs to roll over the water slide to push out any excess water all right let's take a closer look at that look at that i just i just love water slides it just adds so much to a car and you know hey this is monster motorsports if i built a car let's let's rep the brand right so here's the car finished all nice and decaled up a lot of different water slides there and all those little sponsor those little brand logos right there on the between the the door and the front wheel those were six separate water slides that i cut out individually and laid down individually they are tiny oh my goodness and i got those off of ebay which i'll put the link down below as well all right we have glued the driver into the interior look at that i'm really liking how that worked out and i just use gorilla super glue gel and it hardens up very very nicely and you can see a lot of the details there with the wash and stuff like that so all righty what next oh yes the windshield that's right now this is something i encountered look at that gap oh something i did not anticipate being my first driver he's too tall and i've already glued him in there so this is my solution drill a hole in the top of the glass to allow his helmet to poke through and look you there and now the glass is flush again with the interior so i was actually very fortunate that that turned out the way it did so let us reassemble placing the interior back on the chassis our little drill hole drill windshield and our custom body and after i put the water slides on i did shoot it with another couple coats of clear coat it's the wet look clear coat from testers and these are 256 by 1 8 inch screws they're hex hex head screws and i really don't have to drive them in with extra force because they're i've already pre-tapped the holes and they're holding in there nicely very happy with how this build has turned out nice driver man i can't wait to see it with the numbers applied by chaos canyon loving the wheels too oh they spin so nice i'm super excited can't wait for this bad boy to make it one month voyage across the pacific to new zealand all right painted up the lights the grille and the tail lights are red but you really can't tell so let's see some clam shots of this bad boy and there she is in the new monster motorsports diecast garage looking good i have not come up with a name for the car yet so if you have a name suggestion for this car put it in the comments below and i'll pick one of those thanks for checking out this episode of rubber toe rundowns if you enjoyed this video give it a like and subscribe to my channel for more

Stanley was Stanley handcrafted and today we're gonna be talking about wax and weighing it and basically getting it into jars a question that comes up a lot and it's one that popped up again that Shawn and I were talking about the other day and that is when you're filling the candles and a lot of the tutorials that I do I use the 8 ounce jelly jar which is a really common jar and then of course pretty much any of the waxes we're using kind of one pound as the base for everything for the oil is just the mixing the weighing and pouring into different jars and the question that comes up a lot is the one pound of wax fits into three of the eight ounce of jelly jars which is this one right here and of course everybody's first question is how does 16 ounces fit into 3 8 ounce jars that would be 24 ounces and that's what this video is gonna be right here we're gonna go into exactly why 16 ounces of wax is gonna fill 3 of these jars now first off you're gonna see that the jar isn't actually full all the way so eight ounces would be clear to the top so if you did have three jars full completely to the top you're looking at right around like 24 ounces so we're actually going down just a little bit more so you're only putting I don't know I'd probably say like eighty-five ninety percent of the of the jars being full so you're gonna knock that down just a little bit more but that still doesn't take into take into the fact that you're only adding 16 ounces of wax but a lot of people forget that you're also adding a little bit of oil which kind of bumps that up a little bit so you're gonna be using 16 ounces of wax and then with the Paris Oi you're gonna be using right around 1.2 to 1.3 ounces of oil which is gonna bump that up to about 17 point two 17.3 but again that still doesn't add up to around kind of 20 21 22 ounces to fill those three jars and that's when we get into another area that a lot of people don't think about and something else that I kind of wanted to talk about too and that's because the wax actually has more volume than say something like water so a lot of people when they get into candles they don't know how much it lacks to add to a particular jar so a lot of people recommend adding water to a jar and basically seeing how much you need so basically a lot of people will get in and they'll fill this jars who right about this point they'll see the exact ounces that they need for water they'll take into a little bit of consideration for the oil that's going to go into it maybe get down a little bit and then of course when you weigh out that much wax and then you pour it into these you end up with a lot more wax than you thought of you end up with a lot more wax than you actually calculate it for and that's because wax is larger by volume than water is and what I mean by that is 16 ounces of water if you measure that into a measuring cup it's going to hit the 16 ounce mark if you measure 16 ounces of weighed wax and then you melt it down and then you pour that into the same measuring cup you're actually going to get a lot more than the 16 ounce line with the water so we're gonna go ahead and just jump right into the video I've already melted some and I'm just gonna show you the video of basically doing the water weighing it out showing it in the measuring cup and then weighing the wax melting it and then pouring it back into the measuring cup all right so we've got 16 ounces of wax solid form we're gonna go ahead and melt that down to see what it looks like in liquid form once you pour it into this to see the difference between 16 weighed ounces and 16 volume ounces and while we're waiting for that I've got some water right here so we're gonna go ahead and weigh out 16 ounces [Music] that's around 16.4 so just a little bit over but you can see that it's right at the 16 ounce mark it's actually just under a little bit so it aboard it exactly 16 ounces and then we're gonna go do the same thing with the wax all right so this is fully melted and this is 16 ounces exactly from what we made earlier I'm going to zero this out and then we're just going to go ahead and pour this in [Music] and you can see exactly what I was going for 15.8 there's too still a little bit of wax in there I'll try to get it back to 16 that's good enough but the point is that is why you measure by weight not volume so you can see the water of course it was sixteen point four and it was right at the 16 mark the wax at fifteen point nine is almost at twenty fluid ounces so that's the big reason why you always so that right there is exactly why you're always gonna measure and test in your glasses okay so you can clearly see that the wax there there is a lot more wax than there is water and that's where a lot of people get into trouble they do a lot of these jars they'll fill them up and when they go to do like six jars or something like that if you're weighing out like two pounds you end up with almost almost another full jar with wax that's left over that you didn't calculate for so that's why measuring with water is not a great idea it's always best to start with 1 pound of wax melt it down and then just pour it into jars and if you're under or over you can kind of you can adjust for that you can add an extra jar add a little bit more wax if you do have a little bit of extra wax I usually just pour it into a melt like these right here if I have extra wax especially when I'm doing the first couple batches and I'm trying to measure out how much wax is gonna go into like two or three of the nine ounce straight jars the tumblers or anything like that I know to start with a pound and I'll see how many jars I get out of that in anything left over I just pour straight into melts and then turn around and sell these but that still leaves the other question that a lot of people have and that is how does 16 ounces of wax and of course bumping it up with the oil and everything like that seventeen point three ounces of total wax weight and oil weight fit into three jars and basically that's going to come down to this so you're looking at a total of around seventeen point to seventeen point three if you divide that by three jars which it fits into you're gonna come out to just under six ounces so you're actually putting about six ounces of wax and oil into each jar so you're not actually getting a full eight ounces in the eight ounce jelly jar and then of course the reason that looks so full is because again you saw in the video that the wax there's a lot more volume than there is the water by weight so you saw that there's 20 ounces of basically volume so if you're gonna go by volume of wax it went up to the 20 ounce line so getting that much more wax it's gonna even though it weighs less you're gonna fill more of the jar so if you were to fill 6 ounces of water in this thing it would be a lot less than this so that's where a lot of people get into trouble with this one and I definitely did it in the beginning I just didn't even think about wax and water weighing the same or having the same volume and I made the same mistake I would basically go through I measured a couple jars and then of course I ended up with so much extra wax that I just couldn't figure it out and then of course like thinking about it a little bit actually going back to like high school science it finally made sense on why it did that so like I said getting into new jars anything like that and how do you weigh them out how do you figure out the wax I just go for a pound you can you can you can get away with a few other ways to do it too if you have like a 12 ounce jar you know it's not gonna hold 12 ounces so I usually go back down to right around like 80% wax so if it's 12 ounce jar I'll take it down to nine ten ounces somewhere in there and then I'll weigh that out add the oil and then I'll fill a couple different jars basically take like 12 ounce tumbler 10 ounces of wax and then I'll kind of double that up so I can kind of match it so if I'm doing three jars it'd be 30 ounces so that's like right at 2 pounds basically so I would just go ahead and add two ounces of wax fill those up kind of see where they go and see how much wax I have leftover or see how much wax I need and then I can adjust that 32 ounces up or down like one or two maybe three ounces depending on what I'm doing so if if those twelve ounce tumblers ended up only taking about nine ounces of wax I would take that back down from the 32 knock it back to around like twenty-eight twenty-nine ounces or bump it up to maybe 33 or 34 and the reason you would probably take it down a little bit more the 10 ounces I think the 12 ounce tumblers it's been a while since I've filled those I think they actually take a little bit closer to nine ounces of wax and then of course when you add the oil that's gonna bump it up a little bit more to around the 10 ounce mark but that would basically be my recommendation I usually just start out with 1 pound pour it see what it does and then if you've got extra you're gonna have a couple extra melts or just go by about 80% of the actual jar itself so again like I said a 12 ounce I would knock it down to around 9 or 10 if you're feeling like a 20 ounce jar or a bigger candle I would knock that one down probably 16 to 17 I don't know if I would go 18 on that one just because you're gonna have so much more wax that's probably gonna fill it so I would knock that one down a little bit more so probably 16 ounces in a 20 ounce container and then of course adjust as needed so I hope that made sense to a lot of people we get this question a lot and I have surprised I haven't done a video about this one in all this time it's a real easy one it's an easy one to mess up and it's one that a lot of beginners mess up every single time I did it in the beginning and somebody knew watching this video is probably still gonna do it so again if you have any questions on this one or if you have something to add to this one that I might have forgotten or kind of skipped over just let me know in the comments down below I try to go through and answer every single one of them and then of course this discussion will be further carried on on the DIY Facebook group and I've got a link for that down below as well and of course a lot of the materials that I use in the video I've also got links to like candle science Lone Star maple street everything like that in the links down below so if you see something in the video that you kind of want to use like the bag clips a lot of people like the bag clips or the wick holders that I use and I always keep a link for those down below because they're so handy and then of course you can follow me on all the social media platforms Instagram Facebook my website my email is down below also so please reach out ask me anything you need to the DIY Facebook group you can reach out to me

of problems that have to do with measurements in ounces and pounds in the first one they're asking how many Ounces are in a certain number of pounds and in the second one we're doing some subtraction which can get a little bit tricky the key fact you need to know is how many ounces are there in a pound and if you don't know it's 16 so 16 ounces equals 1 pound actually I guess we say lb for pound and what I like to do is write this as a ratio a special kind of ratio that people either call a unit multiplier or I like to call a conversion factor and you can write this ratio in either of two ways you could have pounds on top one pound is 16 ounces or you could have 16 ounces on top and one pound on the bottom and in various situations you might need to use one or the other when you convert from one unit to another what you do is you multiply by a conversion factor by a unit multiplier so what we're starting with is 4 pounds I'll put the unit's in there and I like to write this as a fraction so I just put a 1 on the bottom that's the same thing as 4 pounds but I've put it in the form of a fraction because I'm going to multiply it by another fraction now which one of these do I pick to multiply to convert this into ounces the trick is that you want if you have pounds on the top to begin with you want pounds on the bottom in your unit multiplier so I'm going to choose this one so I'm going to multiply this by 16 ounces on the top and 1 pound on the bottom the reason I want pounds on the bottom is because I want to end up with ounces that's what the question says how many ounces when you have pounds on the top and pounds on the bottom you cancel those so those units cancel out and what you're left with after you do the math is just ounces now I simply multiply these fractions 4 times 16 on the top one times one on the bottom so let's see 4 times 16 what is that 64 and one on the bottom I could write 64 over 1 or I could just leave it as 64 it's 64 ounces that how many Ounces are in four pounds this next one asks us to subtract 216 pounds three ounces from a hundred and seventy three pounds or minus 173 pounds 14 ounces so I'm going to write it out like a traditional subtraction problem here 16 pounds three ounces on the top minus 173 pounds 14 ounces here now when I start this I start here with the ounces and what I notice is I have three ounces minus fourteen ounces and just like in regular subtraction if the number is smaller here I have to borrow from the next unit over while the next unit over is in pounds and I'm going to take away one pound from that 216 that makes this 215 and I get one pound over here but I need to convert it to ounces before I add it in so I don't put a 1 here what I put in is a 16 plus 3 so really this is 19 ounces now minus 14 ounces while 19 ounces minus 14 ounces is 5 ounces so that worked out now we can continue on with my subtraction 5 minus 3 is 2 1 minus 7 I have to borrow again so that becomes a 1 I put a 10 really or you know a 1 in front of the 1 that becomes 11 minus 7 that's 4 and then 1 minus 1 is 0 so it's 42 pounds oops and 5 ounces", "ku91XAyyN6c": "so far we've only focused on the 1 ounce leaky drive slug in our first test we used a nun rifled shotgun and had very bizarre flight characteristics and this is less about the destination and more about the journey next we used a rifled choke tube to impart spin stabilization on the slug and we saw for the most part a noticeable improvement in just how the slug flew through the air but we also saw on one occasion the wadding getting shoved into the back of the slug and completely ruining everything [Music] we've seen what the one-ounce leaky drive slug will do and what it can't do now let's take a look at the 7/8 ounce version many people have commented saying that they've had much better results using the 7/8 ounce version of the leaky drives look for the most part they're very similar in design of course the 7/8 ounce one is a little bit lighter and a little more nose heavy now once again we're using off-the-shelf birdshot shells for the two yourselfers not quite ready to get into reloading yet we want to show it this is just another option for you although it's not a requirement having a mountain storm shell prepping tool comes in very handy for making these things and these things work great for making wax slugs too and I want to thank our W for supplying us with this cutter and also those seven eighths ounce slugs you can see how it leaves the Roll bead there to hold the wadding and everything in place it's just an awesome tool to work with now we want to address the issue of the slug being stuck or shoved into the back of the cavity and you can also see we have a lot of extra space there inside the shot cup we should be able to address both issues using something called nitro cards which is just a fancy term for five-eighths inch cardboard discs now you can buy the nitro cards in bulk and they're about maybe 2 cents each and it didn't make any sense because I had a 5/8 gasket punch and plenty of scrap cardboard and I should note that you need a shot cup in order to fill the space between the slug and the rifling in order for the rifling to work the the slug has to squeeze through there and that plastics a bow or shot Cup fills that space so it will spin we will be shooting these through the Mossberg 590 with the smoothbore but first we'll be shooting them through the Benelli Nova with the rifled choke tube and once again we'll be shooting these at 50 yards here's his grouping but let's look at the high-speed footage to see how he got there now if you were just looking at the grouping and try to make an evaluation that way you really aren't looking at the whole picture really this is the only slug of this set that actually oscillated all wild like that but the strange thing is that particular slug hit closest to the target so there's really a lot of factors going on here that can throw off your shot it could be the way our W cast the slugs it could be that wadding that is missing two petals that throw things off it could be the brand of shells that I selected or those homemade nitro cards that I made and we know that Roberts a really good shot but you know he's prone to being human too ain't like any humble person he's willing to admit that we see something very interesting in the shot watch closely we know that when an objects flying at a supersonic speed it has a low-pressure area behind the slug and we can see one of the nitro cards just kind of falling off right before it hits the target the round is constantly decelerating it gets to the point where it just can't hold under that nitro card anymore now it appears to me that in almost all these shots there is a nitro card stuck to the back of the slug and really I don't think that played a major factor in the grouping of these slugs but every little factor plays its own little role in how a slug flies through the air so you really want to achieve absolute consistency on how you load them before you even shoot them how did the 7/8 ounce slugs perform out of a smoothbore shotgun how good is the smoothbore performance the answer that is remarkably good despite not having any spin stabilization the slugs flew nice and straight for us it has become very obvious to us that the 7/8 ounce slug is a far better slug aerodynamically there's just something minutely hinky about the 1 ounce Li key Drive slugs but the 7/8 out slugs they did it right they got the balance right and they fly very well I hope this video was helpful to you thanks for watching", "KYB0PfsVJhw": "pedaling along into this and you are going to on this question and equation e how

Etsy I'll link it up here and down the description box if you guys wanna go check it out but I am constantly looking for more professional like advanced ways to package my products and I found a really really awesome way to kind of like seal up bottles so a lot of times I don't have you ever seen but brands will use like white electrical tape sometimes black or whatever color they desire to seal up the tops of their bottles so they'll take like a bottle like this and then seal up the top with tape like so so nothing leaks which is a very smart efficient way to prevent leakage but personally I kind of feel like that looks a little tacky that's just my own personal opinion so I've been trying to think of a way to seal up the bottles more professionally and then I found something perforated shrink bands so when you purchase things from a store sometimes they have that like a little plastic that you got to find a like a little opening and tear off and then open it up which is sometimes kind of annoying but it's a professional way to seal things and it doesn't only like prevent leakage but it's like a tamper seal it's so the customer knows like oh this hasn't been open yet it's like fancy I don't know I just feel like it's a fancier way to seal things so if you're looking for a more professional way to seal up your bottles perforate shrink bands are perfect they're very inexpensive and they're easy to use so I'm gonna be showing you guys how to use perforated schrick bands and I'll be linking down below right for just mine and which sizes I use for which size bottles and I'll also put down in description box where I purchased my heat gun as well because it's cute you'll see it here in a minute one more thing I do want to mention is I I sell a few things that like are very prove the leakage so I still do use the electrical tape method for certain packages that are very prone to leakage because even though the perforated shrimp fans do go around the cap it's not quite as like tight as electrical tape it's because electrical tape is obviously sticky so it sticks to it perforated shrink bands store just like sit on the top so certain things that are prone to leakage I do use the electrical tape method still but for most of my products I use perforated shrink bands they look so much more professional they're easy to use they're cute and I feel confident when I use them I feel like a professional yeah so if you want to figure out how to use perforated sheet bands then here you go so first off shrink bands come in all kinds of different sizes it really just depends on what site is you need depending on your bottle but typically a size will fit multiple bottles this smaller size is what we're going to be using today and what I think we don't be talking about because it fits most bottles at least most bottles I use so I'm not sure what size this is exactly but I will put on the screen somewhere what size these are and this is what they look like so they are just little plastic shrink bands and they have the little dotted lines you guys probably can't see but the little dotted lines where the customer will rip it off so these lay flat but in order to use them you need to open them up to where they're like round shaped so this size fits half ounce bottles 1 ounce bottles 2 ounce bottles and 4 ounce bottles and I'm talking about the Boston round bottles the ones that look like this so if you have Boston round bottles this size will fit most of those bottles so like I said I'll have this size shrink ban on the screen so you know what size it is and I'll also link it down in the description box along with the Boston round bottles I use in case you guys like these bottles as well so let's just show you guys how to use these so first off open up the shrink bands to where it's like a round cylinder shape and then place it over the bottle and then you want to use a heat gun and let's just take a moment to appreciate how cute my heat gun is I got it on Amazon I'll link it down below in case you want this one as well so this heat gun at least only has one setting off and all I mean you can't really change the heat setting I don't know about other heat guns but this works pretty dang nicely and it's cute so what I like to do personally is I like to press down the band as far as possible that way I know it's like securely around the opening of the cap so then you just want to turn on at your heat gun and then just evenly distribute the heat as it shrinks so you guys will see how how it works here [Applause] and then I just kind of like to go over it with my hands to make sure it's nicely sealed and you just want to make sure that the seal went over the opening so you don't have any leakage because that is obviously why you are using the seal and also it's just a good way to help your customer know that this haven't been tampered with so it's basically like it hamper seal and also just a seal to hold in liquids at least that's why I use it your reasoning may vary so do hope you guys enjoyed that little tutorial on how to use perforated shrink bands it's super easy very inexpensive again I will have everything linked down below that I use and I'll also link down below to the bottles that I use as well I do order them from a bulk supplier so it's kind of expensive if you only want a couple of bottles but I'll try to find some bottles that look like my bottles over on Amazon too and I'll link those down below as well it'll all be down in a description box yeah so I hope you guys enjoy hope you guys have a great week hope you like something if you have any other suggestions for any future videos leave them down the comments and maybe I'll be one so I hope you guys have a great week and hope see you guys next time bye [Music] my son [Music]", "Ef52wCB0Ujg": "so by now you've probably heard of the ChatterBait or at least vibrating jigs they're kind of a hybrid between a spinnerbait and a jig and one thing about them is that they're super noisy and then they call it a chatter bait for a reason one thing you might not know is that g-man has eight different chatter baits in their lineup so we're gonna take a look at each one and look at the differences between them because some of them are better apt to fish and weeds some of them are better apt to fish on bottom and then some of them come with all sorts of other subtle designs that make them more specific in certain scenarios but one thing we really want to take a look at or listen for is what they all sound like because they've all got different blades they've all got different heads they all swim slightly differently so we'll take a look at each one of these ones see what they look like how they're fished but then we'll also listen to what they sound like like I said all these chatter baits have their specific applications but there are little nuance thanks to them for instance what the head is actually made of the majority of them are made with lead but they're also some that are tungsten which obviously sinks faster is smaller and denser and then some are also brass which has a unique kind of look and feel underwater as well so what you know which ones of those are made up of brass which ones are made of tungsten and which ones are made of lead so we're gonna start with the original and the original is just a no-frills workhorse bait just a silicone skirt you know we got a nickel blade on there so we're going to tie that up and one thing we're gonna do today is fish them without a trailer that way you can just kind of see the bait right out of the package how it performs without any influence so like I say well tie on the original here and then pay attention to the way it moves its components but also give it a good hard listen [Music] all right so we've got a good standard established by looking at the original first like I said no-frills workhorse ChatterBait and this is the ChatterBait original but it's the elite series and main difference was that with this is a hand tied skirt and what you get with a hand tight skirt is more unique colors kind of more custom colors and then there's a wire tie instead of a straight silicone skirt so the thing about wire on skirts is that they're just way more durable they last a lot longer so what you're getting for the money here is essentially custom colors and a little bit more durable of a bait still a workhorse still super loud we'll see flip that fondly all right so this is in the original series as well this is the ChatterBait micro and there's a couple instances where you might want to throw the micro over the standard sizes and that is when you're dealing with small mouths you know or spots a lot of times and then when also they're keying on a little bit smaller fish even smaller crayfish at times just when you want to dial down the finesse a little bit there is a micro option nice thing about that too is that you have a fine wire hook so that often times to give you better penetration on softer smaller mouths so like I said this chatter Bay it's a little more apt for a smaller fish and you might even actually can definitely catch crappies on this as well so let's take a look at it so it looks like let's do two thumbs like after looking at that little guy I have got some seriously good ideas for next spring or what I want to do some crappie fishing cuz that thing that just tantalizing I'm like I said smallmouth - that's the first time I've thrown that and I can definitely see where there's gonna be some application here's one that you might have heard about this is the jackhammer this is the Evergreen jackhammer version of the z-man ChatterBait some of the main differences with this ChatterBait is you've got this Gamakatsu hook this thing is wicked you got a little different keeper on here this is a really good like thin wire keeper last tech baits fit on there really good from z-man you've got upgraded colors on the blade and there's a little bit different line tie this is a snap as opposed to the original way that they've got rigged on the other ones and then another big difference is the tungsten head let has a tendency to be pliable and be mushed when it's run into hard structures say you're fishing near a dam a concrete structure tungsten doesn't get scuffed up nearly as much to flex and makes a lot of noise and so you've got a premium skirt upgraded hook 5 out hook on this 3/8 ounce one extra sharp super super durable different bait keeper on here or it's really good with elastic baits that are very soft stretching durable and then you've got a tungsten head and then a little bit different patterns on the blade and a different line tie so like I said lots of thought processes have gone through to make this bait what it is this is the evergreen jackhammer z-man ChatterBait so let's take a look at it see what it sounds like [Music] so one thing to note one thing that the everything jackhammer is really known for is its erratic hunting action and then that's why people seek out the evergreen jackhammer ChatterBait because like I said it's almost got like at this crazy crankbait action to it where it really hunts all that really erratic action obviously a lot of times I can trigger strikes for demonstration purposes today we were just running it at a steady cadence in order to keep it comparative to all the other ones that we've looked at were really them at the same speed and we're giving them the same action so we can really pay attention to the sound but like I said one thing to note is with that jackhammer that hunting action is is really the reason it's so sought-after but the next bait we're gonna take a look at is the chatter bait but it's got a football head on it and so what that says to me is that this is going to be fish closer to the bottom this is a chatter bait that you're going to want to use around rock or wood you know and really deflect because everybody knows a football head has a really good way of maneuvering through cover through snags so if you take a look at it right here it's got this jointed football head this is from freedom tackle this is the collaboration it's got this swing head style football head on the front of it and that's going to give it some cool kind of crankbait esque action as well when it's down there deflecting so let's take a look at that too [Music] so like I said with that one good choice when you're gonna be fishing around cover reflecting off rocks and wood and then of course it's got that unique swing head design so picture that with a trailer you know and put your favorite trailer on there and you can really see the kind of action that it's going to impart so take a look at that one we're gonna take a look at a similar one here this is another collab with freedom but the unique thing about this bait there's an e WG hook on here there's a wide gap hook so you can take baits rig um completely weedless Texas rig um and then you can run them through a lot of cover that way too still got the swinging head it doesn't have the football head on it so it's not going to be as good at deflecting but like I said you can put whatever trailer you want on this ewg and run it through vegetation so that's gonna make it a good choice for that another cool thing about the freedom head is the brass blade now you can get different blades for all your chatter baits this one's got a brass blade and then the head itself of the freedom tackle head here this the swing head is brass as well which is kind of a rarity and fishing sometimes too you know things are dominant by tungsten and lead but this is brass so you know if you're behind a guy who's fishing lead who's fishing tungsten and you throw something just a little bit different in that brass brass is a little bit softer makes a little bit different noise and flex a little bit differently so see if you can pick that up when we wash it here underwater so the last two we looked at were a collab with freedom freedom tackle they got the swinging heads on them a little softer metal that makes a little different noise and has a different flash also has an e WG hook on there so you can put whatever plastic you want on fish it in the weeds the next one we're gonna take a look at here are the project Z series Z man chatter baits there's a couple differences amongst all eight of these chatter baits you know you've got the original chatter baits here and then you've got a gamma katsu hook on this evergreen jackhammer you got VMC hooks on the freedom tackle ones and these are Mustad hooks this is a heavy gauge Mustad hook so if you've got a preference on hooks there's a chatter bait out there for you so let's take a look at the project Z series again we're concerned with what they sound like so pay attention to that right so this is one of two of the projects these series got a good look at that one and then the last one we're gonna look at is the one we just looked at only with a brush guard where you're gonna fish in and around cover lots of these are really good at deflecting as well but here's just that added security with a brush guard on it and again you know that's that jig spinnerbait hybrid you can take a pretty good look at that custom head on there you can see it kind of flows through into the skirt you know kind of a silver gray top bleeds in white and a yellow chartreuse into a pearl all those kind of translate into the head there so that's a ultra-realistic design super attractive head style on there and let's take a look at it underwater all right so there it is a look at all eight of the chatter Bates and the z-man lineup after looking at them I hope that you understand where each one has a place where you'd use one over the other and what they sound like in variation because I'm sure you didn't even know that there was a chatter Bates in the z-man lineup so hopefully you learned something today pick one of these up whatever situation fits the lake that you like to fish pick them all up if you like to fish a lot of different places across the country because the ChatterBait is one of the most versatile baits out there", "rSHNFo4DWjQ": "welcome happy new year welcome to a brand new year yay 2020 is gone okay hey i'm gonna set up a couple things um on my screen to get us started so first let's take that rolling text off um second i don't know what happened to my music but we can fix that we have the power and set up a few more things oh i'm still not getting music oh i know what's going on oh look got to set something else on my music sorry folks give me just this is why it's nice to have a producer now you hear music i bet let me reset that real fast there you go now you've got music so much better with music in the background they've actually done a study and found that um when you're playing uh when you're doing tai chi to music um that it relaxes you more and i think that's an important thing especially in this uh crazy world uh that we are living in right all right um thanks for being here um i hope everybody had a great holiday um i hope everybody had a great new year i'm excited about the new year as the vaccine rolls out i'm thinking we're going to be able to see you and at some point we'll be able to go back in person in classes i do have a few classes that are teaching live so if that's something you're interested in shoot me an email i can let you know where those are um and uh we're gonna we're gonna make 2021 um a great year all right sounds good um let's go ahead let's get started i've got to bring in my other chairs though so yeah step off camera grab my other chairs real fast so this is the usual best chair setup for this class now you need to do whatever is safe and comfortable for you all right because this is your taiji journey and not mine all right i'm just helping you through it okay so the green chair is a chair to sit in the brown chairs are sitting in front of it so to the side nothing's here so i can move my arms all right so looking at this from the side the green chair is back that i where i can sit and then i can stand up and hold on to these chairs okay um i'm gonna go ahead and take these chairs back away now to give myself some more room um and we're going to talk a little bit about how to sit in the chair but first i'm sorry we want to make sure that we bow in i'm going to have a few changes in year 2021 by the way uh no changes in class we have the blended class which is a seated standing class that's happening at 10 o'clock to 11 and then 11 15 to 12 15 we have our standing class most time best the best way to know you're ready for that class if you know the warm-up exercises pretty well then you are ready for uh the the uh second hour okay i am going to change the set a little bit uh later on this year i couldn't get it all ready in time for for right at the top of the year but i'm gonna have a little bit different look on the set all right let's start out traditional chinese bow right hand fist power left hand fingers together friendship tucking the thumb remaining humble and fist into the paw and we say welcome beautiful all right so when we sit and do tai chi if you choose to sit we'd like you to sit up on the edge of the chair so i'm not using the back of the chair my feet are flat on the floor knee is right over the heel so i have a right angle between the upper and the lower leg now an important thing for my parkinson's friend sometimes you have a tendency to kind of rock back on that pelvic bone rounding the back instead i want you to rock forward on the pelvic bone straightening the back and then instead of having head forward feel like the head is being lifted by a silk thread this is going to feel a little awkward at first for some of you but this is a healthy way to sit you're building core strength you're opening up the inner part of the body the central part of the body you're opening that up for better breathing so this is a very healthy way uh to sit okay um i have good straight body posture in this direction and then when i turn around to the front i have good straight body posture in this direction all right all right so um i'm going to put my chair to the side for right now and we'll talk about how to stand i um so the the type yeah the chinese have a position it's called wu ji it's a state of stillness it's a state of nothingness um and so i'm going to teach you how to stand in the wuji position but if you're seated think of the way i just described there is sitting in the wuji position okay so standing in the wuji position would look like this my feet are shoulder hip distance apart a slight bend in the knees that activates the leg muscles it's important to keep that bend in the knees this is also going to help you immensely with your balance all right when you lock your knees out you may think you're helping yourself with balance but in fact you're not you're making yourself top heavy heavy and i need to slow down you make yourself top heavy and the body will start to kind of rock back and forth where when i bend the knees you can feel it low is the center of gravity you feel your feet connect better to the floor the chinese call that rooting so it's a very very safe way to do things okay so we're in that wuji position knees bent tailbone dropped head lifted by a silk thread arms down to the side we're going to start off with some deep breathing exercises we're going to breathe from the belly not up here in the chest but breathe from the belly all right all right let's begin inhale [Music] and exhale big deep belly breath in and breathe out one more time inhale and exhale push the hands in front of us next inhale and exhale inhale exhale big deep belly breath in breathing out pushing out inhale exhale and one more time inhale exhale inhale and exhale go nice and slow next we're going to do the arms over the head be kind to your shoulders all right inhale hands up in front of the heart exhale gently push the palms to the ceiling inhale hands back up in front of the heart exhale relax the hands down again big deep belly breath in breathing out gently pushing up inhale and exhale one more time inhale exhale inhale and exhale very nice arms to the side inhale hands up in front of the heart exhale gently pushing the palms out notice the fingertips are up you feel the stretch in your arms inhale and exhale big deep belly breath in breathe out push out inhale exhale and one more time arms to the side inhale exhale inhale and exhale next we're going to do arms in the diagonals make sure you keep your upper body straight make sure you keep looking straight ahead sometimes you'll have a tendency to kind of look towards that upper hand instead we want you to look straight in front of you inhale hands up in front of the heart exhale left hand up right hand down inhale and exhale inhale exhale inhale and exhale inhale exhale inhale and exhale inhale hands back up in front of the heart exhale relax the hands down beautiful next we're going to flap the arms like bird wings again we're going to be kind to your shoulders big deep belly breath in and long slow deep breath out again we'll inhale fill the lungs up with air exhale relax the hands down and one more time inhale and exhale lastly gathering chi big deep belly breath in and long slow deep breath out two more times we'll inhale and exhale and one more time inhale and exhale beautiful that's our breathing actually i want to do the breathing a couple more times i want to explain something really fast so something you can watch for with parkinson's is everybody everybody's parkinson's journey is different all right but you will find that in general one side starts to get rigid and one side will start to get weak i'm going to say for the sake of argument that this side is getting rigid and this side is getting weak and what you will find as you exercise is your weak side is a little behind so like when you're gathering chi remember this is my weak side the the hand won't get up quite as high or i'm doing shoulder exercises again with this is my weak side as i do my shoulder exercises i'll lift this shoulder normally and this shoulder will be lagging behind so i'm getting a little movement out of it but not as much all right so it's just something to be aware of as you're doing your tai chi exercises learn the movements first but after you've learned the movements keep an eye on so if you're you know doing the gathering qi is your weak side lower than your than your rigid side or the high side and try and bring that up to even them out okay this is something if we have any care partners or spouses doing this with us um this is something you can keep an eye out for and see if their weak side is lagging a little bit um from the from the rigid side again i'm just using that as an example but you'll see in a lot of exercises you'll see it sometimes in the stepping so again if if this is my weak side i'll have to demonstrate this from the side they'll you'll step out and have you know a quote normal step with the one side and then with the weak side you won't step out as far okay and we want to try and even that up once you learn the movements and as you do more tai chi that will start to even itself out but something you want to be cognizant of and sometimes just just thinking about it a little bit will help start to even that out okay all right so um with that in mind let's gather chi three more times and think about the balancing the left right inhale glance up at your hands and then exhale don't look up at your hands or watch it out of your peripheral vision inhale and exhale one more time inhale and exhale beautiful all right there you go let me get myself a drink of water i recommend you do the same by the way i don't have it here she has it with her um my wife is um so she's eating a little different for the new year one of the things she's doing is drinking 64 ounces of water every day which is something you folks need to do everybody should be doing 64 ounces of water a day she got a water bottle that was off of amazon really sick water it actually has marks on it for how much you should have drank by 7 a.m and then 9 00 a.m 11 a.m 1 p.m 3 p.m so you know how how you're doing throughout the day but it's 64 ounces of water so it's really easy and she has said that it is super super easy because it's all she has to do you know sometimes you think how many how many bottles of water have i had so far today this makes it really easy you fill it up in the morning it's it's done by the end of the day so you can see how you're doing with water um it's a really cool water bottle i wish i i need to take a picture of me with the water bottle because it's a real big water bottle too but it's really helped her and she's been doing really good at drinking 64 ounces of water a day if you want more information about it just shoot me an email and i can send you the link back it wasn't that expensive but it's a really good way to monitor your water intake all right all right so stay hydrated especially in this colder weather drier air need more hydration okay all right let's move along let's do our warm-up exercises starting with the chin tuck we're keeping the chin level as we do this so keep looking straight ahead as you feel like someone's gently pushing back on the chin alright so from the wuji position we float the hands up in front of us hands to the chest tucking in the chin while looking straight ahead rotate the palms out the chin gently floats up sink the chin down to the chest again we float the hands up in front of us hands to the chest tucking in the chin hands come out chin gently floats up and sink the chin down to the chest [Music] one more time we float the hands up in front of us [Music] hands to the chest tucking in the chin feel that nice stretch [Music] rotate the palms out let the chin gently float up and sink the chin down to the chest beautiful next neck exercise we're looking side to side uh make sure you keep your head straight as you do this so you're not leaning your head to the side but keep the head straight rotate it right

gathering qi we're reaching for infinity gently reaching for infinity inhale we're gently reaching out reaching out feeling that beautiful stretch in our shoulders and exhale and relax the hands down oh i wish you guys could see this i have a bird feeder right outside my window here the front of my house is this way and i have a bird feeder right outside of the window here and just had a bluebird sitting on my bird feeder in eastern bluebird state bird of missouri as a matter of fact it's got a beautiful blue color especially in the winter time when all the dead you know you've got you know dead trees and you know everything's kind of brown and colorless you see that bluebird that beautiful color of blue anyway he was he's like 10 feet away from me or he was he flew off now since i

ceiling inhale back to center right hand up left hand down floating the head gently to the ceiling inhale back to center one more time each side exhale float that head gently to the ceiling inhale and exhale floating that head stretching that spot inhale back to prayer hands exhale relax the hands down hey i gotta tell you guys so this young lady does not have parkinson's but she started doing tai chi with me right after the pandemic hit [Music] and it was really cool i didn't hear from her it was on my youtube channel but she sent me a note three months in and said hey i just wanted to let you know i've been following you on youtube started doing tai chi with you in late march um she said i was i i was a half inch shorter by starting to lose my height and she goes i just had myself measured i'm back up to my original height that was after like three or four months she's now taking a zoom class with me and so i get to see her through zoom i still haven't met her in person but she sent me a note last week excuse me really really cool uh she uh visited her chiropractor and had her annual x-ray with her chiropractor she said the difference between between the two was amazing she said she constantly thinks about lifting her head up by that silk thread she goes it must be working because the difference between the two x-rays was amazing and the chiropractor even noted how much better her alignment was and how much better her spine looked from doing tai chi all right so i'm teaching you principles not only for here in class but out there in the real world and something to work on every day so just something as simple as thinking about lifting your head up by that silk thread can change your posture which is important i was talking to a fellow tai chi instructor he's out in hawaii and was talking to him and he has noticed like i have how important posture is for people with parkinson's and we were discussing it and so we both noticed how important posture is so my friends keep that head lifted by that silk thread it'll make a huge difference over the long haul you're not going to feel it like oh i feel a lot different but three weeks or in this case one year later she noticed her chiropractor even noticed her x-rays have shown that that mentality of lifting your head by the silk thread has made a difference in her life pretty incredible isn't it all right second lower spine exercise we're going to turn our upper body from the left side to the right side we're not moving the hips we're turning the belly button left and right all right prayer hand position tai chi ball left hand is on top exhale to the left [Music] inhale the ball over right hand is on top exhale gently sweep and turn to the right inhale the ball over left hand is on top exhale gently left inhale the ball over right hand is on top exhale gently sweep and turn right inhale the ball over left hand on top exhale inhale the ball over right hand is on top exhale to the right and then inhale the ball over come back to prayer hands exhale relax the hands down beautiful there you go all right shake your legs loose get a drink of water um let's do some seated exercises by the way if you want to make a comment or something there is a comment bar there you can type in and you can just say hi and let me know that you're out there or if you have a question you can use that comment to make to ask me a question or you can always reach me on my email craig m at taichi stl.com craig m taichistl.com you can always shoot me an email all right all right so we're gonna sit down do a couple seated exercises now all right um we're going to work on the hips and the knees i want to show you these from the seated position first exercise we're going to do um standing we do the pushing against the wall so we're going to do the corollary of that all right so in this exercise i slide my leg out to the side i keep a right angle between the upper and lower leg i keep my body nice and straight as i do this so i'm not leaning the foot back or out in front of me or tucking it underneath but i keep this nice right angle i'm going to feel the stretch in the inside of my legs and my hips and even the lower back all right if you have arms on your chair go ahead and start by shifting to the right hand side of the chair i'm going to be mirroring you as we do this so facing the right hand side of the chair i am going to keep um to the front just because it shows you this exercise a little bit better from the camera angle all right so slide the left leg across the floor feel that nice stretch and then bring the knees back together again slide the left leg across the floor feel that nice stretch and then bring the knees back together again one more time slide the left leg across the floor and hold it there for a minute inhale and exhale and then bring the knees back together again beautiful now if you're sitting in chair with arms on it go ahead and shift to the left-hand side of the chair so your one leg is up against that upright on the left-hand side of the chair as we do the right foot as opposed to the wrong foot so i'm going to take this little right leg slide it across feel that nice stretch and then bring the knees back together again slide the right leg across the floor feel that nice gentle stretch and then bring the knees back together again beautiful one more time slide the right leg across the floor we're going to hold it here for a minute as we inhale and exhale and then bring the knees back together again beautiful all right shake those legs loose did i see a comment come through no okay i thought i saw somebody make a comment all right next tip exercise we're gonna do the heel kick four motions with the leg all right first we're gonna pick the leg up second we're gonna kick the leg out third pick the leg back up and fourth float the foot to the ground hold that's heel kick what am i thinking i'm trying to go too fast sorry sorry ignore that second hip exercise we're lifting the leg up floating the foot back to the ground all right wish i had a mute button picking that foot up and floating the foot back down keep your back straight keep your body straight then we'll do the heel kick this one kind of preludes the heel kick just get ahead of myself hands in front of us push down on the left foot hard as you can pushing down push push push push and relax and then lift that left knee to the chest back and body stay nice and straight and relax hands in front of us push down on the left foot hard as you can pushing down push push push push and relax and then lift that left knee to the chest keeping the back and body nice and straight and relax one more time hands in front of us push down on that left foot hard as you can push push push push push and relax and then lift that left knee to the chest lift it as high as you're able to but keep that back straight and relax beautiful other side hands in

front of us push down on the right foot hard as you can push push push push push and relax and then lift that right knee to the chest and relax beautiful shake those legs good job everybody all right now we're going to do the heel kick four motions picking the foot up kicking the foot out notice my toe is up and then lifting the leg up and floating the foot to the ground work on keeping your back straight work on keeping your body straight as you do this especially as you're lifting that knee one of my students uh one of my parkinson's friends i was working with him this week as we were doing this this exact exercise i told him that when he's lifting his knee imagine that his head is being lifted by that silk thread at the same time he was having a tendency to kind of lean forward and look down as he lifted his knee up so i said imagine your head and knee are both being lifted simultaneously and that seemed to really help him so see if that works for you okay it definitely helped him as soon as he would think about lifting his knee and his head at the same time he was keeping his back nice and straight all right let me adjust my headset here hang on new headset for the year lower profile okay heel kick hands loosely clenched at the belt line start with the left leg pick the left leg up kick out left punch out right pick up the left leg and float the foot to the ground pick up

the right fist pick up the left leg floating the foot to the ground pick up the right leg heel kick right punch out the left fist pick up the right leg float the foot to the ground beautiful shake those legs loose i'm going to get a drink of water real quick maybe all right second exercise for the knee is a toe kick looks pretty much the same as the heel kick the only difference is a heel kick my toe is pointing up toe kick toe is pointing forward working different muscles of the leg okay all the principles remain the same body straight back straight punching out the opposite hand smiling the whole time of course hands loosely clenched to the belt line pick up the left leg toe kick left punch out right fist pick up the left leg float the foot to the ground pick up the right leg toe kick right punch out left fist pick up the right leg float the foot to the ground pick up the left leg toe kick left punch out right fist pick up the left leg float the foot gently to the ground pick

you can type it in the comments for me um or send me shoot me an email uh whatever works uh best for you okay um let's move along um go ahead and stand if you are able let's repeat a few of these exercises let's do a few of these uh balance exercises from the standing position all right make sure that you have a chair next to you or we talked about how to set up the chairs in that three chair formation so you have a chair to either side of you use that configuration depending on where you're at with your journey you may only need one chair you may want two chairs you may want those three chairs okay we're going to do our hip and actually we're going to do our ankle exercises first and then i'm going to go back and pick up the hip and the knee because i want to make sure you do the ankle exercises it's important when you have parkinson's so you should be doing this exercise every day at least once a day but doing there's two ankle exercises heel toe is the most important one for my parkinson's friends but the second one is a really good idea also it's very important that you have that you keep your ankles strong and flexible okay so using that chair we're gonna weight shift right bend in the right knee left foot touch heel and toe easy peasy right eel and toe heel toe heel toe one more time heel and toe weight shifts to the left bending the left knee right foot touch heel and toe heel and toe heel toe heel toe heel toe one more time heel and toe back to center other side so we're going to weight shift back to the right we're going to do our second ankle exercise touching the little toe and then the big toe outside of the foot inside of the foot or little piggy and big piggy weight shifts to the left bending the left knee right foot touch little toe and big toe outside of the foot inside of the foot little toe big toe one more time little piggy and big piggy and relax beautiful that's our ankle exercises so that's actually all 12 of the warm-up exercises um we're gonna do the hip exercise um and probably i don't know if we'll get to both knee exercises but that's all right we're gonna also be doing those next hour okay so you can take a break and join us the beginning next hour where we roll through all of these exercises from the standing position right now let's do our hip exercise side to side so as we do this exercise our weight shift to the right i keep it bending the right knee my upper body stays nice and straight so i'm not leaning out trying to counterbalance myself i'm not sticking the hip out again trying to counterbalance all right work on the posture just as i said talked about with the gentleman last night who teaches tai chi in hawaii posture is very very important okay so from the wuji position we weight shift to the right bending the right knee hold on to that chair if you need to tap the left foot all the weights on the right so i can tap my left foot or float my left foot and then set the left foot down weight shifts left bend in the left knee and then i tap my right foot or float the right foot [Music] back through center push to the right weight to the right bend in the right knee tap the left foot or float the left foot set that left foot down weight shifts left bend in the left knee tap the right foot or float the right foot back to center one more time each side we push right weight right tap or float the left foot and hold this for a half hour just kidding weight shifts left made you smile weights just left then in the left knee tap or float the right foot and come back to center and relax the hands down beautiful all right next exercise this is one of my favorites for my parkinson's friends let me get a drink of water real fast [Music] i like to call it the chinese hokey pokey that is not what dr lam calls it but that's okay he'll get there eventually all right so i'm turning sideways just to demonstrate so in this exercise i tap the heel out in front of me empty and then i tap my toe behind me again empty just empty heel and empty toe all right the leg that has the weight on it you keep a nice gentle bend in that knee don't lift and lock the knee out leave a bend in that knee as you're touching heel and toe make sure your back is staying nice and straight so i'm not leaning backwards and leaning forwards as i do this but i keep my back nice and straight okay from this perspective make sure that you're keeping space between your feet that when you touch the heel you're not bringing it in in front of the other foot and most importantly as you're stepping behind you again keep space between the feet a lot of people want to tuck that one foot behind the other foot and that puts you on a balance beam so you want to keep this nice spacing between your feet all right keep all the weight on one leg as we touch heel and toe one more thing yeah there's always one more thing right so for my parkinson's friends it's very important you have a tendency to just kind of slide the foot back and forth across the floor as you touch heel and toe would much rather see you pick that knee up touch the toe pick the knee up touch the heel so we learned to pick our knee up when we are moving our leg it gets us out of the shuffling walking gate where we're just kind of sliding the foot forward so instead we're picking the knee up as we are walking i'm exaggerating but you get the idea okay so there you have it 20 things to keep in mind simultaneously told you tai chi was mental exercise use your chair stay safe touching your toe behind you will definitely challenge your balance okay all right weight shifts right bending the right knee empty left heel hands behind us empty left toe hands in front of us picking that knee up as we transition empty heel pick the knee up as we transition empty toe one more time empty heel and empty toe and come back to center one other thing i should have mentioned that i'm giving a lot of information um if you're just starting out keep your heel in close don't try and extend it too far out and especially with the toe keep your toe in close don't try and extend it too far back okay all right other side weight shifts left empty right heel hands behind us empty right toe hands in front of us empty on the heel empty on the toe one more time lifting the knee empty heel and empty toe and back to center beautiful there you go all right those are the two hip exercises but they work really really well for balance okay so let's move along let's do heel kick all right now i want you to make sure you have your chair next to you this is this is a a big balance test for you okay we're gonna do four motions with the leg is the same thing we did from the chair the only difference is we're balancing all of our weight onto one leg easy peasy right so remember our principles of balance that the leg the weight is on the knee stays bent keep the body straight in this direction keep the back straight in this direction all right we're holding on to the chair but if you're able to punch out the opposite hand go ahead and do that okay excuse me now let's give it a try hands loosely clenched to the belt line weight shifts right pick up the left leg heel kick left punch out the right fist pick up the left leg and float the foot to the ground weight shifts left bend in the left knee pick up the right leg heel kick right punch out the left fist pick up the right leg float the foot to the ground weight shifts to the right pick up the left leg heel kick left punch out the right fist pick up the left leg float the foot to the ground use that chair weight shifts left bend in the left knee pick up the right leg heel kick right punch out left fist pick up the right leg and float the foot to the ground beautiful 100 more times weight shifts right pick up the left leg heel kick left punch out right pick up the left leg float the foot to the ground weight shifts left pick up the right leg heel kick right punch out left fist pick up the right leg and float the foot to the ground beautiful all right hey we've got enough time we're gonna finish out uh this hour with by doing the bow stance um love this exercise this is gets into the heart and soul of tai chi and it teaches us how to step out empty it teaches us to keep our weight back as we step out forward all right [Music] watch a lot of people walk and they step forward and put their weight on the foot so their weight is constantly forward on their foot tai chi teaches us a different way teaches us to keep our weight back as we step out empty forward and keep the weight back as we step out empty all right so two things to concentrate there's a lot going on in this exercise also uh more than that heel toe exercise but we're going to use a principle we just learned off of that heel too where you set your heel down empty is exactly the same spot you want to go now touch the heel down touch the foot down and then you can shift your weight forward but we're setting it down empty so there's no weight all the weight's on my back foot and i step out empty with the front foot the weight is still in the back then i shift my weight forward notice i'm keeping my upper body nice and straight as i do that okay so make sure your step forward is an empty step okay also from this perspective as you step out like we talked about earlier keeping space between the feet so as i move into the bow stance this feels really solid and really stable if i'm if my feet are in line with one another as i do the bow stance i'm really going to be fighting my balance all right so you keep that wide stance and that keeps you really solid okay all right so let's have some fun bow stance hands loosely clenched to the belt line weight shifts right step out empty left bow stance weight shifts left punch out right fist weight shifts back come back to center weight shifts left step out empty right bow stance weight shifts right punch out left fist weight shifts back come back to center weight shifts right step out empty left bow stance weight shifts left punch out the right fist upper body stays nice and straight we come back to center weight shifts left step out empty right bow stance weight shifts right punch out left fist weight shifts back and back to center one more time each side weight shifts right step out empty left bow stance weight shifts back back to center weight shifts left step out empty right and bow stance weight shifts back and back to center beautiful all right we're going to stop there for right now now we've got another hour of tai chi coming up all standing tai chi all right bottom line is if you know the warm-up exercises pretty well um you're ready for the next hour you're ready to take it up a notch all right so kick your feet up for 15 minutes come on back the warm-up exercises we do take up about the first 20 minutes to half an hour we do some qigong exercises we do do a little bit of the form so come on back okay let's do our cool down exercises lightly punch slap the legs we worked your legs pretty hard even from a chair uh work those legs next we're going to tighten up all the muscles in the body and relax tighten up the muscles and relax and one more time tighten up those muscles and relax finally gathering qi inhale and exhale inhale exhale and one more time inhale and exhale beautiful that'll do it for the first hour kick your feet up take a 15 minute break get a nice drink of water come on back 15 minutes we're gonna end this stream and then we start another stream 15 minutes later all right excellent work everybody we'll see you back soon i will either see you back next friday or 15 minutes from now you notice i talk with my hands all right good job everybody let me see [Music] all right we'll see in a few minutes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "lQwSkeO_2mA": "alright guys so today I want to go over shotgun shells and what the numbers mean now I have a couple different types of shotgun shells here I've got twelve gauges of four times we're not going to worry about the gauge of the shell between the 410 on the 12-gauge what we're going to look at is the shot size inside lots of times when people start shot using shotguns they don't understand it fully what these numbers mean so like this is a four shot a five shot six shot seven point five and nine you can get these all interchange you know you can get six shot and the four times size we have here you can get 7.5 in the 12-gauge I just couldn't get all twelve gauges in the store so we've got a little bit of mix of the size of the shell but the actual bb's inside are gonna be the same size of course you'll have more fill in the larger 12-gauge shells then you would in the smaller four times so what we're gonna go do up here is go ahead and open these all up you guys can see the size of the shot inside now I'm sure I'm gonna make a little bit of a mess but I'll just go ahead and vacuum when I'm done because I'm sure I'll drop some of these but we're gonna cut each one of these open so you guys can see the difference of the shot sizes and how big they are as the number gets smaller the bb's our pellets inside actually get larger so let's go ahead and start with the nine shot this is just a Remington 410 it's got nine shot inside so when you go ahead and cut into this one hopefully these aren't gonna be too hard for me to cut into okay they're not too bad pretty easy so we're gonna go down here now and empty these out and like I said I know I'm gonna make a little bit of a mess but that's alright I'm not gonna bother emptying them all out well empty more all right there's a lot more in here there you go that's nine shot and of course like I said if you got nine shot in a 12-gauge you have a lot more little pellets in there because you have a lot more space to fill in a 12-gauge so these are really tiny I'll zoom up on them here so you can see them they're very tiny and there's a whole bunch of them grab a couple and just hold them up in front of the camera here also a whole bunch of them little little tiny shots there these people use for bird shooting and such and they're going to give you a lot of spread but they're not going to be as effective for bigger game let's go to 7.5 shot these are very commonly used these are commonly used again for bird shooting the nines are often used for clay pigeon shooting and stuff like that and also shooting flying birds 7.5 is very common again for a shooting birds that are flying they can be used for clay pigeons but usually people go down to the 9 for that so this is 7.5 here I don't want to get it to cut open here and sip a little back alright so here's 7.5 and I'll try to zoom in here so you can see they are bigger let me grab a few of these 7.5 and here's the 7.5 so let me grab a couple nines hard to grab these you might not be able to tell which ones are which now they're kind of mixing in get them separate here if I can these two over here are 9 and these are 7.5 so you can see that 7.5 are bigger not a huge difference but there is definitely a difference now let's go to the number 6 and these are going to make a bigger mess cuz there's gonna be a lot more because these are bigger shelves well like I said we're just looking at the size of the shop side so this is a number 6 these are used often for birds also used a lot for rabbits and such rabbit hunting and such used for a small game a lot all right so these are number six shot and this has some padding in there as well like I said the 12-gauge gonna hold a little bit more so that's most of them out there there's one or two left so the white stuff in there is just filling to make sure it's fully a full shell so there's no air in it so here's the six shot and I'll compare that there to the seven shot so as you can see the six shot pretty good amount bigger than the 7.5 let's go ahead and keep moving down the line here we have five it's getting harder and harder to cut into some of these larger ones are harder alright so here's the five shot like cut it enough yet and these just look a different color because they are plated so now we have five shot and as you can see five shot is just ever so slightly bigger try to get a little side-by-side here here is the five shot versus the six shot and as you can see the five shot is ever so slightly larger now let's move down to the four shot this one's filled with little seeds it looks like interesting never seen that before so now again same thing is the last couple they're a little bit bigger now there are three shot two shot one shot and you know they just keep getting a little bit bigger then we can get into even larger here's double out buck and there's nine pellets in each one of these and double-aught buck it's gonna be a good amount bigger this is more for shooting larger game and obviously they have a named buck for shooting deer and into this one this one's gonna be filled with a lot of filling because there's just nine pellets in this one this one actually says on the box nine pellets I think I got them all so as we can see here now much much larger these are pretty darn big bee bees here and big leg pieces that's like shooting they're a little smaller than nine millimeter I believe they're like 0.33 of an inch or so something around there and they're really big now they didn't fill up the whole cartridge or they mostly did but they use this filling to fill up the rest of the cartridge usually you're gonna get between eight and ten pellets and the 12-gauge buck shots now we have this was double out buck now we have triple out buck and this one is a 410 this one has four triple out box in here so let's go ahead and open this one up again if you had triple a buck in a 12-gauge you would have more like between eight and ten pellets this one's gonna be hard to cut because I'm sure the pellets are taken up pretty much this whole space might dull my knife a little bit cutting these open all right I think I got it enough yep so this is triple out buck this is a home defense round before ten this will go in my handgun my revolver and this one just says for now like I said if you get 12-gauge you're gonna have more these are I believe point three sixth of an inch and it's kind of weird these two are kind of stuck together interesting there they broke apart they would have and these are hard to tell right here's the triple triple lot and the double lot you can tell the triple lot is larger so these four basically took up almost that whole shell length and this is basically like almost as big as nine millimeters so when you shoot one of these it's like shooting four nine-millimeter bullets all at once out of the little four ten if you had it in here you'd be shooting you know between eight and ten there's how many they would put in a 12-gauge now we have these PDX one home defense defenders they're called these go into things like the tourist judge or Smith & Wesson governor revolvers and this is a home defense round this actually has three defense pellets and also lots of little bb's 12 little bb's so these are three defense pellets are going to be about the same diameter as the triple a buck there but they're not going to be round so let me go ahead and see if we can get into here okay I think I got in and what we have here I can get these out well here's the one pallet let me just show this pellet first I got the second one out now here comes the third one after this third one falls out we'll see all these extra little bb's doesn't quite yeah let me see if I just cut it off all right so there's one more pellet right here get that out if we can all right so there's our three pellets and let me go ahead before I dump these bb's out and show these pellets are basically triple a buck it's just they're a different shape they're actually a little bit bigger and wider larger diameter however then they're not circular they're flat pallets so these will fire out of the gun first and behind it you got 12 bb's extra so in a home defense situation you can use something like triple a buck or you could use something like the PDX ones you're gonna get three big pallets followed by some extra bb's for you know some extra spread so you know you're gonna hit something basically now these little bb's it looks like they're probably about number two sides because number fours are good amounts smaller than they are so I'd say these these babies are pretty pretty big to begin with as well so these home defense rounds are pretty highly rated by the company and as well I've heard good reviews about them so these are great for home defense and as you can see here that's what comes out of them the last thing you got is slugs now I do have some slugs for four times and 12-gauge basically a slug is just one big hunk of metal so in here don't know if you can see this on camera you can kind of see the shade of it here this is gonna be alright guys so my camera battery died I had to charge it up a bit so we left off on the shelf I mean the 12 gauge slug here I'm gonna go ahead and try to into this right behind the slug I think I could see it here this one might have some backing to it this one might probably be the hardest one to get into alright it looks like I got into it and we got some padding let me see if I can push this out looks like I can alright so here is a 12 gauge slug and as you can see it's one big hunk of metal we'll compare it to the triple at buck here and as you can see there's just no comparison now with this you just get one shot so it's you know they use this for deer hunting and other things it's not really used too often for home defense because you do only have that one shot but then again if you're you know a good shot it is a pretty devastating round so basically I just wanted to go ahead and open these all up like I said the size of the cartridge here that we're showing doesn't really matter what I was trying to show is the size of the bb's inside and like I said earlier of course you're gonna have more fill in a 12-gauge shell than you would in the smaller shells 28 gauge 20 gauge 18 gauge so on though the more the smaller the shell gets the less fill it's gonna have as you can see over here there's obviously more filled in the number six than we have in the 7.5 because the number six has more space inside to contain more pellets or bb's in there so just want to go ahead and show that so you guys can see the difference I was kind of confused myself when I started shooting shotguns again and I just wanted to show you guys the difference so people head and buy shells you know what you're getting so

from pounds to kilograms we're also gonna talk about what to do if we need to convert pounds and ounces into kilograms so let's begin let's say we have 15 kilograms how can we convert this number into pounds now the conversion factor that you need is this one kilogram is equal to two point two zero five pounds so anytime you wish to go from kilograms to pounds all you need to do is multiply the number by two point two zero five now if you need to go from pounds to kilograms what you need to do is divide by two point two zero five for those of you who like to get the answer quickly now for those of you who want to show their work here's how you can do it so let's start with this example let's convert fifteen kilograms to pounds step one is to write down what you're given on a fraction step to write another fraction now using your conversion factor you need to decide what goes on the bottom and what goes on top notice that we have kilograms on the top part of the first fraction so we want to put that same unit on the bottom part of the second fraction so this part of the conversion factor we're going to write it on the bottom so that these units cancel the other part we're going to put it on top of the second fraction and so that's how we could show our work converted from kilograms to pounds so it's going to be 15 times two point two zero five and the answer is 33 point zero seventy-five pounds so that's how you can convert from kilograms to pounds now let's try another example go ahead and convert 24 kilograms into pounds feel free to pause the video if you wish to and try that example so let's start with what we're given 24 kilograms and then for the next fraction we're gonna use the same conversion factor so we're gonna put this part on the bottom one kilogram so that these units cancel and then two point two zero five pounds on top of the second fraction so it's 24 times two point two zero five and the answer is 52 point nine two pounds so that's it for the second example now let's work backwards let's convert pounds into kilograms so using the same conversion factor go ahead and try that so when you want to go from pounds to kilograms you need to divide by two point two zero five so we have 12 pounds let's put it over one and this time since we have the unit pounds on top of the first fraction on the bottom part of the second fraction we're going to put this portion of the conversion factor so we're gonna write two point two zero five pounds here and then on top we're going to put one kilogram so the unit pounds cancel and because this number is on the bottom that tells us that we need to divide 12 by the number so 12 divided by two point two zero five gives us the answer looking for which is 5.44 two kilograms now let's try another example let's convert 19 pounds to kilograms go ahead and try that so following the same procedure we're gonna multiply 19 pounds by one kilogram divided by two point two zero five pounds so 19 divided by two point two zero five is equal to eight point six one seven kilograms so now you know how to convert from pounds to kilograms and from kilograms to pounds now here's the question for you let's say if we have 15 pounds and eight ounces how can we convert this to kilograms what do you think we need to do here now keep in mind that one kilogram is 2.2 zero five pounds in addition to that you need to know that our one pound is equal to 16 ounces so there's two conversion factors that you need so using those two conversion factors how can we convert 15 pounds and eight ounces into kilograms so go ahead and pause the video and think about it try to find a way to get the answer well the first thing we want to do is you want to convert ounces to pounds so let's do that a simple way to convert from ounces to pounds is 2/16 but let's set it up first so because we have the unit ounces on the top we're gonna put it on the bottom so we're gonna write this part on the bottom the other part we're gonna put it on top so the unit ounces cancel and it's going to be 8 divided by 16 which is 1/2 or 0.5 so 8 ounces is 0.5 pounds so 15 pounds and 8 ounces is going to be 15 point 5 pounds you just gotta take this number and add it to this one so what we're really doing is converting 15 point 5 pounds into kilograms now this is something we could do so let's go ahead and finish the problem so we're going to use this conversion factor now so 1 kilogram is equal to 2 point 2 0 5 pounds so the unit pounds will cancel and the math is going to be 15 point 5 divided by 2 point 2 0 5 and that gives us an answer of 7 point 0 to 9 kilograms so that's how you can convert from pounds and ounces into kilograms now let's try another example for the sake of practice go ahead and convert 14 pounds and 12 ounces into kilograms go ahead and try that based on a last example so let's start with 12 ounces let's convert that into pounds so keep in mind there are 16 ounces in a single pound so we need to divide 12 by 16 and this is gonna give us point seven five pounds next we need to combine these two numbers so we have a total of fourteen point seven five pounds so now let's take that number and let's convert it to kilograms so we know that one kilogram is equal to two point two zero five pounds so we could cross out the unit pounds and get our answer so it's gonna be fourteen point seven five divided by two point two zero five and so the answer is six point six eight nine kilograms and that's basically it for that example so now you know how to convert from pounds to kilograms kilograms to pounds and pounds and ounces into kilograms so that's it for this video that's all I got if you liked it don't forget to subscribe and thanks again for watching", "_DpUP5wk_6Q": "I'm going to be fishing with the world's smallest ChatterBait slacking out put a win there's a bass literally it just jumped out of the water just leave that [Music] so I can swim out of the grass and get that look hell that fish and held that bait you think you've won of it do you think he'd wanted that bait what's going on ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of be fishing and my name is Brett if you are new to the channel go ahead hit the red subscribe button down below because I'm kind of good one for you today I'm going to be fishing with the world's smallest ChatterBait that's right the micro ChatterBait Visine man now this thing is an eighth of an ounce I mean we are talking tiny I'm probably gonna have to bring my spinning set up for this one which I hate doing I really like using my bait casters but the things got a little bitty tiny blade I've got this one in white I've also got one in like a chartreuse white these things work really good for trout they work really good for bass and I'm gonna be fishing it in a pond or right down the road from my house it's one of my like a new favorite ponds mainly because it's like a minute away like it's just right down the road it doesn't get any better than that it's got a lot of grass line the water is a little clearer which I don't like fishing a ChatterBait in ultra clear water I've probably got three foot visibility in that probably a little too much but we're gonna see if we can't make it work the fish love hanging out in the grass line so I'm gonna buzz this up the grass line a very similar to the way you would fish like I love sufficient a spinner bait off a grass line to the chatter bait works in a lot of places that a spinner bait works in it for the same reasons it's got the blade it makes noise it has a lot of water movement but it's like a swim jig and a spinner bait mixed together that's what makes it so deadly we're gonna go fish with this thing you guys are excited as I am go ahead smash the like button and yeah let's get down to the water let's go do the dang thing let's go fun fact I've gotten to that camera the battery was actually not really charged in it and I use an external battery which you can see the cable go into it and the external battery is sitting on my workbench at the house so that's not gonna work and I would rather keep my chest going see how we're just gonna have to bear bear with me but you guys know the deal what we're doing we're gonna be fishing yep that cameras just died we're gonna be fishing with the micro ChatterBait I've got two different color options like I said I've got that white and silver which is this guy right here and I've got him rigged up on a medium ride this is like my crank bait setup I'm hoping I can maybe get a little bit of whipping action on the end of that rod since that rod is a little bit lighter maybe I can fish with it on a bait caster if not I've also got the white and chartreuse micro ChatterBait and I've got it rigged up on my ferry one which is a light action rod really shouldn't matter too much because it's so small and we're gonna give these guys a trailer and the trailer I'm going with don't mind the packaging because I love a lot of these together we've got some little paddle tails some white and silver paddle tails I believe that's going to work on both I've also got like a little green and I've got a black and gray or black and silver so I believe that's going to work pretty well either one of those options they are a little long not a terrible terrible thing but I've also brought my little creek fishing creak fishing tackle box which I carry with me obviously while I'm on the creek and we've got these guys this little three tail curly grub and I think that'll work on there as well and for this purpose just so I can say that I've showed y'all we are gonna use a paddle tail used to give Chris grief for this if you're gonna put this on a paddle to like put a paddle tail on a ChatterBait Chris used to do this now he did it on accident but he was actually correct and doing it put the swim bait a little paddle tail on there upside down the reason this is when that goes popping through the water there's more of a backbone on the back of the swim bait and it'll actually not dip down as far so when you fish them like this notice how much that tail hangs down as opposed to this when you're fishing it through the water this is going to look more natural and it won't be hanging down so low while you're fishing on this chatter because again the chatter but it's going to be doing this a lot it's gonna be just pop pop pop pop pop pop pop it looks more natural when it's upside down again you're not losing or gaining any action special action because the blade is gonna be what's moving the most water so don't worry about that too much but it will look more natural you flip your boot tail upside down on a ChatterBait you know chatter baits one of my favorite ways to fish I have not done it a lot this year because I kind of figured it out last year a ChatterBait should not be a bait that you sit there and just do this you just retreat them that's really not the most effective way you'll get bit but it's not the most effective way to fish a ChatterBait you want to bury it up so if I cast out here I'm gonna sit there anymore I'm gonna let it go and we'll pause we'll Rev it and we'll go back to a normal speed I'm gonna pop it a couple times just give it give it a little something so those fish can react to it you just don't want to be going straight retrieve oh I think we just had one bite at it it was off of a twitch so that tells me something right there yep got one on him got him there you go folks a little bitty bass riding along that grass line just as I was saying on that white micro ChatterBait I think it's gonna be the way to do it I did that on a pause I pause just for a second and he picked it up I really didn't even know he had it cuz he was swimming toward me so setting the hook was kind of a lazy little thing so I got me the bottom a litte bit there you go a little bitty basses on the old world's tiniest ChatterBait alright with the water being the clarity it is I don't see I don't see me needing to use that chartreuse ChatterBait and honestly I'm not really a huge fan of chartreuse chatter baits anyway I think white gets it done almost any water color anyway the only chatter baits you're ever gonna see me throw usually they're gonna be white like some kind of brown pumpkin bluegill color and black and blue and that is literally it I think that's all the chatter baits you need you don't need to get hung up in too much of a color thing maybe in the spring you can throw like a black and red one or a black and brown like a crawfish type color but don't get too hung up on all the colors on these chatter baits [Music] forgot him got him got him another one oh he ain't golf that one in Gulf that ChatterBait I mean absolutely inhaled it sorry I know every time I bend over like y'all can't see you normally I would use that camera but Dumbo here left the old battery pack at the house there's an there's another one another little bass on the micro shatter rate and you let me tell you something that really stinks when you go through all the trouble of rigging up the GoPro and the front of your kayak and you forget the battery and slacking it hey not some slack in it oh my gosh they are hungry for this thing look at this look at this look how this fish can held this bait look tell that fish and held that bait you think he's wanted it did you think he wanted that bait my lord buddy were you hungry how about that folks he freaking inhaled that ChatterBait micro chatter bait is putting in some work you got a pond and you've got fish that you want to catch that are about this size micro ChatterBait my friends micro ChatterBait little buddy putting in some work I love it another little tip is if you have a fish hit it like that they engulf it and they hit in a run like that one hit and ran toward me like you could just tell he hit it on the fly and was trying to get away most likely what that means is that there are other fish the exact same area and they're competing for that food so I would not be shocked because you know we got bit over here just a second ago like right before him I got bit and the fish hit it as soon as it hit the water so I'm gonna cast back in that exact same area and I would suspect there are a couple more fish hanging out there and they're all competing for food and that's why you got that hit-and-run what I say what I say there's another fish there there's another fish there they're all competing for food and looked at this look at this he ate it the exact same way just inhaled inhaled it and a little bit of winter there's a bass literally it just jumped out of the water just see that there was a bass that just jumped out of the water landed on that foam piece and then bounced back in that was crazy no thing about this videos I'm talking to a lot like I am giving you a lot of instructions today I don't know what's gotten into me normally I just try to be entertaining that here today I'm teaching I guess cuz chatter baits like my bait I love chatter based on I know a lot about it I know a lot about it I know a fair amount about it I'm no expert by no means but my name is Britt I'm the last name ain't height I'll tell you that I saw him swim out of the grass and get that that was so cool that was so freakin cool that guy literally swam out of the grass where I could see him at the boat and pluck that off that is so cool so awesome fish number five I think he's one of the bigger ones today I mean he's not a giant by any means but I'll give him close to a pound for sure he's just super thick back they're starting to they're starting to build themselves back up after the spawn man what that was fine that was that was awesome right there at the boat hi buddy all right ladies and gentlemen I'm back I just put the kayak up and I still have the little micro ChatterBait and I'm gonna give this one away I haven't not opened this one yet I use the two out of my creek fishing setup so I'm gonna give this one away all you got to do is leave a comment below on what you thought of it where you would use this bait as well as hit the like button and hit the subscribe button if you haven't already joined the BFF the B fishing family and will continue to make content like this the world's tiniest chatter bait is what we were using today I really hope you guys enjoyed it as you can see the clouds not looking too good so it was a good call that we left the water when we did but that's gonna do it for this one again like button comment on what you would do with it and subscribe button and I'm gonna give that one away in the next video so you need to hit the ding dong notification next to the subscribe button because that's how I'm gonna notify you you need to watch the next video that comes out in the next video that comes out I'll have it in the description of

you have been asking me to please convert the measurement that i use for my cakes into either grams or cups before I continue let me point down that it is my preference to use the US cup method of measurement instead of the imperial i've compiled this charge which is a two page file and you can print it by going to the link below in the information section of this video all the main ingredients used in making a cake have been converted from one measurement to another I hope that you find this chart useful and please don't forget to share it with someone else please check all my other videos

typically you will buy a pound of butter a pound of butter equals four sticks so one two three four now when you're measuring butter what you will need is a knife and either a custard cup or plate to put your butter on first of all butter is dummy proof right on the label it will tell you how to measure its marked with tablespoons and this one butter is actually marked with teaspoons first of all a rule of thumb to remember is that one stick of butter equals 1/2 the cup also a half a cup equals eight tablespoons and it will tell you right on the label so let's measure our butter so our recipe calls for a half a cup what are we going to do well that one's easy because we know one stick of butter equals a half a cup roll up we're done now let's say we need 1 cup of butter that's easy as well because we know 1/2 a cup and a half a cup equals a hold so this is one cup of butter now let's get tricky let's say we need a quarter of a cup of butter again let's look at our stick of butter and we know and it says right here four tablespoons equals a quarter of a cup so that's half of a half so we're going to take our knife and we're going to count four tablespoons one two three four and I'm just going to cut right through and there's my quarter of a cup or four tablespoons of butter that was easy now let's measure 3/4 cup so I need 3/4 so we know 1/2 a cup you have one 2/4 and here is my third quarter so this is 3/4 cup of butter so one and a half sticks great now let's talk about measuring 1/3 cup so how do we measure 1/3 cup again this is dummy proof we can take a peak here at our stick of butter and it says Oh 5 and 1/3 tablespoons equals 1/3 cup so I'm going to take my stick of butter and I'm going to count 1 2 3 4 5 and 1/3 again I'm just going to take my knife and my stick of butter and that will give me 1/3 cup so that's very easy now let's say I just need two tablespoons of butter so I'm going to take my stick of butter and I'm just going to count one two and then I would just cut it the same way okay so it's very easy now in class we buy our butter in bulk so we usually will cut our butter into a half a cup stick and then you will have to figure out what it is that you will need but we have these handy dandy sheets where it says cut your own butter so it's the same label again if you can read it it will tell you how to measure the quarter of a cup the half a cup and the 1/3 cup but again it's key to remember one stick of butter equals a half a cup and a half a cup contains eight tablespoons so if you can remember those you're pretty good to go and you probably won't need to really refer to this that much again this is a how-to video how to measure butter", "yL7CkC2Sq5Q": "hi guys do a slime today slime slime slime tubes made in America one is a self-sealing tube it's all three packaged into this exact it's just a standard bicycle tube and there's very there's many different not many I think there's about four or five different sizes this is a 27-inch here's a 27-inch type tire okay this is a 27-inch is what this works it's worked for twenty seven by one and an eight by one and a quarter and by one and three-eighths and it's a swine self-sealing two instructions it shows how it works everything else it's a bicycle tube guys's what it is with this slime dope stuff in there that helps prevent for a 27-inch you can install this baby and it works pretty well come on over here let me show you our prop here we've got a clear tubing with four ounces of slime you can add it yourself if you wanted to indeed and the 8 ounce dispenser fact it's kind of a pain but it still works it might be a little less money but it's it works 4 ounces per wheel and you put it right on there you're getting inside the tube again in this line too and you if you look carefully you can see the liquid tire line are forming on the outside and it works this stuff really really works you can see little book in there and then it kind of smooches down on the side come on back we got the back of this filled up with that swine okay and again in your walk riding down the road this line comes along and does it stink I lost my pushpin so I'm going to use a staple today alright staple we're gonna put it right here in the middle boom right there there she is it reading it give a little spin go find it and sega does what empty bottle okay slime - if that slime tube is what we're doing you now boom find it there she is you watch it you could see the little slime green green not so close there you go green and green it's sealed the stuff comes up done sealed I get a flat climb to 27 inch never fear fight man for you is here", "3VyLqjku1vQ": "howdy guys and gals. I'm Kyle Broderick.\nwelcome to the social regressive. today we're out here at a field and we are\ngoing to be testing the brand new Falcon s8i the s8i has been around for a\nlittle while but I call this one brand new because they put a new reticle in it\nthis is an illuminated kind of version of their b20 reticle I think they're\ncalling this to b22 I so what this thing does is it has milliradian holds\nyou know up-down left-right and then it includes in the center a great big red\njust an MOA dot and a diamond sort of shape so this is set up not only for\nworking at very close range but at longer range as well and that is going\nto pair really well with the whole setup of the scope overall you've probably\nseen this kind of thing a lot the this scope that has basically no objective\nlens at the other end you see these things in three gun which is I think\nkind of where these were spawned it's the first time I ever saw them and you\nsee people putting these on their ARs so that they can you know kind of have a\nflexible shooting platform but I think in a lot of cases the this type of scope\nhas kind of gone wrong a lot of these have reticles that I have not found\ninteresting at all they just don't seem to really be set up for the sort of work\nthat these were actually designed to do which is being able to engage a target\nthat's really really close up like you know basically within touching distance\nall the way out to some of the longer stuff and this is this one is just\nspecial it's a 1-8X so you get lots of flexibility in the zoom that's a\nmassive zoom ratio so this one especially should be set up very well\nfor kind of short medium out to longer range targets to test this today we're\ngonna be shooting 75 grain Hornady boat tail hollow points in my hand load i\ntook the the can off the end just because it's going to make things much\neasier to hold this thing is gonna be kind of barrel heavy as it is has a\nlittle bit of a thicker h-bar barrel on the end here so yeah we're just shooting\n223 and if you'll see over my shoulder here I have some targets out at various\nranges the first one is going to be 25 yards\nthen we have 50 yards the one way out in the shade in tactical cardboard Brown\nthat one is at 250 yards and then way way way back there if you look past that\nthat little crosshair target down on the ground you're going to see a white steel\nsilhouette target so what we're going to do is we're gonna have a point system\nwe're gonna kind of time this and I'm gonna be shooting with my father-in-law\nwe're gonna kind of compete at this so we're gonna get two shots at each target\nif we take the shot while standing that's worth five points if we take this\nshot while sitting or kneeling that's worth four points and then three points\nfor a prone shot I don't know how all this is going to add up I just kind of\ncame up with that this morning so I'll have to come back and actually tell you\nwhat the scores would be or if the scores even matter the real point though\nis to test this thing out and see how it works when we're kind of shuffling\naround between 1x at these close targets all the way up to eight and then\nafterward we'll kind of do a post-mortem and we'll talk about what it was like to\nshoot the scope and some of the features on here some of them are not quite\nevident just by looking at it but this has some really neat tricks are you seeing her right-to-left wind was that second one he hit - I didn't\nhear it okay clear just over the left shoulder there you go\nnice head okay all right here we go they're switching back and forth all\nright here we go left or right okay I've learned a couple\nthings so I'm gonna try changing things up just a little bit all right all right\nhere we go unsafe all right Center your wind oh no way\nit's lifts right now aim left edge the challenge is over yeah I think I need to\nleave that in the shooting challenge is over and it did take me a little while\nto kind of get used to things and get moving a little bit quicker that's\nusually my problem I'm really kind of slow with everything that I do which is\nprobably why I shoot pro in a lot but it was still a whole lot of fun let me talk\na little bit about the setup on the rifle as we shot it today this is a Rock\nRiver Arms lar-15 car a4 and 223 has a 223 wilde chamber in there and this is\npretty much what came from the factory just a couple little changes it started\nout a very accurate rifle it still continues to be as long as I hand load\ncorrectly but yeah back here we just have the typical a4 stock or whatever up\nhere this is just a quad rail I'd like to swap this out sometime I could really\ntell doing some of the shorter range shooting that this would have benefited\nfrom one of those really long skinny rails you can hold on to way out there I\nknow they can get kind of tired holding a rail really far out but if you have to\nshoot really quickly and steadily I found that it really does work so I\nmight be doing a mod on that a little bit in the future magpul afg and just a\nlittle utg bipod up front here we have a yhm muzzle break it's also the\nattachment for the suppressor if I want to put that on there and this thing has\nturned out to be really effective I've been just shocked by this thing I'm used\nto shooting with the suppressor on or you know just with a birdcage\nyeah this is the first time that I've shot with just the muzzle brake attached\nand I am loving it this new model the the old one had it was pretty\nineffective it had these little holes drilled through it and just didn't\nreally have that kind of chamber area to you know to kind of pick up a lot of\ngasses and kind of move the rifle forward this one works just great you\ncan see that it has a whole lot of real estate in there a whole lot of volume so\nthis thing was very functional and standing off to the side when my\nfather-in-law was shooting it was I got this huge wave of air coming in so it\nmust be doing a good job let's see the scope itself we were both really\nimpressed with how it performed today and it really does that job that I was\ntalking about where you want to be able to like in this case you know kind of\ndefend a homestead against everything from you know a creature or you know\nsome baddie or whatever that's close up to your house all the way out to the\nedge of your property this actually will do the trick we found that out this was\nperfectly up to the task of hitting the this 425 yard target as well as that\nthat the 25 and the 50 rolled back on 1x now this is one of the funky things\nabout this style of optic when you're going when you're taking a magnified\noptic and you're rolling it back to 1x especially when you have a fixed\nparallax like this does this is fixed at a hundred yards everything closer than a\nhundred yards is going to get this crazy curvature to it it's going to get this\nmassive barrel distortion and this does have that but it's only if you're really\nthinking about it in terms of actual shooting it just didn't even pop into my\nhead at all I didn't even notice I was just getting on target and shooting and\nthat's something that's going to affect I think every scope of the type you're\ngonna get that barrel distortion if you're closer than it's fixed parallax\nand really I was expecting to maybe be missing that parallax adjustment since\nthis is kind of a higher magnification one all the way up to eight but you know\nreally I don't miss it I think that it worked just fine and in general you've\nprobably heard that anything up to 9 X maybe 10 x you don't need parallax\nadjust so yeah not really necessary the amount that I have it in today this is a\nWii ever this is their SPR mountain if I\nremember correctly this has some nice thumb nuts here on the other side and so\nit's you know kind of a quick-detach rig works really well and it only took me\nfour shots I think to get this thing zeroed so again this is everything that\nI've come to expect from Falcon they make really nice optics everything\nalways tracks really well in my Falcons on the other turrets or in the reticle\nitself today was no exception this really is every bit as good a scope as\nthe m14, M18, M18 plus that I've reviewed in the past this is every bit\nas good all it does has just come up with a new form factor and yeah it\nreally works let's talk about features and form factor on this this is a 1-8X24 millimeter scope and with such a small objective you probably assume that\nit's not going to collect all that much light and you'll be right compared to\nthe M18 Plus which does a phenomenal job at dusk and down into night I\ncompared the two side-by-side and yes this one could not collect as much light\nif you want to be able to pick up more details if it is starting to get a bit\ndark on you roll it back to 1x and then you're gonna be able to take as much\nlight as this thing will you know be able to suck through that objective lens\nthe weight on this is quite nice and that's one of the reasons why we did\nsome off hand shooting today normally I do prone stuff normally my rifles are\nheavy normally the scopes are heavy but at 17 ounces this is quite doable on an\noff hand rifle this felt very comfortable to shoot today the turrets\nand reticle are both mrad based so they're going to work in concert really\nwell together it is second focal plane so it's going to put the reticle back\nhere and it's going to measure true at that full 8x as you're dialed back to\none and this is one of the things that I'm going to talk about when I do a full\nseries where I'm talking about what I think about optics I think that second\nfocal plane is perfect because at 1x I'm not thinking about various drop\nvalues I'm close enough that it doesn't really matter and if I'm at you know\nshooting at something that's further off I'm not gonna be dialed at 1x I'm gonna\nbe all the way up on 8 that's when it's going to measure true and that's when it\nreally matters so I think this is just a brilliant design the turrets each\nmeasure 30 milliradians and you direct that's up-down left-right and in today's\nshooting we did use both the turrets and we used the reticle all by itself so I\ndid a couple of strings where I was just shooting using only the reticle not\ntouching any of the dials and then I did some where I was using the dials for the\nfurther shots and in both cases there doesn't seem to be any issue both

sixteen for three dollars and 79 cents recall a few wills that define the unit price we're looking at the price per unit so here's our first situation and here's our second situation so I'm just going to get my calculator and divide $6.99 by 40 and I get roughly so that's about 17 cents per cup there and then the dream three dollars and seventy nine cents divided by sixteen cups that gives us about twenty four cents per cup so clearly this is our cheaper this one has a cheaper unit price number two ask a very similar problem why don't you pause the video and see how you do okay first of all let's make sure sorry let's make sure that we are comparing the same units notice on the first one they talked about four pounds and the second one they talked about 24 ounces so that's why if you'll notice here that I change my four pounds to 64 ounces or 16 ounces in a pound okay so then eight dollars and 19 cents divided by 64 ounces gave me about 13 cents that ounce and then over here three dollars and 49 cents divided by 24 ounces gave me about 15 cents per out ounce so clearly this one is the cheapest situation alright so the next one they're asking us to substitute 18 plus 3 y for X into the expression 15 minus X so 15 minus and they told me to substitute in the expression 18 plus 3y so that means I'm going to need to distribute that minus sign and I have 15 minus 18 minus 3y so that gives me a negative 3 minus 3y number for substitute 3x minus 1 for Y and the expression 2y minus 25 so we have 2 times something we're going to substitute something in for Y minus 25 so we're going to substitute 3x minus 1 and for y let's distribute our two so it gives me 6x minus 2 minus 25 and that simplifies to 2x minus 27 all right number five if y equals 14 minus X rewrite the equation 5x minus 10y equals 85 with X as its only variable well the only way that we'll be able to do that is everywhere there's a Y put that 14 minus X so let's do that right now all right and so that becomes 5x minus 140 negative 10 times negative x is plus 10x equals 85 let's simplify the left side I have 5x plus 10x gives me 15 X minus 140 equals 85 and I think that's really all they wanted for us to do right now let me pause and make sure that is a case yep that's it all right number six for the unit price of Reese's Cups in the bag of forty write an equation that describes how many of those Reese's Cups you could buy for twenty-five dollars so remember we said that they were about seventeen cents a cup oops forgot my one there so seventeen cents times let's let C be cups equals 25 that's a good equation for that seven a semi-private golf course has an initiation fee of $800 whoa which allows players to play golf as much as they like but they have to pay a twelve dollar cart fee each time they want to play so it looks like 800 that's your base fee but if you're going to ride in a cart it's $12 every time you rip that cart and so it says write an equation that describes how many times a member could play for $1100 okay that looks like that would work players can choose to walk the course in which case they only have to pay a $2.00 fee that goes towards course maintenance each time that they play write a new equation describing the number of times a player could play in a riding cart or walking for $1,100 okay that's let's get our cart situation okay and if they walked that'll be 2 times W let's let W stand for walking equals 1,100", "9UVgO8zS474": "So right here we've listed two\nquantities or two fluid volumes right over here in terms\nof gallons, 1 gallon and 2 gallons. And what I want to\ndo in this video is try to convert this quantity\nof fluid, this volume of fluid, I want to convert it into\nthese other units within the US customary system. So I encourage you\nto pause the video and first try to\ndo the 1 gallon. Try to convert it into quarts,\npints, cups, and fluid ounces. Well, 1 gallon is\nequal to 4 quarts. So we can just multiply by 4. 1 quart is equal to 2 pints,\nso we can multiply this by 2. So 4 quarts, each\nof them are 2 pints. 4 times 2 gets us to 8 pints. Each pint is equal to 2\ncups, so we have 8 pints. Each of them are\nequal to 2 cups. We're going to have 16 cups. And then finally, if we're\nconverting from a cup to a fluid ounce, each\ncup is 8 fluid ounces. So if we have 16 cups, it's\ngoing to be 16 times 8. 8 times 8 is 64, and it's\ngoing to be twice that. That's going to be\n128 fluid ounces. Now, let's do the same\nthing with 2 gallons. Try to convert that into quarts,\npints, cups, and fluid ounces. And I encourage you\nto pause the video and try it on your own first. Well, same idea. 1 gallon is equivalent\nto 4 quarts. So 2 gallons are going to be\n2 times 4 quarts, or 8 quarts. quart is 2 pints. So if we want to go\nfrom quarts to pints, we'd want to multiply by 2. So this is going to be 16 pints. And then each pint is 2 cups. So multiplying 16 of them, then\nthat's going to be 32 cups. And then finally,\neach cup is 8 ounces. 32 times 8 is going to be? Let's see, it's going to be 256. And notice something here. When we went from 1\ngallon to 2 gallons, we essentially increased the\nquantity of gallons by 2, or we multiplied by 2. And you see that\nacross the board here as it's going from\n4 quarts to 8 quarts. This is going from\n8 pints to 16 pints. This is going from\n16 cups to 32 cups, going from 128\nfluid ounces to 256. When you increase the volume\nin gallons by a factor of 2, you're, of course, going\nto increase the volume in any unit you measure\nit in by a factor of 2.", "MfOeyJdVGIg": "hey guys this is Jean Janssen and in this video I want to talk about what lures match up to my favorite rod all right now before we get started I want to talk about something real quick there are several so many bang rod companies out here out there and a lot of them talk about their power and action of rods different than others so you kind of want to go through a few of the things you might see as you're shopping for a rod to start off with like Dobyns rods and and maybe G Loomis and a bunch of other other rod companies um they tend to to label their their powers and actions as as numbers on the rod so you'll see a rod it's like 7:30 for our 625 well the first two numbers are the length like seven thirty four seven foot three and then the four is the is the power of the rod starts off with like a six as like an extra fast or extra heavy five is a heavy four is a medium heavy three is a medium and two is a medium light or a light action I'm not exactly sure about that one but anyway so just to understand that third number in those three numbers is the the power of the rod now with a lot of other companies you just see medium you don't see medium fast medium extra fast medium moderate well just assume that the the one it just says medium or just says medium heavy um just assume that it's a fast action rod because every company that I've ever that I've seen up into this point that just says medium or medium heavy it's either a faster and extra fast action rod and extra fast is there's not much difference between a fast and extra fast you know just a little bit more flexing one than the other doesn't really make much difference least to me um and then you might see a rod company like Duquette does this where you see like a medium cranking or a medium heavy cranking well you can assume that that cranking means that it's a moderate action rod it's going to have a lot of flex in the blank it's going to you know Bend all the way through the length of the rod so just assume that anything that says cranking is going to be your crank bait rod and then Dobbins also says casting and so all there stink rods are fast-action rods so I hope that kind of helps its kind of confusing I know I hope I explained it well enough for you to understand that every rod is different the bad thing about rod manufacturers is there is no industry standard in action and power so it just it's just tough so anyway the reason I call this my favorite rod it's because it's the first rod I always buy out of a lineup of rods if I want to figure out whether they make decent rods or not it's the first rod I pick up in the morning because it's going to be the one I throw all my moving baits on I throw more baits more different types of baits on a medium action rod than I do anything else and so this is basically my what I call my go-to rod a seven foot or six foot ten to seven foot maybe a seven foot three medium action rod I this one right here I have it paired with an 8 1 to 1 gear ratio inception 30 pound braid and a 15 pound of four-carbon leader this changes depending on what I am fishing and we're going to try to go through that with each individual big but um it doesn't change much how you either have a seven three two one or seven one two one eight one two one or maybe a six three two one on this on this rod alright so the baits that I will throw on this or that I will use on this rod are um usually the thicker open hook bait spinner baits buzzbaits this is a double bladed paddle tail swim baits chatter baits and but this is a half ounce chatter mate I tied it on here for effect I don't like to throw a half ounce chatter bait on this run I like to bump it up to medium heavy but a chatter bait um a quarter ounce or 3/8 ounce will do just fine on this setup um and you know mainly it's it's for being able to I like an eight one two one because it I can slow it down a whole lot easier than I can speed it up I'm using something like a six three two one and I tend to one you know and I find out the fish wanted fish fast which a lot of times they do I've got a crank hard with that six three one two to get the speed that I want but with a seven three seven 101 or an eight one two one um I just you know I don't have to work as hard is the biggest thing and these baits really don't have a whole lot of um whole lot of water resistance and so it won't be that difficult okay so that's what I do when I have that thirty pound braid with a fluorocarbon leader I will change the leader out to a monofilament leader if and when I'm fishing top water this is my top water one I use it from my walking baits I use it from my small whopper poppers I use it for like I said buzzbaits it is what I like to use the most for me I can load up a locking bait like this one right here I think this is a strike King whatever sexy dog I think they call it but it loads up well on the back cast I can chunk it a mile and if I have a monofilament leader on that braided line I have floating line to keep it up and I just can mean it's just perfect and if I have to make a really long kaskus with this bait I'm usually chasing schooling fish and making very very long casts and basically what I have to do is I have to have enough backbone in that rod to be able to set the hook on a very long cast the braided line helps a lot with that because it doesn't have a whole lot of stretch but I still want enough backbone in that rod and be able to set the hook at long distances and be able to fight the fish and have enough flex to be able to fight the fish alright so and with the whopper popper the same thing I've got enough flex I've got enough to be able to set the hook big fish hit this sucker and I got enough backbone in the rod to be able to to set the hook now when I'm fishing things like square bill crank baits this is a a 2.0 this is a 1.5 KVD um now square bills you know I've I've made videos about crane baits and things like that and I always talk about the five three to one gear ratios and the six six six to one gear ratios to fish crane baits the square bill is the exception square bills are shallow one running crank baits I'll even you know well let's talk about second but they are shallow and running crankbaits and I am beating them and banging them off of stuff and I am ripping on the through grass and I'm doing a lot of very aggressive fishing with them and a flimsy rod like a moderate action rod and um and a slow reel or is not what I want I want to be able to pick up the line quick I want to be able to be aggressive with it and have full control over it so a medium action rod with a medium fast action rod with a with a high speed reel is almost a must I typically go with a 7 a 7 1 to 1 gear ratio went on fishing square bills and things like that I just don't one-to-one um I just feel like it's too fast because a lot of times I really want to slow down when I'm working it through timber and things like that but it really doesn't matter to me I'll fish it on 8 1 to 1 if that's what I have on the rod but I prefer 7 1 to 1 all right so the last of the moving baits is I like to fish on a meeting national rod is the lipless crankbait I love this bait in the spring in the fall I can't I'm so glad that our temperatures this is actually the second day of below 90 temperatures that we've had and I'm just waiting for that water temperature to begin to drop because I'm so glad that fall is finally here and I'm able to throw a lipless crankbait all right so the reason I like to fish a lipless crankbait on an 8 1 to 1 7 1 1 gear ratio with a medium action rod is once again I am fishing it very aggressively if you go back and watch my how to fish a square bill crank or a lipless crankbait video I'm literally I mean ripping it popping it reeling it and stopping it reeling to stop it reel stop ripping it through grass I'm beating off of stuff I beat the snot out of the lipless out of the lipless crankbait and and I need a rod that has some backbone and I need a rod that has some flex to be able to absorb the shock of a bite and be able to get those treble hooks in there so I love a medium action you can get a lipless crankbait you and a half ounce whip back really good you can make good long casts cover a lot of water um I can't not wait until the little spike it's on because I'll be fishing it from now through them through the winter on Guntersville and Chickamauga and all the the lakes of the fish around here alright alright so I'm gonna get into the bottom baits that I actually fished with this it's not just a moving bait rod and it's not just a moving bait reel I fish larger shaky heads like this quarter ounce shaky head I've been fishing quarter round shaky heads longer than I've been fishing any other weight and I always like to throw them on a medium action rod a this always felt better you know feels better for me I have more control over the cast I have I'm able to get longer cast and I have a better hook set because I have a lot of power behind that rod to penetrate those larger hooks that you find on those larger larger shaky heads and those larger jig heads small little finesse jigs those quarter ounce finished jigs this is an excellent rod for finesse jig small little trailer dragging on the bottom just remember with any of these baits I found out that it's better to set the hook over the head and off to the side or down to the sweep I don't know why I just hook up more fish that way when I've said it with my shoulder over my head and last but not least little Texas rigs like small uh you know lizards and things like that in the spring anything 3/8 ounce or smaller of a sinker that you put on there Texas rigs um gosh anything anything that's 3/8 ounce are smaller is what I would throw I throw it on a medium action rod fluorocarbon leader braided line all braided line all fluorocarbon it doesn't matter just depends on the water clarity and stuff like that for me but anyway um that's really all I can think of that I throw on a medium action rod just to understand that it is a it's not stiff enough for a big heavy jig it's not stiff enough for um oh heck a lot of the heavier things the big swim baits the big crank baits and things like that it's just uh it's just not quite what you need for that so stick with those those moving baits and those smaller bottom baits and you should be okay shouldn't have a problem with it it covers a lot of stuff and it's one of the rods I always recommend in a basic raw Arsenal so like I always say be sure to introduce somebody to fishing introduce them to my channel let me help you teach them how to fish more important to get out in the water go and get some fish and have a great day", "wAQXoxiiQZE": "[Music] simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title this is some papa herbs this is some weed for some people with daddy issues I'm just kidding but I mean Papa herbs there's 14 dollars and it's 916 percent THC I mean I just had to pick this up first of all because it was $14 an eighth and I didn't really want to spend so much on weed where it would be gone the next day this is just I'll smoke out my friends they'll know nothing better I'll obviously it's just some alright weed you know but saves me money and I get to buy some wax as well so definitely saving in that regard you know if I would have just bought like a $40 ate I wouldn't have enough for this so now I have to I have flour in this and it feels like popcorn mugs already and you must be real but if it's good popcorn nuts I won't complain people complain about popcorn it's gonna get smoked regardless but like alright let's just open this you got this lemon cake guys so just see what this is and I looked at the [Music] so before I start this I looked at their Instagram and I seen there grow off and all that stuff and it's definitely like not bad like this stuff is actually pretty decent looking up on them Wow hey I mean you're gonna get what you pay for but this kind of looks like better than what I pay for you know like it looks pretty decent basically I'm gonna start this again after this is done rolling I'm going to be using the curved papers but you know in love but I feel like this is just gonna be a weed review not like I'm gonna stop rolling on here because I don't roll that good and I don't want to be you know I'm so keen on saying so I've started again hey guys so I just thought I'd start the video again just because I broke this up and it smells like pretty good flour like $14 what the [ __ ] are you sure guys are you sure I mean that [ __ ] looks fire for poking up weed alright guys so we got the joint rolled not too bad and yeah I definitely see myself buying this before going on road trips because my friends won't know the difference you know I'm rolling it and it still tastes pretty good and obviously you know there are better options than this but for $14 you can't really beat it you know don't let's just burn off this extra [ __ ] right here extra extra [Music] I didn't see anyone I'll let you know though y-you stay over here okay I'll let you know hey no problem [Music] it's a bit windy guys drum roll her throat Boyan before I start this video I'm at Randy's house he's about to come out and about to go eat after so don't worry [Music] there we go [Music] [Music] yeah no problem say yes guys just smoking this this is actually really Pleasant smooth honestly $14 not bad they had a hella in stock guys so if you guys see this video you know and you don't want to spend too much on lead but you want to buy a lot of weed and just smoke you know and it's good weed it's club weed it's all a [ __ ] I'm for herbs man this ateva [Music] and and some people like my friend included calamity he loves popcorn hugs and if people can get high quality popcorn uggs for cheaper I'm pretty sure a lot of people would you know because when broken down it all looks the same from the fat note to a small note you know obviously fat notes are gonna have more it's gonna be more potent I guess but only by little you know that the popcorn nugs they're still there you know got a guy showed up to the popcorn eggs feeling that's why they call it popular or a store for sort of pop the popcorn herbs I don't know very nice little packaging not the best part packaging but very miniscule minimalistic very nice [ __ ] with it you know papa herbs honey I don't know if anyone's done it another video on YouTube on this specific brand but if they've done it they probably were pleasantly surprised just like how I am today so [Music] it's actually not bad guys this is like it's like I'm not saying buy like the cheapest dirt weed you can get I'm just saying some people can't afford the [ __ ] lavish $60 Apes you know and you know I could afford that too but I would much rather smoke some of this and then get some wax you know just get more for your buck than just [ __ ] one eight you know and you know if you are one of those people that can buy Apes like that more power to you you know I'm saying this is not a game of signing off on people you know I'm I'm just smoking you know I'm showing you well I think it's good and if you're trying to save some money to get some pubs they also have their Instagram right here and all of you guys been asking for flower reviews and all this stuff and uh from time to time I'll do them but I'm not going to break the bank or break my wallet for a 60 dollar eight just to review you know so hope you guys can understand there's a reason why there's so many levels of cannabis like lows mids and tears because not everyone is rich not everyone can afford that much in a I've gotten slack for making a video on spending a hundred dollars at a dispensary and I've been laughed at and it's like so what so what if I spend a hundred dollars like that's a lot to some people and that's nothing to some people you know and then there's people in between where you know it's they do that every now and then like honestly it shouldn't even be about that you know it should just be about chilling smoking and yeah I like this product part gonna see more of this on the channel if I do get it only bought this because I needed some nuts to do a rosin press and I the homie Justin say he was gonna provide the nug for me but you know sometimes you just I don't know do it yourself you know like I like I appreciate the homie for offering his nug but if I could buy 1405 I bought it you know already $14 for this eight I have some weed know to do this video on and it's not a rosin press video that I can show you guys it's actually for something else but I can tell you guys about it you know they but this lemon cake is pretty good it is a nice mellow not as potent sativa in the morning it is at 16% and it that's pretty good for a $14 eighth 16 percent THC suck honestly you it probably would have been like 12 at another club 12 percent I'm liking it though liking it I also picked up some apex I was gonna pick up some ghost rain haze apex but they had the last one and it wasn't it was the display one and I learned my lesson I only want to get the ghost train haze because I've seen it in one of my top 10 sativa videos and I've never tried this train so I wanted to get it but I learned from my past mistakes I'm not getting display backs ever again and it's nothing I mean don't get me wrong it still got me high when I got that display wax but I feel like it could have got me higher if I would have got it when it was fresh you know so good smoke guys honestly I'm pretty [ __ ] tired but hopefully you guys enjoyed this video so far it's just a Papa herbs Papa herbs you know I'm saying this is the one so yes guys I think my camera's probably gonna overheat pretty soon so I'm just gonna stop it before that even happens great for Papa herbs check them out Instagram is going to be under this right here at yeah right here so yes for those of you who are looking for cheaper alternatives to bring with you to share instead of sharing I mean obviously it's good to share the good stuff too but you know it ain't cheap so if you want to share this stuff it's pretty good I suggest I highly suggest it $14 is where it's priced where I'm at so definitely going to be you know it varies different from where location and even [ __ ] dispensary be sure to check out all your alternatives and I'll see you guys in next one [Music]", "U3wpbP6DH8A": "bluetooth headset 5.0 candio high

i made hot cocoa and i will put a uh recipe in the description box for you it's the same one that i use just with smaller measurements because nobody needs as much hot cocoa as i made that was silly my husband's like what in the world are you doing but i have given a lot of it away so if you want to make a lot to give away you know as gifts or whatever or just to hand out to people during when during the cold weather um just double the recipe because that's essentially what i did and so i'll be back in one second to share with you how i'm sending these out be right back all right everyone this is the first one that i'm going to share with you and these are just plastic containers that i got from amazon i will link them in the description box for you i um share some meals with some of the elderly in our church when i cook for us i just share with them some of what we have and they eat like good teeny birds so this is a small container like this is way more than they normally eat but this is the smallest size i could get i believe this one is eight ounces i'm not exactly sure then there's a 16 and a 32 ounce container that they come in i also used a 16 ounce container and set that to the police station so if you're going to share with a group of people you may want to purchase the larger containers and then i didn't use the 32 ounce one because this this is really a lot of hot cocoa mix and so what i did was i went to my publisher on my computer and i downloaded some of my i transferred some of my images from nitwit collections that i own and just made them into a circle and they had a circle on my on my program so i could make sure everything fit inside that circle and this is this lid i believe is a four inch i used a four inch circle and then i used one of my die cuts to cut it out and it has here the hot cocoa mix and two heaping teaspoons to one cup of hot water one caught like a coffee mug type of hot water and this is the first one that i made here is the second one and they all have the directions written right on them let me zoom out here a little bit so i can share some more of them with you and here is the third one and the fourth one i absolutely love i love nitwit collections and all of these came from different well these two came from the same set and then these are from different sets and they have all kinds they just came out with a nutcracker set that i want and will probably be buying but when i buy them i'm going to tell you i do not buy the seven dollar seventeen dollar set i mean it has everything in it i don't use the letters you know i don't you know i stick with i think it's like seven dollars for what i get i mean it's not expensive at all 779 is the nitwit collection that i'm going to purchase so it's not expensive at all and they've got a muay christmas collection that i'm also going to purchase and right now it's only three dollars and 49 cents and it comes with four different towels some buttons some background papers because all of these background papers came from the sets as well i mean everything and i just printed them out on my printer with some cardstock and i used the inexpensive cardstock that you can get from walmart super easy and it's got the directions there's a ton of hot cocoa in here and so it's just a perfect amount to give to them it will last them all winter you know because i mean they don't you know they don't drink a lot of hot cocoa but if they do and they want more i can just fill them up and that's exactly what i told the police department if you want more once you're done with this send the thing home with jessie i will fill it up again and send it back and these ladies always send me back their tubs because they know i refill them so i will get these back eventually but if i don't it's not a big deal these these containers are not expensive but this is one way that i'm sharing my hot cocoa and if you give me one second i'll be back and show you another way that i'm sharing it and this way um i was gifted these bags that someone had purchased for a candy buffet they had set up at a wedding so i was purchased these but i'm sure you could get something like them at clearbags.com and i will try to link that for you in the description as well and i purchased from them in the past they are an awesome company i'll be right back in one second to share the next idea all right everyone this is my next idea for sharing this and my husband is actually going to take this one and give it to a lady that he works with in the office one there the one lady in the office there's only one and um so i just used it to fill it up with hot coffee and it's got the top like um like if you buy bags for coffee that's what it's like and it just folds down and rolls and then hooks in the back and i will share that with you but all i did was i cut out i used my cottage cuts dies and i cut out a circle here for the little image which says hot cocoa add two heaping teaspoons to one cup of hot water and then i did a scallop circle i'll zoom in a little tighter there and i did a scallop circle for the background and of course all of the papers again come from the knitwick collections and then i just added a little charm of a candy cane since he's hanging from a candy cane i thought that would be cute now i purchased this charm several years ago from dee who is elegant embellishments i don't know that she's going to carry them again or what she's even doing with her store because i know that she um has moved so i'm not sure if she's doing it i did find them on other places but you had to purchase them in a large quantity so if you know if you just google it in either aliexpress or wish or one of these places i'm sure they'll come up and they may have them in smaller quantities on aliexpress but the place i found had them in large quantities which was way more than i wanted and i can't even remember where i got them from or you know where i saw them at but i loved it i tied it on with a little bit of twine i poked a hole now this was my this was my boo-boo don't do this i poked a hole right here now of course you can still pour it out this side and you're fine or you roll it down and you get your spoonful that was a big boo because now there's a hole in the bag the smart thing to do would have been to use my crocodile and punch a hole in this plastic piece and then the plastic piece would be over here it would be out of the way and it wouldn't matter if there was a hole in the plastic piece but i punched it all the way through the roll on the bag so that was not one of my brighter moves definitely not one of my greater moves and uh but you know it will still work because you use a spoon you reach under the spoon get it out i don't think the hole is going to be a problem and the amount is below the hole so i mean it's not a super huge mistake but it's still one i'm not real thrilled with so i will probably change out the bag before i send it to um to my husband's co-worker and uh so that it you know doesn't look like it has a hole in the bag i'm just like i did it this morning my son asked me to get up and go to walmart at some crazy ridiculous hour to try to get some gaming system that they ended up not even having until tomorrow so i am like super tired and so punch drunk i'm just like i can't even think straight i think my eyes are rolling around i'm not even focusing but uh so that explains the hole in the bag if i had been thinking with my wits this morning when i did when i finished it up i would have punched the hole in the little me and the little flappy piece the plastic piece so do that don't punch a hole all the way through the bag and i'll be back in one second to share them with you again so in case you have any questions you can see them good again real good hold on one sec all right everyone here they are again again i punch this into a four inch circle that's what size it took to cover this lid but you know if you use you know you can use recyclable you know plastic containers with lids and just measure it and cut out your circle and adjust it to whatever size container that you're using but i will link these because they're great we my family uses the larger ones for leftovers and like i said the medium and the small ones we use to share i put food in for the elderly so i mean there's there there's a lot of great things you can use them for you could use them in your craft space because they're really handy things and they stack great so but i wanted to share those with you if you have any questions or comments leave them below i will try to link the um each of the collections as well from the nitwit collection so that you can go and purchase any if you're interested i know a lot of people love gingers and there's some really cute ones in this collection but this little santa with his wiry arms and legs for some reason cracks me up and mr and mrs claus came together but they also came separate in this set along with the sleigh being separate so these are all individual pieces that i lined up together and that is it this is the last way that i will probably i sent um hot cocoa and canisters that said coco on the front i found them at walmart i have a video that i will put up probably before this one and i went to the store today like i said i had to be there to try to get this crazy game for my son and um they were out of those red cocoa canisters already at my walmart but my walmart is teeny tiny doesn't get a lot of stuff so you guys still may be able to get them if you're interested in that one and i will link that video um and then just at the end of this one so that you can see it and that's it guys i will be back soon with some more videos if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you have any questions or comments leave them below and i'll do my best to answer them and remember to practice your cpr craft pray repeat thanks for visiting me today and happy crafting love you all bye", "lgsReZodyA0": "hello everyone and welcome back to whimsy Creek art alright today's video is gonna be a fun one so here are the supplies we've got flow trawl and then we have master's touch paint today we have titanium white pink ultramarine blue cobalt blue pale blue turquoise green Viridian magenta violet and yellow deep so those are the colors we're gonna be working with today and this is with the Masters touch fun fine art studio acrylics alright so here we're gonna get to mixing our colors okay so what we have here is some cups and some regular old popsicle sticks and we're gonna start mixing up the colors and we're gonna do one part paint to three parts float roll so I use about two parts float roll if it's one of the thinner paints like a craft paint but if it's a thicker paint like this master's touch is pretty thick here let me show you see it's a pretty thick paint and so we're gonna do one part paint to three parts float roll and then we're gonna check the consistency and we might put a little bit of water we may not need any water then we check it afterwards so I have a couple of videos on how I mix my paint my consistency of my paint and all that see I'm gonna go ahead and link below the videos on how to mix the paint but I'm gonna go ahead and mix up a little bit of each of these colors right now off-camera and I'll show you the consistency we're going for alright now I have all the paints mixed up and I ended up having to put about a teaspoon of water in each color and so we have a pretty good consistency here and what we're looking for is for it to run off this stick but kind of sit across the top not sink right away and I do have other videos on specifically the consistency of paint and so I did all the colors and white that I had gone over before on the Masters Touch paint so one color I did on end is this lighter purple and I just did that by adding 's equal parts of the white and the violet and so I mixed equal parts parts of white and violet to get a little bit of a lighter purple and so that's what we have and so I'll get going and this is top 20 paint pours of 20 20 and they're in no specific order just gonna go ahead and get down my favorite 20 paint pours right now we're just about ready to pour we need to add a little bit of silicone so what we're gonna do is we take spot on treadmill oil and this is 100% silicone oil and you can use whatever silicone oil you're using and so we want to just put it very little you don't want to go overboard with your silicone so this cups probably 2/3 or throw these 3/4 of the way full a little more so we want to put probably two drops in this one and that's it no more than that and you can go ahead and mix that up I don't really mix it you know super super well but that about that much and then that's good all right now I'm gonna get silicone in each of the colors but not the white all right so we're not going to go in any specific order we're just gonna do my top 20 paint pours of 20 20 and there are so many more than 20 different techniques I've just chosen my top 20 and we're not gonna go into any specific order all right we're gonna start out easy and we're gonna start out with a dirty poor and right now I'm just pouring the cups the paint in the cup layering a man really no specific order kind of going for the brighter kind of primary colors for this one and for all 20 paint ports today I am going to be using 6x6 inch ceramic tiles just to keep it keep it a cohesive look for all 20 paint pores and you can get these ceramic tiles at your local Lowe's or Home Depot and I don't do anything to the surface but maybe clean them with a little bit of alcohol if they need it alright so we've layered the cup this is a three ounce cup I forgot about oh two two and a half ounces in the cup I am now pouring it on the surface and wow those cells just pump right up and that's just was using two drops in each color notice I put my hand here to add an L shape and this L shape kind of catches the paint as I leaned it to each side so I'm gonna lean the tile over and kind of get it to the edge get it to the corner and then a little bit back to the center completely back to the center but somewhat so back to the center and then on to the next corner and I do that for all four corners and notice I kind of use my hand my fingers to kind of help it I kind of pull it along that kind of helps it get it all the way to that corner now I'm pulling that gravity of that paint back to the center a little bit and that is a dirty pour so that is our first pour of our twenty paint Wars of 2020 now I'm gonna give it a little bit of a torch I'm only about oh four six forty six inches away from the tile I do not have my flame right on the tile you don't want to scorch your paint and I'm just using a creme brulee torch or a bhoot butane small oak gym torch alright here's a close-up let's look at that Wow quite a difference we've got a variety of cells that's kind of nice to have these smaller cells and the larger ones a little bit of lacing and here are some close-up shots of the same or you all right and for our next floor we're gonna put down a little bit of face paint some of that white that we mixed up with no silicone and we're gonna put that down as a base layer here and this is our second paint for of 20 I'm just gonna go ahead and spread this out I have set this up a little bit to just kind of you know it's kind of the boring part spread not like paint out now that we've got all the paint spread out now we're gonna go ahead this is a napkin ring paint pour or you can do it with toilet paper rolls or some people call this an open cylinder paper but I like to use these plastic dollar tree napkin rings they're in overbites a party section party supplies kind of the wedding supply section of the Dollar Tree and you get six of them for a dollar they're used for a napkin ring and they work great for this technique open cylinder or napkin ring paint pour okay so I'm just taking you don't need much for this technique you're gonna have negative space and that's that it whatever base color you use background color and it does not have to be white you're gonna see in later pours for this video I do not use white as my negative space color but this one we are using white so notice I'm not pouring them in I'm kind of just using the popsicle stick to get a little bit of paint in there because you don't need much now I'm getting it closer to the corner and I'm slowly feathering that napkin ring up just to let a little bit of paint out but not all of it at once so I'm kind of just feathering it across the camp canvas pulling or not canvas tile in this case and you could use tile canvas for any of these techniques they work for any of them I'm just using tile cuz that's what I had on hand so I'm gonna go ahead and give it another little bit of torch oh you see the cells pop up right away with that torch okay now I'm gonna tilt the tile a little bit try to get that paint to come over to that other corner a bit more but I don't want to tilt it too aggressively because I do like the cells and that little bit of lacing I have through that white that's what we paint pores call that a little delicate lacing across that white so I am just trying to tilt it a little but not too aggressively and I'm just trying to get the paint to that corner a little bit more and you'll notice here in just a second I'm gonna grab here an aquarium tubing I use aquarium tubing to blow out the edges you can use a straw or whatever you have on tap on hand I like to use the aquarium tubing because it's reusable and you can use it over and over and over again it's very affordable and I can direct the flow a little bit of better of the air so I have got this vertical with the tile you don't want this right horizontal straight on straight out the cam or the canvas or tile you want this vertical with it and you're just lightly feathering you can see I'm just going back and forth back and forth while I'm chase real lightly blowing the air through so I'm gonna blow that paint pretty aggressively here in the corner trying to get it towards the corner all right now I like this because it gives it a more organic shape and not all paint process if I'd done this you'll see later in this video there's a couple right do not blow out the edges it's just kind of whatever vibe I'm going for for that particular painting and here is a close-up of the final product and some close-up shots you'll notice each pore I do I'll do the technique explain it some tips and then I'll give you a close-up of it and a couple close-up shots so you can see how it turns out and that's kind of how I do all my videos I show you the technique then I do a close-up video of it and then some close-up shots and each one on this video I do that as well all right third paint pour out of our top 20 of 20/20 all right so this one's gonna have a blue negative space and this is gonna be what I call a central swipe there's so many different names and many different techniques have multiple names throughout the years they've gotten different names and such so I just call this a central swipe but what I'm doing here is I'm just taking my palette knife I just have these plastic cheap palette knives from the Dollar Tree and I'm spreading my paint my base color and you can use any base color when we're talking negative space it does not have to be white or have to be black it can be any color we're just negative space meaning leaving a little bit of that base that background color showing not covering it completely and so I'm getting this read about and then I'm gonna go ahead and put some colors down the middle again some of the brighter primary colors and at the beginning of this we've gotten named all the different colors were using today it's a little bit of that magenta and this color this is a real pretty color I mean this master's touch paint is new to me so I really enjoyed using it each technique really did well with the Masters Touch paint I think it is a good versatile paint for all different paid pouring techniques it is a little bit on the thicker side but if you get it the right consistency and get it down to where you want it it really worked well and so I'm just getting a thin layer of paint down the center of the tile I'm not really wanting a lot that's why I'm using my popsicle stick to just get a little bit of paint and so I'm gonna finish it off here with this real nice bright yellow and you can do a swipe in many different ways of doing a swipe this is the first of several swipes I'm gonna go ahead and show you in the top-20 paint pours and this I just call a central swipe so I use these plastic paint palette or these palette knifes because they've got a real nice they're not very heavy they're super light so for a swipe they work real well so just let the knife kind of guide glide across the top you don't want to put too much pressure in it just barely let it kind of glide across the top and then after each time I swipe through the colors I am wiping it off and off-camera I've got a rag and I'm just wiping the surface of the power knife and then going and again for another one and I'm trying to grab a variety of colors so I kind of bring yellow down one side purple down one side I don't want all the yellow in one spot and all the purple so I'm trying to kind of break that up as I'm pulling them down and I'm just going about halfway on some three-quarters on some paint give it a variety there as well the swipe technique does do some really nice lacing so if that's what you're going for a lacing look it does do lovely lacing with the swipe technique so here we're just finishing off swiping that last little end little bit and so that is and I'm gonna go ahead and fix this bald spot here with the edge of the palette knife that is a central swipe I've also called a scenic called like a ghost swipe I believe a ghost wave is the little variation of this now torching again remember not to get too close you don't wanna you're just kind of heating or popping any air bubbles you might have so here in the close-up we can see that lacing really well and has just barely across the top kind of delicate that is real nice you all right and for our fourth paint pour of our 20th for top 20 of 2020 it's gonna be what I can't kind of been calling a whimsy swipe and the reason I call it this is I just kind of put the paint down all over and no real order kind of just throw it down whimsically and all over and then I'm just swiping in all directions all right there is a central swipe there's just an all-over swipe where you swipe the whole thing and there's many different types of swipes and so this one I just kind of have affectionately named it the whimsy swipe but it's just a random swipe and again I'm just gonna throw the colors down randomly all over throw on some of these purples and a little bit of blues and that real pretty kind of turquoise the green color and then I'm gonna grab my palette knife I may use those plastic palette knifes again from the Dollar Tree I'm just lightly letting the palette knife the weight of the palette knife which it is a very light pellet knife just kind of glide across the top real carefully I'm not trying to press down at all just let the weight of the palette knife glide across the top of the paint and I am if the paint isn't all the way to one edge I'm just pulling it to the edge and then pulling it across randomly and kind of with whimsy I this has been one of my favorite techniques lately I've been really just enjoying different color combinations and trying out different directions and kind of going in swirls or diagnol you can just wherever you feel and if you get a spot you don't really like swipe through it again throw some more color down swipe through it you can also get your I use the clam tubing or your straw and you can blow out some parts you don't like so it's a very forgiving technique as well so it's quite fun because you can just you don't have to put a lot of thought into it and just kind of go with ever whimsy whatever color you feel like direction you feel like going so it's been a real fun technique and it does create a good variety of different size cells and thus so that creates a nice good pleasing looking painting for the high it's nice to be able to see you know some of them real larger cells some delay seeing some of the small cells all in the same art piece I particularly personally enjoyed that to see the larger cells small cells Leasing kind of a variety in the same piece that's kind of neat to see and so this whimsy swipe does kind of create that you get a good variety of lacing fail sizes yeah and so here again I am just gonna go ahead and give it a little bit of a torch but this time it's not really doing much I have already kind of made all the cells pop up that are going to pop up here in the corner of this green lacing oh that's really pretty across the top of that purple this one kind of reminds me kind of mermaid vibe to it some mermaid colors you all right now for our fifth paint pour out of our twenty this is a blown flower what I like to call a whimsy bloom and so I'm just putting some of the paint down in the middle some of that violet and a little bit of the magenta and I haven't put anything special in this paint this is just like we mixed it up at the very beginning of this video float roll paint and a tiny bit of water and just like two little drops of silicone I would love to be able to take its Shelly arts course someday on her blooms but for now this is how I do my blooms without adding anything extra I know with her blooms there's a lot few other ingredients well this is just what the paint I've already mixed up and have on hand I'm taking that aquarium tubing and just blowing very gently right across the two colors and kind of throwing them like across the top of the white and I'm trying to create almost you know like a flower petals and this these can be done so many different ways they can be just one bloom in the center it looks really nice doing them a bloom in the corner with the petals you know from the center of the flower being in the corner of the canvas or tile and you can do them also like a bunch of flowers not just one on there so they can be done many different ways quite a fun technique you you okay for our number six out of 20 this is a bottle bottom cake for kind of resembles a flower and so I've laid a little bit of yellow paint down in the middle kind in the middle of the flower and I'm just kind of getting it kind of tilted around kind of about the size of the bottom of my bottle now this is a real tiny bottle that I was able to find they've got all different sized soda bottles water bottles and I just cut off the bottom and I'm like putting laying it right there over the top of that yellow now I'm gonna try to evenly in the middle so it goes down evenly all different sides I've got some of the blue and I'm just gonna randomly layer some blues and greens first and then I'm gonna get two more some traditionally flower colors please excuse the paint they're on my arm I need to wash that off and so I'm just trying to get it straight into the center and so it evenly goes down each edge of the paint each edge of the bottle bottom and I sometimes use propel sports drink bottoms because they have multiple they have six of the little knobs creating more of a crevice for the paint to go down so now putting down some of the magenta and you can do this technique and any any of these techniques can be done with silicone or without silicone and as you saw at the very beginning of this video each of my colors do have silicone so um here you are gonna see a few cells pop up but I don't torch it so then that created we're not a ton of cells popped up and I'm alternating the colors back and forth trying to get them evenly but they kind of have a mind of their own and so I'm trying to pay attention when I put down the next color if the color before did go down one side a little bit too much maybe I'm gonna try to even it out with this next color but I mean you can't do too much you just gotta kind of get it as even as possible after we get all the paint layered on here then we're gonna very carefully lift that bottle bottom now that is slippery so it is kind of hard to lift up make sure that you just lift it straight up and that you have kind of a landing spot for it I've got a little tray off-camera here I'm gonna lift it straight up and get it out of there it's trying not to tilt it because then you will tilt the paint off and kind of skew your the way it looks now I'm gonna grab a clean popsicle stick here and I'm gonna take the popsicle stick through each of the what you can kind of call petals kind of created more of the petal of a flower look now you can do this sometimes I go just once down the center of each petal sometimes I go down three times just depends on what look your look going for any of these techniques you can change them up and you can do it your way that's what's so fun and the freedom with paint pouring is you can do it any way you really want you don't have to use that popsicle stick down the center how I just did it and each time I took the popsicle stick down each side of the petal I did wipe it off and then put it back through clean again to do the next petal so now I am tilting it tilting it to each corner and kind of helping it there with my fingers once you get once it gets about an inch or so away from the corner I'm just kind of hoping it kind of helps it to squeeze it down there to the last little bit always check your edges always check your corners they can easily messed us just so much easier to get them painted now than to have to go back and try to do it and so each time I tilt to a corner you'll notice I am somewhat tilting it back to the center then on to the next corner then back to the center and then on to the next corner now with this technique you don't want to tilt it too aggressively if you tilt it too aggressively you may slide it right off the edge so you want to just very easily tilt it to each side so here we go that's kind of an abstract flower and this is just a 6x6 ceramic tile if you do have a larger canvas you can kind of see the whole definition of the flower a little bit more on a larger surface but on these smaller tiles that looks going to need as well you all right and for number seven out of 20 we have a flip cup and the flip cup is a super easy accrete paint pour for beginners to do I'm just gonna I have a three ounce cup this is again a six by six inch tile I'm gonna get about two two and a half ounces in this cup to get the whole surface I'm just layering them randomly and I'm going with some of these pastel colors I haven't used too many of those that we mixed up here and so I'm gonna just layer them here with a little bit of the white and now I've got about two two and a half ounces I'm gonna take that tile flip it over onto the top of the cup and flip that Cup over onto the surface now I'm gonna lift this Cup I'm gonna go off to the edge I'm not gonna go straight up if I go straight up it'll drip drips down in now you can take see how I'm taking it it's coming out and I'm trying to get some streaks across there give a little bit more character I'm taking the rest of the paint and I'm trying to just get it out on the corners that'll mainly come off the edge so it's kind of ugly there it's gonna come off the edge this helps get all of that paint out and get it used up to get those corners covered now I gave it a little bit of torch and you can torch it before you tilt it or you can torture after if you tilt it I torched it before I tilt it you're gonna see here in a second I got much larger cells because now they're gonna stretch out as I'm getting it to each corner of in my kind of my hands my fingers help it to the edge help it to the corner and so I've ended up with some larger cells because I tilted it or I torched it before I tilted it if I would have just went ahead and tilted it and then torched after tilting I would have gotten a little bit smaller cells so that's one thing with flip Cup says you can torch it before tilting or torch it after and that would be depending on what size of cells you're going for okay our eight pink poor out of 20 it's gonna be a bottle cap paint pour and so this is gonna be the last paintin part for this video but right after this I have another video coming out and that's gonna have number nine through twenty in this video we had how to mix up our paint and what colors were using and then one through eight next video will have nine through 20 now right here I'm just spreading out the base layer so this one's gonna have quite a bit of that negative space that base colors still showing up and as I've said you don't have to have negative space just being white or black I'm using that aqua this light kind of teal color as my negative space here and then I'm gonna take a bottle cap and you can use a bottle cap you can just use a small cup you can use a bottle cap and you can use uh anything just real small you want a small amount of paint here you're not gonna want to put a lot down I use a cap to a Gatorade it's what I'm gonna use that's a nice size for this technique in this size of a tile take your bottle cap and you just want to take a little bit of paint on each of the popsicle sticks and drip a little bit down in that bottle cap you don't want a ton just enough for each of the colors so I'm Jake in a variety these blues and just I don't want to pour it in there cuz I don't want I'm getting a little bit of purple and letting it just come off into the popsicle stick and this is a real fun abstract look because you get a lot more of that negative space which is real nice for the eye sometimes if the surface is just too busy and too full of like a dirty poor or flip Cup with no negative space isn't always the most pleasing sometimes it can be really really nice and look great but sometimes you want it this negative space you're looking for a more of the solid color and then just a little bit of color going through it and these bottle cap pores are great for that because you don't put all that much in the book bottle cap so now I flipped it over on the surface and now I'm going to drag it across the surface and I am just feathering it up this is something you're just gonna have to practice because I'm dragging it across the surface I'm just lifting it a little bit more and a little bit more you don't want to let all of it go gushy if you just lift it up it'll all go gushing out at once you want to just kind of feather it out as you're dragging it across the surface and then I notice the one corner didn't have too much paint so I went ahead and took the bottle cap back to that edge and kind just drugged it off and gave it a little bit more paint for that edge all right so sometimes I blow those edges out this particular one I'm going for more of that minimal look so I am NOT going to go ahead and blow it out I do like kinda it's already given itself kind of an organic look to it it doesn't have straight edges that knots the reason I maybe would blow it out but I'm gonna go ahead and leave this one because I like just the minimal look without having too much there alright so thank you for joining me and that is one through eight in just a few minutes 9 through 20 will be out", "dAnEu2rwQvo": "yeah we're gonna do some math today kids okay are we ready here we go these three things don't write them down okay don't all you have to do is decide which ones are greater than four times five this is pretty easy okay so which one of these is gonna give you an answer that's bigger than four times five pause now and make those decisions and there you go okay yeah you added two to it this you multiplied by two yes this you took away two all right let's get the next set let's hope they're a little higher there okay here we go let's do the next batch your job is to decide if the answer is gonna be uh is the value of the expression twice as large as eight plus seventeen twice as large so is this value that at least three are they twice as large as eight plus seventeen not bigger less than just are they so you check them out are you done yet okay here we go which ones are twice yep that one's yeah sure that one is the same thing you just put that over there okay i don't know what happened to my accent there okay now we're doing 2 divided by that no that's going to be like 2 2 divided by is like a fraction line so that's going to be 25 that's not the same no no no let's do the last three now now we're going to do the last ones here you go we have three expressions your job is to determine is the value of each of these expressions less than 12 times four which ones it or what we have is each one which one is less than 12 times four you hit the positive you figure out okay let's do it that is one divided by lots of stuff it's going to make a little bit diffraction it is definitely less than 12 times 4. this we get really big number we divide it by four well that's time weight that would just get us back to the beginning so that is definitely less than 12 times four okay there's my 12 times four and i'm making it bigger because i'm multiplying it by something that is going to be more than one so that is a big x did it really do that all three times look at that all three times it did yes yes no variety everyday matt you needed a variety i realized i did not have the mic attached to my body i don't know if you heard anything i have just said to you terrible okay we're doing 21 to 24. here's what you got to know all right let's start out with 21. and this whole page about minutes and seconds and kilo liters and all that kilo means a thousand okay you can do it a kilo is a thousand miles and yards okay well okay that one they kind of tell you their whole key that's just a multiply in there okay down at the bottom we got a problem okay uh we got quartz and cups and blah blah blah okay you need this information get ready you might want to write it down did anyone answer ounces they don't they do over here they want the bounces okay here we go ready oh i just erase what i need okay okay okay ready yeah you are all right eight ounces equals a cup okay that's about you know like a which is like a little not a big glass just it's a cup it's called a cup why why eight welcome to america okay we've talked about that okay eight ounces makes a cup when you get two cups it equals a pint i don't know just cuz when you get two of these pints you get a quart which sort of sounds like the fraction quarter because if you have four of these quartz you get a gallon four quarts and a gallon by the way they also have half gallons so if you have two of these chords then you got a half gal is that all you need for that totally totally dead that's like so like all your name okay let's go over to like page 22. so what you're gonna have to do with each of these shapes is like find out like how many cubes are in like the bottom layer by counting like lefty righty not lefty righty yeah sort of like here's my drawing like this oh my god i'm like should have gone to art school okay so here's the cubes find out how many go this way and how many go back that's the bottom layer and they ask you that on page 22. how many cubes in one layer let's think of that as the bottom layer and then how many layers are there how which is how how high how high up does it go that's the second piece and then the total is you just multiply those two together you figure out the ones on the bottom times this one and you get it and that's also going to be the volume the volume and the number of little cubes is the same ah goody okay that gets you through 22 and 23 and you got a math box is any that hard hard enough then actually some of it's really not hard at all but let's not be judgy okay okay what about the home like i don't know go do it you find out do i have to do everything around here no go do your work", "o9pDIC1nh-M": "what's going on guys alright so this video ended up being way way longer than I anticipated it turned into more of a vlog style video than a review but I promise the reviews in there and if you just want to see the review I'll put a timecode down in the description you can click on it it'll take you right to the review but if you want to watch the whole video that'd be cool too hope you enjoy so I posted a picture on Instagram asking people if they prefer three inch or three-and-a-half inch shells and boy it caused quite a stink we were supposed to have a discussion you've got an angry so we're gonna not talk about it we're gonna be about it we're gonna go right we're gonna go snag some shotgun shells from the local gander and do a little test shall we so from what I gathered from the comments is there's basically two camps and no one's really in between you're either on the side of I shoot three and a half inch shells because they don't make four inch shells or you're on the side of the argument that says two or three quarters enough I only shoot three inch because it's hard to find two and three quarters if you can't get them close enough to shoot with three inch you shouldn't be shooting and that's all well and good I'm not I'm not picking a side but it brings up another point that I'd like to talk about but we'll talk about that in another video we're all in the same team guys just because it's not what you use doesn't mean it's wrong but we'll save that for another video right now we're gonna go to Gander we're gonna snag some shells and we're gonna do some tests all right we have arrived to beady gander go see what they got all right when you got blindsided first three and a half inch two shots 1,400 feet a second 26 bucks the exact same shell that's three inches 22 $5 difference they got Winchester there to shot again three-inch two shots 1550 12 bucks three half-days two shot here we go 17 bucks so about a five dollar difference per box again I think that dude test two different kinds of shells all right we've got our shells look at this nice eco-friendly bag we're gonna go shoot something all right step one of the process is complete I'm thinking we're gonna need some big pieces of cardboard to shoot at the board that we shoot at is really shot up and I want to shoot it a bigger target I want to see all the pellets the whole spread rather than just shooting it a 12 inch piece of paper and you only get to see the pellets that hit the target I want to see you know the full spread of what we got going on so we're gonna run in here to the home depot see what they got for us all right well that was a success we got a big roll of paper three feet wide so we'll probably do like a three foot by three foot square put that on the boards we'll be able to see a lot more of the pellet strikes that should make people happy so I'm gonna go ahead and make a prediction I'm gonna say that the three and a half inch shell is going to put more pellets on target but it's only going to be marginally better than the three inch it's going to be a small enough gap where the three-inch guys are going to say see I told you three 1/2 inch shells aren't worth it you don't need that but it's going to be just big enough to where the three and a half inch guys you're going to say see I told you the extra five dollars is worth having you know however many extra pellets on so I don't think it's gonna change anybody's mind his moon make the argument worse but we're gonna find out nonetheless it is test time all right so we're going to be shaping these bigger targets but for test purposes we're only going to be concerned with what is inside it's raining perfect timing great that is that's exactly that is exactly what I wanted come on I guess we're gonna have to wait this one out for a minute you know what we came here to do a test and we're doing a test don't worry about this rain come back gonna be oh goodness so we're going to cut these into a roughly three-foot pieces okay so after further assessment the chest is gonna have to wait till a later day because it's raining a lot so this is to be continued mmm all right it's a new day the sun is shining and we're gonna do a shotgun shell test also side note I got a drone I've actually had a drone for a while but I've never flown it outside of my house so we made a little bit of drone footage in here too and if you came here not to be entertained but just to learn about shotgun shells well I apologize you can fast-forward to the shotgun shell part but this is my video I can do what I want so ok we're back again this is take two [Music] gonna be shooting at 30 yards see who can put the most pellets in the square and what they're the bigger paper is I just want to see what the entire pattern looks like if there's any major differences here we go Nate who's gonna be helping us Azir protection which one we gonna shoot first first one in line okay that 3-inch two-shot Winchester Hey so we got that was the 3-inch two-shot Winchester matters a little bit high one shot down three more to go well that's been impressed with that I'm not gonna lie so next we'll do the three 1/2 inch Winchester two-shot so this is the three and a half inch this is the three and a half inch Winchester and it is substantially better absolutely worth the extra $5 a box in my opinion for this application I'm interested to see how it compares to the blindside so what's this target out the next will be three-inch blindside still number two shot trying to keep things as fair as possible I think it's better it's better it's definitely better than the Winchester three-inch but not nearly as good as the three-and-a-half so during a half inch blindside okay last one this is one I'm most excited about seeing that is a pretty doggone good package blindside that was our square one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen we got 14 inside the square and a pretty good pattern overall little behind left but they were all like that now this is the 3 inch blind side 1 2 3 4 5 yep 5 on the 3 inch blind side still a decent pattern not nearly as dense as the Korean half 3 inch Winchester 1 and I will count that one will count that one mm close three of them in the square with the 3 inch Winchester the three and a half inch Winchester I miss my square up a little bit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 we got 15 on this one there in the Blind Side that's what you get what the paper looks like on the back that's a solid pattern that's what it looks like on the back of the blindside so those are two three and a half so three and a half inch Winchester did fifteen three and a half inch blindside did fourteen three-inch Winchester did three kind of three-inch blindside did five so that pretty well settles it for me you can make your own mind up I would say there's no other conclusion that you can draw from this other than you should be spending the extra five dollars on three and a half's if your gun will accept them so I hope this video helped you leave me a comment down below let me know if this changed your mind at all if you're gonna stick with threes if you always been shooting threes or maybe if you're gonna accept your going to move up to three and a half's or maybe both shot three and a half's and this just confirmed what you thought but anyways enjoy some drone footage and while we were down here we figured why not break out the fun guns [Music]", "v054wvlbTgo": "hello my name is Bruce Cheaney I would like to demonstrate to you how to silver solder two pieces of steel they're a quarter inch thick by one inch wide just little pieces that I've cleaned put a little shampoo on and basically I want to demonstrate to you how I silver solder two pieces of metal like that together I'll be using the Harris products 45 percent safety seal 1/16 inch bracing wire and the flux I'll be using is safety stay sealed and it's also made by the Harris company it's a white brazing flux and that's what helps bond the two together so let's get started here this is the corner of my workbench where I do a lot of my soldering for the handmade items up making this is my two pieces of steel that I have prepped they're quarter-inch stick actually these are that's a little more likely inch and a quarter in width but that'll work just fine for this demonstration got a little chamfer on those and they're belt set in clean and you can actually but it right up to each other you can move it back a little bit so I'm just put it right close to each other right like that and that's what I'll saw her together with the Harris 45 percent silver solder okay I've got my parts going already and it's a victor tarts it's a small one with the heating tip on it in some cases you'll need a bigger heating tip but what I'm doing right now is putting the flat pace flux on to the steel where I want the silver solder to flow as I mentioned this has been cleaned with a belt sander right up to the edge what I want to solve and it's good with plenty of flux on there so that the Queen wanted to do and this is what the silver solder wire looks like I'll snip off a piece long enough to do flame what I'll do is hold the silver solder wire my left hand there and what I'll do is I'll heat the back end of it get the metal hot towards the back and then I'll apply heat towards the seam that I want to solve it kind of work it back and forth like that and it said both pieces of Steel need to be hot the Harris products are really good for soldering and I highly recommend on my views the Harris silver solders for over 30 years public okay I'm getting some heat built up on my piece and then now I can kind of go towards the center and one thing you want to keep in mind is not to burn your  so if it turns black it will not be effective so right now I think I'm about ready here I'm gonna start on this side here my middle that it's a dull red until it's ready to flow I'll just slow that sort of right down on there and just stop like that you know turn that over there'll be some cases where you will not be able to flip your piece over and you'll just hit the solder from the top and back pretty much assure you that there is a good fat sealer and just right there just get off of it just like that you can spray a little bit trim it off depending on your metal though because just like if it's cast iron you you get the let it cool it off naturally and real slow if it's a mild steel or some kind of carbon steel it can well cut a carbon steel I let it cool off slow also the hot roll or a coal row you can go ahead and cool it off that is a good tight bond all the way around that piece of steel right there you", "vtwuy4VRtO8": "hi everyone I am Rebecca from chemnitz and I'm here today with a quick video to talk about acid dye powder weight versus volume when I am measuring out acid dyes for a project I will use a small kitchen scale and do everything based on the grams of dye so if I'm making a stock solution I will measure out say 5 grams of dye dissolve it in 500 milliliters of water for a 1% stock solution but this does add an additional step and has an additional server requirement and so there are some people who might prefer safer one skein of yarn to measure a quarter teaspoon on a teaspoon of dye and go about it that way the big reason to weigh your dye by grams versus by volumes is that the manufacturers mix these dye stocks they can keep it about the weight and the colors that you can achieve per weight of dye they recommend specific on weight of goods for example Dharma training company recommends and on weight of goods of 1.5% to 2% for most of their colors and then for some of their more saturated colors they recommend that you use a non weight of goods of 4% which would be 4 grams of dye per 100 grams to achieve the advertised color since I needed to make up some stocks today anyway I thought that while I'm weighing out my 5 grams of dye for each of these colors that it could be worth me using measuring spoons and measuring the volume as I go along and yeah who knows what we'll see as always I will be wearing gloves safety glasses and wearing a respirator while dealing with the powders so that way I don't inhale or accidentally get anything in my eye or anything like that we're going to start today with the paler cherry bomb and let's try measure one teaspoon of dye this is approximately leveled right here let's see how much the boys okay so that looks about two point eight grams right now all right let's do now a half teaspoon and again this is approximate okay so 4.2 4.3 it's good that there is some consistency on the food day for the same amount of that but it can really depend and the volume that you get in to the pen and how compact your powders are or even probably from color to color I'm not sure that we will see the same kind of weights with different colors necessarily all right next color is dirt navy and we're gonna get one teaspoon two point three grams so I'm gonna go ahead and do a second teaspoon oh that one was and that one was merde so the first one I got two point three grams the second one gave us about 3 grams of dye this one was notable because we get shootable teaspoons in a row and you can give us different weight I need the difference between two point three grams two point four grams and three grams insignificant the extra half gram of dye can make a difference in your depth of shape depending on the color now I think that we got such a different weight because one of our spoonfuls our second one that was more compact than the first one and so this was actually a really good example of what I wanted to show finally the last color I we know today is peacock blue and let's weigh out approximately a quarter teaspoon for about point nine grams second one that is pretty consistent so fun I was having consistency within this color but wait nine brands for a quarter teaspoon okay we've now added four quarter teaspoons and we have 3.6 grams again this is different a different weight per volume that what we've seen for the other colors this one is clearly more compact food I have been over filling my quarter teaspoon with this color definitely I definitely could have been doing that but oh yeah was measuring out what should be approximately one teaspoon we've got everywhere friend you know 2.3 to 3.6 grams which is a huge difference so why is this important and it really is only important if you're concerned about consistency because the density of your dye how compact or how fluffy it is can vary from when you first open it to when you use it a couple months later or even between one batch versus another from the same supplier so if you're gonna get like a huge variability when you're dealing with a specific volume of your dye powder then you could get inconsistent color results which is only a problem if you have a recipe and you are trying to replicate it so if you want to make a recipe for achieving a specific shade or a specific color way it makes a bit more sense to go for grams if you die more by feel and it's okay if there's some variability and what you within the end by all means you can go by volume there's nothing wrong with it one of my favorite techniques is just to go straight from the dye powder where I'm not doing any measuring at all I'm just dying by feel so that is absolutely okay but ultimately as long as you are consistent with the way that you measure the color you will likely end up with some reproducible results but there could be a fluke and you get one overpacked spoon and then suddenly your colors a lot more intense which you know you can always add more color but you can't exactly take it away so that could be a problem I am happy that I can finally answer a question and say alright there's between I guess like 2.3 and 3.6 grams of dye per one teaspoon and it really probably varies not just on the compactness of the dye but it could also vary a lot on the color different colors could have different volumes per weight just because they're made up of different molecules they have different amounts of filler and things like that when you're speckling with dermis silvered gray and true black the colors look of the specks of the actual dye and there looks pretty indistinguishable but there's no question that there's got to be some kind of filler in that silver gray dye stock so that way you can measure out a full gram versus having to do a fraction of the gram to get that more true gray versus sort of a deep gray this is something I talked about in the math of yarn dyeing where we actually went and looked at the different depths of shade of silver gray and true black and how they compare versus the amount of dye used for each of those scans I'll have a link to that video in the video description and my card anyway I hope that this was really helpful and helped answer some questions I have no problem dying by feel you don't need to do strict calculations to get beautiful results it's totally okay to go with the flow and just have fun but it's just when you want something more reproducible kitchen skills aren't that expensive and it's worth getting one one another thing the accuracy of your kitchen scale is something also to consider with this there's no question there can be some variability there and I know this particular scale has trouble when you're adding little amounts that are less than say point 2 grams sometimes in like itty-bitty increments sometimes those don't necessarily register right away it's important to keep that in mind and so if you're dealing with really low weights that you want to measure take that into account when you go and purchase a scale I am Rebecca from cabinets and if you found this video helpful make sure you subscribe to the convent's tutorials YouTube channel and give the video a like I released two new yarn dyeing videos every week on Tuesday and Friday mornings at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and you really don't want to miss any of the fun so make sure that you also turn on notifications if you have a lot more dyeing questions you should go and check out the cabinets lab Facebook group we have a huge community of dyers and other fiber artists starting from people who are starting out and dulling their first skeins to people who have shops and businesses and so it's a great place for collaboration answering questions and talking about how to do different techniques you can find a link to it in the video description thank you so much for watching everyone", "n-yN4lyz1Ck": "acquainted with instant pot nearly two million people follow insta pot on the

done everything here for you to make your life much easier I want you to see food and as we go along you're also going to hear about some cooking times because when you're cooking under pressure you're cooking so much faster oh yeah now we talked a lot about mac and cheese because this got some is perfect food before you cheese everyone know that you cooked dry noodles in broth yes I did and you know what she what she did not do because we just lifted the lid on this we just released the pressure on this the the macaroni absorbs all the chicken broth so you do not strain any of that away knew those noodles are perfectly al dente they're all absorbed all that liquid yeah now you're adding in your I'm adding in visa users and Parmesan cheese and some butter and some mustard and you can actually change the recipe to whatever you want to put in yours this is sour cream a little sour cream yeah it's some richness and something right but here's what I love David is because I started with that chicken stock all those noodles in there because they were dry they're absorbing all of that much delicious chicken stock if you don't want to use chicken stock go ahead use vegetable stock or you can use water but don't forget you're not draining it so all of that flavor is going right into your new doll and look at how quickly that cheese melted that big knob of butter in there is gonna melt down as well adding the richness of this oh yeah if you wanted to stir this up and park the lid back on there the residual heat and the cooker will continue to melt that butter sure and keep the cheese nice and melty and gooey gooey and fantastic yeah but you know what's great about this recipe and it's included in them in the and the recipe booklet I believe isn't right no this one is actually on the instant pot but what I was gonna say is you can add other ingredients to this if you decide you wanted to add bacon to it or you wanted to add some kind of protein whether it be chicken or Lobster yes for sure I actually thought doing some bacon for you because I've done that at home I have to tell you this is the very first recipe I ever made in my instant pot it is unlike anything the way that chicken broth infuses into the world makes it crazy is it I've never ever done this before well you know other than the first time here in my Viva but I absolutely love that and David you can keep it warm for up to 24 hours it's nice isn't it actually good it's nicely done yeah this is fantastic and that cooked in how many minutes that was 6 minutes David high-pressure minutes on high pressure 300 gone in this presentation this is the instant pot I do want to give a quick look at the control panel okay I'm gonna move this out of the way all righty we're coming okay tight just to let you know there's one button presets on here and look at all that you can do here because they're all included there just give us a quick run-through so soup and broth again 15 preset

you 15 preset programs take a look at these cook times and give us just a quick rundown of the kind of time we're gonna see sure David okay I mean it's really absolutely incredible the amount of time you can save so if you're doing short ribs okay you're gonna cook in 1/4 the amount of time if you were doing a traditional oven it would be 90 to 150 minutes in your instant pot Viva it's 20 to 25 minutes a run per round roast 30 to 35 minutes per pound if you're doing it in a traditional oven 15 to 20 minutes per pound here so you're actually only doing it in half the time whole chicken and we have one down there 23 to 30 minutes per pound in your instant pot eight minutes per pound that's one-third the time and then your your boneless chicken breast David 20 to 30 minutes if you're doing it in your oven 5 to 8 minutes that's literally 1/4 the amount of time that it would take you to do it in a traditional stuff it is an unbelievable opportunity for you to enjoy all these great foods

thanksgiving it's a sweet potato that we pack in a orange here's the oranges we'll stuff them in that and then we'll put a marshmallow on the top we bake our sweet potato and when you get it baked you just peel it i baked them i've already baked them so you wouldn't have to wait on that and uh if there's any dark places in it you need to take that out they have to bake about about 45 minutes on a 425 degree oven and what i would do is not get a great big potato and get all of them uh about the same size so they'll bake they'll be done at the same time so i use potatoes about that size and i'm gonna cut it this big chunks in this mixing bowl and we're gonna use the electric mixer to mix this stuff together the next thing we're gonna do is mix in a 14 ounce can of eagle brand milk everything good with eagle ran on it this is soft it's not melted but it'll be all right three tablespoons of melted butter two teaspoons of vanilla extract two teaspoons of orange zest now i like to use uh i have used all kind of zesting tools but this is one of the best ones i've used and i don't know where i got that i think down at the viking cooking school though when i went down there and it really works great i thought you might want to see that a fourth of a teaspoon of salt an eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg we have an eighth a teaspoon of allspice with a teaspoon of cinnamon and that's about all till we get this mixed up we have to make people when it's cleaner it's already cooked so there's nothing in here you really have to cook so you do warm it up we're just going to stir this so it's real creamy it's looking pretty good we have our potatoes now and we're going to just spoon a half a cup what we're going to do is put these back in the oven for about uh i think 20 minutes and then we take them out and we put marshmallows on top and you know marshmallows is great with sweet potatoes we're going to put these in the oven for 20 minutes on the 350 degrees we're going to put these back in the oven in a 350 degree oven they cook about another 15 minutes just enough the marshmallows melt okay we have uh finished our sweet potato orange cups it's good it's i hope you enjoy it i hope you cook it and enjoy as much as we do and i'll see you on our next family video thank you for watching you", "YFvS-xrc5w8": "old world style with a sleek modern twist these eight-ounce drinking

365 devotions we are currently on day 106 so because my page there has some chipboard pieces on the back today I'm going to put my image on with a piece of carbon paper and I'm going to be using this adorable sassy Cheryl stamp called always on my mind I did not reduce her in size that is the size she came when I opened the file I just printed her out on a piece of paper and then my title there says a hug from God because it's about the verse and when I read that you'll understand my font there the top one a and from is called Ariel and it's number 24 and then hug and God our dan kita and I did that in size 48 I printed that on some clear sticker paper and I'll put a link to everything I used down in the description box in case you would like to pick something up but here I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna put well I put a piece of carbon paper back there but I'd already used it too much so I'm just gonna replace my carbon paper and then I'm going to trace around my image Joy's want to make sure to check it after you've done a couple of lines to make sure it's actually working and I did that there to make sure that it was going onto the page so I'm going to trace my whole girl on to my page and then I'm going to use my micron 0 1 black pen to trace her on permanently and I always check it periodically to make sure that it's actually going onto the page before I get finished there's nothing more discouraging than tracing the whole thing on there and then when you're done it's not there so make sure to check it every once in a while to make sure that you're getting all the lines here one also a few of the things like she's wearing socks here I decided that was going to be too much detail so I just left it off you can do exactly the same thing you can put things on or take things off of the images that you don't like like here I went around the whole paper and everything like that but I didn't put like the detail at the top of the pencil and I did not put any of those ground marks on to my page so it's totally up to you what you want to do but there it is and then I'm going to take my pin and I'm going to trace around that so today our verse is Joshua 1:8 it says this book of instruction must not depart from your mouth you are to meditate on it day and night so that you may care phileas irv everything written in it so then you will prosper and succeed in whatever you do and then let's go ahead and read today's story so today's story says I woke up in a funk maybe it was a gloomy weather or the fitful night's sleep in a humid room have you ever been in a funk for no apparent reason when I get in a funk I am unproductive my brain feels thick I wander aimlessly from task to task never quite landing on what it is I need to do I'm emotionally vague not bad not good just directionless I unload the dishwasher check email and threw in a load of laundry finally I paused I knew something had to change and it needed to be me I needed to get rid of the junk so I pulled out my Bible ask God to talk to me read one verse and wrote it down word for word as I continued this routine I've practiced countless times in the past I felt my heart shift I felt my burden lighten my perspective change hearing God speak to me through his words in the Bible feels like a giant hug from God that's where I got the title and all it took was ten minutes tops God's Word does that this isn't just true for me it's true for all of us God promises that we'll find him when we seek Him with all of our heart here's what I found effective for me that can work for you too one open your Bible to ask God to speak to your heart as he read his word 3 read a passage of scripture for pick a verse or two that Rahsaan any Rahsaan eats with you and write it down word-for-word 5 ask what does this verse teach me about God about myself about my circumstances six ask is there anything God wants me to know to feel or to do reading the Bible and allowing it to transform your life is this simple and here's the best part you don't have to wait until you're in a funk to do it so our moment to breathe today says open your Bible and read a Psalms or start in Genesis or if you're new to the Bible read John when we're in the word spending time with God is like the best hug ever I promise don't you just love that story I don't know about you but I've definitely been in a funk sometimes so I'm gonna try this out next time I'm in a funk and see if maybe God will speak to me and make me feel feel better we'll see how that works I'm gonna trust that he will definitely make me feel better and I guess maybe just getting outside of your comfort zone or out of your zone that you're in and doing something new can help you translate or trance transfer to some other mood in general so that's gonna be my hope for that I haven't tried it but I'm willing to give it a try so my girl there I am painting with watercolors and I did just on my page after with some clear gesso after I trace the girl on there that pin is waterproof so you don't have to worry about it bleeding or messing up after when you put the gesso on I always wait til unfinished and then I put the gesso on after that so I don't have to worry about the lines and my paint set there is a prima complexion set I really love this set because it's lock got lots of Browns and stuff for complexions which is why they named it that I'm assuming and now I'm going through my pile of inks trying to decide what colors I want to use and I really like this illustrated faith watercolor set it's got lots of bright colors that are very useful I use it all the time so I'm going to go ahead and do that and I found that when I paint my pages when they have gesso on there if after I rinse my brush I kind of dab it on to the paper towel so it's not it's not loaded with water it's damp but it's not loaded with water and then pick the paint up off the pallet it tends to work a little bit better it doesn't run completely fill the page up or the little berry own coloring it just kind of goes in that little spot and stays where I want it to day so that's my little hint our tip for you today is to unload your brush with water keep it damp but just enough water on there to kind of spread it around a little bit and keep it thicker that tends to work a little bit better for me with the gesso and then I've decided I forgot to paint or paint her hair right there so I went and grabbed my complexions palette back out and I'm painting I painted her hair and then we're gonna finish this all up by painting the pencil and I went back in after I paint a few of the things and I just add a second coat of the color like the pink there just to make it a little bit darker so it looks like there's a shadow there gives it a little bit of dimension that kind of works for me but I'm gonna go ahead and finish coloring her up and I didn't really the red here doesn't seem that red when I painted it on so I had to give it another coat I made sure to get my pin my paintbrush pretty saturated with the color and then it worked out just fine but also if you made a little mistake like I did there I went out of the lines I just used a little bit of water and I brushed it on there and then I just dabbed it up with my paper towel to suck the ink back up and it worked out perfectly it's completely gone and here I decided my page needed some color so I what I did is I put a little bit of white paint down first and then I went over it with number I think it's number 91 I don't have the paints with me that the little gold color right next to it just to give it a little bit of shine so that it will look like it's not so flat then I decided she should be outside enjoying the grass and you know doodling to Jesus so grass went on and of course no page wouldn't be complete unless I did some splatter so of course we're gonna have to do that I find it easiest here if I just plop my paper towel on top of my girl I don't have to worry about splattering her and I also find that if you tap your paintbrush against another paintbrush it tends to make smaller plus Potter's for me and I made a bunch of little bitty spotters by accidentally I hit the paintbrush but it slipped off so it made a bunch of really cool smallish splatter so I really like that's I'm going to try that some more in the future so I'm going to finish my page off by putting my title up there and this is on clear sticker paper so make sure when you put it down it's where you want it and because once you press it down you are not getting that back up so be careful then I'm gonna finish my page with a little bit of journaling and my date and then I'm gonna call it good for my for my Bible journaling

was a great dessert choice it's so easy to make one stick of butter that's eight tablespoons of butter in a oven safe dish we're gonna put that in the oven to melt the butter while that's melting we're gonna get a mixing bowl and add one cup of all-purpose flour or you could use self-rising flour but I'm using regular all-purpose flour and so now we want to add some sugar I've got a 1/3 cup measuring cup and I'm gonna put two scoops in so that's 2/3 a cup of sugar and if you like yours really sweet then just add a whole cup of sugar instead of 2/3 anyway we'll put that in and we're going to add one and a half teaspoons of baking powder because this is regular all-purpose flour and then also 1/8 teaspoon of salt and we're gonna go now and stir that up just really simple get those ingredients combined just like that and then to 1 cup of milk I'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and then pour it in the flour mixture simple huh very easy dessert and then stir this up get it nice and combined like that it's a nice thin batter see all right now we're gonna go ahead and open this can of blueberry pie filling blueberry pie filling it's 21 ounces let's check and see if that butter is melted yeah it looks about right so we're gonna bring that dish out and be very careful because it is just extremely hot and now it's time to pour the batter in and do it right in the middle just pour that all in scrape that out just like that very very easy and now it's time to add the blueberry pie filling and just get a spoon and distribute it out in the dish I'll speed this up it's a lot of filling no it's so good if you like blueberries so we'll get that all spread out and you don't want to stir it or anything like that just put it in and then we're gonna put it in this preheated oven 350 degrees for about 50 minutes and then it's ready just like that and that is bubbling hot so we'll let that cool off a little bit before we give it a taste mmm all right there you have it some beautiful blueberry cobbler look at that we'll just dish this up it's still pretty hot I could have waited a little longer but I wanted to give it a taste one more spoonful that looks about right hmm wonderful okay now for the taste test oh that's so good very delicious blueberry cobbler so simple to make well I hope you give this a try thanks for watching we'll see you next time bye now [Music]", "A_vuoJtr71k": "hi everybody its Daphne from scrap and create and I know it's been a long time since I've been been online I've been kind of busy with a couple of things got a little bit of construction going on at my house so it's been very difficult to try to get any videos done with all the noise and dust and just chaos in general but I'm back to continue working on the graphic 45 eight and a half by eight and a half mini album featuring the dream line collection and in the last video I put together the two inside liners and today we're gonna start working on page one so I hope I have most everything cut out so it'll go pretty quickly so we're gonna start with a pocket page which I pre assembled as part of just the base album build tutorial so I'm not going to go over how to cover this but if you go to the playlist the base album build is part of the collection of this playlist for Dreamlands so with that I'm gonna go ahead and sit down and we're gonna get started and gosh I have to say I feel a little nervous it's been so long since I've done a video I feel very out of practice so hopefully this will go well and and you guys don't have something to work with here pretty soon and I'm hoping I also got in here with everything I need and it looks like it so so what are we doing on page one so page one and you've seen this in other albums that I've done before we're gonna have two flats a left and a right flap so I'm just setting aside all the designer paper so we can see the actual base page so excusing that aside so we have our our 8 by 8 pocket page we're gonna have a left and right flap and then on the very top of those flaps we're gonna have a pocket and inside the pocket we are going to use one or graphic 45s large tags now the large tag is a little too long for the 8x8 album so I'm going to be trimming these down a little bit I'll cover that when I get to it but I noted that the the rectangular regular tags too short and this one was too long so I'm choosing to use the long one and trim it down a little alright so with that let's go ahead and get started by putting down by first putting down the left and right flaps and of course I didn't get the tape on so I knew there would be something and where's my turret is I also wanted to share with everybody that we do have these in stock and I think I mentioned it in the last video this is a tape chair tool so I had previously used something that was called an omni grid which is used predominantly I think either in quilt-making or certainly in in the fabric space in general and it had a lot of gridlines on it and to me it was just a little too hard to look at so with a friend of mine Martha Jackson she came up with this little template or I provided a template and she actually created this for me with on one of her machines that cuts a laser machine that cuts through acrylic so what you see here are two lines so there's the edge and then the first line is 1/8 inch mark and the second line is 1/4 inch mark so I use those as reference just as I'm moving through the album just to make sure things aren't drifting up or down but then what I mostly use this for is to tear my tape so enough of that let me show you how I use it and like I said these are available in our shop and it comes with the pop socket and the base and it was actually a tool that I developed kind of out of necessity and used that Omni grid just because that's what I had and then put what I consider to be a handle on top so I'm liking this a little better of course if you have the Omni grid I mean by all means continue to use it but it was just difficult for me there was just too many grid lines on it in general it was just very hard to pick a line and then try to stay on it so I think the solid line a solid simple line with just a couple reference lines works better for me and those are really the only two measurements I used on the omni grid oops anyway sorry for all the racket so I just simplified it and it's for sale in our shop and I'm not going to tell you the price because I'm afraid my partner might change the price and I'm not even sure what it is right now but I can't tell you it's cheaper than buying the Omni grid we made it more affordable than if you were gonna buy the Omni grid which by the way isn't a very inexpensive piece of acrylic it's kind of expensive for what you get and it doesn't come with a pop socket and I should have drank that this first so I'm gonna go ahead and flip it over and make sure yeah it looks good make sure that it's gonna fit on the page so the pocket is here so I'm applying it to the left so the spine side and the outside pocket space and I'm just going as close to the edge as possible squaring off the page itself okay so that's one put the second one in and then we'll actually get to start laying down some designer paper I'm excited so I've been very anxious to get on camera again but there's just been too much noise and I'm having my son's bathroom redone and between the noise and the what feels like constant interruption I just couldn't get anything done so I was just dry kidding to make sure it's the same height and it's not gonna hang over and it looks good oops that didn't grab all right there we go okay so now we have these two vases in so the next thing I want to do is apply these two pockets to the outside here and I'm just doing them side by side to make sure there's no interference and it looks good I need to get some tape on here so I also want to give you a heads-up that it is an airshow weekend here in San Diego so but I may get drowned out a couple of times I'm actually right in the flight path I live very close to the base Miramar just a couple miles away and when they're looping around to come back over the air base they actually come right over my house so you may hear some of that and it'll be unmistakable it'll be quite loud if they come over on Sunday I'm not sure but they have been doing it for the last couple of days so just heads up on the noise or the possible noise there goes a cloud taking up my son so I'm gonna add a little artificial light here there we go not the best I prefer natural light but I'm so far behind I just I'm happy to be sitting down working at all so hey I also want to let you guys know I'm back to my jibber-jabber self apparently YouTube just came out with this new feature which is way way overdue in my opinion as a content creator I think most people like myself do their best to try to stay on top of comments I always want to respond to you guys for a couple reasons one if you have a question I don't want to out there and - oops I think we want that to happen and - sometimes you'll tell me or give me tips that I'm not familiar with so I want to take advantage of that so anyways back to YouTube YouTube just delivered and it's still in test right now this new feature that allows me to go look at all the comments that you guys have provided and narrow it down to the ones that I have not responded to which up until now I've not been able to do so if I miss something and a couple of weeks goes by it's buried so low that it's hard for me to find anyway so I just they just released this feature limited and fortunately I can see it so some of you may be wondering why am i responding to such old comments and that is why because I am going through and I'm making sure that I read every comment that was ever put out there and if I somehow had missed it I'm responding to it now so I'm just giving you a heads up I know it's old some of the questions I'm sure I've already answered or that you've moved on but that's that's why you're finding these comments or responses for me that are two three four six eight months old because I've missed things and I'm trying to go clean that up so when I go look at comments that I have not responded to they're relevant and new and I'm up to date so just a heads up I've been working on that for the last two days and it looks like I might be working on it for a little while longer because there are quite a few but my goal is to get to all of them and you there's no need for you to respond I just want you to know that I've gotten the comment and that I see it so the other reason it's important for me to do that is the last reason I guess is YouTube has lots of algorithms that will help me get my word out and get me on other people's radar in terms of possible videos or recommendations and one of the things that they consider when determining you know how to make recommendations is you know what the popularity of your channel is and whether or not you're actively responding to your your audience and so that's the other reason of why I want to be up to date because I want to be responding to my audience and I want to get the benefit from that so just FYI that's what's going on if you see something come across that you you know what I didn't do a very good job making that even so I'm gonna have to come back and trim that piece out or am i hmm it's pretty close so I'm gonna let you guys see so if you look very closely these two don't come across straight but it's so close I think I'm gonna go ahead and leave it but those are the kind of things that kind of bother me if I wasn't so far behind schedule I think I might actually undo this and redo it but but I am woefully behind schedule okay so here's what I have planned and I just realized this this is what happens when I don't record for a while I completely lose my mojo and forget how I did this so I'm gonna back up right now and tell you the two flap sizes so this is a left and a right flap and it's four and a half by eight four and a half by eight it's eight inches this way four and a half across the top and then you're gonna score a half-inch for the hinge itself so that is the measurements of the left and right flap so same measurement you're going to need two four and a half by eight score at half inch for the bottom I've wrote it two different ways four and three quarter by five or five and so it's kind of funny that I wrote it both ways but you're going I didn't write the score line so I really am out of it I have to retrain myself so let's see so four so it's five inches across and 4 and 3/4 length and you're going to score half-inch on three sides so again it's 5 inches across and you're going to score a half inch on either side of that 5 inches so when you're done you've got a four inch here and then this is four and three quarters you're gonna score half-inch and you should have a finished panel of four and a quarter by four so four and a quarter by four when you're finished and that's what these two things are for and I apologize for not covering that before I started moving our head to put down the designer paper and I'll try to be mindful of that moving forward okay so here's the picture that I chose um and I have to think about this but I'm pretty sure I'm pretty darn sure that this is from the twelve by twelve collection pack and when I go through the walkthrough I'll verify that but I'm pretty sure this is from the twelve by twelve pretty sure it's from the twelve by twelve pack but like I said I'll verify that and I'll try to cover that all this was fresh in my mind week and a half ago when I started this when I'm going through the construction process moving forward when I'm working with the graphic 45 and I'm using a twelve by twelve collection pack and an eight by eight I'll try to tell you as I'm laying the designer paper down which one of the pads it came from of course you can always substitute but I'll at least tell you what I'm doing so you can be cutting from the same pack I'm just gonna give it here we go this will help me see my edges a little more clearly all right there we go there's one piece so the other piece is gonna go here and I think I'm actually going to leave this like so so I can actually make this line go straight across and you'll see what I mean in just a second oh and here's another reminder and I sent an email out to all our subscribers on our our shop page but I'm gonna let you guys youtubers know whether you buy from us or someone else stock up on your art glitter glue as soon as we get into the freezing temperatures or below 40 our glitter glue will won't ship their product and they won't warranty the product if we ship it so stock up before it cools down that's just a heads up and also I the this is the old format for the 4 ounce the 4 ounce now comes in a longer slumber slimmer bottle which is much easier in my opinion to handle so I'm really liking the new format I'm gonna use up what I have but I'm anxious to start using the new format which was one of the reasons why I really like the 2 ounce was because I just like the size of that bottle in my hand so if you didn't see what I was doing I was using this edge and pushed pushing it against the designer paper and then pushing this one up so that you get that nice consistent line it was especially important here because I pointed out that the pockets aren't exactly the same size so visually I'm going to make up for that by making sure these two designer sheets are exactly lined up so and you can do that with anything that has a sharp flat edge or of course you can use one of these okay so this is the cream cardstock there's always one sheet in the collection pack and most of the time I try to make use of it not always most of the time so that is what this is and I want this to be fairly simple and in a minute it'll be evident from right so I'm just double-checking to make sure they fit and that I can slide them slightly inside the pocket and I like that because when I go to put something in the pocket it won't get hung up on the edge of the hinge if whatever's on top is just slightly over that edge so once these are in I am gonna use these tags to go into the pocket that's why it's okay to have this be so simple okay excuse me okay all that looks good so another thing I want to point out is I always ink my edges and I use these powder puffs at ink ink pads which I really like they're called chalk ink I like them for a lot of reasons one of the reason I biggest reasons is it doesn't transfer onto me like many other inks that I've used in the past also you don't need a separate applicator you can actually just apply it from the pad that's attached to the container so that's just one less thing for me to keep track up but what I was going to point out is I've inked the edges of the designer paper but I did not ink the edges of the cream paper I'm just not a huge fan of inking everybody's different it's so that's personal preference but I kind of like the crispness of a solid piece of paper here so that's really entirely up to you but I just wanted to point it out alright I am ready to get some glue on you oh look I have a little arrow that's telling me which way oh and I was gonna put it in the wrong way I think sometimes I'll do that when the paper is you know not not quite square and this one was not quite square and I almost did the same thing so it actually fits better this way so no pattern to tell what direction it is so I just put that little cheap on the back okay oh I have some other exciting news so Janet is this Janet Mueller's a subscriber from Australia and I had exchanged some comments with her through YouTube and then she came on over to our Channel and I was so excited to find out that she he has family here in San Diego so she's here now yay hi Janet and Janet is gonna come to our retreat here in San Diego and that's exciting she's our first international customer for the retreat so that's kind of neat she actually was gonna head home but then was able to change her plan so she can stay in and play with us so I'm kind of excited about that so our retreats a really very small quite quaint we cap out of 25 people between the YouTube channel and the shop it keeps us so busy with shipping and customer service that it's harder to get away get more time to plan larger events or to even get away for that long it's it's usually kind of treacherous even to take that many days off from shipping but anyways they are fun but they are small and of course they sell out because they are so small but I was really thrilled that she was able to make it and I hope she has a good time with us she was very knowledgeable very nice she used to own her own [Music] scrapbooking store and also to classes so we have a lot in common which i think is pretty safe to say that's our whole community right okay that's in how's it looking guys looking good so I also started taking apart and looking at and shuffling through the life is a journey paper and I know it's not everybody's cup of tea but I'm loving it so I'm really anxious to get something going so I've started kind of getting my head wrapped around what to do with that paper so that's gonna come next and then after that it's gonna be a flip between either romantique la romantique which is another graphic 45 the DCE that just came out or maybe doing something with stamp area I'm not sure okay so as you can see this is too long for the pocket that I have here the book is eight and a half inches the pocket page is eight so I'm gonna need to turn something off this so I'm going to turn it over push it in get it flat and then I'm going to mark where I want to trim this and I want it to come down just a little bit below this white paper so I'll tell you how much I'm cutting off in just a second because I didn't measure it I just did what I showed you I turned it turn it upside down but I'll tell you it is I just took one and a half inches off so we're gonna test that and see how it looks and yes that's I like it so I wanted a little space up here and that's how that's turned out so I'm gonna do the same thing here only this time instead of measuring it off the pocket I'm just gonna measure it off the tag so now from tip to bottom it's about seven and a half inches it's actually slightly less than that so now I'm gonna need to trim these down because I use the die to cut these and that means these are too long as well so these need to be trimmed down just a little bit and I am going to use my pencil to mark it and trim it and then we'll cover these tags okay double check how does that look I think I should take a little bit more it's very cool very very cool okay all right now I need to ink this I didn't do that after I took it out of the dye and I think I got in here without it but this is the graphic forty five large tag dye and it comes with a large tag and the very small ATC tag die and then flower dies which I used also and if I had my corner rounder in here I'd probably round all these corners but I don't have it handy so I'm not gonna stop to go get it tomorrow my house will be full of contractors and noisy again so I need to get as much done today for you guys as I can and that might mean taking a couple short steps like not going and getting my corner rounder [Music] after all the noise I've had for the last two weeks it's kind of eerie it's so quiet now all right looks so pretty I haven't covered the back and I think I'm going to but I'm not gonna do that right now because there's still a few pieces that need to be cut and I don't know how much paper or which papers I have left yet so for now I'm going to just leave the back length which will be fine either way but I think I will come back and cover it with something once I know really where I'm at in terms of paper how much paper is left okay we'll need to trim this one as well so I'm gonna put lay this in get it set double check looks good well ink it and glue it get it down and then we're gonna open our doors and then figure out where to put our magnets and also lay in the designer paper and wrap up page one as a heads up page two is a waterfowl page I think I actually design page two and three to go together but I can't decide which way I want me to go if two is gonna be three or three is gonna be - I don't know I'm gonna lay them out we're gonna decide together no I got it I'm good I'm about ready for glue myself because it can tell it's getting thicker on me when I get down to the bottom of a 4-ounce it's it starts to get a little thick because it takes takes a while to go through a four ounce bottle all right let's see what else is going on guys I can't really think of a whole lot the weather's really beautiful here right now and I am excited about our retreat which is at the end of October so that's right around the corner and I don't usually do this but I'm gonna I mean I always do making takes for the retreat but I don't usually do a YouTube forum and I think this time I'm going to so I'm going to do a couple of small videos with cards that we're gonna use for the making of take there we go I have to I want to make sure it's not getting hung up on the there it is so this one is getting hung up on the hinge down here that's holding the pocket together so I just need to get it to good go on top of that that's why it's so much taller there we go there we go after I train it a few times it'll want to slide in the right place okay so let's get this on cuz it's drying out on me that is that is the front of page one I am going to put something on these grommets I just don't know what yet and this collection has been so popular I had to give up my charms and my ribbon to Julie to ship to a customer so as soon as we get some more stuff in and before I finish and do the walkthrough I'll come back and show you what I'm gonna do but I'm thinking of two ribbons with maybe a little charm dangling off each one I just think that's pretty ok here we are lots of space to work with so I think this is what I had planned I'm pretty sure yeah so this is what I used on the front here and then this is just the flip side and again this is 12 by 12 from the 12 by 12 so you could use either side here's what I'm planning to do as far as the flaps just two very simple flaps so we have that's one side and there's the flip side and I actually think I'm going to go with this and here's why I like this pattern better but I think I'd have a hard time putting a picture on it so I'm going to flip it over and then I won't have to struggle so much to put a picture of it so this is going to be the completion of page one once we get these down now pre inked everything I'm just gonna go through and dry fit make sure everything's looking good before I apply some glue yeah I think so let's just double check there is a cut list in the description so if you click or if you scroll let me back up maybe I had too much coffee just underneath the video box itself there is a description and there's usually just a little blurb about the shop and maybe a link to our website which is our shop then there it says show more if you click the show more and scroll down the first thing you're gonna see is material list what it took to make this album with some links to our shop and we hope you consider buying from us but it's not required great and then keep scrolling and you're gonna come to the cut list and the cut list will cover everything that's interactive about this album it does not cover the base album itself for the base album go back to the playlist find the base album tutorial and it will have all the build components for the pocket pages the covers the spine the hinge and all of that so what you're gonna find in terms of a cut list under this video is just the interactive pieces that are sitting on top of an eight and a half by eight and a half base album it's a little bit confusing I know but it really saves me a lot of time not having to rebuild the eight and a half by eight and a half generic book for every album for you guys so I appreciate your patience but go to the playlist and it should be an order you should have a walkthrough a base album build whatever size it is in this case it's eight and a half by eight and a half and then when it says tutorial one that's the tutorial that's adding the flaps and pockets and the designer pieces if you scroll down in the description of the tutorial one that's where you'll find these flap and pocket measurements thankfully all the tutorials are organized the same way so once you figure it out for one you've got it mastered for all and I encourage you to use the playlist and save yourself some time so you're not searching around for the videos they're all grouped together so there's usually four tutorials per album and they're all in one place for you to use so you can just go one video to the next and not have to go searching for you know tutorial two or two 4:03 they're right there so please do take advantage of that and the way to get to those playlists is from our channel page go to scrap and create and right underneath our banner there's a couple of menu options and one of them is playlist and click on that and every every project we've ever done has got a playlist with you know anywhere from three to six videos associated to it and the playlists are titled with a paper that's used so that should help you if you've got some paper and you're trying to figure out what to do with it of course you can use any one of our tutorials but if you have some that specific like a graphic collection look up that name and there's a good chance that it's been released in the last two years that we have a tutorial building a mini album with it and we also have stamp Rio - Ciao Bella as well and they're just all in order the way they're listed on there they're in order by the most recent one is the one gonna see first there's also a tips and had to double-check make sure I was putting flu on the right side there's a tips and tools tutorial and there's not much in there but one of the things that's in there is how to use an edge die in your albums which has been kind of popular but if you haven't seen it take a look it's really quick I think it's 15 minutes maybe less on how to use an edge die and how to get your designer paper to map perfectly on top of the edge die once it's turned out so hopefully that'll be a oh my gosh you guys I've been jabbering and I didn't put my magnets in how could you let me do that sorry about that too much jabbering okay I need to figure out how I'm gonna keep this closed dummy okay I'm gonna need two magnets and I have to figure out how to get them here so I'm probably gonna put a designer strip that splits this so that I can get a magnet behind it so as you can see you can always you can always figure out a way around it but it's best to keep your keep your mind on what you're doing in the first place do what I say not what I do sorry about that guys so hopefully you're not doing exactly what I'm doing and you're at least a few minutes behind me so you don't make the same mistake alright I'm gonna go ahead and stick these down because like I said I'm gonna put a decorator strip across to mask it so now I do want them because the strip is gonna cover it I want them in the same place so I'm gonna make a quick reference line maybe mm-hmm okay so I'm just gonna Center it it's eight inches so we're gonna break it up put a strip in at four inches on both sides dum-dum that's okay I think it'll actually look better with a strip across it instead of just a solid panel but but it's not like we have a choice anymore okay now I'm going to put the matching line on the other side I'm gonna hard time get my ruler flat there we go here we go okay put a magnet somewhere on that line and then we're gonna do the same thing on this side keep picking up the magnet okay yeah that looks good all right so we are looking good okay I'm just gonna put it toward the edge not too far out so that I'm worried about buckling cover my glute buckling the edge of whatever strip I put over it so I'm not gonna put it too far to the edge so maybe right about there so 2/3 2/3 across and if if you're a little bit behind me you don't have to do this at all you just put it under this panel right and I'm just using my reference line to Center and like I said I'll put a 1 inch or inch and a half strip over it when I'm finished it's not the right one here we go okay now we need to find where to locate these so thank goodness I caught it before that took hold silly me good night like I said I am just kind of lost it out of the groove okay okay I'm gonna cover all four of these with some tape to soften the edges um it also it's very helpful I'm just gonna put a big piece across here you know to glue doesn't want to dry on the metal so it it ensures that he's into whatever you put on top of it and that there's not a bubble over your magnet okay let's do over its to do what we're [Music] and then putting glue over the tape right now the tape is extremely tacky so if any part of this paper goes down upon the tape in the wrong spot you can't lift it it'll tear the paper so so I always if when I'm doing something like this I want to get glue on the tape so I've got a few minutes to torque it into place which I might eat or will probably need it sounds very crunchy because of a dry glue that'll get better a bit okay well there you go come along these straight edges out of the way now we need to find a strip to go over this so I am going to look first at some here's a little basket that I have that helps me stay organized so what I'm gonna look at first is whether or not I've got a scrap that I can use that will fit without you know having to cut into a big piece of paper so I'm gonna try a couple of different things where you guys are with me here and we will find something together so one of the options is this which is off the twelve by twelve and here's a larger piece of it actually this is the 8 by 8 so on the flip side of this paper there are these cut aparts and this one is actually you can see the difference so this is from the twelve by twelve and this is from the eight by eight and I like the twelve by twelve size better but I'm not sure I like it so I'm gonna keep looking and see if I like something better it's too busy so really I think because of this paper yellow or blue or is what I'm looking for oh here's an option to you yellow or blue is what I'm looking for and I think I like this one so now I'm gonna find another piece of it it's on the orange patterned paper so if I can't find another strip of that there it is so this is actually part of the this is from the 8x8 pad pad so it's one of those trips from the 8x8 pad that's what I'm going to use to cover this up so hang tight I'm gonna get this trimmed off and I'm trimming it right below the blue line okay so it was like this so you can see I've got the Stars just on this side so if you're gonna do the same thing or you may have already put it under the panel but if you did the same mistake this is the trim line where I'm cutting which is just below that dark blue with the blue with a gold stars so now we need to shorten it so that it fits on here with wise okay let's see how we did okay looks good I'm gonna get some ink on that so you can either put it down as is or you can put some black cardstock behind it and mat it which looks nice also setup so your other option to and is to just glue down the sides and have it be a belly band I I think I'm gonna glue it down completely just because I don't want anything slipping through here and catching on the magnet even though it's covered with with double-sided tape I'm worried that something might get hung up on it so I'm gonna go ahead and glue this down firmly trim this piece up first it's yes it does okay get some ink on this so before I put it down I'm actually going to put this trimmed off from the tag I'm just gonna set it behind it and it's lay it down here and look what it looks like matted I wouldn't use this piece but you can see how it kind of pops more than this in fact I like it so much I'm gonna stop here and go get some black paper so I can do that because I just think that makes it look so much better and I think it'll also soften the look of the magnet that's behind it so I'm gonna pause for a second go get some black paper I'll be right back okay I'm back so people often ask me and since I'm getting ready to do it I'll share with you what do you do with all your scraps well I I save them for either photo mats or scraps that I can use to back things like stickers and small strips so I I save almost everything some of it sometimes it gets out of hand I go through and I get rid of anything that's shorter than four inches and narrower than an inch but even oftentimes that is still large enough to use on a sticker if I want to stiffen the sticker up instead of just applying the sticker directly and one of the reasons I like to put stickers on black cardstock is I like to fussy cut around them because I like the look but the other reason is the stickers don't seem to want to stay down they want to peel back up I don't know what it is about that adhesive but it doesn't feel permanent so if you are gonna put stickers directly on your album I would recommend adding glue to it as well because it will peel up okay and because this is so small I am going to trim it by hand because it won't fit in my trimmer very well so I'm going to show you real quick so you can see I didn't really leave a black border on here and the reason is because I've trimmed it so that the black border is going to be exposed from this mat anyway and if I added another black border it would be inset so just FYI okay not very elegant it's just a box cutter but my exacto knife is sold up so dull I can't use it right now sure there you go I don't know what it is about is back tone nice but they don't seem to stay sharp as long as my box cutter also when my box cutter gets dull I take a fingernail file and sharpen the edge and a blade will last me years sorry I was trying to find my pick tool alright so I'm going to leave one down and then I'm going to get a straightedge to carry it across to get the other one in the same position and there's my one or my four-inch reference line and I'm gonna Center it on this but you could go up or down but I'm just gonna try to Center it there we go problem solved right there it is the other reason I wanted to trim the black level is I don't want that any of that to get into the hinge area so that's the other reason why it's a little bit shorter okay I might actually have enough left of the scrap I cut off mmm-hmm I do so that's perfect so I'll get this adhered and then I'll trim the other side okay get my straightedge and I just need to take a little sliver off this is always a little challenging especially if you're using a cork back because the cork doesn't go all the way to the edge so what I would recommend is you didn't using a flat edge that is totally flat I do not like using this particular ruler because the blade can cut into it but if I don't a paper underneath it could shift and I just had a panic attack that I forgot to turn the video on but it's running so yay alright we're almost I promise we're almost done with page one and what I usually do is number my pages and put the spine orientation on them when I get started and I didn't do that but I am gonna I am going to moving forward I didn't do it for page one but I am gonna mark page two and which side the spine is supposed to be on so that so I don't get anything in upside down okay I'm just gonna do a little housekeeping here and then we're gonna walk through what I did okay so this is the inside of page one and here's the closed position and like I said there's nothing on the back of the tags but I'll probably come back and put something on them once I finish the album and know what kind of scrubs I have left I am gonna put some ribbon here but I had to give up my ribbon because we were it was so popular we were actually running out of ribbon to give to the customers so I'm pretty happy with the way that turned out this is page one there's the pocket this will be the spine side so this is page two and when we come back we'll get started on page two but I'm gonna leave you with one more thing before I go and that is this is page two this is the spine so that when I come back and sit down I keep track of where the spine is where the pocket side is and what page number I'm on I'm gonna go ahead and number the rest of my pages as well but I'm done for now I'm gonna go get this uploaded and then I'll be back with page two", "bfXqG0YlF80": "welcome back friends i am meredith and today i'm going to be sharing two different dip recipes that are absolutely delicious and perfect for you to make for that really big uh what was it again that um really big concert that they do you know every year in the beginning of february and they put a sporting event at before and after it do you know what i'm talking about um but anyways i'm going to be sharing my aunt mary's really yummy enchilada dip as well as my mother-in-law's taco chip dip which should definitely be scooped and enjoyed with some doritos so stay tuned and i'll be sharing those with you they will be in the description box below in case you're interested in trying them for yourself and definitely let me know what it is that you guys uh make for that halftime show let's whip up a batch of enchilada dip so the first thing you're gonna need for this is eight ounces or one package of cream cheese i recommend that you have it softened a little bit in the microwave first just to make it easier to mix it up we are also going to add to this one can of mild fire roasted diced green chilies these are the market pantry brand they don't have to be fire roasted i just grabbed that and we're gonna actually use these undrained we're gonna put them all in there then we're also going to add one cup of shredded cheese the recipe calls for mexican style shredded cheese my cooking assistant is going to add one teaspoon of garlic powder and i'm gonna go ahead and add one quarter teaspoon of chili powder and now we're gonna go ahead and use a hand held blender to beat this all together and then we're gonna add our chicken now we're gonna add in some cooked and finely chopped chicken breasts right in there and i'm just going to stir that in now you could absolutely add a little bit more chicken if you want or this would be great to make a double batch if you are gonna have a gathering but it's just gonna be us tonight so we're just having it for a fun appetizer so voila it's as simple as that we are going to go ahead and pour this into our high plate and we're going to bake this at about 350 for 20 to 30 minutes and just when it comes out we're going to top it with a little bit more cheese now if you wanted to make this spicier you could do a not mild diced green chilies and you could certainly do pepper jack cheese instead of mexican style cheese for even more heat in there so we're just gonna smooth this out and we will put it in the oven again i will leave the recipe in the description box below in case you are interested in trying it out i just pulled the enchilada dip piping hot and bubbling out of the oven now we're going to add a half of a cup of additional cheese because you know cheese is the stuff of life it makes everything better right so we're literally just going to sprinkle a little bit of cheese on top and then all you have to do is wait 10 minutes and the cheese is going to melt beautifully right on top of this because obviously it's already hot out of the oven you certainly could put it under the broiler if you want to golden brown up the cheese a bit that would be delicious and if you're trying to do the low carb thing i think this would be great if you scooped a little bit onto those sweet mini peppers you know just like hollow them out and put a scoop of this in there that would be unbelievably good all right it is completely melted and looking absolutely delicious so i'm going to take my scoop of bell pepper here and let's try a bite one for you so good so good i hope you guys enjoy this one and again recipe is linked below so here is the recipe we are making in case you want to grab a quick screenshot i will definitely leave this linked in the description box below or i should say typed up in the description box below in case you are interested all right so for this recipe we need uh one package of cream cheese that is softened it'll make it so much easier to beat it so if you soften it on the counter or you can even stick in the microwave for you know 10 to 15 seconds to help soften it up a little quicker you can do that and then we're going to use one can of the jalapeno cheese dip and i like to make it in a large rubbermaid container so that i can store it that way and then people can scoop out what they want we're going to go ahead and use one can of nice and processed cheese dip tasty but you know full of horrible things i'm sure did you see that i landed on my arm a little on the messy side we're gonna go ahead and add one cup of sour cream and our cheese dip right to the container getting as much out of that as possible the sour cream just gives it a more scoopable consistency gave her processed orange cheese definitely not something we eat all the time but this would be great for like super bowl sunday or if you're watching a football game if that's your jam i don't watch football but you know if you do you could or let's be honest if you're just feeling like eating junk food all right so i'm going to go ahead and use my electric hand mixer to whip this all together and i'll be right back so once you have your cheese dip all mixed up and then smooth it out into a nice even layer you're going to top this with salsa i am using a mild salsa but you could absolutely use medium or hot if you like a little bit more spice i like the layer of salsa to be um not quite as thick as the dip the cheese dip on the bottom you could absolutely add a layer of guacamole to this if you want or refried beans but this is my mother-in-law's recipe so i'm just making it how she does and then you're going to of course top this with sharp cheddar cheese i'm going to go ahead and use the whole bag and we serve this up with doritos but you could do it with regular tortilla chips if you prefer just trying to get my nice even layer of cheese you could also do black olives if you normally eat those on your tacos and then the last thing we're going to add on top is shredded lettuce so this is an eight ounce bag of lettuce and i'm going to go ahead and i think probably use all of it so if you wanted to you could use romaine instead of iceberg but voila if you are going to make this ahead ahead of time i would just do the cheese dip layer and then add the salsa and the cheese and the lettuce later on so that is it guys that's all there is to it i'm just gonna let this uh refrigerate and chill until we are ready to enjoy it on junk food night don't forget to like subscribe and ring the bell i will leave the recipe in the description box like i said and i will be talking to you again soon guys bye-bye", "F_ReKoaEPus": "okay so this is a clearly a geometry question and you guys don't have a ton of experience with this type of question where it's a circle with intercepted arcs that's really what's happening but we have this weird quadrilateral shape in the middle of it and just to the naked eye you've probably seen some symmetry on the shape and they clearly identify that these little corners here are equal 20 degrees so there is definite symmetry happening there's a formula that I don't really know if they teach you in geometry anymore so I'll just go ahead and tell you hmm but they want to know what is the value for x so they want to know how big this angle is right here well it turns out that this angle it's gonna be the same size as this oh geez no supposed to be highlighted there this arc like proportional wise oh my gosh B golly that's terrible all right so there's another formula that I have to remind you of it and I know what they teach you about circles anymore and sorry I've been taught geometry a long time this angle right here the one that's on the other side of the circle directly across from this blue mark this guy is gonna be half the size of the blue one so basically if I want to call this X then this is gonna be half X so why is that important to us well this angle Plus this angle it's gonna be the same measure as this angle I keep messing up with my colors here so this angle right here is 40 degrees which means how big is this hello pen if 40 degrees is half of X how big is X so half of X is 40 degrees that means X is 80 very good the answer here is 80 that was a really tricky question if you really don't have knowledge of arcs of circles so if you experience that again on an SAT test and like I said the geometry is so sparse on the test that it's very unlikely that you're going to run into a question that uses those same arc theorems so I guess if you remembered about how the arcs are related to each other cool and if you hit a weird question when you're like me and I just don't know what this is that's okay you can make a guess and move on remember we there are gonna be some questions where you have to move on from oh gosh that's super tiny I can't read that so there's this chart about miss Simon's workday morning drive and it says that her car from oh okay blah blah blah so the table at the table scuse me is showing the distance and our average driving speed in miles per hour where there is no traffic delay for each segment of her drive so there's this uh like a multi-part question I think it goes for 37 okay the rest of the test is about this church fascinating stuff it says one morning with Simon drove directly from her home to her workplace in 24 minutes what was her average speed in miles per hour that morning so if you were running out of time at least you kind of know like common sense a way to guess about an average driving speed but there's quite a big range of like answers here so we do want to try to calculate this one if we add the time [Music] from her home to her workplace so she has to go from her home to the freeway entrance freeway entrance to the exit and then freeway exit to the workplace so she's got to do all of these right and this is her average driving speed with no traffic delay this is how many minutes and they want to know speed in miles per hour so what that tells me is we have to figure out how many miles she drove and divide it by how many hours it took her to drive there now we have a bit of a labeling problem because of the minutes thing we'll get to that in a second let's talk about miles it is a calculator test question so you can go ahead use your calculator if you want can you please tell me the total distance if you were to add up all those distances please and they are labeled in miles so that's good is it 17.4 okay cool so it's 17 point four miles and then normally I would say let's divide this by 24 minutes however 24 minutes is not ours is it so in order to convert that to a portion of an hour we would write it as 24 over sixty now I think that is let's see a nice decimal if you want to write it as a decimal you can if you don't want to write it as decimal just be careful that when you type this in your calculator you use parentheses around the 24 over 60 type that in your calculator and you should get is it forty three point five exactly cool all right so it says what was our average speed in miles per hour they don't say anything weird like how you're supposed to interpret the answer sometimes they'll say like round to the nearest whole mile per hour it's the paper that's on the front two people so you're welcome to do 43.5 because you have enough bubble spaces to do that just make sure your bubbling it in and then the decimal points up here so make sure you're getting that guy um the other and I looked at the answer key from their official website and they said they would also accept 43 or 44 because the directions were very vague they were willing to accept a child who rounded either up or down to 43 or 44 so good to know they'll accept all those answers this last question here is still referring to little miss Simon and her chart or table which I can't read this question though so tiny there we go oh that's a lot of words and of course it's the last question so if my Simon starts her drive at 6:30 a.m. so she can drive at an average driving speed with no traffic delay for each segment of the drive thank you I do that up so no traffic if she starts at 6:30 however she wants to sleep in she has to start at 7:00 the travel time from the freeway entrance to the freeway exit increases by 33% due to slower traffic but the travel time everywhere else is the same so this part right here is gonna increase 33% anyone know a quick way something you could multiply by that'll increase something by 33% what would I have to multiply this by that would take away 33% so if I want to add 33% to it one point three three so I'm gonna just jot that down as a note I don't really know if that's what my math is gonna look like in a second I have to keep reading the question okay oh now do you ever notice this in math whatever the underlined are bold something that usually means like they're trying to be nice but that means there's some sort of a catch to this question so how many more minutes does miss Simon take to drive to work place at seven versus at 6:30 so at some point in our math we're gonna have to figure out the difference between like which would it used to take her and then this additional amount of time okay um all right so they want the whole trip right yeah can you guys do me a favor ooh you know what I just thought of something let's do let's work since all I want to know is the difference in time because of this extended traffic issue let's just figure out how much extra time it's gonna take us on that middle part of the trip and not worry about the rest of the trip okay so let's just talk about this this part right here so fifteen point four miles they give you miles per hour what do you have to do with this miles per hour because we're not gonna multiply miles by miles per hour that doesn't make any sense we're gonna divide it aren't we miles divided by speed would give you time so on your calculator real quick and you guys calculate that for me it's probably a weird decimal that's okay cuz I'm gonna rival it to me I didn't write that one down I did all my work in one step like a silly person one more time point 308 yeah and that's ours now remember they want to know how many more minutes but we haven't actually increased anything yet so be careful guys I have to convert it to ours would have to multiply back hmm this is our I'm sorry I have to convert it to minutes excuse me hahaha what you don't know what I saying what I'm saying okay how do I convert it to minutes multiply by 60 okay what is this all right cool so that's how many minutes this trip normally would take her now be careful I kind of misspoke earlier James and I kind of poo-pooed your answer even though I still don't like it but I don't think I like my answer either so I said x 1.33 if I did that what I'd be getting is her new time for that segment of the drive but I don't think that's what they wanted they wanted just the difference in minutes right so how many additional minutes is she gonna be driving for so let's take this answer that we have right now and multiply it by 33% and this is how many additional minutes that she has to drive for and it's like 6.0 something and it does say look at the problem here round your answer to the nearest minute so we're gonna round that down to six it was a fun question now when I originally did this question and I was tired or something I figured out a whole lot of stuff about her driving trip that I really didn't need like I figured out the whole shebang to and from one minute additional minutes and one without and then I eventually subtracted him still got the right answer but it took me like a long time so that probably wasn't the best way to do the question but like we said guys this is the very last question on the test so if you got to the end I know we're not done with our test but if we got to the end of the section and we're like wow this looks like a tricky question and I don't think I have time to sit through this question right now it's okay making a guess I'm moving on I will warn you though because it's rooted response the likelihood of you just magically picking six as an answer I mean not totally out of the realm of capabilities for you but I mean maybe it is your favorite number mine 7 I would have been close oh okay so that's the end of the test but but this isn't the end of the test for us because remember we started with girded response now we got to go off but this is part of the reason why I like doing the test this way besides like the obvious logic of not being able to guess Unger to response now that we're coming back to number one I have a little like sigh of relief I'm like oh thank goodness number one this can't be that bad right and it's not gonna be bad remember there's some easy stuff here at the beginning so you do get to use a calculator and the remainder of the test keep that in mind number 1 gives us this weird little line plaque thing according to the line graph between which two consecutive years was the greatest change in the number of 3d movies released so this is just graph interpretation and greatest change we're looking for something with the biggest slope you see it find the right part of the test huh oh you were here for our exploration you start with gridded response always on a section and then you come back to the multiple-choice in case you run out of time because we won't be able to guess on gridded response okay so back to number 1 between which two years is it the biggest slope biggest growth 2010 to 2011 yes the answers deep so you guys are all shy on a Tuesday morning and not shouting things out to me but I have a pretty good feeling that when you looked at that you had the answer like within 10 seconds so remember we talked about how there's gonna be quite a few questions where they take that long so don't panic when you find yourself spending two minutes on a question that's really difficult because there's gonna be just you know a few questions coming up where you spend ten seconds alright number two and remember guys on this test I know I do a lot of blabbing but you get a lot of time fifty-five minutes is a lot of time to do thirty-eight math questions it's significantly more time that they used to give on the AC t-test the AC t-test is essentially a minute a question and this has quite a few more seconds per question if you want to think of it that way all right number two we have X and f of X now don't forget f of X is just a very fancy way of saying y so you have an XY T table and this is a linear function which of the following defines f of X so they just want to know which one of these functions would work for these ordered pairs there's several ways you guys can figure this out I noticed that every single one of these has a different slope so for me what I would do is I just quickly find slope who remembers how to find slope we did we know it's changed and why ever changed it whoops change in X its rise over run so I'm gonna pick my two favorite points these are them cuz they're there and then y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 so that would be 8 over 2 better known as 4 so which one of these lines has a slope of 4 boom the answer is C now the other way to do this question this is the way a lot of kids do it is they just start taking the first ordered pair x equals 1 and y equals 5 and they start plugging it into like each of the options the problem with that and you have to be careful is sometimes the point 1 5 will work for more than one of the answers so you have to make sure you test them all before you commit to an answer and sometimes you have to test another point as well so just be careful all right to make a bakery single a signature so you can make chocolate muffin a baker needs ok anytime there's a baking question or a recipe question its it's a proportion every single time so this is gonna be a proportion question sorry 2.5 ounces of chocolate how many pounds of chocolate are needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins I don't know alright 2.5 ounces makes one muffin so how many ounces to make 48 muffins that would be a good place to start this question so what is 2.5 times 48 one-twenty now what do we have here what label is on 120 yeah once's notice 120 is totally an answer was nasty cuz there's 120 the answer no they want the answer in pounds notice how the underline the word pounds that was a favor to you you're supposed to pay careful attention to anything they underline or bolt so in order to convert ounces to pounds you just divide it by 16 is the easiest way to do it but you can also set up another proportion where you say like hundred 20 ounces over X pounds equals 16 ounces over 1 pound so what you get 7.5 very good or if you're a super baker you already knew that answer no don't even follow recipes throw stuff together hope for the best oh this question I love cuz kids are really freaked out by it and I don't know why they want the value of C + D which seems like a very random and weird thing for them to ask but look at the equation over here all you need to do is isolate that so what do you do divide by 3 and then the dyslexic and me goes oh that was me what they did they put 3/5 as the first thing it's their choice it's like they're getting me it's like they know I'm taking this test the answer is B C plus D is 5/3 all right number 6 I know I'm going a little out order I'm just going through whatever is on my screen hmm an online bookstore sells novels and magazines each novel sells for $4 in each magazine for $1 say D purchase a total of 11 novels and and magazines for a combined selling price of $20 how many novels did she purchase so the first thing I'm gonna do because I know I screw this up a lot I'm gonna underline or highlight somehow novels because I need to make sure that when I give my answer I'm talking about the novels and not the magazines because there are two unknown things in this problem the number of novels and the number of magazines we'd need to set up a system of equations and I know this seems like overkill because I me were like I don't need to tell you what x and y are I disagree let's X what would you like X to be I don't hear number of novels okay so that leaves Y to be the number of magazines so a little reminder that we're trying to find the number of novels at the end of this question keep that in mind so the first clue is all about money and it says uh novel sells for four dollars a magazine sells for one dollar and then later on it says they they sold a total of twenty bucks so that's our first equation four times every novel plus one x times every magazine is 20 bucks and then there's one more clue snuck in here and it's a total of eleven things not eleven novels but eleven novels and magazines together so that means the number of magazines and novels added together is eleven things so keep your eye on the prize guys I would like you to solve for X remember that was what we're trying to find so don't knock out the x's let's use elimination except in order to eliminate it wouldn't we have to do that now I am trying to save a little bit of time so if you feel comfortable doing this you don't have to rewrite the system like we normally do in algebra 4x minus 1 X is 3x these are gonna knock out and then 20 minus 11 would be 9 so after you divide both sides by 3 you found x equals 3 which is the number of novels which is what I wanted the answer is B a lot of kids try to do that question by the good-old plug and chug method so they like go through the answers and they're like let's pretend that there were two novels and then they go back and figure out how many magazines there were and then they go plug it into the money clue and try to figure it out and that does work I'm not saying it doesn't work it's just not always efficient and it also leaves you with this grand feeling of I hate to say it but failure a lot of kids take this test and they feel like if they didn't do it in the quote right way they don't have a good feeling about themselves when they leave that question but if you were to set up a system of equations and then you have this weird like confidence boost like yes I was totally supposed to do that we talked this about this before where I can't really tell you exactly what's on your SAT test but I can tell you certain concepts that will show up multiple times in fact systems of equations is one of those in this particular test that we've been working through i've already seen three systems occasions they're not all traditional this is a story problem one was real basic algebra and the other one was like a quadratic one but they're all systems of equations so we by the way we've used substitution twice an elimination once the other one that we did with substitution I could have also done by graphing if I knew how to graph by hand because that question was on the no calculator part okay oh it's a word problem but it's okay we got this cuz I've totally been to Venus so I know exactly how much we all way on Venus no that's not true with the weight of an object on Venus is approximately nine-tenths of the weight on earth cool good to know the weight of an object on jupiter is 23 tenths the weight on earth so you're lighter on Venus you're heavier on Jupiter cool if an object weighs a hundred pounds on earth how many oh I hate when they do this how many more pounds does it weigh on Jupiter than on Venus so I think the safest way to do this question is to figure out your weight on Jupiter figure out your weight on Venus and then just subtract them but don't forget to subtract them because I have a feeling your other answers you get show up somewhere else here so be careful all right turn it pages okay all right Venus okay you are a hundred pounds on earth but on Venus you're nine-tenths of that so how much do you weigh on Venus ninety right okay on Jupiter here a hundred pounds on earth but you're gonna be heavier on Jupiter twenty three tenths so that's what two thirty now ah sneaky look what they did 90 and two thirty or options this is how they catch kids right you do your math and you look over the answers and you're like oh look good answer that I have not done because the question was how many more pounds do you weigh on Jupiter versus Venus so now I need you to subtract these that's how we're gonna get one forty there's other ways to do that question guys and that thing that was the only way I just found that to be the simplest way so I think the moral of the story today that we've learned is there often it often going to ask you questions where it's things like how many more or what is the difference between so whenever that shows up in my question I'm gonna like circle highlight underlying the heck out of it because it's very likely they're gonna try to trick me on my answer choices and if I forget to find the difference on that question my other answer is probably gonna be sitting there too it's not all sunshine and roses roses on your SAT test guys I hate to break it to you all right number seven the downtown business association in a certain city plans to increase membership by a total of n businesses per year there were B businesses in the DB a at the beginning of this year which functioned best models the total number of businesses Y that they plan to have X years from now all right we have linear linear exponential exponential so I guess the fact is we need to figure out whether this is a linear growth or an exponential growth so they want to increase by a total of n businesses per year you would use an exponential function if they said things like you're going to double it it's going to grow it's going to increase exponentially you're gonna triple it than any of those words show up in this problem no so we're just increasing by n businesses per year that's fancy talk for you have a linear growth so it's one of these not these so would it I guess the difference now between these two options is what it makes sense to start with a plus B or starting with a negative B and you might want to go back to what be represented to begin with there were B businesses at the beginning of the year remember your y-intercept of a linear function is your starting point so did you start with B or did you start with negative B that's weird we started with B it said right away that we were at the beginning of the year we started with B businesses that's the quote starting point of your linear function so that was really just a matter of is it linear exponential and then it was pretty obvious after that so that's goodness number 9 in the 1908 Olympic Games the Olympic marathon was lengthened from 40 kilometers - approximately 42 kilometers of the following which is the closest to the increase in miles now they're not gonna try to trick you on this one so it's alright they don't just want you to convert two miles or anything it's the difference right so what is the difference in kilometres let's just start there - so you need to figure out how many miles that is and I think some of you might know that off the top of your head I'm not one of those people but luckily they told me the conversion rate here so two kilometers is X number of miles and right here it says one point six kilometers is one mile so if I were to solve this proportion I would take two times one which is two and then I'm gonna have to divide it by one point six bless you so is that come out to one point two five cool very cool and oh you don't mean get it done it should be an easy question for us in theory so I'm gonna show you what it looks like to kind of partially do a question and this question actually is a little misleading because it looks really easy at first track low subtraction but this first factor of this binomial squared is usually where kids make a mistake what does what has to happen when you have a binomial squared like this you would have to distribute and foil it like it's not as simple as like square this and square that and be done it's like 1.5 X minus 2 point 4 times another 1.5 X minus 2 point 4 now I'm actually not gonna go through and do this whole problem and this is what makes kids uncomfortable because they're like they think like the math teacher is gonna be inherently mad about this like okay a your math teachers never gonna see your work on your SAT so I don't really care how you get the answer except for cheating don't do that but let's talk about the quote let's start with like the first terms for instance 1.5 x times another 1.5 X you have a calculator please use it what is that 2.25 and x squared right now later on in the question remember we're subtracting this so you're gonna also subtract a 5.2 x squared from that go ahead and collect those like terms for me so I can at least eliminate two of the choices real quick what is it I'm sorry negative two point nine five okay so my lead quadratic term is negative two point nine five so you're gone and you're gone so it's one of these two the only difference between these two problems these two answers the back coefficient this one has a positive twelve point one six and this one has a positive point six four your job is to figure out what's that back coefficient so guys remember I'm only gonna partially do this question can you figure out your coefficient from the spoiling problem for me two point four times two point four I'm sorry what five point seven six and then remember you're subtracting and this is my algebra two kids keep getting wrong makes me sad you're subtracting a negative six point four so what are you really doing there you're adding a six point four so you're back coefficient is clearly not that so the answer is C now notice I didn't actually finish the question does it matter not really because I eliminated the other choices that's a little risky because I'm pretty proud of mistakes so maybe if it was my really SAT I wouldn't do that but it is a way to save time okay partially doing the question all right after school today we're gonna continue on that and I'll post the video if you can't make it", "aGVuObJih14": "Shot sizes are one of most confusing aspects\nof the shotgun world. For newcomers, all those arbitrary letters and numbers are an utter\nmystery; and even many experienced shooters can\u2019t keep track of all the different sizes,\ntheir diameters, and how they\u2019re organized. And every shot size chart or table I\u2019ve\ncome across is incomplete in one way or another. So I figured I\u2019d kick off this new video\nseries with an exhaustive, two-part video guide that covers all of the American shot\nsizes, common and uncommon. I\u2019ll explain the various formulas and naming conventions,\nand touch briefly on what the different sizes are used for.\nI\u2019ll explain some basics and try to keep things easy for newcomers to follow, but even\nexperienced shooters should be able to learn something new here.\nNow, the American shot size system isn\u2019t the only one in the world, but trying to include\nothers in the same video would just be confusing - especially with birdshot, where the same\nnumbers and letters refer to different diameters in different systems.\nA majority of my viewers live in areas that predominately use American shot sizes, so\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover first. Other shot size systems will get their own videos later\non. I\u2019ll get to specific sizes shortly, but\nfirst, some definitions and background: For the purposes of this video, shot refers\nto spherical projectiles fired two or more at a time from a firearm. Shot size is either\nthe nominal diameter of the pellets, or the standardized name representing that diameter.\nNon-spherical shot exists, but I\u2019ve never come across a standard size system for those\nprojectiles, and they only show up in a handful of novelty or specialty shotshells anyway.\nShot can be made from a variety of materials, but I won\u2019t get into that much in this video\nbecause standard shot sizes are the same for all materials. Despite some misleading charts,\nthere aren\u2019t separate size systems for lead and steel shot.\nAs used in firearms, shot can be separated into two major varieties: smaller birdshot,\nand larger buckshot. Both are round pellets fired manifoldly, but they can be distinguished\nby their size, the way they\u2019re loaded, their ballistic properties, and how they\u2019re used.\nThe next video will cover buckshot; this video will focus on birdshot.\nBirdshot is very much the characteristic shotgun payload. Dozens, hundreds, even thousands\nof birdshot pellets are fired simultaneously, and spread out in flight to create a wide\ncloud - called a pattern - that improves the shooter\u2019s chances of hitting small, fast-moving,\nand/or distant targets. The idea is that with the right pattern; a\ntarget anywhere inside will be hit by enough pellets to get the job done.\nThis is the kind of behavior most folks associate with shotguns - sometimes incorrectly so,\nbut more on that in the next video. As the name suggests, birdshot is used on\nall types of birds, along with other small game animals, pests, and varmints; and inanimate\nobjects like the breakable clay discs used in various shooting activities.\nBecause birdshot pellets are relatively small and used in large numbers, the amount of birdshot\nin a shell is typically described by the total weight or mass of shot, usually in ounces\nor grams. When it\u2019s loaded, the shot is measured out by weight or an equivalent volume,\nnot by a specific number of pellets. Ammo manufacturers may give pellet counts\nin addition to the weight of shot, but these numbers are almost always estimates.\nStandard American birdshot ranges from the size of a grain of sand to just below the\nsmallest buckshot in steps of one hundredth of an inch. There are also accepted half-sizes\nthat cut that step to just five thousandths of an inch.\nThat\u2019s less than the thickness of one of my beard hairs.\nAll these birdshot sizes are split between two major naming systems. The smaller sizes\nuse a system of numbers, while larger sizes are designated by letters. We\u2019ll run through\nthe sizes, starting at the bottom with the numbered birdshot.\nThe way these numbers work, the lower the number, the larger the pellet. It\u2019s a little\ncounterintuitive, but there\u2019s a handy mathematical formula that relates these numbers to their\ncorresponding pellet diameter. Simply take the shot size number, subtract\nit from seventeen, and the difference is the nominal pellet diameter in hundredths of an\ninch. Take #5 birdshot as an example. 17 minus 5\nis 12. Move the decimal point two places to the left, and #5 birdshot pellets are .12\ninches in diameter. This formula also holds true for non-integer\nnumbers, allowing for half sizes such as 7\u00bd. 17 minus 7.5 is 9.5, or .095 inches. The numbered birdshot sizes start at #12, which is .05 inches in diameter, followed\nby #11, and #10. Anything smaller than #12 is simply called \u201cdust shot\u201d, though sometimes\n#11 and #12 are also referred to as dust shot. Because of their very low mass, tiny #10,\n11, and 12 pellets are only effective on small animals at very close ranges. For that reason,\nthese sizes are used primarily for pest control, and are often called rat-shot or snake-shot.\nYou won\u2019t see many actual shotgun shells factory-loaded with this tiny shot nowadays;\nbut it does show up in specialty shotshells and pistol cartridges, and the shot by itself\ncan be obtained for handloading. Moving up the scale, we have #9, 8, and 7\nshot. Unlike minuscule #10 and smaller sizes, this\nshot is heavy enough to remain effective beyond absolute point-blank ranges, but still provides\nvery high pellet counts and large, dense patterns that are ideal for fragile, but small or fast-moving\ntargets such as clays or small game animals. Also in this range are #7 \u00bd and #8 \u00bd birdshot.\nThese are the only common half-sizes in the American system, though others can be defined.\nWhen dealing with pellets this small, half-sizes offer relatively significant changes in pellet\ncount, and with the way these sizes are made and used, it makes sense to have these intermediaries.\nSince #9 through #7 lead birdshot is less expensive to manufacture than most larger\nsizes, they\u2019re what you\u2019ll usually find in cheap, steel-based, bulk-pack shotshells\nthat are great for inexpensive plinking and training.\nNext, #6, #5, and #4 birdshot are popular for hunting most upland game, as well as smaller\nor close-range waterfowl. .125\u201d #4 \u00bd shot isn\u2019t unheard of. Some\nreloading suppliers offer slightly oversized #4 shot that\u2019s technically #4 \u00bd. And since\nthat\u2019s exactly one-eighth of an inch, metal balls from various other sources can be repurposed\nas shot. But if you see shotgun ammunition specifically\nmarked as #4 \u00bd birdshot - or 5 \u00bd, or 6 \u00bd - you\u2019re more likely dealing with a different\nshot size system. British birdshot sizes include #4 \u00bd, but that\u2019s similar to American #6.\nAbove #4 is #3, #2, and #1 birdshot. These bigger pellets are used primarily on waterfowl;\noffering the penetration and energy retention needed for big, tough birds like geese, or\nlong-range shots at high-flying game. At .16 inches in diameter, #1 shot tops off\nthe numbered birdshot sizes. Larger sizes still move up in hundredth-inch increments,\nbut the math is replaced by a new system of letters and tuples.\nThe sizes just above #1 are the \u201cB\u201ds. At .17 inches \u2013 what would have been #0\nby the number-size formula - is B shot. After that, we have BB shot at .18 inches, and triple-B\nat .19 inches. If that middle one rings a bell, yes, .18-caliber\nBB birdshot was the original basis for the name and bore size of BB air guns. However,\nair rifles have evolved some since their introduction, and the standard pellet size for modern BB\nguns is 4.5 mm, or .177-caliber. Also, it\u2019s worth mentioning that \u201cBB\u201d\nis often used as a catch-all term for shotgun pellets. If someone uses \"BB\" as a plural\nnoun, as in \u201cI like magnum shells because they hold more BBs\u201d, they probably just\nmean pellets in general, not necessarily BB-size pellets.\nAnyway, above triple-B, there\u2019s no quadruple-B. Instead, things start over with a new letter,\nand we have .20-caliber T shot and .21-caliber TT shot. Then, the letter changes once more\nto give us .22-caliber F shot \u2013 sometimes called triple-T \u2013 and .23-caliber FF shot.\nThe \u201cB\u2019s\u201d and \u201cT\u2019s\u201d are common steel shot sizes for waterfowl hunting in\nareas where lead has been banned. Since steel shot has a relatively low density, achieving\nthe same penetration and effective range requires larger pellets.\nThe biggest \u201cT\u201d and \u201cF\u201d birdshot sizes are also used on thin-skinned varmints and\npredators like coyotes and wild cats. Compared to buckshot, these sizes offer higher pellet\ncounts at the expense of some range and penetration. There\u2019s no handy formula for these letter\nbirdshot sizes, but they\u2019re not too tough to keep track of. Just remember that \u201cB\u201d\nshot is essentially #0 at .17-caliber, then the other two \u201cB\u201ds, the \u201cT\u201ds, and\nthe \u201cF\u201ds follow in the usual hundredth-inch increments.\nThe \u201cF\u201d sizes top off the American birdshot system. One hundredth of an inch above FF\nis the smallest buckshot size, .24-caliber #4 buck. We\u2019ll start there next time.\nAll in all, American birdshot isn\u2019t too difficult to grasp and remember once you see\nhow the system works. Stay tuned for part 2 on buckshot, where things get somewhat less\nstraightforward. For now, I welcome any questions and comments,\nand please let me know if there are any general shotgun topics you\u2019d like me to explain.\nI\u2019ve been planning this new video series for a while, and now that it\u2019s finally off\nthe ground, I\u2019m looking forward to feedback.

two-foot group at 25 yards with it I don't have clue why they're not doing right don't have a clue shotgun barrels perform well with every other slug I got shot so I said hey old Jeff see if he'll do some slow-mo for me see if he'll test them and see if he gets the same kind of results so here you go thanks Jeff I want to thank Ben for send me these slugs to test out I want to mention that he is also an author and has books available on Amazon and Ben also runs a professional typing service and if you're interested there's links in the description the leaky drive slugs work great even if you're not a avid reloader because you really don't need expensive tools to load these rounds here we're using the mountain storm shell prepping tool and I can't say enough good things about this it's handmade and it's it makes it really safe to remove the crimp and it's fast and we're just using off-the-shelf birdshot shells and we can reuse that lead to cast more slugs with next we'll take the 1 ounce slug and just press it into the shot cup the fit is nice and solid and it's not going to go anywhere the fit was nice and snug on every brand of shell that I tried so using this method as quick it's simple and it's going to save you a lot of money over the cost of shooting factory loaded slugs we'll be shooting these slugs 50 yards out of a smoothbore Mossberg 590 shotgun now at 50 yards not 25 yards we got roughly a 12-inch group maybe a little bigger than that as I've always said a high-speed camera does not lie this first round is a Fiocchi target load raid for 1,200 feet per second even though I got on target you can see the slug oscillating quite a bit as its flying through the air but you got to remember that we're shooting us out of a smoothbore shotgun no rifle barrel or rifled choke now this remington peters target load shell is probably 30 years old it's so old it uses a fiber wadding I don't have any velocity numbers as far as what the shell is rated for but I'm guessing around 1,200 feet per second also really the biggest difference between the five different brands of shells I use is the wadding system and I wanted to use a fiber wadding as a comparison this is a Winchester game and target load that you would get at Walmart at a 100 round box and it's rave for 1290 feet per second and again we're seeing a little bit of oscillation the round is waggling around a little bit but all in all I'm pretty happy with the grouping I'm getting this is a federal field and target load rafer 1200 feet per second again I a bulk hunter ground box that you get at Walmart now again we see a lot of oscillation and irregular flight characteristics this is a Rio game load rated for 1,250 feet per second but using one and as sixteenth ounce of shot it's a little hotter I must been using too much Jedi force on this one because you can see that round curving like a boomerang I always love it when we get these oddball shots caught on camera look at that thing I think the shock wave hit the edge of that target stand and it kind of pushed even further and this is the same Ryo target shell as last shot this one worked out real well didn't have that weird curving we saw in the last shot and Ryo is probably one of my favorite brands of shotgun shells I've had very good success no duds I've had a lot of duds with federal rounds but never with a Ryo and then our third shot using the Ryo and we see a lot of weird oscillation with this one so we're having some consistency problems using this brand of ammo now Ben was using a rifled barrel and doing a complete reload on his shells but in a couple weeks we'll be testing these through a rifled choke and see what kind of results we get I hope you enjoyed this thanks for watching", "yhxpFqUxn8c":

thursday so we're gonna review some lessons uh we did not review last week because you took a test on tuesday so we're gonna review lessons one to eight so first we look at um finding parts of fractions so we have three quarters of a gallon of batter poured equally into two bowls how many gallons are in each bowl so we took three fourths divided by two which was half of three quarters so we get three eighths of a gallon of batter in each bowl and when we used models i did not recreate the models but if that's something that you need to do to help you go right ahead next we have three quarters of a pan of lasagna shared equally by six friends what fraction will each friend get so three-fourths divided by six excuse me or you can rewrite it as 1 6 times 3 4 which is equal to 3 24 or 1 8 of the pan okay and i gave the answer right away for this one that's okay so margot freezes eight cups of strawberries if this is two-thirds of the total that she picked how many cups did she pick so eight is two-thirds of what each unit represents four it's like because eight divided by two is four so four times three is twelve or eight divided by two thirds equals twelve okay next we looked at more division so eight divided by nine or eight ninths divided by two ninths gives us four okay nine twelfths divided by three twelfths is three and now in these new lessons we talked about how to figure that out so you take 9 12 and then you actually multiply it times what we call the reciprocal which is the flip of the second number so 9 times 12 divided by 12 times 3 is necessary if able and then we had 7 9 divided by 3 9 gives us two in the third okay 21 over nine all right moving up so next we looked at measurement or partitive interpretations with models so first decide on an interpretation measurement or partitive then draw a model if you need to three find the answer next choose a unit because we're writing division stories and then set up a situation based on the model so writing that story problem so first we have three quarters divided by one half so we sorry let's go back towards this find the answer so we take three fourths divided by one half so three it's going to be times two is six four times one is eight six eight oh my god sorry not six sixth fourths numbers are really hard for me today apparently so six fourths are rewritten as one and one half we write a division story t has three quarters of an ounce of growth coffee grounds left in her coffee can she needs half an ounce to make one cup of coffee how many cups of coffee can she make one and a half so this is a measurement now we're going to look at partitive so divide 50 by two thirds then write the story so two units was 50 when we drew our thing so one is going to be 25 times 25 because we know that because 25 times 2 is 50 50 divided by 2. okay then our story ronaldo has ridden 50 miles during his bicycle race and is two-thirds of the way to the finish line how long is the race it's going to be 50 plus another 25 because that's only two-thirds of the race is 75 okay next modeling so we have measurement we're not going to model it today because we did that in our lessons but if you need to do that to help that's fine so remember with measurements you can write it as three-fifths is how many fourths we drew it out so we got 12 20 because they both have the same denominator so 12 20 divided by five twentieths which gave us 12 over five or two and two fifths and we talked about writing the expression converting it into a fraction and then dividing the fractions if necessary so we had two fifths divided by three and four sevenths so convert this into a fraction an improper fraction so we have 25 sevenths so we're going to take two fifths divided by 25 sevenths so two fifths divided by 25 sevenths two fifths times seven twenty-fifths equals fourteen hundred 125th okay i know there's a lot there i really do um no assignment other than to finish any missing

equations and inequalities now it's time to put them to use on application problems word problems these are always going to be application problems where problems are always going to be in the form of and when spheres are us ships bags of golf balls each bag must contain 860 balls plus or minus nine balls and the reason that is is because sometimes if you have people hand putting them in the in the bag or box however they're shipped sometimes they miscount they get off a little bit or you have a machine spitting the balls into the bag and sometimes it'll spit maybe two in instead of one at a time on certain problems and so this is the margin of error write an inequality which represents an acceptable number of golf balls in each bag name the variable so we're going to let b stand for the range of balls needed it's always from least needed in a bag to the most that can be in a bag what is the margin of error nine balls it cannot be more than nine or less than nine balls different from what is needed what is needed is 860. and so margin of balls can't be more than nine okay we're trying to find the difference between the number of golf balls you have and the range of golf balls needed which will give you the answer within the margin of error so it can be written two different ways it can be written 860 minus b or the number of balls minus 860. it doesn't matter because the absolute value the difference between these two are going to either be a positive or a negative of the same number and so it does not matter which you write i prefer this one right here all right because this is going to be the balls in bag this is what is needed what did we need to have what is needed what did we need to have how many balls are supposed to be in the bag 860. that's what's needed but this amount can differ by what nine balls and remember i said it's an and so if it's an and always use less than or equal to sine all right so we're going to solve this now you're saying yourself oh i don't need to solve it because i know all i have to do is add 9 or subtract 9 from the 860 but we're still going to go ahead and solve it and you might be asked to solve this let me come over here so b minus 860 is less than or equal to nine remember absolute value we have to write two inequalities one of them we just drop the absolute value ours and the other one we write the negative of it and the negative of 9 is negative 9 but remember if we're going from a positive 9 to a negative 9 basically we're dividing this by negative 1 or multiplying by negative 1 and whenever you multiply or divide by a negative what happens to this sign right here it switches direction or flips okay so i'm going to say flips all right and then i'm going to solve i'm going to add 860. b has to be less than or equal to 869 balls i'm going to add 860 to this side and b has to be greater than or equal to when i combine these two 851 balls so let's see what that looks like this is what is needed in the bag it can be plus or minus 9. so if i add 9 that's going to give me the 869. if i subtract 9 that's going to give me the 851 and that's a difference of 9 false all right and so how you write your solution is this it is a less than or equal inequality so the solutions will be and statement with the shading in between so we just wrote it up here we're going to write it one more time we have 869 we have 851 so it can be balls all the way up to 869 and this is the range right here range of acceptable balls in the bag sorry all right and how you write this right here this is what you want actually it would be a b right it can be 851 or 869. you always go from least to greatest so it's going to be always less than or equal to signs so i'm going to come over here and write 851 is less than or equal to the number of balls needed or what we prefer to have in it and less than or equal to 869. so this is the solution right here and this right here is the graph solution now what did we take away from it what's the one thing we need to remember on these we need to remember it's always an and statement it's always written with a less than or equal to sign the average or what you want in the bag is on the inside and this right here is can differ by or it's your margin of error okay so on the outside is always the margin of error let's look at these two problems amanda is apartment honey in a specific area she discovers that the average monthly rent for a two bedroom apartment is 800 that's the average but the actual price could differ from the average by as much as 225 dollars a month write and solve an absolute value inequality so absolute value we know it's a range of values so we always know this is a less than or equal to so that's what we know automatically on these application problems we also know that it differs by our margin of error is on the outside and what is going to be on the inside what you want or what is the in this case the average but always always always remember the margin of error what it can differ by is on the outside so rent is r what was the average rent that she would expect to pay 800 what can the rent differ by margin of error 225 and there's the equation now when i solve this one it's r minus 800 i'm going to drop the absolute value bars less than or equal to 225 and the other equation our inequality is going to be r minus 800 same thing but this is going to be a negative 225 you remember that but remember when this becomes a positive and changes to a negative it's like we're multiplying by a negative number it changes the direction of the sign okay and when i solve this one i'm going to add 800 so i have 1025 the rent has to be less than a thousand twenty five dollars i add 100 on this side the rent has to be greater than or equal to 575 so that's the range of rents so i come over here i'm going to graph it first what is the average eight hundred dollars how much more can we spend what do they think the range would be or it could differ by 225 what was the amount then 1025 and over here what was the amount the lower amount was 575. so it could be 575 that would be great the average is 800 so it could be 800 could be 850 but the most we would expect to pay is a thousand twenty five dollars so this is the range of values that you would expect to pay for the apartment all right and so here again here's how we write it from least to greatest what's my least value 575 dollars what is my greatest value 1025 so that's the range it could be anything in between those two numbers all right last one a company's guidelines call for each can of soup produced not to vary not to vary from its stated volume stated volume this is what we would expect the volume to be should be 14.5 fluid ounces but it can't vary it shouldn't vary by more than very high point zero eight ounces it can't be off more than point zero eight ounces it could be a little less than this by only 0.08 ounces or it could be 0.08 ounces greater than this but it can't be outside that range so right you solve we already know that how much can it vary by point zero eight we're going to just use x on this when it really didn't say anything so we'll use x minus what it should be 14.5 now if it says to solve it really didn't say solve well it did say write and solve you would write the two inequalities b minus 14.5 less than or equal to 0.08 and you have to write a second one b minus 14.5 and this is a negative 0.08 what happens when this becomes a negative from a positive it changes the direction of the sign and when we solve this i'm just going to go ahead and i've already solved it real quickly b is less than blue and not b where am i getting the b from i said x right x is less than or equal to 14.58 and there i did i had the x here and i don't know i guess i'm getting them from the bag of balls earlier so and then on this one when i solve it x has to be greater than or equal to 14.42 if i graph it here's the average or what they've won in the can it can be as much as 14.58 or as little as 14.42 it can be 14.42 it could be 14.5 point 14.7 all the way up to but no more than 14.58 when i write it i always write it like this and it's always least to greatest what was my least value 14.42 what was my greatest value 14.58 now explain in sentence form because you have these executives and they can't do math and so but they want you to tell them in sentence form what the range and the volume of the cans of soup will be all right so this is how i wrote it the cans must have a volume at least 14.42 ounces but cannot exceed or cannot be more than 14.4 uh 14.58 amps or you can put the range of the volume has to be are ranges between 14.42 ounces up to no more than 14.58 ounces so you can ward it any way you want as long as you know this is the minimum value this is the maximum weight thank you", "noQGg_t5eYY": "what's going on everyone we're at the range today we're going to do some penetration tests with three different types of home defense annal birdshot buckshot and a slug and what we're basically going to show is that I think birdshot is the best because it's not going to over penetrate but whatever gets it is going to get destroyed anyway but some people think that buckshot and slugs are better so they more lethal but they're going to over penetrate and possibly go through a wall or through a door so we've set up a mock scenario here's an inside panel door it's a hollow door pretty good pretty typical scenario you're going to be in a corridor we're going to shoot the target the watermelon here that's going to be center mass just flesh and body whatever it's going to get destroyed we're going to see if it's going to go through the target and hit a watermelon on the other side we're going to be using the Remington 870 optical with an 18 and 1/2 inch barrel first up is challenger number seven and a half birdshot here we go you Oh messy alright so as you guys can see the watermelon or your intruder he's totally destroyed but if you take a close look at the door not a single pellet actually even touch the door and auntie or granny sleeping on the next side and the other room she's perfectly fine no damage so that's a success let's move on to the next test buckshot alright so for the second test we're going to be using Remington 2 and 3/4 buckshot this is extremely high velocity see how that goes you awesome alright so that was the second shot with the Buckshot completely different story the target is equally destroyed there's really no noticeable difference there but if you take a closer look it completely went through the watermelon or your intruder completely went through this hollow panel door I see light on the other side so ooh that's bad granny sleeping she's not waking up from that one so look here oh yeah completely Oh completely destroyed all right so we're on to the third test we're going to use high brass high velocity two and three-quarter inch one ounce slug you take it right holy [ __ ] any telling exploded better than the line alright so that was the slug and as you can see it was the most devastating by far you could tell by the footage so your intruder is completely destroyed but it went clean through the watermelon clean through the door and we got the other watermelon here granny would not have liked that very much let's crack her open see if we can find that slug a hole like that Wow pieces of the door there's peace of wadding alright so in conclusion so as I suspected I personally think that birdshot is really the best for home defense simply because it's not going to over penetrate go through walls go through doors and possibly hurt or kill somebody in the next room but the target or the intruder is still going to be completely destroyed buckshot it penetrates goes through the door goes to the wall no problem and the slug is even worse so I hope you guys learn something maybe that will change how you feel about home defense or what you're going to use leave your comments let me know what you think after watching this you", "4qbBH9-g1w0": "Oh guys Big Daddy Hoffman 1911 coming to you Friday night here on the compound and uh I got another shot getting my hand how about that can you believe it man and I got a wall full of zombies behind me right here yes sir got clown zombies nazi zombies terrorist lobbies and I can guarantee you one thing you'll never see Big Daddy - melesa terrace army knew got wild boars pigs hog zombies more nazi zombies more over here you probably can't even see but that's really not what this video is about but hey if you are interested in these check the link underneath the video i'll list a discount code we can get 15% off so but what I want to talk to you tonight about is our shotgun ammo choosing the right hand mode I get so many PMS and messages and comments emails about asking me about what's the best ammo to use or would you help me with my shotgun it won't cycle properly also I'll see a comment saying that well I wouldn't have that shotgun if it wouldn't cycle any type of ammo well that's the craziest thing I can hear anybody say because I have Vanilli's Remington's Winchester's saviors all kind of semi-automatic pump shotguns everything and I can make any of them misfeed or fail to eject or have problems with them with the underpowered shotgun shell so what I'd like to do tonight is maybe save you a little heartache and headache and show you what to look for when buying shotgun ammo I had to learn the hard way on this one you know so let me take the camera off the tripod and I want to show you this ammo I've got laid out here on the table and hope it helps let's get it okay we got a lot of shells laid out here let me say this first most of my shooting is done shooting plays and shooting still I love to shoot clay targets I just ordered a new skeet thrower and I'm going to do a video on that very soon but just for out here having to fell on the range I normally stick with the low Brown shells which is this one here and I'm going to stick it back over here and have some hot brass that's federal all right after you finish this video I'd like you to Google 12-gauge DRAM equivalent all right in this you're going to find some real useful information excuse me I got the hiccups but this is a very good chart when you do that you'll find other photos that come up and explain shotgun loads and explain sizes this is not to scale and a shotgun anatomy if you're that new to shotgun okay so let me start here all right this is 12-gauge and of course you know y'all know what that is we're using a 12 gauge or 20 gauge or 10 gauge or whatever to a 3/4 inch which that's what what this is and you know you'll see it 2 and 3/4 you'll see 3-inch three and a half inch it's all printed on your shotgun barrel the next thing you have is is the ounce of shot so it's one out of nine shot all right so when they say that they're referring to this little chart right here okay you got nine shot again this is not the scale right so so some might go in there and say okay super sport competition target load well man that'll be a good one but I want you to look at one thing here what's really important is the DRAM equivalent this is two and three quarter gram all right muzzle velocity 1180 which anything under 1200 is low all right federal target lewd all right we got 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch two and three-quarter gram which the dram is a measure of powder in the shotgun shell all right it's one in 1/8 ounce of nine shot okay all right this is traveling at eleven hundred and forty five feet per second so this is a low powered shot getting [ __ ] alright so the state ammo that I said I like the best they even make some some low powered shotgun shells okay I'm going to move on to two one this gave me the most problem which this will throw you off just a little bit all right you've got 12-gauge two and three quarter one and one day I wanted one paint out seven and a half shot and it's got a three gram equivalent and it jumped up to 1,200 feet per second okay on the seven and a half shot all right this stuff right here I've had problems with in all my semiautomatic shotguns and I've even Stephen seen it get problems in a pump shot okay and I just don't like this type of ammo alright we're going to the state and this says it's a three gram equivalent and it's 1200 now my suggestion to you is to stay above 1200 so I'm going to move over to the next one which is a Winchester it's three gram equivalent okay so we jumped up 50 from 1200 to 1250 using the eight shot okay you might you might get by with it alright alright but I'm going to to that I like the very best okay and again it's the estate heavy game load and it's three and a quarter gram the muzzle velocity is 1255 on the eighth shot and on the seven shot you got friend recorded round at twelve hundred and ninety feet per second now this stuff has never given me a problem and that's the heavy game load by a state okay it works great in my sega's and everything but recently I just went down to Gander Mountain and I found this Winchester Double A and I've used it and I really liked it okay so we're reading twelve gays two and three-quarter we've got a dram of three and a quarter it's one in 1/8 ounce of seven and a half shot and see this thing it's a pretty hot little load is 1,300 miles velocity 1,300 feet per second okay I really like this hammer right here okay it's three and a quarter DRAM seven and a half shot it's some good stuff in it they're following it Supersport sporting clays now be careful there all right because this one says super handicap heavy target load this is a three gram equivalent and this is a three and a quarter so fight I'm putting this back over here where I had it before guys these are my best ones I even think that when my buddy sent me a link Winchester if you're good their site you might find a coupon code you could Google Winchester double-a coupon code to have a discount on this you buy so many dollars worth so I'm going to back down to getting a mountain and I'm going to buy me a bunch of this stuff because I really like it it's psycho well three and a quarter DRAM that's what you look for though I really hope this helps you a little bit again please to understand this a little better please Google that right there 12 gauge from AM equivalent and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about okay the three and a quarter DRAM all right we're looking at one of them weight one and 1/8 ounce is coming out about twelve fifty five and one ounce is coming out at twelve ninety so anything around this range here you're going to be good with okay anyway I hope you get the point I hope this helps you let me put this camera back on the tripod okay guys sorry about my stumbled around there you know it's hard to do these videos holding the camera do it by yourself but that's the way it is I don't mind being alone here on Friday night but I got you guys I share this stuff with anyway I hope this helps you a little bit I've got two to do I like the best which is the Winchester Double A it's like I said a while ago in the estate heavy game load both of them are traveling at both over three and a quarter DRAM that's the important thing you look for and I think in the old days with black powder days that was the the way they measured black powder in grams but anyway that that tells you how much how heavy of thoughts you're going to have and how much power is in your shotgun shell so you know you can tell big dad I'm not the smartest cookie on the block you know but you gotta give me a break you know like I'm one hundred and sixty years old like I said in my last video but that's what you look for let me know if it helps you guys keep up the fight against gun control it's more important now to fight this and we're gonna have to keep fighting I'm afraid forever so support the NRA get on room air any organization that that will help you fight for your second Amendment rights so guys if you like this video please like favorite and subscribe and as always remember Big Daddy lotion Iran god bless you all no let's go out and shoot some shotgun shells tomorrow don't think I don't think I'll do it tonight see you guys see", "6EwnDkT2GDQ": "sometimes that little bit of added flash makes all the difference in the world let's go pull up in a calm pocket I'm gonna talk to you guys about some options with under spins hey guys Matt Allen here welcome back to tactical Bassin today we are going to talk about making your own under spins how to do it on the fly out here on the boat so that you can adapt and change with the conditions and keep catching fish it's very easy to do if you're prepared now you guys know that we love under spins we talk about them a lot we we throw exposed tooks we throw weedless versions there are some great heads on the market and we try to always have them around especially in the fall but it's never going to fail you're out there on a bite in fact it happened to me yesterday where you think you've got what you need conditions change and even though you own a ton of tackle you find yourself out on the boat with that tackle at home and you're not prepared so today I'm going to walk you through just a handful of things that are gonna make a huge difference for you most of us carry a hook box in the boat if you're a bank guy you probably carry some hooks too just not quite the selection well today we're gonna go through just a handful of things here that are going to change things for you they're not heavy they don't take up a lot of space you can add them to your box and when conditions start changing you're right there with them so under spins what is it just in case you guys have missed that an under spin it's going to be a head that's got a blade hanging down below it you're gonna pair it up with a swimbait and when you swim that thing through the water you've got that swim bait back there kicking you've also got that blade churning underneath think of it as a very finesse approach to spinnerbait fishing that's basically what it is a little tiny blade just adding some flash adding some vibration to a swimbait they range in size their giant under spins tiny under spins but when you get out there on the lake and it starts changing on you you can adapt so here's a couple of things I want to talk to you about these two guys are gonna make a world of difference for you two different styles of blades that you can add this little Pro Point guy it's a blade with a screw to go into a bait this one con baits these are made to hang so the difference you know let's just build one I'm gonna start with this guy right here some Matt Allen swim bait head obviously a head that I throw a lot but occasionally when I'm out here on the water especially if I get around a lot of bait fish I need to add some flash to it if I've got these guys in the boat I'm good to go I just keep both tied on but I don't always have them with me and more importantly this is a 3/8 ounce so is this look at the difference in the hook size this is a much styler hook and it's a size larger one of the things I like about my head is that the hooks are up size just a little not enough to create a problem when you're trying to finesse it and use lighter line but they're a little stouter than the under spins that are on the market the benefit to me is that when I get around big fish I can do exactly what we're gonna do right here and I end up with a little bit stronger hook so I don't ever come out prepared for that per se I start out with just my swim bait head and just an under spin but if I start catching giants on that under spin what I do is I take this head I grab that probe point blade and next we're gonna talk wheatless what I do is I line this guy up I look at the belly of the bait and I look at that Pro point because once it's screwed in everything needs to be straight so I line it up I pick my location I just sort of stab it in there and then you're just going to twist it's a screw lock it's gonna go right into that material and literally that fast I'm running an under spin and they work so well so well it's that easy you don't have to carry a ton of stuff on the boat now let's talk weedless there's a bunch of different reasons to do this it could be as simple as here's an owner flashy swimmer it's a 5 watt flashy swimmer this is the owner be stuck it's a 4 OTT Beast the Beast has a slightly deeper throat a lot of the time it doesn't matter some days I get a way better hook up ratio here than here it seems to make a difference on those days this guy the con baits they make a version of it that's weightless you take that weightless version snap it onto the beast hook and now I've got that better hook up ratio and I'm right back where I started but I'm hooking more fish some days it doesn't matter I mean we love the flashy swimmer we throw it a ton but once in a while you're like why today why do they not want to fully eat it today and that beast hook is still getting them so let's look at a couple more examples well here is the con baits out of the package all you're gonna need to carry guys let's run through the components and then we're gonna rig this to those little pro point blades these little conveyed blades some owner CPS Springs you throw that into your hook box you can adapt to any condition any condition I mean that so here a couple more examples here's one that's still rigged out on the water you don't have any components you don't have an under spin to save your life you don't even have a wide gap hook no problem you see how good that looks that thing has been catching fish it's a flipping hook it is a straight up flipping hook take a flipping hook take that spring clip it to the eyelet so that you can screw your bait on this is a four point eight Kai Tak going on a five off flip and hook stab that guy in there and then that con baits all you do is clip it on and you've got a perfect understand made out of flipping components now that's where that spring is going to make a big difference if you've got wide gap hooks you don't even have to do that so here we go there's one of those Scottsboro swim baits we told you we're starting to experiment with six OTT Gamakatsu wide gap hook see if we can do this middle of the nose pop it out just like it's a just like it's a worm come around hmm you know what I don't think I like that hook we're going bigger bigger owner jungle gap jungle wide gap six awe hug same spot plop it out I like that one better come back here pop through a reason why I said I didn't like cuz I didn't have enough hook gap when they ate it I wasn't going to expose that hook now I will okay now we're a weedless swim bait but we're still weightless we don't have a blade take that con this is the 3/8 put that guy in here clip clip we are in business and you can do it with any of these baits here's a 5.8 high tech now they make big owner swim bait hooks to do a lot of this stuff but again if you have to stock all that stuff on the boat it's a mess it's it it's a whole extra box in your boat let alone if you're walking the shoreline use that same hook that's that jungle hook it's gonna look good on this five point eight spin that guy around Saima let's use that eight balance little eight down sky why would we use a little eight doubts because we're fish in shallow water fishing around docks fishing around grass you don't wanna get snagged in that grass and just like that you're in business why would you not stock this stuff it is so easy guys it allows you to use different gap hooks different strength hooks different weights you can use a stronger hook than you can find in your favorite underspin so many different things and it's just a handful of little parts that you throw into your box and it's done and you can see how fast this is going it's not like it's complicated to make these under spins you can do it with any hook any hook can be adapted and turned in to an under spin in a flash when you get around bait when those fish are just getting a little funny your bite doesn't seem to be as good as it was quick adaptation make the switch get back to catching fish guys I hope you enjoyed this video I hope it helps you it's easy to do it's easy to just stick in a little compartment forget about it bury it in the boat but when the day comes that you need to adapt you thought your fish were out deep they moved up shallow all of a sudden you don't have a weedless under spin or you thought you were fishing grass and the fish backed out now you can't reach them you need to get heavier so many different times where quick changes make the difference if you enjoyed this video hit that like

we'll talk to you soon [Music] you you", "0sP27ZE6lKo": "[Music] okay guys so today I'm gonna be showing you how to fish ChatterBait it's been a pretty popular request so figured I'd knock it out today that's all it is let's get right into it [Music] this is just a black-and-blue ChatterBait I like to throw this on my basic setup 6 3 2 1 gear ratio 6 6 rod 25 pound braid with a 12th pound invisi leader and fishing in ChatterBait is very simple just cast it right out all you all I like to do is keep my rod tip down and just bring a steady steady reel in [Music] the chatter Bay is easy one of the easiest baits to fish with there's not much you have to do with it just because that blade does all the action for you I don't know if you guys can see that well but the action that that ChatterBait gives off is just insane it's a lot of vibrations and this is this is a good lure to use all year round pretty heavy lure you can wail it way out there throw it out in the middle and just reel it in and wait for a hungry fish to attack it in my opinion I like the ChatterBait more than the spinnerbait just because it catches more fish but the spinner Bay is a lot more efficient on your fish and pretty weedy waters because the spinner bait will will glide through the through the weeds pretty easily unlike the chatter bait which has that blade sticking right out in front of this it picks up any little weeds that you come across show you a couple more times just cast it way out there let it fall to the column that you want to fish if you want to fish low you let it sink all the way to the bottom then you just keep an even retrieve rod tip down see how that rod tip is vibrating it all that action that's giving off this thing just looks so naturally there's not much that there's not many lures that can look as great as this like I said guys it's a very easy lure to use if you want to see me actually fishing catching fish on this lure you can check my previous video I can post it right here and today I'm just giving you guys a tutorial on how to fish it I'm not really gonna fish today I don't think I got quite a bit of stuff to do today so just a quick little video one last cast just look at the action on that Bay it's just insane it looks so good yeah guys thanks for watching if you've never fished the ChatterBait you should definitely buy one and throw in on your line because it's a very effective bait as long as you're throwing it somewhere where there's fish you'll most likely go so thanks for watching keep subscribing and give a thumbs up if you thought this was hopeful thank you [Music]", "9fZB4s38Ygg": "hi this is pressure Locker your parents or grandparents may have had milk delivered to their home and this mathematical problem relates to that custom imagine a milkman carries a full 12 litre container of milk he needs to deliver exactly 6 litres of milk to a customer but the customer only has 8 and 5 liter jugs can he measure out exactly 6 litres for the customer while taking 6 litres for himself he can obviously use all three containers in order to get this measurement the story goes this problem was asked to a school child in France around the late 1700s he was so interested in the problem that he went on to pursue mathematics this child was named Poisson and he's made many contributions to statistics so the question for you is can you figure it out how can the milkman measure exactly 6 litres and take home 6 liters for himself give this problem a try and when you're ready keep watching the video for the solution all right we have 12 litres of milk and the other two containers have 0 and 0 they start out with nothing so we're going to pour this milk between the containers and we're going to keep track of how much milk is in each container first we'll pour 8 litres and fill up the 8 liter container so that leaves 4 litres in the 12 eater container and we filled up the 8 liter completely we'll fill up the 5 liter container so we now have the amounts of 3 & 5 we'll take that 5 liter amount and put it back into the 12 litre container so we have 4 plus 5 which makes 9 we transfer the 3 litres from the 8 to the 5 litre jugs we now fill up the 8 litre container from the 12 litre jug so that leaves 1 liter of milk in the 12 litre jug and we have 8 litres filled in the a leader jug we fill up the five liter container from the eight liter jug and that leaves six liters for the customer the milkman can then take the five liters pour back into his twelve liter container and he is left with six and so now we've measured it out the milkman can take home the six liters of milk and he's provided six liters exactly six liters for the customer did you figure it out thanks for watching this video please

conversion from one troy ounce of gold to grams and gold and first and this sliver tricky troy runs is not the same as the regular arms you can find conversion factors in crayons in unit in unit conversion tables you need to have a need to know the distinction between them and so looking at your conversion tables you you can just can find there that very simply there and and troy ounce that is abbreviated in all ZT is just equivalent to 31.1 something and did let's just use this on 31.1 grams and we'll be using this conversion factor in our solution and so we are given that one one troy ounce although that is just obviously that's just the same so just proceed with a solution so that you'll get a a pattern for so being this kind of problem on drawing tons of gold and multiplied by the conversion factor you write in the denominator the conversion factor that you wish to to cancel out and that is one troy ounce and in the numerator is the unit that you desire on you one that is 30 in grams we want the unit to be in grams and then we cancel the cancel the unit in in the troy ounce and so we we get an answer that is thirty 1.1 grams of gold next that's just pretty simple", "3hSEPHj8mNg": "this is my Lee slug mold I went with the one ounce version there's also a 7/8 ounce version available I want to share with you what I've learned about a few of the wads holes and loads that are available first of all the mold it's it's a three part mold as the plug and then the two sides very nicely made especially for the price works great I've made about three or four hundred of them so far comes with an instruction sheet on the back we have some load data and this instruction sheet is all available online without charge so go to Lee's website and you can pull up the PDF file and review that and see if you have available the components that you need for for doing some of these loads these are two different holes that have worked really well for me the STS by Remington love those holes they work great very durable and the Winchester double a these holes are also very durable very available the next thing I'd like to talk about are the different wads that I've used the first wad that I tried was the clay buster waa 12 replacement wad Part C b11 8 - 1 - it is not an exact replacement for that wad because there is a little bit of a buildup on each of the pedals and when that is put together you end up with a bulge on each of the four sides where those pedals are and causes it to not chamber very well in my 870 they would chamber but it was really tight my KSG it won't chamber him it's just I'm not gonna force it that Laura don't use these rods this is the next one that I want to talk about this is the W t12 this one is a clone of the waa 12 it does not have those ridges on the pedals like the clay busters and those slugs fit down in there properly and you get a nice straight smooth wall on your hole when you're done and these work really well this is the Winchester waa 12 SL WOD this WOD has a has a different cup height as you can see it brings the slug up a little closer to the top these crimp a little bit better for me however I am not recommending that anybody use them because they're not on the load data I have my mech sized master set up and ready to go we're gonna load some Remington STS holes with some slugs d-prime in size with the new primer in using my Hornet e powder measure instead of the charge bar I get a little better consistency with that 49 grains of blue dot then I want to put the lot in I don't compress the wad all the way I'll leave it sticking out about a quarter of an inch that makes it very easy to install the slug put it back in the press I have my pressure set to Aidan recruit final crimp and we're ready to go we've got 25 cents into that reloaded slug", "nAKs79XWqc8": "okay good day guys today's um the uh january 8th let's do it to it okay so for today's lesson we're going to again review this and then do some more inequalities let me do two more of these for as amadi okay so first off i'm going to always go with domain and range just keeping with that you know domain i'm going to go with x and then it's going to be between what two numbers so i'm gonna go uh again i'm looking strictly when i go left and right here off the x-axis you see how there's no more graph over here i know more graph over here and the graph only exists here so i'm trying to get here is that if i get any coordinate from here here any point the x values where could my x values be well they'll always have between a one two three four a negative four and a one two three four five six seven and a seven see how it's shaded in or it's not like an open circle like this and i'm gonna say it's included for both sides that's it any coordinate i get will have an x value between a negative four and a seven and that means decimal isn't everything okay that's when we see it like that and just take it easy don't freak out now range are your y values and the y values are between two numbers now now here i'm just looking how for the y axis see this is how high and how low there's no graph over here there's no graph over here so my y values any coordinate anywhere any kind of x y i'm looking strictly otherwise the lowest my y's would go would be a negative one two three four five six seven and the highest it would go would be a negative one negative two this one uh yes open here so that's saying it don't don't include it so you do not put the equal sign the highest one is a solid line that goes through there so we're going to go and say it is computed there's my domain my range for that domain range again we'll try this real quick domain my x values are between what two numbers the lowest now again i'm going to go off the x-axis so i'm saying you see this error the lowest would be well forever in that direction now i can't say negative one a or two negative 10 negative 30 because the arrow here means that it goes on forever just just look at this you see how it has a little slight you know a slope going up and definitely has a lot of slope going this way so really goes up forever in that direction and it goes further in that direction let me see uh and then here is like its starting point so at least it would be tornado infinity the most it would be would be uh what uh x-axis what does that mean here and there's my answer right there oh it is included so i'm gonna go right here so i'm gonna tell you this much this is saying any x value that's less than or equal to zero so we're going to throw this as my final answer does that make sense any x value less than zero or equal to it that's what that says you could say goes up into negative infinity but this also includes that so we're just going to leave it like this range that's normal y values like this like this um this one right here lowest value and then the highest value again since it has a little slope pointing making a little slope up it goes forever in that direction so the lowest assuming would go would be zero and i want to say it's included and it goes up into positive forever and ever infinity what i'll say here is i'm just going to say this part here now i'm going to switch it around i'm going to say y okay see how it's feeding the y greater than or equal to zero y as long as it's what greater than or equal to zero greater than zero any of these y values are greater than zero and then right here means it's equal to it true that means it starts off there yes it is okay let's go to today's lesson now we're going back to the book we're talking about inequalities remember we said here less than fewer than greater than more than this right here these are the words it can kind of uh you know mean this when you read words like this so we're going to write any quantities over this stuff quick review remember if we had uh variables like this on either side subtract the smaller one or end up with this idea here to graph that flip that around as a is greater than negative six this part here make sure you write it the arrow pointing to the right going to the right and then shade it in and from where it's six this is the answer the set is a such that a is greater than or equal to a six and there it is a is it any a value as long as it's going to be what greater than or equal to six and all this like blue line it means that there any answer from here any of these answers and they put the arrows because they make it goes on forever in that direction we left off here yesterday okay going into words let's come back to the words see what's going on with the words so uh philippe needs for the leverage schedule right here basket spot to be at least 82 degrees so it has to be like kind of warm right currently the masking spot is 62.5 how much warmer does the basket spot uh need to be so we're gonna come right here and say well it's the current temperature it needs to be at this much so we're gonna kind of look at this stuff here the current temperature is gonna go we're gonna go with t for temperature right and the temperature is what 62.5 and how much more do we need to add to it since obviously we need to make it go up right so 62 plus the the needed amount and it has to be at least so if you think about this this is the temperature and this is what the limit is we want the temperature of what to the limit we want it greater or do we want less actually it says at least so that means that's going to be a lower spot so we want this side over here to be greater so we set it up for the other read this and make sense of this case at least so in this part here means this part is going to be greater than that is it included can it be 82 degrees at least 82 degrees yes it does it doesn't say more than 82 degrees it says that least so 82 is included so put the equal sign down there on the bottom set it up do your math minus 62.5 minus 0.5 so 19.5 is the answer what does that mean for us that means if we have 19.5 and we add it to the current temperature it would be at 82 degrees and that's the least we'd want for that basking spot so can it be something greater yes around is elizabeth greater cool can it be here in a situation where it's equal to yes let's practice this real quick now don't worry if you don't get it just practice much perfect sanjay has 65 to spend at the mall he bought a t-shirt for 18 and he built for 14. if sanjay wants a pair of jeans how much can he spend okay so let's give this real quick i'm going to go with 18 you know what he has spent for the belt and 14 where he had oh i'm sorry for the t-shirt and fourteen for the bounce that makes sense and he has 65 dollars now let's think about this can this is what he's going to spend over here's what he's spending and this is what he has so just think about this in your head somebody already had the answer where you know how to do this if i put this symbol here i'm just going to go with this one this is 65 is the most the bigger one can he spend 65 or more the 65 the upper limit that he can spend think about that is that the most he can spend since this is greater can he spend less if you think about this i say yes he can spend less over here i'm gonna reverse this symbol right here real quick this is how i'll do it you know i'm not i'm not professional i'm not the best at this thing so this one says this one's more and it's what he has that this one's less like think about this he can send more than what he has he can spend more than what he has okay let's look at the story again he has 65 to spend on them all so that's what he has that's all he has i don't think he can spend more he bought a t-shirt for 18 bucks and about for 14. he wants to put a pair of jeans how much can he spend with a pair of jeans right okay so let's look at this one can he spend more than 65 someone say no this setup would be wrong so this is the most he has and this one would be less do you agree so he can spend less right he also has this do you agree he also wants a pair of jeans i won't tell you this much can he spend all of 65 okay so you come back here um can you spend at the whole 65 i want to say yes he's just working that right here so i'm going to step to the side real quick so we're going to jade the castle jeans that he wants he already has spent 18 and 14 and he can't spend any more than that 65 is the most and he can't spend a whole 65. i'm going to add these up real quick you remind us of 12 32. so the jeans plus 32 is less than or equal to 65 minus 32 minus the issue that he's already spent for the shirt and the belt james uh 33 he can spend up to 33 for a pair of jeans pretty cool right he can buy jeans for a dollar two dollars all the way to 33 she can't go over 33 because then he'd be going over 65. okay so today we're doing 5 2 solving inequalities by multiplication and division and i'm going to tell you this much these things are the same they're basically the same i promise uh so if you know how to do one you want to do that remember i'm saying last time you add that's like subtracting or subtracting like adding because you're adding the negative same thing here if you're multiplying you're multiplying by a number if you're dividing you're multiplying by the inverse and that's it really simple so we're going to solve that and equates by multiplication solving and requires by using division now this so if you have a true statement here and you multiply each side by uh whatever number it stays true it has to be the same number right we know how to do that now what happens if you multiply by a negative okay so if i have a seven let me see how that was less than nine and i multiplied by a negative but what happens is if we multiply these out and we keep the symbols the same it's going to be wrong but look if i already keep this symbol the same is that true that's a false statement okay so for it to be true we're going to have to do this now when you multiply by a negative or divide by a negative you have to switch the inequality sign okay so here we go so just copy let me zoom out a little bit and i'll talk to you about it so you pause it here and i'm going to say i'm going to save it some time okay multiplication and division symbols okay so what this part says here if you have an inequality and it's true and you multiply by a positive number you keep the inequality sign the same that's it keep it the same here's another example 5 is greater than this one if i'm off by whatever number whatever number as long as it's the same the resulting thing is true so you leave it like that now if you multiply both sides by a negative number the direction of the quantity sign is reversed you have to reverse it guys you have to because otherwise it becomes the wrong statement so you see how this one's true right here if you have 7 is greater than 4.5 and i multiply by a negative 3 both sides we have to switch inequality around we have to you see from here to here and this is true this part is true now if you don't know how to understand about the natives how this one's bigger than that one you're thinking about it like this if i give you fifty dollars or a dollar which one would you grab wouldn't you grab this right here now grabbing like imagine a good hand to stick your hand grabbing it you always want the bigger one when it comes to money now looking at this real quick this is how i expand and if you don't like it i'm sorry but this is the way i explain it so you should have made it another way in sixth grade this one right here you owe twenty one dollars or you owe thirteen dollars either way you have to owe money because they're both those are your options i want you i'd rather oh yes so that's how that one is bigger okay if we get a number line i would go back i would get first off to a negative 13.5 before i line up out of 21. okay now the rule is on a number line if it's further to the right it's greater what do you mean sir so look at one and two which one's further to the right the two right so that one's greater same thing with the negatives on the number line if it's on the right hand side it's greater than the one on the left simple as that so when i think about numbers if you can't forget this part here don't worry about the idea just think about whatever that oh this or whatever oh that oh i'd rather oh that that's what's greater that's what you want okay now the rule is if you divide by a negative multiply by a negative it switches you understand that if you multiply by a negative you see i'm multiplying by negative and it switches and these are the rules for the division here's a division property same properties if you multiply in five okay by positive number the resulting decline is also true so um if i had 4.5 you see that and it's greater than 2.1 and i divide it by 3. dividing both sides by the same number it's still true inequality side stays the same now if i have this one this one's true and i divide by a negative six you need to switch around the inequality sign same principle same idea so if both sides of a true inequality are divided by a negative number the direction of the inequality sign is reversed to make the resulting inequality also true you guys can be aware of that that's the only rule you need to keep it's like solving an equation guys it's like solving you know what we've been doing since the first six weeks let's jump over here and start working on some examples first off they give you a workout i'm going to skip the word problem jump into here now look at this part real quick this one's my first idea that i'm working on the first one we're working with here okay so look at this just hear me see it as 3r is less than 21. how would i solve that one wouldn't i divide by three right in this situation i'm going to divide by three i multiply by uh one third okay and it would cancel out so you agree i'll divide by one 3. and see how division and multiplication are the same thing so you kind of the same rules apply here now how do i get rid of this right here remember i multiplied by the reciprocal guess i multiplied by the reciprocal which is this what seven over three so you can't stop this one here is negative so i'm multiplying by negative and that's what we're doing here we multiply by a negative reciprocal of this thing these would cancel out really good but guys please make sure you're multiplying by a negative inequality saying what switches there's your final answer okay the idea is did i multiply divide by a negative not if i got a negative answer i don't care about the negative answer i want to know did i multiply or divide by negative if i did then the inequalities sine switches everything stays true here you come right here set notation r is the answer such that r is greater than or equal i'm sorry greater than a negative 49. so we're negative 49. you see how it's going to the right goes to the right i'll try these real quick so look at this real quick i'm going to have n over 6 divided by um i'm sorry less than or equal to an 8. this one's being divided by a six so what i would do multiply if i multiply by six these would cancel out tell you the truth but still these are negative so i'm gonna multiply by a negative six so i'd multiply this by negative six when they multiply by negative six they cancel out the negativeness slash i'd have n since they're multiplied by a negative listing switches negative 48 number line here 48 negative you see this pointing to the right again my variable has to be on the left i'll shade it in and go to the right okay go back and recap since it's a negative i want to cancel that negative out so i multiply by negative since i multiplied by negative this inequality sign switches make sure you know that here we go uh four thirds negative times a p here negative ten so then i would honestly multiply by a negative three fourths the reciprocal multiplied by a negative three fourths four thirds flip it over three-fourths you got it negative times a negative give me a positive and that's what i wanted since i'm multiplying a negative and a negative okay it becomes a positive p since i multiply the negative times the whole thing this thing switches uh what does this give me and 30 over four oh what is that seven point five all right we'll give it right now so p is my answer so i'm going to go over here put my number line we're going to go with 30 over 4. the variable was on the left and goes to that equal sign shaded in no equal sign not sure here's our one-fifth and greater than or equal to a negative three [Music] let's look at this madness um what do i want to do here uh i want to get there all right so this side here i would multiply by five okay five over one guess which is five plus you're gonna write five multiply by five this cancels out here in the m i did not multiply by negative so the symbol stays the same negative 15. sir but you got negative 15 yes i did not multiply by a negative so this thing stays the same i don't care about what i get as the answer here i just care about do i multiply by a negative if i do multiply by negative this thing switches if i don't multiply by negative then it stays the same final answer for this one would be 15 here and you see how my variables on the left here equal shaded in go to the right here we have three eighths t less than five so we're gonna come in here and the same thing and we multiply it by a reciprocal of eight thirds multiplied by reciprocal of eight thirds this cancels out completely t is no multiplication by a negative so it stays the same this becomes 40 over 3. it gives me a weird number like 13 and one third so we should leave it like that so we're going to go with t we're going to graph this thing 40 over 3 and then we're going to go ahead and forgot that one to the left see a variable on the left that's my arrow which way to go left and then no shaded in and there it stays okay so i just went to the next example in the book so the situation right here you have this multiplication you want to divide right divide to go ahead and get that variable by itself 60 times t so you divide by 16. so in this situation we divide both sides by 60. guys we're not dividing by a negative so the inequality sign stays the same over here i will divide by n negative seven you see that divided by negative seven once we do that look what happens see from facing i guess to the right you can see it switches because we divided by negative okay let me try these real quick so the top right here i would have 8 p is less than a 58 again that's my 8 times p so i would divide by 8 divided by 8. this one gives me p is less than or equal to 58 over eight um i don't even know what that is what i can do is divide them by four no eight no so i'm going to simplify this real quick right twos right it gives me a 29 over four so this gives me 29 over four so we graph that one okay variables on the left i'm going to put here 29 over 4 and we're going to shade to the left arrow pointing us to that i did not divide by negative guys so it does not switch i did not divide by negative so the inequality sign does not switch okay so let's look at this real quick so you have a negative 42 divide um less than or greater than or equal to 6 r so i'm going to divide by 6 divided by 6. remember i want the variable for itself when i put 6 over 6 it gives me a 1. that's the idea if i get that i get a one r number we want that uh this gives me a negative seven here i got a negative guys but why didn't i switch here why did i not switch because i didn't divide by a negative so it's just coming here final answer add a negative seven variable is oh i almost got checked there let me rewrite this one r make sure the variables on the left put the negative seven over here you see that one right there guys how it's eating the seven so i'm gonna come on here and continue to eat that seven or negative seven so now this is the one i graph not this one that one's going to be if you did that one you could get it wrong since the r is on the left now and now i can say go to the left shade it in and there it is that's about right okay let's look at this real quick uh negative 12 h greater than equal greater than 15. okay so i want that variable alone and now look what i'm going to do here since i'm going to divide by negative 12 both sides cancels out we're going to have h this thing guys switches because i divided by negative um dividing both by three five over four and there it is negative five over four variable is on the left so i would say this way uh oh no shade i didn't know equal sign but i would point the arrow that way next over here i'm gonna go with negative one half and less than or equal to a six on the n by itself they're sneaky sneaky guys they want you to come out here and divide by a negative one-half i don't like that okay remember multiplication division are the same thing just multiply this one by the reciprocal which is a two over one we don't write two over one would you write the two this right here situation's a negative so multiply by a negative you have to okay now that part cancels out purposely and this thing switches and it becomes an a12 variable on the left pointing to the right so here you go to the right what's wrong with this one what's wrong with that last one right there guys equal sign show you there go once going twice okay that's your video for today uh we understood this perfect you have an assignment on alex hold on okay alex it's called five two have one get it done do it to it have fun enjoy it", "amG0L8F3NfU": "and the reason why we know it's linear is that it's the same gap between everyone everybody agree with that now this is a gap of minus 0.2 whatever the gap is always comes in front of the x so we already know it's a minus point two x plus big the next thing we need to do is we need to test one of the terms so we know that f one equals minus one everybody see that f one equals minus one or is it f zero it's actually f zero because of x equals zero so we actually have f zero equals minus one so plug in zero so minus point two times uh zero plus b equals minus one this implies b itself is equal to minus one and then what should happen next is this it should be that uh f x for this question f x for this question is gonna be minus point two x minus one all right you guys yeah i might just go back and hit one of them now all right so f1 uh sorry guys one more thing it's getting bigger by point two not getting smaller by point two would you agree with that so it's actually a it's actually a plus point two in this case 0.2 x take away 1. now the reason why i spotted that error was i was verifying my answer in my head so if you go to your calculator and you put in a if you put in point two x take away one and you start at zero and let's say for argument's sake end of five and just do a step of one you should find that all these numbers i'm about to go through have to match your list minus one minus point a minus point six so you should verify your answer before you move on okay so while we're here i'm gonna do part four okay just to hit the point home that we're starting off at zero okay so f x equals a x plus big in the case of part four are we going down five or up and five we're going down five so this one is most definitely a minus five so what do we do with the a value minus five x series plus b how do we know it starts at f zero again it's written in the language isn't it starts out zero so f zero will equal what guys f zero equals minus 2 so it's minus 5 times 0 plus b equals minus 2 just implies b equals minus 2. yes x greater than or equal to 0. if i said x squared and equal to one you'd start off with one and go both okay so that's the fine print is a bit weird because in sequences and series you only ever start off at one you start with t1 t2 but you guys haven't done that yet so you can easily get mixed up so make sure you read specifically what it says so what is the formula for this one called minus 5x yeah you can check your answers there zero will give you minus two one will give you minus seven two will give you minus twelve we're good to go all right all right let's do question six now all right all right first of all are these uh are these ones are linear more than lucky so that's the first one three how many in the next one six and then finally nine three six nine all right so three to six is to nine i would say you have to start off at one here can anybody tell me why you have to start off with one you have the first pattern the second pattern and the third pattern you can't have to zero pardon can no all right guys so here's what we're going to do so we're going to use that formula from earlier aren't we what was it it was a bx plus sorry ax plus b all right and what can we say the a value is which is three and what can we say uh f1 is f1 is three times one plus b and what's the answer tree just implies b equals implies f x equals three x there we kill uh because uh it says this is the first pattern that's the second part and that's the third part serial pattern won't exist in this case that's the main question they're a bit misleading you usually always start one but in that in question three you're asked to start a zero which is unusual but is what it is okay all right how many matchsticks in the how many matchsticks in this one then four after that eight after that twelve anybody now the answer already it's gonna be four x isn't it what's gonna be 4x if i wrote this out that'll be four x plus b and then it's gonna be four times one plus b and how many are in the first one four and once again you can see that b will end up being zero and we'll end up turning that into four x star here you guys i think the next one works out slightly differently though three five and seven this one's going to be slightly different all right so once again if i go back to my system okay what's the a value this time huh the a value this time is two because it goes up in two so a is two and what's uh f1 so to speak f1 equals three two plus b equals three so what does b equal in this case b equals one so the answer this time will be two x plus one is that all right you all good okay question seven i know you don't have to do it is it linear again is it all right let's uh highlight keywords here two different building plans plan a where it's 25 euro per month with a down payment of 70 quid plan b with repayments of 24 euro per month so i'll highlight plan b in a different color with down payment of 125. if x represents the number of months of the plan write an expression for each building plan write the number of representing a number sequence represent the cost for each month for the first four months after how many months would both plans have repaid to say a minute okay so alrighty so here's what i suggest we do what's plan a after one month how much have you spent after one month hundred and five okay so one month two months three months and four months okay so for this one for plan a it's going to be uh what do we say it's going to be 105 then after that out on another 35 after that after that 210. what about plan b how much would you spend in the first month all right after that add on 24s and on 24. 100 73 after that 197 and after that 220 one after how many months would both plans repay to same amounts have repaid i'm sick that's so first thing i'm going to do is going to establish two formulas for both plants i'm going to start off with the red plant and we're going to do the same trick we did in the last question what was the last question we did ax plus a what's the a value the gap in between them is thirty five thirty five x what about the billion amount at the initial amount was a hundred and five you don't need to do that again because you know you're gonna add on 105 don't you try it out one is when x equals one what do you get oh wait wait wait wait no i'm wrong actually because i'll explain why i'm wrong the system i'd be using there would start from x equals zero not x equals one so we will do our system after all so here's what we're gonna do okay ready so f x equals 25 x plus b and that equals 100 amps five f one equals y guys so f1 equals 105 so f1 equals 35 plus b equals 105 therefore b must equal and we're happy with equal 70 okay now that we know that b equals 70 what we can say here is that it's 25 x plus 70. quickly test it out when x equals 1 it's 105. when x equals 2 it's 140 and when x equals 3 it's 100 ounce 75 so we're sorry all right now we did the blue one how'd you do the blue one ax plus b so once again what's the gap this time 24x now what's f1 in this case f1 is 24 plus b equals 100 and 49 then b will equal that will be equal 100 well 125 125. sorry right you guys so what's the farmer for fx then 24x plus 100 ants test it ones if you put in x equals two it'd be 48 plus 125 which will give you a hundred and seventy three we'll start we want to find out after how many months both plans will be equal to each other so when does the red plan equal the blue plan how do you write that when does 35x plus 70 equal 24x plus 100 and 25. move them to one side and we go what's that 11x equals 55 and after that x equals 5. x equals 1 was the end of the end of one month x equals two is the end of two months therefore x equals five will be the end of five months everybody get percent and the end of five months think about it imagine you start it's like zero to one one is x equals one at the end of the first month is x equals one at the end of uh just at the end of the second month is x equals two and then that carries all the way down doesn't it what's the two to three is x equals three three to four is x equals four and finally the end of the fifth month is x equals five everybody all right question 8 is a quadratic sequence huh about awesome all right question eight a biologist counted the number of bacteria grown in culture every hour four seven fourteen twenty five and forty all right colonel what's the gap yeah and then what's the difference of the differences this implies that this is a quadratic equation are we called that what's your tn formula for our quadratic equation i'll say what's your yeah it's this is no i gave you just here today a n squared plus let's see okay we got that now does it say x does it give us it says t we'll just change them to t's at the end is that okay so every hour so t1 would be the first hour at the end of the first hour t2 is at the end of the second hour t trees at the end of the third hour g4 is ending fourth hour so right basically t equals t equals one would be a result of if t equals one f one equals four if we kill that if t equals two which means at the end of two hours f two would be what goes seven yes oh sorry he oh sorry he started with four so t zero is four yeah that's perfect sorry my bad uh because the bacteria can't appear out of nowhere and you have to start off with a certain amount of bacteria to grow the bacteria in this specific case you would use t equals zero and not t equals one i think the hardest part of the question is is choosing whether you're starting off a zero or one seems to be the hardest part so once again we go back if the bacteria don't appear of thin air you need bacteria to start the experiment off so it's actually f zero equals four and then it's going to be f one equals two good man yes i just signed the journal and you know what to do f1 equals seven everybody okay with that okay now what's the uh what's the a value so what i'm going to do in this question is i'm going to change the uh equation to this see my tn equation i'm going to change it to this ft equals a t squared plus bt plus c are we good with that because we're not using n and we'll start off with n equals one so i have to re-specify this to start off at t equals zero okay now what's the a value half the second difference so the a value is going to be two everybody caught that so it's going to be 2 t squared plus bt plus c all right now we're going to have to start off with what you told me start off with f 0. is that okay so what do we do for f zero guys two times zero squared plus b times zero plus c equals four this implies c equals four after we do f zero what's the next step we do f1 where you replace t with one so f1 would be uh two times one squared plus b times one plus c equals seven b plus c that's a two on the left bring it to the right and it becomes a minus two so b plus c equals five we already know that c equals four so this implies b equals one we all good now i should test my equation to make sure it works so i'm going to write down the full equation here it's going to be 2t squared plus 1t plus 4. i'm going to take out my calculator i'm going to put in the table function using x's okay because that's the only thing i have to work with and i'm going to start at zero correct and if it doesn't work out then i know something's gone wrong start at zero and i'll end the five step of one all right how's the numbers i want zero four one seven two fourteen and finally three twenty five are they the numbers we started off with yes they are i'm in business means i got all right okay i'll pause there so what we did was we got a formula for the number of i should have read that for being the initial number present so hence specifying t zero is four show that this sequence contains both a linear and quadratic elements okay what's that what's the quadratic element we just got it didn't we the number of bacteria is the quadratic elements however the linear element is waka is the linear element is the time because time goes zero one two three and four time is linear the amount of bacteria is quadratic using f of t and trial and error find in which error the colony you will reach 520 9. there's a lazy way of doing this there's two ways there's trial and error but we don't have to use trial and error because we have to super calculator so i'll show you what i mean in a second get out your calculator put in the form that the red form that okay farmland where does it go you go start at zero end of 20 step of one keep going through the list until you find the number you're looking for what did you say it was what did he want 500 ant 529 happened somewhere between 15 and 16 would you agree with that at 20. because you didn't know i was 15. so would everybody agree it happened somewhere between the 15th and 16th hour does that make sense now how would you show that in the exam here's how you cheat your way to showing this what i would say is i'll just go oh look i tried f15 i say 2 times 15 squared plus 1 times 15 plus 4 and i say oh that gave me an answer of 400 and 69 then i'd go okay next thing i did was i tried f-16 and then the examiner will well know that he only took the fact you only took two attempts means you definitely use the calculator but that doesn't matter because you showed your workings and then 529 we've surpassed that haven't we and we've got 530 two okay the second method for doing this is the minus b formula where ft equals 532 so you're gonna get two t squared plus one t plus four equals five hundred and thirty two bring it over either sides we already know it doesn't go unevenly so it's two t squared plus one t uh minus five hundred and twenty eight equals zero some of you do the minus b formula for me you should get a a is two b is one minus b is minus one column you do the minus b formula for me in the calculator i'll write down what you have to do okay it's going to be minus one plus or minus why do i not need to be concerned with the minus answer why do i not need to be concerned with the minus answer has to be a positive number for time okay so only putting the positive number at the start so i even bother with the minus and what we do next is we do uh b squared which is a one squared plus four ac which is two by minus five two eight you already know the answer has to be between fifteen and sixteen if it isn't there's an issue yes just signed a journal apparently all right just give me a second there's another chance the calculator made an error which is which would be highly unusual but look we'll give it a go so i'm going to just go for 2 times 16 squared uh plus 16 i'm just going to do it manually usually calculator isn't valuable and followable well here we go let's uh let's try it out that is not zero it appears my calculator is broken awesome very time for that to happen so in that case the answer is t equals 16. lads did anybody when you put it into your own calculator did you guys get five to nine on your list interesting i'm gonna try plan b here i'm gonna use the second calculator and we're gonna see if something just went wrong with my software martin i think it is two t squared plus one t plus four isn't it okay we started here uh we start at zero we end at 20 and we go open once and when i go through my list i'm looking for 529 it shouldn't exist it doesn't it goes straight to 530 2. in which case somebody um might have messed up with the minus b farmer so we'll try this again minus one plus square roots one squared this is not explainable two times -528 all over two times two and 16 on the money no it's all right it's gonna it's not 532 it's 529 read the question again it's 529 532 is what i got in my 532 is what i got in my in my answer so change change the c value what's the new c value the new c value is 525 change that to a five and therefore it cannot be it cannot be 16 on the money it's impossible 15.95 which is essentially the 16th hour what happens in between the 15th and 16th hour yes damn cake", "5FB5dgcVjUs": "all right so to find help to find out how much me servings of marinara sauce this will make what I'm going to do is I'm going to find out how many ounces of marinara sauce it makes total then just divide it by 4 to get find out how many portions so start with 16 throw with 12 pounds if it needs 12 pounds I'm going to set up a proportion 12 pounds is how many ounces I'm going to put X X ounces now I know that 1 pound is 16 ounces 16 ounces in 1 pound so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to just cross multiply x times 1 and 12 times 16 and that will give me 192 ounces 192 ounces the next ones of all tablespoons so I'm gonna come down here there's 16 tablespoons in one cup I also know one cup is 8 ounces so I'm going to do 16 tablespoons and 1 cup I have 2 tablespoons in this and the recipe how many cups is it and use x again cause multiply 16 times X 1 times 2 sixteen X is equal to 2 I divide both sides by 16 I'm gonna get 2 over 16 which is equal to 1/8 now I'm gonna trick change that into ounces so I have 1/8 cup that's gonna be how many ounces come and look down here one cup is 8 ounces so one cup is equal to 8 ounces easy cross multiply 1 8 times 8 X times 1 now x times 1 is just X 1 8 times 8 well that's just going to be 1 so 1 ounce so you can see that 2 tablespoons is equal to 1 ounce so this is gonna equal 1 ounce same thing here one else 1 tablespoon well that's half as much so that just going to be half an ounce these are easy 4 ounces for ounces eight ounces two tablespoons well we know that that's equal to one ounce one tablespoon we know that that's equal to 1/2 ounce and if I add these all up I'm going to get two hundred and twelve ounces but do you know how many 4-ounce portions so we're just going to divided by 4

ratio between fluid ounces and tablespoons is 1/2 to 1 fluid ounce equals two tablespoons so if we wanted to do a conversion and let's say we were given three fluid ounces we're going to set up a proportion so we know that for every one fluid ounce there are two tablespoons I'm going to set up a proportion if I have three fluid ounces I'm going to make sure that they're matched up ounces ounces tablespoons tablespoons so I'm going to put my three in the numerator with my other ounces and I don't know how many tablespoons because that's what I'm trying to convert to so I'm going to put a variable there now I have a proportion that I'm going to solve by cross-multiplying so I'm doing x times 1 equals X bring down my equal sign 2 times 3 equals 6 so in 3 fluid ounces there are six tablespoons so the way to do fluid ounce to tablespoon conversion is by setting up the ratio one to two one fluid ounce for every two tablespoons and then creating a proportion and solving it",

bears write a few sentences describing the distribution of body length be sure to comment on shape Center and spread of the distribution the distribution of the data is relatively symmetrical the typical body length of the Bears in the group is about 60 inches there is a lot of variability of body lengths of the Bears in this group the length of the Bears in this group range from between 35 inches and 85 inches number two which data set is more likely to produce a histogram with a symmetric distribution explain your reasoning data on the number of seconds on a tract of music and a pop album or data on the number of seconds spent talking on the phone yesterday by everyone in the school data on the number of seconds on a tract of music and a pop album is more likely to be symmetrical because many of the songs are close in length some students won't talk much on their phone while other students might talk on the phone a lot number three decide if each data set might produce one or more gaps when represented by a histogram for each data set that you think might produce gaps briefly describe or give an example of how the values in the data set might do so a the ages of students in a sixth-grade class since the ages of students in a sixth grade class are all very similar there would be no gaps be the ages of people in an elementary school yes there will be a gap in the data the data set will include observations between five and twelve representing the students ages and the data set will also include observations over 18 representing the adult staff there will be a gap between 12 and 18 because there are no people in an elementary school who are 13 14 15 16 and 17 years old see the ages of people eating in a family restaurant and the ages of people who watch football yes there may be a gap between the ages of parents and their children eating in the family restaurant and no there probably won't be a gap in the ages of people who watch football because people of all ages watch football d the ages of runners and a marathon yes there may be gaps in the data because a few people in their early teens might run and a few people in their 70s or 80s might run in the marathon most of the runners are likely to be between 20 and 50 or 60 number for evaluate the expression for X to the 3rd power for each value of X a when the value of X is worth 1 when the value of X is worth 1 your going to substitute the X with a 1 so you'd have 4 times 1 to the 3rd power instead of 4 times X to the 3rd power and 4 times 1 to the 3rd power is the same as 4 times 1 times 1 times 1 and that equals 4 so when the value of x is worth 1 for X to the 3rd power is equal to 4 B when the value of X is equal to 2 when the value of x is 2 you're going to substitute the X with a 2 have four times two to the third power and four times two to the third power is 4 times 2 times 2 times 2 since 2 times 2 times 2 is 8 you'd multiply 4 times 8 and that would equal 32 so when the value of x is worth 2 4 to the X to the third power is equal to 32 see when the value of x is equal to 1/2 when the value of x is equal to 1/2 you're going to substitute the X with a 1/2 so 4 times X to the 3rd power would be 4 times 1/2 to the third power and 4 times 1/2 to the third power is the same as 4 times 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2 and 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2 is equal to 1/8 so 4 times 1/8 would be the same as 4 eighths and four eighths is equal to 1/2 so when x equals 1/2 4 times X to the third power equals 1/2 number five Jayda drank 12 ounces of water from her bottle this

this because I had the wire hanger go over the corners of this because the front plate like this broke off so I wasn't able to put a hanger through there but I did find a little tab on the back side that I could slide the hanger in front of it actually is removable but I need my players I don't really I don't think I have oh here we go but it comes out it's from the plate is removable so if this shorts out or anything I can change it easily just put some new plates on it all right so all right so I here I have just over a ground before you get started I always like to squish it through so it doesn't slide around when I'm pressing it so I'll just go ahead and before it's turned on it's not hot and the nice little talk like that might even just press these together [Applause] when I try and stick it these together and then I'm gonna turn this off after all right so what I have here is just some parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and that wax paper all right so I got you squished together let me see what a good there we go nice and frosty all right so you want to make sure you got all the debris off of the parchment paper that'll be in your roster what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it on this side and then I'm going to probably squeeze it squish it about 2:1 once the two more times turn this on first I'll let it warm up and I will get back to you guys when it's warmed up all right guys I'm back and it's all heated up we're good to go so I just put that right there in the middle close to the edge and I want to put it all the way at the edge because I want to get you guys a shot of it through the side seeing all those good juices fall out so I wanted to do just realize I made a left-handed vise grip press all right so get it in there push it towards the back yeah let me see if I can focus into that all right you just keep pressing you hear some sizzling might that go on for a little bit you actually can see someone coming out right there it's bubbling all right and then release that was a good one and as you can see right there this works just as good as the real deal and I can probably squish this about once more looks like I got a lot of it so I'll go ahead and do that are you guys here I'm gonna do another close-up of the Rosen oops snapped this one's a little longer it's gonna sizzle and then you're gonna see some coming out on the edges squeeze a little bit more and then release there's really no timing for this I mean pretty much the school by ear line as you go if you haven't done this before all right so I'm gonna throw this in the freezer real quick and then I'll just try to get it all stuck together then I'll show you guys once it's a hardened alright I'm back again and I'll just show you this real quick a little close-up on this the Nugget that I pressed you can see some oil this is gonna be left behind you know can't really help that it's just a little bit though this is not completely done though you can actually probably press this one more time and after it's brown and decarboxylated you'll be able to you can just pretty much eat this like a chip grind it up put it in some coffee I mean look at a lake at least a little high depending on how much you ingest cannabis so I did go ahead and I threw this in the freezer for about 30 seconds and the dial on hot plates was about at a 10 to 15 so about half way you can see that this is a nice golden color this is right here is the first one and you can see how just [ __ ] gorgeous this is it is a bit warming a show it is still kind of gooey but I threw it in the freezer so I could hurt it a little bit when I scrape it this down here is the second round not bad at all for just over your grand all right so I am gonna scrape this and I will get back to you guys so in order to make this easier for you guys what you're gonna want to do is put a little bit of water and a baggie freeze it and then put the parchment paper on top of that baggie and start scraping it's going to make it a whole lot easier it's going to come up with ease thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it and you any questions or comments comment down

breakfast getting ready to do some duck hunting and there's something I wanted to talk about here real quick see I got a couple couple boxes sitting out here got Winchester Super X this is 3-inch one on one 8-ounce load of number two shot and then I also have some very cheap nine dollars and forty nine cents at my local Dick's Dick's Sporting Goods Field & Stream 12-gauge steel shot and if you look one and 1/8 ounce load of number two shot three-inch also so this is steel shot this is still shot that's what you have to use for duck huntin if you're not familiar and I just wanted to show you this you know Winchester is a reputable brand you know I know this is their budget stuff okay but this is more than this so even though this is their budget stuff III have a problem with this we shoot wood ducks here in southeast North Carolina nothing but wood ducks very rarely do we see any mallards but uh you know there's I can already hear it all to shot for wood ducks Wow well that's what I shoot we shoot a lot of passing birds there hi I need to get distance I like this because all we need one pellet one pellet makes contact I'm good to go anyway I can already hear some more comments are gonna be made about well you need to shoot better well coming up with me and if you can hit a wood flying 60 mile an hour through the timber great teach me but until I see some videos of you dropping wood ducks left and right in the timber let's just not go there this has nothing to do with that this is strictly a video about how poorly this stuff is made it's horrible it's the most useless junk that I have ever fed through my shotgun yes I have killed ducks with this don't get me wrong it will still kill them but I'm just blown away by the absolute trash that they're putting in these shells so I wanted to show you now just so you know this is the same shot 3-inch one in one eight thousand umber two same thing let's go with this fielding stream if you can read that one and 1/8 ounce 3-inch number-two shot these are the same kind of same kind of rounds now I'm doing this with my phone in the left hand work with my right so let's see how this works here I'll show you this shot alright I've counted these pellets this Winchester right here sorry this Winchester round right here has 121 pellets in it okay now let's take a closer look what do you see there is that nice round symmetrical pieces of steel shot no look good lord egg shape divot spits I mean look at that stuff and then my phone's not focusing great but I think that pretty much speaks for itself just look at it yeah it'll fly yeah if you hit your target it will probably go go in the inside and and cause some damage and yeah it'll probably cause a little more damage but I've done some tests with this stuff and at 40 yards which is a long shot and no doubt these will stick and I mean just barely stick into a piece of particle board you can rake your hand down the front of it and they'll fall off now let's take a look at the nine dollar field and stream shot and let's see if we can see a difference oh wow oh wow we have here nice symmetrical round looks like possibly even coated zinc coated possibly pieces of steel that is beautiful now any of you with a brain will be able to look at these two and know that one will fly truer will hold a better pattern and well one of them simply has more mass these being so odd shaped with pits all in them they're not gonna be consistent in weight by no means whereas these are so your shot string if you don't know what shot string is when you shoot a shotgun some pellets go out faster than others so let's pretend like this piece of paper towel is a body of water if you aim right here and shoot pellets we'll hit from here to way out here in a stream this is going to have a longer shot stream okay so you'll have a lot of slow pellets and some fast pellets the ones that are more round will fly faster because they'll cut through the wind better these pellets with all these funky divots and crevices and hits and at all this gum they're not gonna fly as good they're gonna you know good lord if you took a flat foot ball and threw it it's gonna it's gonna tell it whereas a round ball that's why to use round balls in muskets they fly they flew straighter and I've sat down and looked at these very closely when I was counting them they're very consistent they're they're virtually identical they almost look like I mean they almost look like bb's that you would buy for your child's BB gun they're so truly symmetrical compared to these come on Winchester what are you doing scraping this mess up off the floor tossing it in the shotgun shell and charging us $12 a box for it these guys ain't and just so you know this stuff imma show you assembled in the USA Fiocchi of America so this stuff it's pretty much Fiocchi branded for dicks with fielding string that's all it is but it's two dollars cheaper than this okay this says fifteen hundred feet per second this says 1550 I will guarantee you that that fifty feet per second is so greatly diminished by the poor quality of shot now there were too much shotguns and it doesn't take nothing great but if you knew how many wood ducks that I have lost this year shooting this junk right here I got these boxes just the other day and it was it was amazing the difference immediately I was shooting the same type of shots taking the same type of shot same distances but these birds shot with this shot they were just they were dying a lot quicker I didn't have as many cripples nowhere near as many cripples yeah if I was a great shooter and I could you know force pellets coming out of a tube to go exactly where I wanted them to go every time I would make one of these pellets hit the duck right in the head and that would be the end of it but I'm a human being so when I pulled the trigger on a shot they just kind of that's what happens I've got a extended range pattern master choke I'm not shooting you know junk equipment but I was shooting junk shot no doubt about it so I doubt I buy any more of this because I didn't really realize it I've never took any apart and paid any attention I've just shot it but this year we've had such a bad time losing cripples you know it's almost to the point to where when I go hunting my limits three birds I want to drop four or five because if I do maybe I find three because right here lately we're losing four to five Birds a trip me and my buddy that went over the morning we two of us we dropped six Birds we stopped shooting we found three we got some of this shot we went back and the very first day we shot this shot we dropped six birds we found five okay the sixth one was crippled and we had to shoot the water the difference was just unbelievable I just wanted to show the the shot that should speak volumes how beautifully round and symmetrical that shot is compared to this this just looks like they scraped it up off the floor when they were making whatever they're making and throwed it in here now let me address this they have hexagonal shot that's stacked inside of a shell to create more wound channels worse deeper wound channels or more violent wound channels in the ducts that's great no I haven't had good patterns with that stuff you may have and that's fine but when you buy steel shot that's meant to be round balls just like this none of these are even the same size I can't even look at these two for example let's pull these out this is not gosh knows this is hard to do I see cracks and some of this stuff if I can get him a stay still this is number two shot now let's talk to me I've got a possibly a number one or even a BB mixed in with the number two this one shot here is completely cracked in half I don't know if I was gonna be able to show you this but I'm gonna try yeah it's not gonna focus but that pellet right there is crack down the middle so it's probably bust open when it comes down the barrel I'm just shocked okay I had to post this because I'm so stunned yeah I know this is a I noticed a budget shot there's no doubt about that this is ridiculous Winchester my god you can do it why can't you your Winchester for God's sake make some good shot I can't afford to buy heavy shot where I would I can't afford to buy freaking dry locks at $18 a box at my local Walmart when I shoot a box a day you know we're not shooting decoying mallards so it's not simple killer would I shoot a lot of shells okay this stuff will now be my go-to shot if I have to order it I will order it this is just junk look at it okay I had to post that that's my rant I'm done I'm over we'll see you guys on the next video", "ZVvMviOSXLY": "this is a little very little as you can see as compared to my hand digital scale and this scale can weigh everything up to about 6.6 pounds and that is equivalent to 3 kilograms so this is a smaller smaller size scale and it's meant for weight for wings small amounts of things it comes with these two pieces which you can turn over and use as receptacles for putting things into way and then when you're all done with the scale that one fits on there and then you can just slide the scale in here and it's kind of like a protective case which is an ingenious idea this scale comes with two double-a batteries so everything is ready to go out of the box you just put in the batteries and you're ready to go it has an on/off button it has a changing your measurement scale pieces button and then it also has a tare button so for the modes you can there are four different modes that you can weigh things in so right now I don't know if you can see it but there's a tiny little G and that means grams then it can go two ounces and as you see it comes out to three decimal places which is really nice and then it's got CT and that is a carat weight and that's used for gemstones I don't have much experience with that other than I know what that stands for and then you have GN which is grain weight and I have zero experience with that and as a matter of fact I had to look that up online to see what GN stood for so grain weight is very small and I don't know what you would use it for I bet most people who get this are going to be using the grams or the ounces I know that's what I'll be using so I want to go over this tear button with you in case you're not familiar with how that works but the tare button does is it allows you to measure things when they're in a vessel without measuring the weight of the vessel so I'm going to go ahead and put that on there and this way is one point four eight five ounces so then I'm going to hit the tare button and it will zero out and so now it will weigh what I'm going to put in the vessel without weighing the vessel so my pen weighs 0.4 ounces so then when you're all done you take the whole thing off and now it's registering a negative number you just hit the tare button again and then you're back to zero so operation is very simple on this there's not a lot of ways to mess it up and before you just so you have a true idea of how big this scale is it is exactly 5 inches by 4 inches and the plate itself I believe is this is going to come out at 4 yeah 4 by 4 inches is the the plate itself and its profile off the table is about 3/4 of an inch", "o_RGzWnILag":

make of each fragrance so let's say we want to make six straight sided tumblers using our cactus flower in Jade the next step is to determine how much each of those containers holds and for that you can reference our website now keep in mind you should always weigh your materials on a scale as opposed to measuring by volume or in fluid ounces we will list the wax weighed for each container that we carry on the product page now that we know that each of these containers hold 8.5 ounces of wax by weight we can multiply that by the number of candles we're making in order to determine how much wax we need total so for this example 8.5 ounces times 6 is 51 ounces of wax so the next step is to determine how much fragrance oil you're gonna need and that does get a little bit more complicated we recommend starting at a 6% fragrance load which is roughly 1 ounce of fragrance for every pound of wax but you can go higher depending on how much your wax can hold and you will always find this information listed on the product page for your wax once you decide on your fragrance oil percentage you can use that number to determine the overall amount of fragrance oil you're going to need for your project and no matter what the batch size this formula is always going to be the same you take your percentage of fragrance oil multiply that by your amount of wax and it's going to give you the amount of oil you need for your project now this is where the math gets a little bit intimidating so don't be afraid to pull out your phone or use a calculator to help you with some of this precise math you may find it easier to convert that percentage into a decimal first and to do that you just divide it by 100 so 6% turns into point zero 6 if you're using 7% would be point zero seven eight percent so point zero eight and so on and so forth but again for this example we're gonna stick with six percent so if you take that point zero six and multiply it by the 51 ounces of wax that we need you're gonna get 3.06 ounces of fragrance and that's the amount you need for your project now mini scales will not be that precise with their calculations so it's okay to round up or down slightly but you're aiming for that three point zero six so now we know we need 51 ounces of wax for this project we need three point zero six ounces of fragrance and that's what we're gonna use to pour these six straight sided tumblers well thanks for watching everybody I hope this video helps you to calculate the amount of wax and fragrance oil you're gonna need for your next project if you liked the video

grams into kilograms so here's the shortcut method well first you need to know that one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams so that is our conversion factor so therefore if we want to convert from kilograms to grams all you need to do is multiply by 1,000 and if you wish to convert from grams to kilograms what you need to do is divide by a thousand so that's the quick and simple way to get the answer but for those of you who want to show your work is what you can do so let's say we have four point eight kilograms let's go ahead and convert that into grams so start with what you're given which is four point eight kilograms now in the next fraction and we need to use our conversion factor we want to set it up in such a way that the unit kilograms cancel leaving behind the unit grams so notice that we have the unique kilograms on the top part of the first fraction we want to put that same unit on the bottom so this portion of the conversion factor is going to go on the bottom so I'm going to write one kilogram on the bottom and this part is going to go on the top so by setting up this way we can see that the unit kilograms will cancel leaving behind the unit grams and so that's how we can convert from kilograms to grams so because this number is on the top of the fraction we're going to multiply four point eight by a thousand if this was on the bottom we would divide by a thousand so it's four point eight times a thousand which is four thousand eight hundred grams so that's the answer for this example for the sake of practice try these two go ahead and convert 0.37 for kilograms into grams and convert point zero five six kilograms into grams so let's start with the first example so the setup is going to be the same we're gonna put one kilogram on the bottom and a thousand grams on top so it's going to be point three seven four times a thousand which is three hundred and seventy four grams so that's the answer for the first example for the second we're going to follow the same process we're going to multiply point zero five six kilograms by one thousand grams over one kilogram so point zero five six times a thousand that's gonna be fifty six grams so now you know how to convert from kilograms to grams but now let's work backwards let's convert grams to kilograms so let's say we have 4.5 grams how many kilograms is that so keep in mind one kilogram is a thousand grams when you want to go from grams to kilograms you need to divide but let's set it up first so notice that we have the unit grams on top this time this part of the conversion factor will go on the bottom the other part is going to go on the top and the reason is so that we can cancel the unit grams because we don't want that anymore we want the unit kilograms so we want this unit to remain so notice that the thousand is on the bottom of the second fraction so this time we're gonna divide by a thousand so it's four point five divided by a thousand which you can move the decimal point three units to the left that's going to give us point zero zero four five kilograms so that's how you can convert from grams to kilograms so here are two practice examples that you could try convert 16 grams into kilograms and go ahead and convert 500 grams into kilograms so let's start with the first one we're gonna write it as 16 grams over 1 just like before we're gonna put the 1000 grams on the bottom and 1 kilogram on top of the second fraction these units will cancel and it's gonna be 16 divided by thousand or just move the decimal point three units to the left and so you should get point zero one six kilograms for the next one it's going to be 500 grams over one times from one kilogram per a thousand grams so it's 500 divided by thousand which is going to be point five kilograms so that's basically it for this video now you know how to convert from grams to kilograms and kilograms to grams", "KrM5U2kGQCc": "hi I'm Roy Huntington editor of American handgun ER magazine a lot of my readers are really concerned about self defense and home protection basically defending their families of course in these crazy times I think it's wise to at least be thinking about those things a lot of people have bought a short-barreled defensive shotguns lately in order to defend their home a lot of my readers asked should I buy buckshot should I buy slugs should I buy birdshot I'm just really confused can you help me now keep in mind this isn't a comprehensive training video about how to effectively deploy a shotgun in a combat situation all I want to do is give you just a real quick look at the basic differences between buckshot which in this case is nine pellets about 32 or 33 caliber my left hand I have a typical two and three-quarter inch number eight shot 12-gauge something that you would go dove hunting with now which one is most effective in your home defense shotgun a few things you need to keep in mind buckshot will penetrate just like you were shooting a 380 automatic or a nine-millimeter it'll penetrate multiple walls inside of your house more than likely now if you live alone and out in the woods then that may not be a problem but if you have family members in the house or neighbors who are close by over penetration is a serious problem and something you need to think about and that's maybe where birdshot is a good option birdshot since it's very small bb's tend to under penetrate now that doesn't mean they're ineffective against an unprotected bad guy we actually took buckshot and took number eight shot and shot it at a target that was about five yards away what I want you to pay attention to is the fact that at close range they're virtually equally effective now granted you can argue that the buckshot may be more effective because it'll penetrate better and I won't argue the point with you but if you're concerned about over penetration you're concerned about other family members in the house being armed with 12-gauge shotgun loaded with number eight birdshot will absolutely protect you and your family okay we made these two shots at about five yards and this is an old Remington 870 police trading shotgun and it's got a cylinder bore so there's essentially no choke whatsoever it's pretty short barreled and it's pretty typical of a lot of the home defense type shotguns that you buy nowadays made by Remington or mosburger but not only anybody like that well we've learned here is we have number eight birdshot here and then we have double-aught buckshot over here what I'm trying to show you here is the fact that at five yards which is essentially across the room if you're using this as a defensive shotgun this is actually very significant and you'll see the majority of the shot are clustered right in here and this is what's called a rathole effect wound this is where a large portion of the shot actually went through causing a very significant wound over here of course you have the 32 33 caliber pellets that have spread out in a little bit of a distance this may be more effective for you because it does cover a larger area and at these distances both would be very lethal and would more than likely stop any threat that you had so if you have a sporting shotgun there's certainly nothing wrong I feel to use birdshot of some kind at close range home defense situations the additional advantage of that is the fact that the birdshot generally won't over penetrate and won't pass through two or three walls the buckshot being solid lead 32 or 33 caliber projectile tends to really penetrate and that could endanger neighbors or family members in other rooms so you need to think about this personally and do a little experimenting likely we did here with your shotgun just to see what kind of patterns but make a wise decision always be safe to be sure of your target make sure you have a light if possible get some training all we wanted to do is just give you something to think about here i'm roy huntington and thanks for tuning in you [Music]", "TdqAA9Ky2DY": "Eight,\nSixteen, Twenty-four,\nThirty-two, Forty,\nForty-Eight, Fifty-Six,\nSixty-Four, Seventy-two,\nEighty,

B here for the first part of math DBA to review make sure you read how this is going to work and have your parent print and sign this bring it back and forth to school each day and check my YouTube video each day for the next round of questions that we're gonna go over start by making sure you understand you got your formulas right here I want you to make a change to the formula chart we talked about the formula for area of a triangle area equals one-half times base times height my version is area equals base times height divided by two there it is it's a little easier to work with same thing with area of a trapezoid half times base one plus base two times height it's a little easier if you do area equals base one plus base two times height and then divide the whole thing by two divided by two is the same thing as multiplying by 1/2 so make sure to change those up also volume equals Big B times H Big B means area of the base area is found with length times width so my version of the formula for volume of rectangular prism is volume equals length times width times height okay the height is the same the length in the width comes from area of the base capital B means area of the base area of the base of a rectangle is length times width so these are the ones we used in class because they work a little better than using this version okay so make sure you check your formula charts and you may need some of your conversions as you work through these okay alright number 1 Frank had $65 he spent $2 per day for 7 days then he was given $9 to divide equally between himself and his two brothers the following expression can be used to find the amount of money Frank had after that so they gave you the expression you didn't even have to build it it's multiple operations there's subtraction multiplication addition and division you need to use PEMDAS when you have multiple operations so I rewrote it in its original form I'm using PEMDAS here I do not have any parentheses I do not have any exponents the next part is multiply or divide not multiply then divide multiply or divide whichever comes first left to right so multiplication is what I should do first so 2 times 7 is what I did first that's where the 14 comes from so I just left everything else alone 65 minus 14 plus 9 divided by 3 all right multiply or divide still no parentheses no exponents no adding and subtracting yet because I still have a division to do so multiply or divide whichever comes first left to right division is left so 9 divided by 3 is 3 left everything else alone 65 minus 14 plus 3 all right add or subtract not add first then subtract it's whichever comes first as you move left to right so subtraction comes first I've got to do 65 minus 14 first to get 51 then add the 3 if you add 14 plus 3 first and get 17 and then do the subtraction it's gonna be wrong 54 is what you want and there it is all right number 2 a baby weighed 7 0.25 pounds at birth at the end of 8 months the baby weighed two and a half times its birth weight how many pounds of the baby way at the end of a just read this literally two and a half times its birth weight here it is two and a half two point five times the birth weight seven point two five that's what you want two point five times seven point two five so here it is seven point two five times two point five do not line up decimals when you're multiplying you move the decimal back after you're multiplying this is not addition of decimals or subtraction of decimals you don't have to line up the decimal so do your multiplication carefully there were three total decimal places in the original problem right here one two and three so I'll move it back one two and three eighteen point one two five just multiplying some decimals there that's all we're doing all right number three is a big problem takes up the whole page but it's not hard all right Hector surveyed all the sixth graders at his school about their favorite after-school activity the table shows the results that were used to make a bar graph all right forty four people picked reading 55 picks sports 55 pick videogame 66 picked music so what percentage bar graph best represents the data forget what you see down here it's asking you out of your data what percent was reading what percent was sports what percent was videogames what percent was 55 okay so you'll need to take these and change them to percents eventually but it was 44 out of what we don't know so we got to add them all up first so here I added them all up there's a total of 220 that means 44 out of 220 picked reading 55 out of 220 pick sports also 55 out of 220 picked videogames and 66 out of 220 picked music so let's go find an answer choice that matches that you can rule out the first answer choice immediately because you can count from 0 to 10 so there's 10 there's ten more that's 20 and this is halfway between 20 and 30 so that's 25 25 percent if you count this one go backwards start at 50 50 to 40 is 10 40 to 30 is 10 and there's five more that's another 25 if you count the percentages they're all 25 we know it can't be correct because these are these are not all the same it's sports and video games are the same 55 out of 220 but music and reading is not so if they're not all the same fractions then they're not all the same percents you can rule answer choice out any at no time answer choice B you can rule it out really fast music is gonna be the biggest percent because it's the most out of 220 but think about half 66 out of 220 is way less than half half of 220 is a hundred and ten so if a hundred and ten out of 220 is 50% there's no way 66 out of 220 could be 65 percent which is over half so music is the biggest but there's no way that it's that big you can roll that out quickly C and D are very similar so you have got to calculate the exact percentages otherwise it's nothing but a guessing game so I'd figure it out ahead of time that reading was gonna be the smallest these two were gonna be equal and music was gonna be the largest and when I look at these two it looks like reading is the largest in both it looks like these two are pretty equal in both and it looks like music is the largest in both but that's not good enough I don't want to just randomly choose between C and D I need specifics so I calculated them down here I took my 66 out of 220 I need to turn it into a percent I can just take 66 and divide it by 220 if I want to that's an easy way to do it it's gonna give me a decimal and I can take that decimal and turn it into a percent but fractions were pretty easy too I noticed they're both even so I divided them by two I noticed that both of these could be divided by 11 so that gave me 3/10 and then I'm trying to make it a percent so I wanted the nominator of 100 so I multiplied them both by 10 and 30 out of 100 is 30% so music is 30% so when I look at this one they're both 30% 70 to 80 that's 10 so 10 20 30 10 20 30 so that didn't then help me a whole lot there all right music is definitely 30% but that's the same in both answer choices so I did reading I noticed that they're both even so they can both be divided by 2 and if they can both be divided by 2 they can probably both be divided by 4 so I started by dividing them by 4 and got 11 over 55 I notice they could both be divided by 11 so I divided them both by 11 and got 1/5 and then again I'm turning it into a percent so I need a denominator of 100 so 5 times 20 gives me 100 1 times 20 gives me 20 that's 20 over 100 that's 20 percent some music is that music scuse me reading is a 20% all right when you look at answer choice D there's no way reading is 20% I didn't see it is so I can eliminate D from that point on I want to go and check sports and video games I can convert that to a percent and find out that's 25 and 25 and then I can match it up exactly all right you could have done a lot of work ahead of time with some common sense and just ruling some things out all right number 4 pretty easy question a barrel has 60 gallons of water water leaks out at a rate of 5 gallons every three days so every three days five gallons three more days five more gallons three more days five more gallons right at this rate how many days did it take for all 60 gallons of water to leak out set yourself up a table all right every time three days go by five more gallons so three days five gallons three more days six five more gallons ten and I just keep going three more five more three more five more three more five more now I could go all the way to 60 if I want it to get my answer of 36 I don't have to I could stop right here in 30 if you double 30 that gives you 60 gallons if you double 18 that gives you 36 you could also stop at night if you multiple have 15 times four you're gonna get 60 and if you multiply 9 times 4 you're gonna get 36 so you didn't have to go all the way if you notice that pattern so it would take 36 days for all 16 to leak out 5 coordinate plane all right 4 points are on the coordinate plane which one does not appear to be represented by one of these points well you've got to take these points that are not so easy and turn them into something you can use 5 1/2 so you don't know where that goes you gotta turn it into a decimal or a fraction 5 halves 5 over 2 is 5 divided by 2 5 divided by 2 is 2.5 so instead of calling it 5 halves negative 3 2 point 5 negative 3 works a lot better so here we are here's 2 point 5 here's negative 3 so a is correct the next one's easy negative 1 and 1/2 is just negative 1 point 5 so negative 1 and negative 1 point 5 so here we are at the origin negative 1 here's negative 1 but negative 1 point 5 is here so that is graphed incorrectly it should be right there so bead is wrong if you check the other 2 3 halves is equal to 1 point 5 and that one is in the right place if you go check those coordinates here is 1 point 5 and then positive 2 and then negative 4 and 1/2 here's negative 4 and then up all right so remember in coordinate planes you have an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate the X is telling you left or right positive right negative left the y-coordinate is telling you up or down positive up negative down take a look at number six carpenter wants to cut a board that is five six foot long in two pieces that are 5/16 foot long the carpenter will use the expression shown to calculate the number of pieces that can be cut from the board all right look you're cutting something into smaller pieces that are equal that's division okay I don't care if they're fractions or whole numbers you're cutting some you're cutting something into smaller pieces and those pieces are equal that's division if you didn't realize that they told you they set it up for you five six divided by five six teams they told you what to do we learned that when dividing fractions don't be shy flip the second number and multiply you never really divide fractions instead you multiply by the reciprocal so you flip that second one over five six times 16 fifths and it's a choice F it's an easy question if you remember the rule about multiplying fractions excuse me dividing fractions you turn it into multiplying fractions all right seven-volume we just finished this a few weeks ago you this is a thinking question the picture they show you is not the picture you need to solve it you've got to build the rest of the picture to know what you need the rectangle below represents the base of a rectangular prism this rectangle only represents the base what I highlighted in yellow it doesn't show you the whole picture use the ruler provided to measure the dimensions of the rectangle to the nearest centimeter hopefully you got a ruler at home to measure this all right it's not exactly 4 centimeters all right when I use the ruler oops make sure you know your own centimeters when it says centimeters are not inches don't put the ruler at the end like this go to 0 so that is closer to 4 than it is to 3 so 4 centimeters same thing up here it's closer to 5 centimeters than it is to 4 so we're gonna call that 5 centimeter so there's your base and it tells you the height is 12 so I just drew the rest of it so I've got a base that has a 5 by 4 and a height of 12 go to my formula chart volume equals length times width times height length width height multiply multiply again that's where I came up with my 240 if you want to use this formula area of the base is big beat area length times way up to 20 now multiply times the height 12 okay 240 centimeters cute use your formulas when you need volume all right number 8 we have not taught this yet this will be confusing it will cause you to be frustrated so just listen to how I'm gonna describe this and we will talk about this more in class when we get to it this is called a box plot you've never seen one before they're confusing students record the amount of liquid and fluid ounces each of them drink in one day the box plot shows the summary of the results what you need to know about a box plot is it never shows individual responses it never shows all of the Intuit individual data it's not like a dot plot where every question you ask has a result it's just a summary so here's what you get in a box plot you get the lowest amount the lowest data point you get the highest data point so you get the low and the high you get the median that's the line that always cuts through the box so that's the median and you get this q1 and q3 which are called quartile 1 and quartile 3 and what that does is it divides the data from the beginning to the end into four pieces so there's a yellow piece of blue piece a green piece in a pink piece there's your four pieces all right again it does not show individual data all right between 24 and 36 there's a difference of 12 so that means there's 12 between these and if you draw a little line down that's halfway between them so half of 12 is 6 so if I add 6 to 24 I get 30 and this one extends down to here if I add 6 to 72 I get 78 same thing here if I add 6 to this I get 90 if I had 6 to this I get 114 ok that's where I'm getting all my information which statement best describes the data represented in the box plot all right if half the students drank from 78 to 114 fluid ounces this is true because the median is the middle that's half right there so half the students drink so the first half is 32 78 the second half is 78 to 114 so that's true half the students drank from 78 to 114 that's your second half right there okay I know it doesn't look exactly in the middle but that's not how box plots work all right the rest the greatest number of students drink from 32 78 no 3278 again is the first half so that's not greater than this is it looks greater because it's bigger from here to here but that's again this is not a number line it's a box plot so we're not looking at a size the data represents 78 student responses box plots never show individual responses you cannot look at a box plot and see how many people gave you an answer it doesn't work that way the mean that means average the average number of fluid ounces that the students drink is 78 again you cannot calculate the mean without every single data point and box plots do not show all data points so I know that you will be confused about this one because we have taught it in class but you should be able to watch this video and have a little bit more of an understanding about how box plots work all right that is one through eight on your review I hope you'll check these tonight and see how you did I'll post another video tomorrow with about eight more questions so Tuesday - Tuesday Tuesday today - next Tuesday you need to be working every night including the weekends to prepare for DBA - so good luck and I'll see you in class", "f0a0ZaEeXY8": "good morning everybody okay so in this video I've got something I got to talk about I've got a document what happened to me the other day wild squirrel hunting I picked up these shotgun shells at Walmart about a month ago right for squirrel season because they were like pretty cheap they were cheaper than the regular shot shells number six for squirrels they're cheaper than lead guys so I was like alright I'll try on so I want to show you what happened to them and what happened to my shotgun in this video so here we go guys [Music] alright guys I wanted to show you that this shotgun the other day I went squirrel hunting I loaded up I sat down and then I had to change locations so I had to unload my shotgun and when I was coming out of the woods and I went to unload basically eject the shell and then cycle the ones in here out they went in cycle so you can see there is still one in the tube I hope you can see it and this one will not come out so what I'm gonna have to do is take this shotgun apart take the doggone shells out through the tube and that was a real problem because when I was changing location I didn't have anything to take this thing out with and basically my my hunting day was about over and these are these super X teal shot so you can see them and see these so what I have seen and I hope winchester figures this out and recall some of these but the ends of these shells are not the same size I've had this happen before on some Federals and they wouldn't go through the tube I guess when you mass-produce these things these things happen so I just wanted to document this and say hey guys if you're gonna use these shells and you're a duck hunter especially thought of taking these out in my kayak my day would have been over because I wouldn't have been able to fix this in my kayak so this guy gotta take this tube out of here hopefully it yep there goes the end of the plot or the end of the tube and here comes a shell and boom and for you guys that are gonna yell at me the actions open that's weird that this bad boy would not go through the tube now just so we can have a test and y'all don't say that it's my shotgun I'm going to and yeah I have a plug in it I'm going to put this bad boy back together and then I'm gonna put some sure shot heavy Devils in here and show you that it's not my shotgun there's the other shell - alright put it back together put the barrel back on these things are pretty easy to take apart once you get used to don't lose the pieces oh and don't let the plug shoot at the top so hold it with your hand put it back together screw it screw the end cap on rock and roll all right now I'm gonna take some sure shot heavy double it's here one two three all right so these are just seven and a half short shot heavy Davalos but you'd shoot everything from dove to squirrels with and I'm gonna load them up so you can watch it's gun will cycle all right so here we go pressing it its cycles okay all right guys so that's basically the test all right the gun cycles those two wooden so I guess it's just these I don't have a diameter checker to see if they're different there it's like one of those situations where they're super close when you look at them at the back I mean there might be just a smidgen difference and I'm tough to tell I don't know if they're I mean they don't feel like they have a burr on them or nothing why they wouldn't go through the tube but they sure it wouldn't go through to but that's all I got guys I just want to make this video to say if you're looking at using these this is the issue I've had with them I don't know if it was like just a couple out of the box I don't really want to cycle the whole box and figure it out but just check them before you use them and if you find one that's irregular note it make a video so all of us will know like what's going on with these shells I'll probably shoot them until they're gone because I've already bought them and I can't take them back and you know so you know comment down below if you've had this issue with these shells if not put them a thumbs up and we'll know that maybe it's just this box or whatever but I'll see you guys later don't forget to Like and subscribe follow me on facebook at yak moly and i'll see you guys later oh did it again again oh there goes second pump", "z5kNNnjAZlo": "the life of a fisherman it never gets old so welcome to the show come on yo go away like hey everybody I want to talk to you about the recent going I kept Assad the South Jersey slam and if you live in the state of New Jersey especially in South Jersey you know what the South Jersey slam is that's a bag consisting of bluegill yellow perch crappie pickerel and finally bass and it was a really fun day on the water for being a wintertime pattern wintertime fishing is super tough and when the day started we fished a lot of grubs to catch those more aggressive cold water species the bluegill the perch the crappie and the pickerel all hit small finesse swim bait grub style lures and I fish that's that havoc beach at and I would just take it and bite it down fishing on a jig head and reel it slow off the bottom but the funny thing is in the winter a lot of times the bass won't cooperate to those faster moving baits you know the swim baits the grubs the jerk baits they ignore that stuff and they actually get super low to the bottom I mean they almost lay on the bottom and those wintertime conditions and we use the technique that's really neat and it's called a micro jig and you know I want to show you a small finesse compact jig in comparison to the micro jig and this is a traditional smaller jig this is the missile mini flip jig quarter ounce and it's a real small profile Jake look at it it's very small and in normal conditions that'd be a great small bait to throw but when it gets brutally tough like in the winter and the fish won't respond to any this micro jig becomes a real player and look how small that thing is look how tiny that micro jig is and if you look at it it's actually a sixteenth of an ounce it's more like a crappie jig size but it's got the features of a regular jig its skirted it's got a little fiber guard on it and it's got a little tiny trailer and that bait for us was the absolute key and compete completing the South Jersey slam in fact that little bait caught some giant fish three to five pound class fish on a little itsy-bitsy jig want to talk to you a little bit about how we fish it I want to talk to you about a trailer modification and then we'll look at the line the rod and reel and that's real critical you know but when they get really inactive in the winter and they're laying on the bottom ignore everything else the best way to fish this micro jig is what I call dead sticking and you know in the dead sticking technique you're going to make a really long cast to clear the water the longer the cache you want to make you're going to let that thing fall on a semi slack line until it hits the bottom and then once it hits the bottom you know your tendency is you want to jerk it you want to you want to pull it back you want to fish it like a regular compact jig but with this micro jig don't do it think about the fish they're laying low to the bottom they're lethargic and a lot of times in the winter like that you're not going to believe me but they do they're feeding on nymphs and larvae and grubs that live in the bottom also little tiny crawfish that's a big part of their diet in the wintertime and that's what we want to imitate with this micro jig we make that long cast we let it follow the bottom we're really not going to move it a lot at all in fact a lot of the time we're going to use the momentum of the boat and we're going to use the wind to be our r8 to move this bait every once in a while I'll pull in my slack and move it again if I feel something on the bottom if I contact a piece of cover I'm just going to real gently just so slow to shake it a little bit but the key to this bait is micro jig is to dead-stick it and to not hardly move it at all so key on that little tiny sixteenth ounce micro jig you know on trailers you want to match a small trailer to the bait and a little tiny baby chunk a little tiny grub is a great choice or a modification that I make on this micro jig all the time and it's taking your favorite of what I call broad tail finesse worm and I'm going to make a little modification that cuts the bait and and we've got a Berkley power bait this is their Pro g1 it's only four inches it's the perfect style bait to fish on a micro jig and we're just going to modify that bait to make it fit that compact jacket if you look at it it's four inches it's small it's natural looking and the first modification we're going to make is cut the length and we're going to cut that down to about an inch and a quarter so we're going to go ahead and just cut the body right off I've got a little tiny tail section and of course that that broad paddle on the back and then the second modification is to actually cut that tail and we want to cut it in the shape of a V just like a lot of the craw fish just like a lot of the larvae that have pincers on the bottom it's a very natural modification and I'm going to go ahead and get my scissors and I'm going to cut a v-shape in that plastic and just pull that middle section out and if you look what we end up with is that same bait we start it with and now we've got a beautiful little natural crawl larva cut in that trailer it's small it matches perfect to the size of the jig you know the last thing I want to talk about is the rod 3 on the line very critical you know when they get on the bottom like that and they want it barely moving action is so key and because of that I'm always using light fluorocarbon six and eight pound Berkeley try lean 100% fluorocarbon is a great line to use on the reel I like a 20 or 30 size reel with the middle-of-the-road ratio you want it a little bit slow - for sure - slow down but you don't want it to slow and then the last piece of equipment is the rod and a spinning rod for sure is the deal I like a seven to seven and a half foot spinning rod in the show I was using the Abu Garcia Ike series rod in the 7 feet 2 inch model it's a perfect finesse rod and it's medium action and look at the bend on that rod if you look at it about the 40% of that rod the first 40 percent is real tippy and that's what you need to make those casts feel the bite and set the hook the backbone of that rod is still there listen to me if you're having a super tough day it's winter times conditions and the fishery lethargic and toward the bottom put away your regular jig try one of those micro jigs modify the trailer and you're going to catch some fish too when a fish like him you know I'm fishing hard you might wanna say that I'm go away", "dLvYKA5AvMs": "thank you for answering the pretest i am laura a Aguinaldo a PPS SDC member and clinical toxicologists welcome to ewha's la zona de long SATA guru from ro ro an online CPD on poisoning prevention the objectives for the DCPD are the following first to recognize the common harmful or poisonous substances that may harm children next initially managed a child who has been exposed to poisonous substances thirdly proper referral of children were exposed to the poison control center prevention of exposure of children from poisonous substances based on the latest national data on poisoning the substances that are commonly involved can usually be found inside the home as seen in the data compiled by the national poison management and control center for both pediatric and adult cases similar data are also reported in developed countries like the US wherein substances which may appear innocent enough such as cosmetics toys and art supplies post poisoning threats to our children non pharmaceutical products are responsible for 56 percent of poisoning exposures for children under 5 years of age as adults we have the responsibility of looking out for the safety of children to prevent accidental poisoning events we also have to bear in mind the unique susceptibilities of children which make them at higher risk for the development of serious adverse effects from exposure to toxic substances remember children are not little adults should poisoning occur prompt and appropriate interventions should be undertaken to minimize harmful secondly the following are risk factors for poisoning and supervised home setting lower socioeconomic status males less than five years old lower level of education belonging in a family with a member who is a substance abuser depress the dollar cents and a tall ascent females the products we use in place under the sink are among the most common culprits for accidental poisoning ingestions we should always check if the substances we store there will pose a risk to our young ones the safest thing to do is place this storage areas under lock and key or better yet place them in a secure area outside the house again the products we use on a daily basis which may be left unattended around the home can add to the over forty five thousand child and teen deaths due to poisoning in a year especially in children less than one year old wherein the risk of fatal outcomes from ingestions are highest children as part of their development are natural explorers and extremely curious unfortunately everything they encounter they also want to taste which of course is not always a good thing household cleaning agents are mostly caustic substances which can range from mild to very severe depending on the active component the injury can range from mild local irritation gastric complaints intestinal perforation bleeding circulatory collapse and even death as is the case for a silver cleaner which can contain highly toxic cyanide with regards to the common medications involved the toxic effects will depend on the dose taken computed in milligram per kilogram body weight and management can range from supportive to definitive antidotal therapy the administration of n-acetylcysteine for paracetamol the ferox amine for iron vitamin b6 or pyridoxine for isoniazid and activated charcoal either as a single or multiple dose can be used depending on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs ingested and severity of symptoms proper storage more than proper labeling cannot be overemphasized properly labeled containers will not be helpful at all for very young children pesticides contain a lot of chemicals and the importance of knowing the active ingredient again is pertinent so what's the determinant toxic effects they can range from mild hypersensitivity reactions to fulminant liver failure or death some exposures may require antidote administration such as atropine for organophosphates social nitrate and sodium thiosulfate for cyanide containing substances vitamin K for coumarine derivatives and a settle sustain for sync phosphide personal care products may contain alcohol salicylates and other caustic substances we should also ask for history of g6pd since exposures to these oxidizing substances may trigger hemolytic reactions which may manifest several days after the exposure the incidence decreases after 72 hours the pets we bring in the house can have toxins which can be highly fatal in very young children seen here are the stone fish and lionfish whose erectile fins in their dorsal anal and pelvic spines can inject a toxic venom especially the stone fish whose venom is a neurotoxin with similar effects to a cobra bite other exotic pets should always be kept away from young children plants in and outside the home can also pose a threat hence we have to be very familiar with their qualities and where to put them so that they will be out of reach of children jatropha has a fruit which is very tasty but contain stocks albumin curscene and reefs in which can cause hypocalcemia severe abdominal cramps vomiting and seizure the toxic effects will vary depending on the amount taken and the maturity of the seeds angels trumpet or datura is an outer plant which can act as a bronchodilator and is used in traditional medicine for cough and asthma but in overdose can result in the Alice in Wonderland syndrome remember in med school our mad as a hatter dry as a bone red as a beet blind as a bat memory aid to remember the symptoms of anticholinergic excess - bah\u00eda or dump cane which can also be found in doors have oxalic acid in their stems which can have a tropical irritant effect when the SAP comes into contact with our skin but can cause renal failure if otherwise ingested there are a lot of plans which can have various physiologic and toxic effects such as the following Lance will guard your active steroids which contain cardiac glycosides similar to digitalis seen in foxglove seizure causing plants which have a high content of monitor pinky tones such as found in rosemary sage fennel and eucalyptus plans with cyanogenic or cyanide containing compounds as seen in our local cassava with the scientific name manihot esculenta and plants with mitotic inhibiting properties which are very toxic similar to colchicine which is found in autumn crumples we also have to scrutinize the materials of the toys and arts and crafts products we buy for our children more so now that school time is approaching the quality of the plastic products we buy especially for their drinks and other bond may also leach harmful endocrine disrupting substances into their food and water other culprits to watch out for will be the heavy metals specially mercury and lead let in paint which can be found in older houses or establishments a sources of exposure is also a concern therefore we should make sure there is no peeling or chipped paint in areas where children eat sleep or play and again the importance of always reading the label of our children's toys in cases of accidental poisonings at home what should we do first aid measures first and foremost stay calm check the condition of your child if the poison is swallowed do not give the child anything to eat drink and do not induce vomiting do not give anything to neutralize the poison an exception may be when a caustic substance or sink phosphites phosphide is ingested in this cases egg whites for pediatric age four to six and for adults 8 to 12 may be given but remember that this is only helpful if given within the first 30 minutes of ingestion if inhaled bring out the patient to fresh air we should all also do external the contamination to prevent thermal absorption by thoroughly washing or bathing the child for at least 10 minutes using an alkaline soap such as Perla removing all contaminated clothing flushing the eyes with water or NSS for at least 15 minutes next if we have access contact the poison control center in the area and give them and give them the following data the child's age weight and condition the time of the poisoning event what was ingested the amount of the substance ingested any treatment given any pre-existing medical problems or significant past medical history your name and telephone number follow the instructions given by the poison center if this is not possible then bring the child immediately to the nearest health facility for proper evaluation and treatment some more reminders on the most common substances kerosene or locally known as gas and some pesticides are categorized under hydrocarbons depending on their chemical classification whether aromatic or aliphatic toxic effects are related to their viscosity surface tension and volatility which can aid in anticipating what complications to expect whether pulmonary CNS gi or others the importance of not transferring substances in specially in using containers such as mineral water bottles soda or other drinks cannot be emphasized enough especially since this contributes significantly as to why children accidentally ingest them cyanide containing silver jewelry cleaner as was mentioned is especially hazardous the potency will depend on the concentration of cyanide hence we should ask if it was bought as a solid powdered or liquid form the most toxic is the solid crystal form which is associated with higher more other forums maybe less lethal since it may be diluted or otherwise adulterated because of an increase in poisoning incident seen in the early part of 2000 as reported by the national poison management and control center restrictions which were already present have since been more strictly implemented medications especially isoniazid iron and paracetamol mainly cause hepatic toxicity and in the case of inh intractable seizures again administration of antidotal therapy for each will depend on the amount ingested and clinical signs and symptoms if warranted it should be administered as soon as possible preferably within the first two to four hours from the time of ingestion caustic household cleaners such as bleach liquid salsa muriatic acid oxalic acid and the like should never be on display mixed or transferred to unlabeled containers salicylate toxicity can result not only from ingestion of tablets but through thermal absorption especially in children whose epidermis is still very thin application of highly concentrated liniments may result in significant systemic absorption diagnosis of toxicity is clinical but can be aided by requesting for arterial blood gas computing the anion gap and serum salicylate determination if possible if untreated this could lead to hepatic and renal failure seizures coma and even death symptoms of poisoning may be delayed depending on the history of exposure active contents of pesticides may be permethrin organophosphates or carbamates they have several classes which will depend on it indication for use whether for household agricultural or industrial in addition they may also have cyanide nerve agents ethanol and petroleum distillates among others with regards to the dentist's Ides if the active ingredient is not immediately available we should always ask for color pink green or blue commonly contained coumarine derivatives while black rat poison contains zinc phosphide so in order to prevent poisoning exposures here are some helpful reminders with regards the medications keep all medicine locked and out of reach of children don't put medicine on a kitchen table or bedside table read labels to find out what can be poisonous never leave medicines or potentially poisonous household products unattended while you are using them by child resistant packages when available keep products in their original packages to avoid confusion when administering medication always read labels follow directions and give medicines the children based on their weights and ages only use the dispensers packaged with children's medications never leave out loose pills don't take medicine or vitamins in front of kids and don't call them candy don't involves children as helpers with medication tell grandparents and Friends about avoiding medication poisoning when visiting their homes keep purses and other bags with medications out of reach of children and remind others to do the same for household chemicals we should always store cleaning products in locked closet or cabinets away from food and inaccessible to young children store products in their original containers and never remove product labels scheduled routine cleaning of surfaces and dishwashing when there is a lull in activities such as nap time or when the children are not in the room put products away immediately after removing the amount needed for the cleaning job at hand dispose empty cleaning product containers carefully and promptly don't mix cleaning chemicals as this can emit dangerous gases which can be very harmful especially shion's we can do a lot to raise awareness of child injury and Prevention as part of anticipatory care especially during the holidays or school breaks when children will most likely be at home second integrate child injury prevention into a comprehensive approach to child health and development which can be aided by giving talks mini lectures in schools or daycare or any appropriate setting third implement specific actions to prevent and control child injuries such as child proofing the home in school environment fourth coordinate with the nearest poison center or set up a poison information service in your health facility to strengthen health systems to address child injuries and finally to enhance the quality and quantity of data for child injury prevention conduct more research and data recording on poisoning in children to help address the needs of your particular area build upon strengths and work on weaknesses working together for success thank you for your at most focus and attention please answer the posttest all for the Filipino child remember an ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching", "7HuVkXLreWE": "12-gauge 1 ounce rifled slug what are some of the things that you can do with the 12-gauge slug how about relocate 50 pounds of water break a concrete block or you could drill a hole through a 4-inch fence post yeah you can do all those things and probably a long list of other stuff that was a six gallon container a concrete construction block or foundation block and this is a four by four fence post treated would clean entry there and I know you're asking the question did it go all the way through yes it did no problem whatsoever and that was from about 25 feet there 35 40 feet on the block and I think 30 feet or so on the container using the Mossberg 590 a1 special purpose this is a smoothbore and a 20 inch barrel so I'm using rifled slugs this is also known as a foster slug 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch shell 1600 feet per second one ounce at one ounce converts to four hundred and thirty seven point five grains so when you calculate foot-pounds energy it is approximately two thousand four hundred and eighty four foot-pounds that is a lot of force for size comparison on the Left you have a 45 ACP 230 grain jacketed hollow point I think that's a Winchester PD X 1 and then the slug on the right you can clearly see the rifling and when you turn it over and look underneath it is hollowed out so it's not a solid all the way through for the main attraction we have a block of the sim test media this has been calibrated to match 10% ordnance gelatin specifications it weighs approximately 50 pounds 20 inches in length but I still think this is an excellent pass-through opportunity today we have some water jug back up and then a large plastic container that is stuffed with dry newspaper and a surprise in the very back we have a 40 pound bag of dry cement just waiting as that last resort try this from 20 feet if there was ever a day that the block could fly off the table is today so I have taken precautions that was awesome excellent shot placement it did break the board check out this cavity that is just some serious nastiness Wow there's the thumb wow that is just that's just nasty great use or not depending on how you wanted this to penetrate is that it is inside of the block it did not exit I did lose a water-jug due to splinters coming out of that board so has some leakage on that but otherwise a pretty clean test let's break it down here's how it gets started and this was not really what I expected here is the entry point this is the left half the block by the way as I was cutting start to see this permanent stretch cavity really opened up about an inch and a half in from this point to this point where it narrows now show you that in a moment that is seven inches the widest from here to here is four inches and it is approximately an inch and a half yes it was an inch and a half deep on this site that is just unbelievable now it continues on I did peel that back away a little bit but a segment and I mean a segment not all of it but a segment of the slug was embedded in the bottom right there it was stopped by the board and that leading edge is at 12 inches so it's split off at some point I'm not sure exactly where here is the other side of the block obviously captured most of the permanent cavity on that other half but this is about an inch and a half two inches wide this is one in three quarters of an inch deep this carries on we get into some paper wadding here and some more paper there whoops there's the other half of the slug and the leading edge of that is it 10 inches so we'll never know where its split off I'd say probably in this side to 10 inch mark obviously they back up and there is an overhead of both halves of the tracks here is another perspective and there are the two halves or are they they don't go together and the weights coming in at point seven three seven ounces so something is missing looking at this perspective you can see how this opens up and check it out I dug this out and actually I haven't taken it out it's still embedded but on the left side of the block and the track there is another chunk of the slug so it is split into two is split into three so now with the sections I've recovered we're still coming in a little bit less at 0.98 three ounces I believe that's the puzzle and it's odd that two of the three pieces really flattened out diameter at that mark is one point two to five inches if you look there on the lower right hand corner of the box that's actually the top of the box it's just the way it's positioned right now you see the primary purpose for these and a lot of you already know that it is for hunting medium game maybe even some large game and a lot of folks do that I'll use these for target practice I do not use them for home defense it's not my first choice in spite of the fact that we you know this is going to be a fight stopper you would think or hope but that's not my first choice I have some other things that I use in my 12-gauge so I hope that from all these perspectives whether or not it's home defense or hunting or target practice you got a little bit out of this maybe something educational and possibly a little bit of fun we're going to close out with some slow-motion thanks for watching", "nbywJIEYNfQ": "hi i'm joel from Jonesy's auto restoration in Ridgefield Washington and I'm going to show you how to mix automotive paint so what we have here is we have a whole assortment of different types of paint and what I'm going to try to convey to you is that different brands of paint all mix in a very similar manner and there are some tips and tricks that you need to look out for so that you mix them correctly because if you don't mix them correctly then all kinds of really bad things can happen the paint won't harden properly it won't spray properly it won't have the right viscosity to work in your gun and you can just ruin it it won't match subsequent top coats that you need to put on it so one of the most common types of paint is a base coat clear coat and this is a base coat and again depending on what brand of paint they have a different method for how to mix it sometimes it's mixed with a one type of thinner and a hardener on top of that sometimes it's mixed with just a reducer and so what I'm going to try and convey to you today is how you figure out what needs to be added to the paint and what ratio needs to be mixed and nine times out of ten you can find that information directly on the side of the can this is a this is a very common pain as a PPG paint and it tells you with a picture and then also a ratio of the two different types this right here is a DBC and that's the actual base coat and the DT is a reducer so it mixes one-to-one with color and the reducer and so what you want to do is you want to get a paint cup that is specifically for mixing automotive paints it won't deteriorate it won't melt and then on the sides of the cup you'll see all of these different little legends and so if I want to mix one to one you find up here one to one on that paint cup and then each one of these marks corresponds to the level at which you need to fill this Cup you go up to the seven with the paint and then you go to the next column over and you go up to the seven with the thinner so it's one part of paint one part of thinner and you can see they have it already marked out for a whole bunch of different ratios 2 to 1 1 to 1.5 3 2 1 4 2 1 8 to 1 and then they also have gradients in milliliters ounces and just generic scale this is this doesn't mean anything so if you wanted to mix 1 to 1 you would go to 5 parts of paint go to the 5 line and then 5 more up to the 10 line with the thinner getting a little bit more complicated is this is a single stage paint and if you can zoom in on there you can see that there's a whole bunch of different options for different products that you can mix DCC that's this paint a DT is a reducer and then a Dec X is the hardener so they want this paint mixed 4 to 2 to 1 so that means 4 parts of this paint 2 parts of the reducer and 1 part of the activator or hardener so the way you would do that is you would want 4 parts of the one so you go four of the paint two parts of the reducer so you'd go up to six with the reducer and one part of the hardener so you'd go up to the 7 so it's 4 to 2 to 1 so if you do your math and you think about these cups you can pretty much mix any kind of paint here's clear coat this one's very simple again you always look at the side of the of the can and it says it needs to be mixed 2 to 1 so 2 parts of the clear coat with 1 part of the hardener again you can find that directly on the side of the cup used to find 2 to 1 and then all these different gradients correlate to 2 to 1 so if you only need a little bit of clear coat you'd put the clear coat up to the 2 mark and then the next column over you'd find the to mark and you put the hardener to the level goes up to that again here's a completely different brand but on the side of the can it tells you specifically how you're supposed to all the information you need now if hypothetically the paint mixing information is not on the can go to the manufacturers website and what I always keep at my paint mixing station is a three-ring binder and you can see this we've used this a lot and inside I print off all of the different types of paint that I generally use including the primers all of their technical information so DBC for example that was the first base coat that I showed you where you mix it one to one well if you go to the manufacturers website you can print off technical information specifically for DBC and they do a great job of outlining the different additives that you can use what type of tip you need to run for your gun all kinds of different things like the amount of time you need to spend between your coats so go check out the manufacturers website and you can download and print off all this technical information as well as safety information finally if you still are not sure after checking the website and checking the side of the can call the paint company that sold you the paint they should be able to provide you with all the information that you need as well as all the chemicals and all of the safety equipment that you need to mix and spray paint successfully", "ZTM5FX_1FJo": "youtubers its fortune cookie 45 Alvey coming to burn hot LED zone and there's been a lot of interest in shotgun slug lows and which wad works with which slug thought we give you a little diagram in video form on what slugs work with what ones but first of all let's go over the ones that don't work the one over here is the clay Buster substitute for the Winchester double a wad and it doesn't work it'll bulge when you put slugs in there so avoid the clay buster substitute for the Winchester double a wad the next one is the Remington power piston and it won't work with slugs if you buy that one you're going to waste your money then the next one is a Fiocchi wide for trap loads and it won't work with slugs to avoid that one but the ones that do work real well for instance is the winchester double a 12-1 it works with both li slugs the round balls slug and also the Lyman 525 pellet slug and you have enough room in here that you can add a card spacer in there if you want now the next one is the Winchester ping quad and it works with the slugs but you can use a spacer then you have the Winchester grey wad which works with the Lee slugs and the round ball slug but it won't work with the Lyman 525 pellet slug because the high fizz not enough for that slug next one is a very good wad that that will work with all the slugs and the spacer and that is a federal 12 s 3 wad it works very well then we have the down range substitute for the winchester double awad which is the down range dark blue wad and it will work with a spacer and all the slugs as well this is a good one I like this one a lot then the next one is the downrange yellow wad and it will work with all of the other slugs and a spacer and finally for you clay buster fans out there both the Windjammer and the both the lightning and the Windjammer slug works well with all the slugs and the spacer so those are good ones as well if you want to know which one my favorites are the winchester double a 12 WOD the federal 12 s3 WOD and the downrange blue WA those are my favorites and that's followed very closely by a downrange yellow one which I use a lot of also so youtubers out there take care and this should get you going and avoid you buying a lot of wads that you won't be able to use bye for now", "Sxhm6HTetZU": "[Music] so [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to my crafting world this is anna guys i was making some coffee you know the little miniature coffee cup i was making some holders that are holding some candy inside and a gift card on the back so my daughter is going to give her niece and nephews one of one of these each and i was down to my last one i thought you know what let me make a video just in case just in case somebody hasn't um seen how these are made they're really really simple and i'm going to show you how i have made mine they turned out really cute i really like them so the uh traditional red and white ones are for the boys and we are going to make one um for a girl so i am starting out with a sheet of cardstock this is 110 pounds a sheet of cardstock that is um two and a half by 11. now i found that that was the perfect size for this project so that being said two and a half by eleven and we are going to do some scoring so let me get my scoreboard let me show you where we're going to use today we are going to use the stamperia uh pink christmas and i am going to use a chipboard as well so the these i got from asc crafts and i'm going to go ahead and link their web store and their etsy store in the description box along with my coupon code so we are also going to use one of these four ounce coffee cups and i am going to link these as well i got these from amazon so i'm going to link these in the description box as well so they do come with the lids therefore are going to score at three quarters of an inch which is right here so remember this is a 110 pound cardstock so score at three quarters at three and a half and you know me i like to score a few times so it i don't score all at once and crack the paper and then we're going to score at four and a quarter okay and then the last score we are going to make at seven okay so um that's all the scoring we're going to do i am going to go ahead and round my corners before i forget i am using the quarter inch corner uh rounder the cropadile the quarter inch size and i am going to go ahead and die cut a circle okay so this is the top this is the bottom this is the front of the cup holder and this is going to be the actual cup holder so what i'm going to do is i'm going this is a two inch circle um it's a plain circle just your your basic uh circle so i'm going to take this over to the um cutting machine and i'm going to cut this out right here i'll be right back all right guys i have die cut my hole for the actual coffee cup right here and that fits nicely i had to figure out how much was left at the bottom so i know how much how tall to uh make my space here this is all we have to do to this piece right now so the next thing i needed to do was cut out my sleeve that's going to go around my coffee cup which is this one right here and the way i got this template was i cut the coffee cup in half i removed the bottom and then i went ahead and cut off the rim and that is my template so you know that gives me a perfect fit around the coffee cup okay so after i cut it up i put it down on my paper i traced it and then just cut around the trace line that's how you get your template for your coffee cups and you know the package of coffee cups i don't remember how many that there are but there's a lot so i'm going to keep this for uh the next time i need it so after i cut my uh my sleeve that's going to go around my coffee cup i just put glue on the back i did ink the edges with worn lipstick so all i did all i need to do now is glue it down now i don't want it right on that seam either because then it just becomes too thick so i'm just going to move over a little bit and start to glue this down [Music] [Music] there we go there we go guys it is on here and it looks like i do need to trim this just a little bit and i'm going to do that right now i'm just going to take my scissors and just go around the rim and make sure that it is down right up against the cup okay so there is my cup nice and covered okay now the next thing i'm going to do is is i'm going to set this cup aside and i'm going to go ahead and start to fold this so i know exactly where my folds are going to be and whatnot so i'm going to burnish that really well let me move this because i i'm finished with this for the moment so i'm going to burnish my score marks and this is the way our cup holder goes okay so before i glue that down i find it easier to go ahead and cut my mats and glue them down before i actually glue down the cup holder itself so let me give you measurements for these mats so the mat that goes right in front of your cup holder the front mat is two and a half inches wide by 3 and 1 8 inch long so that goes right here i'm going to go ahead and glue that one down way so i'm going to go ahead and do the top one and these i cut three three of these these are two and a half by two and five eighths and on the top one all i did was take my circle i die and i centered it right in right now as centered as i can get it and i die you know i cut it i ran it through my machine and i cut it and that goes right here okay i have glued that one down now i'm gonna glue my bottom piece right here there we go okay that's what we have so far now we're gonna go ahead and glue the back one so that the back one is gonna go right there okay so i have the bat the back on i have the front on so what i'm going to do next is i am going to um glue this one on there okay so that is the back it's so much easier to layer once you are before you assemble it it's so much easier to layer so i'm going to take my front piece and i'm going to glue that down right there okay okay and i want mine to look totally finished so you don't have to do the inside but i am going to just because um i can see the inside maybe because i am the one that's making it what do you guys think that's probably it but i'm gonna go ahead and cover the inside okay guys so there is that we're still um this is the way it goes this is where our cup is going is gonna go before i glue this down i'm going to put a pocket in the back for the gift card and that pocket i'm going to cut at i cut my piece at three and a half inches wide two and a half inches tall and then i scored a half an inch on this side half an inch on this side and half an inch at the bottom and then i just merely folded it in like that okay and then what i'm going to do now is i'm going to cut half a circle because i have to make them all the same otherwise the siblings get a little upset the other ones have a half circle on the back so i'm going to do that here and then i'm going to simply glue this down i'm just going to put glue on here and we'll go from one side to the other okay [Music] and that is the pocket for the gift card okay guys now i'm going to go ahead and glue this down this way okay and it is complete after that there so while that dries okay so that isn't that cute she's gonna love it okay so while that is driving drying i'm going to of course you can decorate your cup however you want but these are kind of plain so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put the little lid on there and i simply took the circle that i cut for this top mat fits perfect on the top okay because it's a you just need a two inch circle on the top as well so i took that circle and i added one of the rosettes that i got from raquel at paints and glitter during our swap and i went ahead and removed the little circle that was in the center because it didn't actually match the paper so it was really easy to remove she did a really good job of staying pretty centered and i am just inking this vellum paper and i am going to glue it to the top of the lid like that and that is going to be the top of the lid now i have two choices i really don't want to use hot glue and i have not used hot glue for any of the other ones either i'm just gonna use good old art glitter glue [Music] and just so you guys know i'm going to put the uh link the facebook link to asc craft supplies the vip group because they are having the 12 days of christmas giveaways today they gave away this enormous package you know that whoever won that was lucky lucky so all i'm gonna do is go ahead and glue this down and it fits right over the top all right guys i think that is glued down pretty well and on the other ones i went ahead and tied some um twine around the rim i don't think i'm going to do that that with this one i think i am going to put some bling around there [Music] all right guys there is her little bling blinged up cup oh i just love that so i am going to add a bow to um [Music] to the top there we go guys i just added a little bow with the bling center with a half back pearl on the center and she's ready to go of course you know we can do a lot more embellishing but um this is all i'm going to do to it so here is that one oh my gosh aren't these cute i kind of want to add some bling to the front but i'm going to leave them like that because again these are for the kids and hopefully you know i mean kids don't pay that close attention to anything so this is the way they turned out guys i may go ahead and add their names to the front i think that would be cute but um yeah this is the coffee cup holders with a pocket for the gift cards oh my gosh guys i love this one i can't wait to make one for like valentine's day oh i just can't wait all right guys here we go you can put chocolate in there you can put you know the hot cocoa you can do different candies you can you know if you're gonna send this off in happy meal you can put some small embellishments you can do uh you know crafty supplies oh my gosh i just love this i really truly do i love the way it turned out guys so i just thought i would show you really quick how to make these in case uh you don't have measurements or something like that and there we go guys thank you so much for watching i appreciate each and every one of you thanks a lot guys y'all have a great day", "0x0TcEMmxiE": "okay welcome to this tutorial this tutorial is gonna walk you through how to do inventor parts one through eight actually we're going to talk about one through eight so this is part one this is part two part three four I scroll off five six seven and eight alright so a little bit of background here i am recording this so obviously so you can see it okay but I am also what I'm doing is I'm gonna make it a little bit easier on you if I click with my left which is the default by a left click on the mouse which is the default click which is my pointer finger it's gonna turn blue if I right click it's going to turn red so right is red right is red left it's blue it's gonna help you to understand what I'm doing and also as I hold down the mouse key if I hold it down for whatever reason like right now I'm holding on a left key I might let you know what's going on okay so let's start off by doing parts one through four and what we're going to do is we're going to go through inventor real quick real easy and we're gonna make this the the fast way okay we did this to easy way so this right here is the front view everything that we see here all this is the front of you so we're gonna make this the fast way so open up inventor start any parts if I need to I can go up to here the big eye and open up a part that way now the monitor that I'm using is quite large it's actually a lot bigger than the one that you have so you may have to minimize this to make it easier for you to to work okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to basically just draw out these lines making sure that they're perfectly ninety degrees to one another as you can see they are 90 degrees and I'm just gonna make this the shape and then extrude it out alright just let me show you so I'm gonna click on the big I new standard IPT create start 2d sketch click on my front view click there okay I'm gonna grab my line tool and what I'm doing is I'm just gonna draw the shape so I'm going to click there and release I just click the release draw it off over do you notice how it says 90 degrees at the very bottom there at the at the bottom there so 90 90 90 and if I bring this up you know saw Connolly lines up with the other one there there 90 degrees bring it down and notice how that turns green there it knows that I want to click it and then want to snap them together BAM okay so from here we're gonna go back and look at our dimensions and we notice the bottom is 5 that's our dimension right there bottom is 5 and this one's too so let's go ahead and make our dimensions 5 and 2 so let's go over here click on dimension click bring it down click again that opens up our dimension type in 5 hit the 5 in the hit enter now you notice how it kind of vanished over here not a problem click on front and all of a sudden it makes it bigger for us and I'm still on my dimension tool so I'm gonna left click here click again to okay so now I've made the 5 and the 2 that's similar to this 5 and this 2 okay now I want to dimension this line right here which is also 2 and then this line which is 1 which is this line here okay so I'm gonna do two and then one watch so I'm gonna do is I'm use the the ball on my mouse and just gonna pull pull it towards me okay this line right here should be one so let's click dimension okay just bring over it here click it again one enter notice how it also made this one one okay so we just did this one right here not this one's gonna be to which is this line right here okay click here click to enter perfect click on my front of you okay it's starting to take shape here it looks a little funky but we'll deal with that let's make this one right here which should be one inch so click here one enter okay and if I look the overall size is five okay this is 2 this is 1 so I know that this is 2 plus 1 equals 3 so this has to be 2 so if I click on this it's probably gonna give me an error it says hey listen you can't dimension this because it has to be 2 so let's click and see what it says look exactly what it's saying okay over constrain always hit cancel if you get this so we know that this is this is 2 it has to be okay and it's showing that it's too perfect cancel I go to finish sketch I'm gonna click on my little house over here now that I finished sketch everything is closed out I'm going to click on extrude and right here or over here either one this box or this box down here I'm gonna click on Direction 2 and if I look back here I can see that it's extruded out 3 inches ok so I'm gonna make this one 3 inches as well click OK click on my home view and now I've just made a part 1 so I'm gonna go to the big guy and I go to save as ok I'm gonna click on that document so I'm gonna go all the way down to the bottom where I see my name now your name's gonna look different it's gonna have your first initial your last initial and a bunch of numbers or it could have your first name dot last name ok but basically when I go to your xDrive and then you want to create a new folder here so I'll create folder you should have 8 X 7 folder or if this is for DDP it should be in your DDP folder ok whatever it's for so make that so we're gonna make that and then we're gonna put it into an inventor folder so let me just name this inventor so inventor I double click on that and this is part 1 I'm gonna save it as part 1 click Save I've just saved part 1 okay if I look down here at the bottom of the screen it even says part 1 now let's go ahead and let's make part 2 okay alright so we just finished part 1 let's move on to part 2 big I click new double click standard IP T start 2d sketch I'm gonna click on my front view click right here alright start with the line tool come on up how are we gonna bring this up we're gonna do this a little bit different okay we're gonna bring this one off and notice I didn't click anything yet bring it up straight okay I just had the line there straight click to and then enter alright and you notice it's still attached up here that's fine okay I'm going to bring this over doesn't make a difference how long right now click it okay I'm gonna bring this one down perfectly 90 degrees does not make a difference how long click it bring this one over it doesn't make a big deal how long click it I'm gonna bring this one down okay right to this line here click it and because there's no line here I have to make one so I'm gonna bring this right over and click so now I've just created a full shape okay I've just created a full shape how cool is that with only one dimension now let's click on my dimension tool and go back to my front view and I have two inches here so let's do the rest of this let's do five I know it supposed to be 5 ok let's click back over here how big is that top piece this piece right here is 2 so let's click here you go to click it again okay this piece right here how big is that supposed to be let's take a look one just click one that's one right there then this piece right here let's take a look is 2 so I just clicked to to enter and what happens is that automatically adjust this angle to fit the the correct size do finish sketch click on my little house extrude I'm gonna come over here and type in or click on Direction 2 so it's going away from us change to this from 1 to 3 hit enter click on my little house and we are good to go that's it that is part 2 very simple okay if you could do part 1 part 2 should be very simple as well now we're gonna work on part 3 in part 4 and for this one we have to work on three different I'm sorry two different planes so let's let's start and work a little bit slower for this so that's part number three let's work on that but before we leave its go to file save as say this is part to save perfect good go to the big guy let's go to new standard IPT such the part file alright so we're gonna start 2d sketch we're going to go to front click on the front view now we're gonna make a rectangle we're going to the old-fashioned style just make a rectangle so I clicked it there after clicking the rectangle notice the rectangles in blue over here okay so I just clicked and I release the mouse so I'm gonna type in 5 hit the tab key and then hit 2 and then enter hit my front view and look there we go click on my home view so it gives me that nice isometric look ok now what we have right here is we we have our basic shape okay if we look back here we have just a basic rectangle I know it's not all here but we just have a basic rectangle we'll have to do is if they go back to inventor and we're gonna finish our sketch and go to extrude click on Direction too and we're going three inches three enter click on our little home view so now we've got that rectangle the way we want it we've been working on our front view now for part number three what we're going to do is we're going to work on our side view so let's click over here the top right let's click over here click on our right view perfect and we're looking at it from the side okay we have one inch that goes up we have two inches that go over and then we have an angle that comes down here that we don't really know what that angle is okay so let's do this the easiest way we can so we're on our right side already okay you changed it over see I'm on my right side perfect start 2d sketch click on this plane so it knows where I want to work I just scrolled the mouse and an ounce of it so it helps me click on my line tool I'm gonna start at the top left corner and I'm gonna make a line and there's my line there bring it down perfectly 90 degrees type in 1 hit enter awesome I'm going to right click then click OK left click ok now I'm gonna click on my line tool again okay and I'm gonna click the same spot that I started that before but I'm gonna come over right along this line - good - cool and notice how it's still attached I'm going to then come on down here and click and I've not created a triangle one inch by two inch and if you look that's the size here one inch down from the top two inch back from the top the top left okay now what I'm gonna do is I'm still on this sketch I haven't closed the sketch out I'm stalling my line tool I watch what I do I'm gonna start over here click on the top right corner come over to this corner click click again see I have a line click click again see I have a line I'm gonna click each corner what I'm doing is and that's that line is still attached there click what I did was I just basically created a box around the whole shape okay using the existing lines the reason being is if you notice over here I'm on sketch - it doesn't know the difference between sketch 1 and sketch 2 so I have to tell it so I basically made a box just to tell the computer hey listen I'm gonna you know I want you to extrude something for me but this is the shape I want you to extrude it out of which in this case is a box now I'm going to click on my little home view okay and I'm gonna do finish sketch so I finished sketch and I've got my little rectangle sitting right there that we worked on okay I wanted to extrude and as I do extrude it's nothing selected yet okay I have to tell it what I want to select so I'm going to select the top area okay and if I look down over here I notice this top area is selected it's this triangle here okay that's the part I selected and I want to bring it back I want to bring it back three inches okay bring it back three inches so notice it's going in the wrong direction let's select direction - so it's actually taking it away click OK and there we go that's it that's part three file save as so can be saved as part three click say clicked on her and we are good to go all right so let's move on to part four the big guy click new double click standard IPT nope sorry about that it's part 4 part 4 is interesting let's take a look at part 4 oh boy it's got a slant on the front it's got that it's got that okay so let's let's make this easy on ourselves let's go to start 2d sketch click on our front view click again and it's gonna move stuff okay like start my line right here I'm gonna come over and I'm gonna make this fun 5 and I'm just going to scroll the mouse back and forth basically the wheel okay until I can see what I'm working on I put the mouse where I want it to scroll into okay so I put it right there and I just scroll alright so now I want to bring this this up I want to bring this over perfectly 90 degrees okay and then I want to bring it over to here down to down to there click okay so all I did was I made a line I'm in another one ninety nine ninety then I just made kinda like a slant all right you're gonna say mister see that's not the right size it doesn't look anything like the other one I know we'll work with it so click on right now we're on our line tool click on your dimension tool that's five let's click here this and we're gonna make this - it's supposed to be - alright let's click on my front view alright starting to come together a little bit now here's the thing this is five but the top we don't know the size so let's go back and look at it the bottom is five we see right here it's five we know we went up - that's right there oh that's how big the top is it's four okay so install my dimension tool let's click here bring it up click again and let's do four notice that when I do this it automatically gives me this angle I don't have to figure it out I don't have to do any math it gives me the angle right away so let's do finish sketch sketch is no finish let's click on my little home view perfect let's go to extrude I click on extrude we have to go in Direction 2 we know we have to go 3 inches and I'm gonna hit enter and there you go you have the basic shape of part number 4 but wait a minute we are missing a chunk out of the back of it here I'm sorry out of the right side we're missing a piece out of it so how do we do that well let's take a look it is one inch over it goes all the way up it's one inch by two inch okay it's let's let's do this together so click on my right side over here on the top I'm clicking my right side and I'm gonna go start 2d sketch and I click on that I am now in sketch mode first thing we're gonna do grab my line tool start at the top left you notice how it turns green click click click now in the last shape I did this afterwards right now I'm just doing it in the beginning it doesn't make a difference that it's all the same turns green and I click so now I've just boxed in this entire shape and you notice that I still have my line tool attached ok and this is why so I'm going to come over bring my line tool still attached right along the top I'm gonna one click I want to bring this down 90 degrees click OK click here again I'm gonna bring this over 1 hit enter I bring it up perfectly 90 degrees okay perfectly 90 degrees click again you notice I have three separate sections here 1 2 3 okay let's do finish sketch let's click on my home view now let's extrude again we have to tell the computer which one of these sections we want to extrude ok you have to carefully select the one that you want to work with oops I made a mistake I click the wrong one that's ok click cancel go back and click extrude so whatever one I want to work on I have to be very careful just to highlight that area Jane takes sometimes it takes a second okay the turns dark and soon as it turns dark we know that's theory we want to we want to highlight we want to click this is just part of the program it does this unfortunately just have to get used to it a lot of times if you zoom in sometimes it helps or even if you change the angle and sometimes it actually does help as well I just changed forearm coming from okay okay finally got it it is that tricky to get the right one so if you're having trouble with it just keep working on it okay so I I've got the part selected that I want let me just take a look how far back do I want to go I want to go back two inches so I come back here I select two but I'm still going the wrong way so let's do direction too and then I click OK click I'm a little home view and now I've got the shape I'm gonna go file save as this is part 4 click Save ok this is the first four parts they should be relatively easy the next four parts five through eight are a little more complicated okay and let's start on part number five got a new part okay let's take a look at the basic shape of part five okay so I kind of have an idea here what I need to do let's do start 2d sketch and let's do the standard rectangle so I did start 2d sketch I clicked on my front view clicked on my front plane clicked on my rectangle clicked here okay and I'm gonna do five notice how the blue area is highlighted right now five I'm gonna hit the tab key and then do to click on my little house okay now I have that rectangle I'm gonna click finish' sketch click extrude I want extrude in direction to I want to extrude three inches and click enter I'm a little home view so I can see everything that I'm working on now just like I've done on my on part three I'm the same thing here on part five before I go any further let's do file save as and change this to part five hit enter perfect I'm gonna work on the right side view so I'm gonna click start 2d sketch and I'm just gonna click that view okay yeah I'm just gonna get it to where I want it perfect now this one's a little tricky because you have angles here that aren't given to you they don't tell you the exact length they don't tell you much of anything really so let's work with what we do know this one point five we know that the peak of this is directly in the center of this three inch box so let's use that to our advantage watch what we do line tool I start at the bottom left what do I do I'm gonna box it in like a heaven box on everything else and box it in you notice how it changes color it goes right to green when it gets to that corner sometimes it'll go to yellow that's fine all right so now I have a box around the entire thing notice I'm still in sketch - I haven't done anything else okay and so my line tool watch what I'm gonna do click the bottom left corner I'm gonna come over 1.5 I typed in 1.5 then I hit enter that is directly in the center of this three inch box now I just bring the line straight up notice how it turns green there when it gets to the top notice how it says two inches which is perfect where it should be and you notice where it says 90 degrees it's exactly what it should be as well snob just divided this box into two separate but equal sections here okay they're separate this is 1 point 5 by 2 this is 1 point 5 by 2 they're separated okay but they're both equal in size now let's take a look over here if I notice I have a line that comes down from that point all the way down to the far back side which in our case the way we're looking at it is the right side but on this side I've got a line that comes up one inch and then it slants over to the middle so let's worry about the let's do this all in one shot okay and let's start by going to the bottom left-hand corner so we're gonna start down here I still have my line tool selected make sure you still have that selected I'm going to click here and I'ma come up how far was that do you remember should we take a look one inch bring it up put my line right on top of that line type in 1 hit enter ok notice it's directly in the center and it's still attached I'm gonna bring this right over here click click this again on my line tool right over here click click on my little house all right now I'm gonna do finish sketch and you can see the the lines that I just made our right there click extrude now does it know what you what do you want to extrude so you have to tell it already I'm gonna hold down the ctrl key click this one and I'm gonna highlight just this area oh no I made a mistake it's okay remember hit cancel do it again extrude I want to highlight just this area here hold on can i holding down the control key click zoom in a little bit and I want to highlight just that area there okay so I basically just highlighted both those areas that I want to want to extrude okay I'm just moving the view around so you can see different different sides of it okay I want to go direction too but I want to do the whole distance so this is just one inch I know that it's five inches altogether so I'm gonna do five hit enter I have now made part five if by any chance holding down ctrl and clicking them doesn't work for you just do them separately if I go back I could always do it this way click extrude highlight the area that you want to extrude okay if it does that again that's just a mistake just highlight the area that you want to extrude make sure it turns light and color not dark okay again it can be tricky sometimes to work with so that's my just start with that one that's five I'll go direction to click okay and the reason why I want to show you this is because all of a sudden you notice those lines that were there before are no longer visible this happens a lot when you're working with inventor don't panic don't raise your hand be like oh I don't know what happened I'm about to tell you over here on the left hand side where it says extrusion to an extrusion one these are what I've just done these are the extrusions that I've just made I'm going to click this extrusion to okay and sketch - as we're just working notice if I if I roll over it if you look back at the piece you notice how those white lines come on back we wanted to be back there we want to make them visible right now they are invisible so I'm going to right click sketch - and then left click invisibility and if you look back all of a sudden there they are they're back again so now I can go back into extrusion and I can play around with this a little bit more again you may have to change your angles I a lot of times I tell students just change the angle maybe that'll help you out a little bit you want to get it so that it's light-colored and Oh got it okay I gotta take some time so be patient with it all right do direction to click okay now a lot of times you'll be you'll have your sketches your sketches will be left on that's okay but we want to turn them off the same way we turn them on it's the same way we're gonna turn them off you're going to right-click on that sketch so it for this in this case it's sketch to right-click and then unclick visibility click on my little house and there we go we have just made part 5 how cool is that we've already saved this but let's just click the Save button again just to make sure we save it it's this little disc right here ok it says save so you can just click that and you can save it now let's work on part 6 so new part click on that it's gonna open it up for us let's go to the big eye again let's go to save as and let's make this into part 6 click on her now we're at part 6 and we just saved it let's do start 2d sketch and now we've got our planes in front of us and let's let's take a look at part 6 ok part 6 looks a lot like part 3 okay so if remember who did part 3 at the same we're gonna do part 6 alright so this is part 6 let's take a look here we're gonna do a 5 by 2 rectangle and then extrude it out by 3 inches so let's start by doing that here's my front view front rectangle start down here at the center bring it up type in 5 I hit my tab key I then hit 2 and now I hit enter from here I'm gonna click on my little house I'm gonna do finish sketch I'm gonna do extrude and I'm gonna go direction too and I'm gonna go three inches decider the highlight of that I deleted it three click on my little boom okay so we have the standard five by two by three I just want to stop you here if you ever are not sure the size of something you're not sure what size it is that you made it click on the inspect tab at the top here and click on distance okay click on distance and what you can do is you can just click on lines and I'm sorry you click on points it'll tell you from point to point how big that line is okay so if I click on this it tells me it's 2 if I click this point to this point it tells me that it's 5 ok if I click this point to this point tells me that it's 3 it's exactly what it should be ok a 5 by 2 by 3 rectangle ok so getting back into 3d mode here we want to start a 2d sketch on our right side now I can either click here or I can click here does not make a difference okay so I click there then I clicked here alright so now I am on the right side view and let's take a look at what I need to make okay so I have to make this this weird-looking thing here so let's make this easy on ourselves let's make a line that goes up 1 a line that goes over 1.5 and then another line that comes up and we don't know the distance to that but we do know that it goes to the top right okay so let's just work on that so let's make a line that's one line that's 1.5 another line that's over to the right so watch again we're on the right view okay we're on the right side view so I start at the bottom left click I got my little line tool here okay comes up and we're gonna go1 hit enter I'm still attached my line is still attached I want to come over 1.5 now before I hit enter do you notice it says 90 degrees at the bottom there do you notice I am 1.5 I'm ready to go enter okay everything's good now I want to now take this line that is still attached and click it over to here perfect do you notice how my line tool is still attached now let's say for instance that your line tool goes away I just make mine go away you can always just click line again and as long as you're in the same sketch which I haven't finished sketch or anything I haven't done that long as you're in the same sketch you can just keep on working okay so I'm gonna click back over here and I'm gonna make that that piece that goes around the outside okay the the frame that was around the outside okay so now I have finished sketch now I have all my lines all the way around it no do you notice how it looks do you notice how everything looks looks purple or blue depending on what series of what version you're running with okay I have if I click on my house view I've got like that really weird shape and lined out okay now I have one up one I went over 1.5 now here's the question how far do I bring it back from here to here how far do I bring that back it's a little interesting because there really isn't a measurement for it okay I'm gonna do a little bit of math here all right the overall is 5 this piece right here is 2 so 2 minus 5 is 3 so I know that this line from here from here to here is 3 so that's gonna tell us our extrusion distance so let's click on extrude and I want to extrude just this oops I made a mistake click cancel extrude again okay so now I have just that partselect of the part that I want okay and I'm just gonna show you some different angles here a little a little show for you alright so click on my home view I add the part that I want to work with it happens to just be three which is perfect it's what I want if not just type in three and then I do Direction to click okay boom I had exactly what I want all right click my home view look at that I have now made part six click the little Save and fills you that why don't know what that icon is it's actually called a floppy disk we don't use those anymore believe it or not when I was a teacher that's well I'm sorry when I was a student we save everything I'm copy discs and well you don't see him anymore because the month they won't even hold a song that's how a little of space they have but that's but that's what that is called a floppy disk all right so you click on the Save icon and we've saved parts X let's go to the big guy let's go to new standard IPT again going to the big guy and clicking on new or clicking or just hovering over new and having it go to the parts thing it's it's the same thing a standard IPT in a part file is the same exact thing if you notice look down here at the bottom you notice how these have part one has part one dot i PT part two dot i PT okay this tells us that these are all in better parts okay that's what these are so these are in thinner parts so we know that they're a part that we've made and they're not like an assembly or a drawing or anything else like that okay so I just opened up a new a new part file unfortunately it's saying it's part 9 so let's correct that let's go to the big eye that's what a save as and this is actually part 7/7 but save okay all right I'll start 2d sketch click on the front view click the front plane the correct angle click 5 to click [Music] okay go to finish sketch extrude direction to change this to three perfect now what I want to do is I want to go to start TD sketch I want to click on the right side and what I want to do is I'm gonna grab my line tool click here click every corner here makes a nice box around what we need all right hmm let's start part number seven new standard IPT start sketch let's go to front click rectangle start down here five tab to enter click I'm a little house finish sketch extrude I want to extrude three inches in direction to perfect click on my little house click on start TD sketch again I'm gonna go to the right side I'm gonna grab my line tool and I want to go click on the bottom left corner click the top left corner wait till it turns green click with turns green click and green click perfect I have now made a box around the the right side of it now why did I pick the right side because if you look at part 7 I made the the overall box but on the right side I want to extrude out the letter L so I want to just get this this L shape going for me so I'm gonna go from the bottom left corner go up 1 over 2 go up 1 and over 1 okay already sorry I saw on the right side okay I'm on the right side I'm just gonna show you this ok I'm still in sketch mode let's look at my line tool go up 1 enter go over to make sure I'm perfectly 90 degrees to enter go up 1 make sure I'm perfectly 90 and go over here BAM right click OK click I'm a little house to finish my sketch extrude him when I extrude just the just the top part here so I can get just that highlighted sometimes it does take a second okay maybe it's gonna zoom in a little bit okay so I've clicked on just that top portion if I look around you can see it's just the area that I want I want to go in direction to but I want to go five inches okay now I'm a little house view now I want to work on this front and create that hole that that belongs there if I look here there's like just this gap in the middle okay those are two inch by one inch rectangles at the front here so let's start by making those and then just extrude out the middle so start 2d sketch and I'm gonna click just on this area okay just in this area click on front watch I'm going to do the same thing I have been doing grab my line tool click here click here click here click here click here okay and what I did was if I look at my side view okay I paint pretty much just outlined that whole front area there that I'm gonna be working on now with my lines tools stoically connected I'm sorry with my line tool click here I'm gonna come over to I just put it right there over to enter I'm gonna come up to that line which should be one which it is perfect then I'm gonna come over here click perfectly 90 or in this case 180 either one it's fine click to enter oh okay and then finish sketch now I have three boxes to buy one a two by one and then a one by one right in the middle there I'm gonna do extrude I'm gonna select the center area okay if you accidentally select the whole thing it's okay just gonna cancel click extrude remember we just want the area that you want to be highlighted mm-hmm I want to go in directions to and I want to go 3 hit 3 press 3 then enter and if you notice I've just created part number 7 okay let's make sure we save this file save as part 7 okay and we are good with part number 7 check that out now let's do part number 8 let's take a look at part 8 part 8 is a weird one okay but let's take this one step at a time okay so we're gonna start by making our 5 by 2 by 3 standard block okay so let's go to file file new double click standard IPT start 2d sketch I'm gonna click front click on the front clip rectangle click the center their 5 tab to enter click I'm a little house finish 2d sketch extrude I'm gonna straight out 3 click on my little house okay now we can begin to do a little bit of work on the the area here that we're never trying to extrude out which is going to be part of part 8 so let's go ahead and let's just save this real quick save as part eight typed in part 8 there you go so we save party let's work on the front view which is this view right here we got this line that comes down straight it comes over one then it comes up at an angle and then it goes over to oh boy okay let's relax here let's figure this out let's do this well let's do a start 2d sketch we're gonna click on this area now I know this is already part of sketch 1 but we've already done work on sketch 1 so we're gonna add another sketch on top of sketch one named sketch 2 and it's just gonna work out a little bit better for us we're gonna do is I'm gonna grab my line tool and I'm just going to highlight all the corners so I started at the top left come down here green clicked green clicked um turns green I'm gonna click click I'm just basically making a rectangle around the rectangle now what I want to do is I want to make that weird look in shape that was there and I want to strip out the area that I don't need okay so the top line I'm gonna make here is gonna be to the bottom line is going to be 1 and then we're gonna come like them okay I stole them on my line tool so I'm gonna click here I'm gonna bring this over to hit enter I don't I don't know where this line is gonna go yet I don't know how far over one inch is so I'm just going to right click and then click OK click back on my line tool now I'm gonna click on the bottom left-hand corner and I'll make this one click it and then I'm gonna come back up to where that two inch lines stop you notice it turns green and I'm gonna click that now I'm gonna do finish sketch ok and I clicked on my home view now what I want to do is I want to extrude the area that I don't want i wanna i want extrude and get rid of that okay so let's take a look here how far back does this does this extrusion go from here to here how far back won't be look the whole thing is 3 we know that okay there's this little indentation here is one this piece over here is one so this has to be just a one-inch which means that this whole area here has to be extruded back 1 inch okay so extrude highlight the area that we want okay which is this area here now we're do directions two and one inches already selected for us right here okay so I'm gonna click OK now just made that odd little shape on the side there okay you see how this looks similar to this over here really cool right now what we want to do is we want to make it this indentation that you see in the back shouldn't be that hard okay and here's why we're gonna do start TD sketch we're gonna click on that area that we want to work on okay what I want you to understand is you need to ignore the shaded area here when you're looking at the square here because we're not working on that plane anymore we're just working on this shaded area so what I'm going to do and be careful to do it like this I'm gonna start at the top right corner bring it down I clicked and I'm gonna bring it down clicked remember every time I click left click it turns blue or to a ring break like a turn red okay I'm gonna click right here okay which is the edge of this box now here's the thing the computer might not recognize the edge of the box so you might have to tell it hey listen I want to go to the edge of this box so if you notice I just turn my view there click that much for my view back click that and then right here him to click that now if you notice I've just made a box around this entire box right there now what I want to do is I want to create that's one inch piece that goes that's gonna be extruded back on that on that far side so I know what's gonna be extruded back or it's gonna be one inch but how far is it gonna go back good question all right so let's just worry about making the 1 inch box and then we'll do the rest in a minute let's start here at the top right I'm gonna come I have a line I line tool selected I'm gonna come over one enter I'm gonna come down perfectly 90 degrees make sure you're always doing any degrees here to select you know click on my little house do finish sketch and now I want to extrude back this piece so I want to get that selected now I want to extrude in direction too but I don't know how far to bring it back let's take a look here I want extrude am i shooting this area right here okay if I look the whole thing is 5 what I have left over is 3 which means that this piece has to be 2 so I've already got this here I'm ready going in the correct direction direction to which is also 2 inches put it in a 2 hit enter I have now just created Kart 8 click Save and I wrap it up I have carts 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5 part 6 part 7 part 8 ok that is all 8 shapes when you are done make sure that you hit save and that is the completed tutorial for parts 1 through 8 with inventor thanks for watching", "2FZgUC0F6XY": "when I was learning about shotguns I remember that gauge and all the different payloads was a little bit difficult for me to wrap my head around and so in this video we're gonna go over what each of those are I'm Chris Chang History Channel's Top Shot season four champion and professional marksman for Bass Pro Shops here we've got two different shotguns one's a 12-gauge and one's a 20 gauge and they're both Mossberg shotguns but how do we know which gauge is which at first glance they kind of look identical the way you tell is by looking at the stamping on the barrel it'll mention 20 gauge 12 gauge or there are other gauges available but 12 and 20 gauge are the common beginner gauges so now that we know how to determine your shotguns gauge let's take a look at what the ammo looks like here we have a 12 gauge round in the middle we have a 20 gauge round and on the end here we have actually another round which is a 410 round now the 410 round it's really small as you can see and typically it's more of an advanced round so I'm gonna set this aside and we're just going to talk about the 12 and 20 gauge round now the way this works I'm going to really simplify this for you is that be smaller the gauge number the larger the round so here is a 12 gauge round which is larger than the 20 gauge round another thing to take into consideration is your shotgun shell length two and three-quarter inch or three inch shells are common but they can go as large as three and a half inches as well this will also be noted on the side of your shotgun barrel so make sure that your shotgun shell length matches whatever stamped on your barrel now to talk about payloads we've got three common payloads right in front of us here we have birdshot buckshot and slugs now with birdshot as you can see here it's these smaller bb's which are common in competition in hunting and also in trap skeet and sporting clays in the middle here we have buckshot which were these larger bb's common in home defense and hunting and then finally we have slugs which are these huge chunks of metal basically really similar to a bullet let's talk now about the composition of a shotgun shell and what's happening here now when the shell is inside of a shotgun on the end here we have a primer in the center of the shell here now when you pull the trigger a firing pin gets released and hits that primer now what happens the primer ignites there's a small little spark that goes off inside we now then have gunpowder in this part of the shell there is a plastic wad that is holding the payload and the payload is all the way in the end of the front of the shell so let's take a closer look at the inside of a shell now that you know what's going on I've got a shell that I've already cut open so I'm going to lift off the outside part there and see a bunch of that shot come out here's a bunch of that shot and alright throw it over the left shoulder for good luck here is that what I was talking about all right made out of plastic and then finally we've got the powder all in there as well alright so now that you have an understanding of gauge and the different payloads birdshot buckshot and slugs if you're looking for a place to shoot check out where to shoot dorg to find a range near you and finally always remember that firearm safety depends on you", "Sv3feH266nY": "every day a to development every hour a new story every minute history in the making news interviews education we are TNM news how many grams are in an ounce well how many times have you bought some weed and you thought you were getting more than what you bargained for but it turns out you got less than what you bargained for why is cannabis weed and sold by the gram from cultivator to dispensary when buying by the pound and yet they sell grams eighths quarters and ounces in retail it's interesting how we mix the metric system when you have to be exactly now I know math might not be your thing but it's important to know these things if you are at some point going to buy some weed which if I foresee everybody doing in the near future so according to merriam-webster a gram is a metric unit of mass equal to one thousandth of a kilogram grams are used to weight everything from seed to sale in the cannabis industry and are the building blocks for personal cannabis purchases although like I previously stated marijuana flower is usually sold at retail establishments by the eighth of an ounce a quarter of an ounce or a full ounce and extracts are sold by the gram in the hopper and much why I don't know so anyways how many grams are in an ounce well the official answer is twenty eight point three four nine five that's right twenty-eight point three four ninety five grams per ounce now most people will round that down to 28 grams per ounce so if you buy large quantities you end up losing a little over a brown every three ounces and since there are 16 ounces to a pound you will lose a little over 5 grams per pound and that can be 5 joints that's a lot to me that might not be about you but it definitely adds up over time so here it goes there are 28 grams to announce 14 grams to a hot balance 7 grams to a quarter ounce and 3.5 grams to an 8 oh and if you buy less than an 8 you'd be buying by the gram at that point anyway so oh and for all of you ballers out there there are four hundred and fifty three point 592 grams to a pound which is always rounds up to 450 for when buying info so quick recap there are officially 28 point three four nine five grams per ounce of the most people round that down to 28 grams per ounce so that means there are 28 grams to announce 14 grams so I've ounce seven grams to a quarter ounce and 3.5 grams to an eighth and there you have it you are now officially smarter than a fifth grader well at least you're smarter than you were before you watch this video remember 28 grams to an ounce i have christine's bhavani with the national marijuana news thank you for watching don't forget to give us a follow on facebook instagram and twitter

the Mojo choke tube on the Benelli and I figure while is out here be cool to do a little comparison video pretty much myself and I think my whole team uses the Winchester long beard XR well I went ahead and picked up the double X and I've got the winchester super X two kind of shooting down ranch just to compare those and I'm gonna show you guys the results of that at the end of this video [Music] [Music] I'm pretty much shot my shoulder off and this was the last one I did here this is the five shot long beard XR and I was just doing it from 30 yards I did everything from 30 yards you can see I was a little off there but that's open sights and everything holds a really really tight pattern and this holds a tight pattern I can vouch for it up to you know 60 yards even and that mojo choke there's a heck of a job combined with that well I try to lay him out where you can see them as best as you could a shot pretty much three-inch of everything except the XRS I already had them at three and a half inch and didn't want to buy them in three-inch but I had the devil X that is the six shot that did really well it's pretty impressed with that and then you had the Winchester Super X which of course just didn't hold the pattern even anywhere close to compared to the double X or the long beard XR and of course the long beard XR I shot the four shot and the five shot both hold a really close close pattern and if you like taking those longer shots or if you like to hit exactly where you aim that is the ammo for you now if you like to have a little bit wider shot then you might want to look at the devil X or even the Winchester Super X but all three have done great and I was pretty impressed by them [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "FjxdibpsqkA": "hey what's up guys it's Tim Walker thanks for joining me today we're gonna talk about the $10 a gram business model I made a video recently that was essentially complaining about the high price of weed and I thought I should maybe clarify a little bit on what I mean by ten dollars a gram so let's move this joint will talk about the ten dollar a grandbabies so essentially the ten dollar grim business model works like this when you pay ten dollars you get one gram at the lowest end of the scale ten dollars one gram one dollar per quarter now when you move up to grabbing say a half quarter three point five grams you're gonna get a little bit of a price break you're gonna pay $30 for the three point five or you're still gonna be paying a dollar a point which is still okay three point five thirty five dollars you're paying basically 850 per gram to ten dollars a gram now when you move up to a quarter you're not gonna get that much of a price break unless you were paying a dollar point at a half quarter in which case you're probably gonna get your quarter for 850 grams at sixty dollars for a quarter or you're gonna be paying a dollar point still which is gonna put you at $70 per quarter now when you double that you really grab a half ounce of weed and that's gonna be 14 grams and it should cost you between 100 and 120 dollars that's gonna come out to $7 gram or about 850 when you double that and you grab a full ounce which is 28 grams you should be paying between seven and eight dollars a gram which comes out to two hundred to two hundred and twenty dollars so as you can see the ten dollar a gram business model at the higher end when you're grabbing an ounce or more is no longer ten dollars a gram in fact it's less it's about seven and that's the way I believe it should be now when I posted my last video a couple of you guys mentioned that wheat prices in the states are astronomically higher than in Canada which I am aware of and I guess you could say that we're a bit spoiled in Canada then because at the highest end of our spectrum if you're grabbing an ounce you're probably paying at most two hundred and eighty dollars which is basically a dollar a point for ceiling as I said in my last video and that's still like half the price of what a lot of people in the states are paying for an ounce so I guess you could call it complaining and whatever you want but whatever I'm a firm believer in the $10 Graham business model you guys could let me know what you think I'd love to know some of the different models that you've experienced whether it was the the old dime models at points Evans for ten dollars or the old three for twenty I'd love some insight from across the border so hit me up in the comment section guys anyways joins almost done don't forget to Like comment

Pro candle supply.com make sure you check out my website where you can get all of your candle making needs right in one place or check out one of our candle making kits if you're just getting started I've included the links in the description below today we're going to be talking about how much wax candle containers hold and how to find out how much wax your container will hold I get a lot of questions about the sizes of candle containers people seem to be getting confused by the liquid volume a container can hold versus how much wax by weight it can hold I'll explain how sizing works and how to apply it to candle making first and foremost there are a lot of containers out there many of them are designed to be used with more than just candle making most manufacturers of containers list the size based on the liquid volume that they hold this is not very helpful for us candle makers because we always formulate candles by weight and not by liquid volume and thus it's very confusing to someone who is just starting the containers on our website show the industry standard liquid volume as well as how much actual soy wax they will hold by weight for example the 8 ounce candle tin here holds 8 ounces of liquid volume but only 6 ounces of melted wax by weight this holds true for nearly any 8 ounce candle 10 you buy anywhere the 16 ounce candle tin holds 16 ounces of liquid volume and approximately 10 ounces of melted wax by weight the 16 ounce mason jar holds 16 ounces of liquid volume and approximately 12 ounces of melted wax by weight remember when making candles you always formulate them by weight not by volume it's extremely important that you always weigh out your fragrances and wax on a kitchen scale never use a liquid measuring device if you measure out 16 fluid ounces of fragrance oil or wax with a liquid measuring device it will not be the same amount as if you weigh out 16 ounces by weight of fragrance or wax on a scale here I have our 16 ounce mason jar it holds 16 ounces of water and it's sold a 16-ounce jar nearly everywhere you can buy it but when making a candle it will not hold 16 ounces of wax by weight let me demonstrate this for you what I'm about to show you is also a really good trick to find out how much wax any candle container will hold first you turn the scale on and make sure it's announces check check then you're going to put the jar onto the scale then go ahead and tear it out so the scale reads zero sorry there's a little bit of a glare on the scale so we tilted it a little bit now I should be able to see it so we have the scale it's on its announces we put the jar on we tear it it out and now we're at zero ounces so now you're gonna take your melted soy wax and you're gonna pour it into the jar until it hits the neck of the jar or until where you want to fill your candle to [Music] as you can see on the scale pouring to the neck of the jar gives me approximately 12 ounces by weight of soy wax this would be the perfect fill amount for my candle and now I know that I need 12 ounces of wax by weight each time I want to make this candle like I said before you can do this with any jar you have if you want to know how much wax it will hold by weight now that we have 12 ounces let me show you what would happen if I actually tried to put 16 ounces of wax by weight into this jar [Music] right at the top I don't want to keep pouring and make a huge mess but as you can see the candle jar is filled all the way to the tippy top and as you can see the candle wax weighs 15 ounces obviously you're not making candles like this because this one burned properly there's no room for the wick it's obviously not a correct candle so the jar doesn't hold 16 ounces of wax it only holds 12 ounces of wax to be a correct sized candle so moral of the story is this make sure you never make your candles based on liquid volume throw your liquid measuring devices into the cupboard and don't use them at all when you're making candles so I hope this helped clear up some confusion my wax is about to spill in my next video I'm going to show you how to find out how much wax and fragrance you need to make a specific number of candles I've definitely shown this in previous videos but I've decided I need to make a designated video just for this topic with some extra helpful tips and tricks so it's easy to find in view thanks so much for watching make sure you like and subscribe so you don't miss any future videos bye", "XWC9dDif8O8": "hey I'm back with a another video so you may or may not have heard of the 8 by 8 rule basically states that we are supposed to consume 8 glasses of water a day a what yes so that is correct that's about half a gallon or 2 liters of it that sounds like a lot of water this claim has become somewhat of an accepted wisdom and literally have been towed and shared by everyone but is there truth to this advice or is it just some minutes well friends so we are putting it to the test in today's video I decided to go a week of consuming eight glasses of water a day I'm super excited to give this a try and see if there are any noticeable differences here we go morning so today is day number one of the eight glasses of water a day challenge you know I'm actually feeling pretty excited about this and you know what this is about to do for my skin good girl Oh so here is my bottle of water this is actually a 1 liter No yeah it is it's a one liter bottle that means a 33.8 fluid ounces how many Ounces are in a cup 8 so this is about like 4.2 yeah four point two glasses we're just gonna count it as four so y'all won't think I'm cheating but yes by the time I drink all of this this will count as a full glasses four glasses of water that was good so as you can see I drink this much yeah um I'm necessarily halfway there but we have 24 hours we can do it let's get this day started so here's an update I'm getting ready to leave for the day and look guys I am literally like more than halfway there with my first bottle ah hey guys so it's been a couple of hours since you've last seen me I went to class and went to another class I had a quick meeting and now I am back home I was supposed to come home and do some work yeah that didn't happen I got home I told myself Morgan you're pretty tired you deserve a nap it's only opposed to be like a quick power nap like 20 minutes seriously only 20 minutes I slept for over an hour on the bright side however I did finish my first liter of water for the day yeah that's four glasses down and then I am currently like almost halfway done with the second bottle and it's only like like five o'clock where's my time I am like on a roll like I'm doing great so I've decided that I'm going to continue being irresponsible and not do my work watch a movie and hopefully by the end of this movie I should be done with my second bottle and yeah that's it glasses go girl girls on the ground what what is going on Effie Curtis was supposed to love me Curtis was supposed to love me Dada okay so no work was actually completed book okay what's more important is that we finished all of our water for the day guys this is a glasses what what what eight glasses is complete we did it we did it we did it Oh brain yes we did it we did it good morning and welcome to day two of our what water water water drinking water drinking so I will say everything is so far so good I think because I already just drink a lot of water in any given day like that part is it hard I don't struggle with the actual consumption of water I love water I love how it tastes I prefer water literally over like any other drink anyway I think the part that I I want to say struggling with or okay maybe struggling with be to remember like how much water I actually have to drink typically I'm just drink water freely and not necessarily pay attention to how much water but now that I know I have like a set number to hit which is the eight glasses or however many ounces that is I would have to consistently like remind myself okay you have this many to go you have this many go yep this needs so currently I am on my first leader of the day I'm about this much and probably not even a glass or like maybe sorta so it's still pretty early we have a lot of hours to go in the day so let's uh let's get this day going so update okay so as you can see I made some major progress yes this is still my first leader of the day but I only have like this much like this is not a lot yes girl yeah this is basically for glasses complete so I just made it back home before the day and want to give you guys a little update um water has been going well the no surprises there I am already halfway done with my second liter so that's what almost basically I guess six glasses yeah so I'm like six glasses down two more to go I guess the only like Oh about this whole thing is how much you have to go to the bathroom oh my god gotta use it gotta use it use it that goes is bathroom one more time literally like almost every 30 minutes I am running to the bathroom yeah I think I'm just gonna stay here your bladder is like girl this has to go somewhere and it has to come out so let it out I think that's supposed to be like good for the body right also I think the water is like helping with my digestive what why is this word so hard digestive system which I guess is also a really good thing my system is clear y'all like it is clear so yeah those are the two things that are like sticking out the most um over these past two days or more so that I've seen like chain we are still on a roll people undercover superstar yeah a glass is complete for day number two guys so it is day number three of our eight glasses of water a day thing we have been doing so it is currently like it's like five o'clock no idea and I have successfully completed my eight glasses of water or as you guys know I've been doing the two liters I think like drinking two of these as opposed to eight actual cups of water is not as overwhelming you know like my brain can say okay Morgan you only need to drink to like to two bottles well two very big bottles as opposed to like one two three four five six seven eight so yeah another day another dollar okay another day successful but today I really wanted to sit down and talk about like the overall condition of my skin over these past three days so you guys already know like in regards to skin care water is so important like people say that all because even though I am already mindful of that in addition to being mindful of just like my overall skin care I would say that like I have seen like some really good stuff happening to my skin some areas of my skin like especially my t-zone I've used stuff for some dryness but like galaxy some dryness cuz cuz I don't and by the way I am not wearing any makeup what just so y'all gonna say okay my skin feels so smooth it looks smooth it is also hydrated it looks hydrated and I think a lot of that has to do well I'm sure a lot of it has to do with all the water I have been drinking also also also okay like before I started this eight glasses of water thing I was getting like some little pimples trying to pop up here and there I'm sure a lot of them were just like stress pimples because I had like a really stressful week but y'all again y'all see some pimples cuz that time I will say date three is also a success there we go date number four yes guys it is day number four already Wow so today I had a little bit of a rough start where I'm just now getting off the house and I haven't yet like I haven't drinkin any water yet mmm or yet but okay still my faith in me I'm headed to rehearsal now and since I'll be like jumping around being tired I know I'll be able to complete the eight glasses and rehearsal alone so yeah it ain't oppa it ain't no but so I actually ran out of the house without my water bottle because I was rushing because I was late but that's nothing new what my good friend Carla always saves the day shoutout to you girl by bringing me a 32-ounce to make sure I stayed on track [Applause] progress progress and we're back okay first things first like can we get into this hoodie like guys this is like the first hoodie ever ever to fit my hair so the last time we spoke I was at with her so and I am proud to say guys look I saved it for you just to make sure I have proof I finished my 32 ounce water cup cup yep Cup honestly it wasn't that hard because when you're dancing for literally four hours straight all you want is water but I know you guys are like uh-huh you got four more to go so we're sad right after rehearsal I went right to the store to get me another liter of smart water and no this is not sponsored if you guys can see I have a little less than half like yeah a little less than half to go so that's probably like three point four seven five glasses left to consume before the night is over we can definitely do it I'm going to finish up some work and sippy-sip while I do that and by the next time I see you guys I should be done we should be complete yes okay all right I just sat here for the past like maybe two hours and did absolutely nothing like I don't understand what their time just went on the bright side though I am almost complete with my eight glasses okay let me just finish this up if that people is officially eight glasses for day number four good afternoon guys yes it is not morning this time I had a bit of a late start this morning I didn't get my work done I had to get up extra early this morning to like finish it before class so I didn't have the opportunity to turn on my camera and like chat you guys are probably like girl where's the water what eat what you're doing got good news okay I finished my first liter I went to the store right before class and picked up two bottles finished one throughout the day but I do have one more that I need to finish up that's some good water okay okay so we made it this far with our last leader of the day oh my god I'm actually getting ready to go to rehearsal so I should definitely be able to finish this within the next hour for sure so yeah I'll see you guys we're done so guys we are back hey did you miss me did you miss me did you miss and I am pleased to announce that we have finished we have officially yes finished our last bottle of the day do you know what that means that means we have successfully completed a glass of water for the week uh sorry this is just really satisfied Wow I drank what was eight times five eight times five sometime wait how do we get the total ounces I don't know but we drink a lot of water this week guys now I have to go pee again so I would actually say this week was a complete success as I mentioned I believe on one day to the actual consumption of the water like wasn't the hard part whatsoever and that's because I already drink lots and lots of water like daily I will say the hardest part for me was like remembering that I had a certain amount of water I must consume before the day was over so initially it seemed like it was more of a task versus me just being super thirsty and wanted to consume water other than that however everything else went pretty smooth there were some recognizable differences that I've seen like with my body the first thing was my skin it was smooth and hydrated and most importantly pimple free okay a girl's dream like to the point or makeup just just wasn't necessary there was only one day which I believe will stay 5 where I actually wore makeup the rest of the days guys that that was my skin the second thing that I noticed was the change in my energy I'm definitely like not a morning person whatsoever but I found this week getting up in the morning and like feeling refreshed and energized wasn't a hard task for me so yeah I will say was pretty successful so I really hope you guys enjoy today's

about tips and tricks on how to do hard sell on eBay I'm a I've been selling on eBay for the past five years and I've been doing pretty good as a reseller I have friends and family who also want to do the same thing and the number one issue that people have is shipping so I figured I'd do a quick video give you some helpful tips perhaps you're interested in becoming an eBay reseller or just sell some stuff do you have laying around your house or make a few extra bucks hopefully I can give you some good advice and encourage you to do it because I've been doing this for a while and it's pretty good side side income I don't have to get a part-time job so let's begin keep in mind when you're beginning to sell on eBay you're gonna have a limit which is 10 items at $1,000 but if you continue to sell stuff and you bbc's are you doing pretty good then you could always call them and increase it and the problem the number one thing I always tell people that if you're gonna have an eBay account you should have a PayPal account as well you go you can also sync up your bank account to your eBay but when you make transactions it's gonna take time for the funds to actually hit your bank account because the bank actually wants they take about three to five business days but with PayPal it's automatic and you can build up a balance and then when you when you want to transfer that money to your bank account that's when you could do it that's you can transfer everything I want and then they'll take their normal three to five business days before you start running you gotta learn how to walk and one of the things I tell everybody to do as far as my as far as my second tip is to start selling small before you start some of the big stuff so you probably have a pile of clothes you want to sell some are worth $10 and some are worth hundreds of dollars start off by selling the small stuff stop this Wharf like five ten dollars playing around with eBay with that merchandise with those little items and once you start selling you get the hang of how eBay works and you learn more about the process then you can so the bigger items the Banger stuff number three you're gonna find similar items on eBay that you're selling so you can price compare so for example I'm trying to sell a shirt I don't know how much I could sell it for you don't want to undersell it or you don't want to also over sell it because there nobody's gonna buy it from you so I will look up the brand of the shirt to see if it's on eBay there's a filter you can check out which it tells you what are the last 90 days people who have sold a similar item you could find out it's the price the average so let's say the same shirt has sold five times the past month well it has been the average price has been selling for so you get an idea of how much your item is actually warf because if you understood that somebody's gonna take from you for a great deal then you really lost out on a few bucks but if you trying to oversell it nobody's ever gonna buy from you unless you actually set it to a lower price tip number four is you gotta take good pictures of your items so eBay I recommend to have a white background but now they recently updated the app so you can actually crop out the background so if you're selling something I say sneakers take pictures of every angle the bottom the inside you know people think of it as you being the buyer you want to see a lot of pictures of the item before you buy it because if you just put one or two pictures you're probably not gonna get that many viewers I suppose somebody else who's selling the same item with more pictures they're gonna get the sale so try to take a lot of good pictures and use that cropping tool on eBay to erase the background you know a white background looks more professional another thing is when you're selling items use that use the Buy It Now option as opposed to the auction option is mostly for memorabilia so fans can fight over who wants it the most but if you're selling something you know it's a regular 20 $30 price range the seller said buy it now and always allow offers entertain offers from buyers buyers may be not hesitant to sell to buy your item for the full price they'll send you an offer most of the times will be a very low ball offer but that's when you can actually make a counteroffer and eBay allows you both parties to counteroffer for five times so maybe you guys can meet in the middle and arrange a deal to sell the item it's better to sell it for something instead of it occupying space in my home when I could get rid of it make money spend the money that's how it works so this is where the shipping part comes a little tricky for people if you're not sure how much your item is gonna wait and on eBay when you're listening an item is gonna ask you how much as a weight by digital shipping scale I'm gonna post an Amazon affiliate link in the description below of this video and you can buy a shipping scale for $20 from Amazon and you should get it within two or three days sorry about that anyways so I don't see why your item you can actually figure out how much actually Waits and then when you're listening on eBay you can put USPS FedEx or UPS normally USPS is the cheapest it was less than a pound which is fit up to fourteen ounces there's typically ships for three to four bucks anything over that we've already mail but it will tell you right there all you gotta do is put how much awaits and I'll tell you all the shipping options when you select one and then you can have the buyer pay for that shipping aside from the price that they're paying for your item so buy a shipping scale it helps when you're selling stuff and it actually does get rid of a lot of confusion when it comes to shipping alright number seven is that don't buy labels at the post office use eBay to buy your labels when you're shipping items if you're gonna go to the post office you're gonna get a different rate from buying from eBay eBay gives their sellers a discounted rate for buying their labels through their websites aside from saving money another great reason is because when the seller if you do this way the seller gets an automatic notification under under eBay saying here's your tracking number so they can track the package when it's an male but if you go to the post office they're gonna create their own tracking number and then you have to come back home or on your phone and insert that tracking number manually onto eBay so it saves you time if you buy from eBay and actually it's a good benefit for the for the buyer because they get an automatic update on the tracking all right tip number I forgot but there's another tip if you find shipping supplies and you have if you're selling a lot of stuff you may want to buy in bulk and Amazon usually where I get my shipping supplies in bulk and it's a great deal but if you're gonna just solve one thing or two things down low you know once in a while you don't have to buy in bulk you just go to Walmart spend a dollar or two on the poly mail a mailer or box and then just ship your item out that way so if you're buying in bulk go to Amazon if you just buying one or two things to ship out one two items or the Walmart I'm gonna finish up this video with one last thing now since you're doing your your business or even PayPal PayPal collects or feast right away so you don't have to pay them but even you do have a balance so they say for example if you're done selling for the month and you made a hundred bucks you have to understand there's a balance that paid the eBay is gonna take out of your PayPal balance so when you're done we're before you transfer any money to your bank account look at your eBay balance go to your my account and right there should tell you the balance and you can just make a payment right away so I do that so let's say I have a hundred bucks I will eat may twenty dollars I pay eBay the twenty dollars did I know that those eighty dollars I could transfer to my bank if you do it the other way where you transfer $100 to your account and then later on eBay is trying to collect their twenty dollars they're gonna take it from PayPal PayPal has no balance then that twenty dollars is coming out of your bank account yeah there's a truck behind me anyways those were my tips if you guys have any more tips you want to add to this video just feel free to drop a comment down below if you thought this video was helpful give it a thumbs up subscribe because I have a reseller and I do a lot of thrifting and maybe you can learn some more info from me and watch me and say go treasure-hunting also click the little buff so when I do drop a new video you get notified right away than that I guess I'll see you guys the next time take care and be well [Music] [Music]", "BdCKB7y4Weg": "okay so we're going to fill in the information that we just solved on our weight of state birds so i know that one ounce one pound is 16 ounces three pounds is 48 5 pounds is 80 ounces 10 pounds is 160. a half of a pound is 8 ounces 1 8 of a pound is 2 ounces 1 4 of a pound is 4 ounces and 3 4 of a pound is 12 ounces so now we're gonna solve each number story using drawings or equations to show how you found your answer so two the yellow hammer is the state bird of alabama a yellow hammer weighs one-fourth of a pound what is the weight of six yellow hammers so i could write this as a number model which would be six times one-fourth and we would get six fourths or one and one oh sorry it would be or one and two two-fourths which also could be written as one and one-half so six yellow hammers weighs one and one-half of a pound is that more or less than 30 ounces so now we're going to take one and one half and we're going to change it to ounces so i know that one pound is 16 ounces plus if i look at my chart i know a half a pound is 8 ounces and i would get 24 and i know that 24 is less than 30 ounces because remember they asked if it was less than or greater than 30 ounces and we know that it is less let's look at three what is the combined weight so i'm gonna highlight that because that means we're adding combined weight of three four and three eighth pound neenies from hawaii and two seven and five eighth pounds brown pelicans from louisiana so i'm going to write the numbers on top of here so we don't forget the that you have multiple birds so you have to do a few things first we have to figure out each combined weight of the type of bird and then we have to add them together i'm going to do my work down here so we have more room um and then i'll erase it so here are the knee knees so i'm going to put an n for a nene so we have three neenies and they each weigh four and three eighths so that means that i'm going to split apart this mixed number just like we did in earlier lessons about how to multiply whole numbers by mixed numbers so it's three times four and three eighths so really this would look like three times parentheses four plus three eighths and then you multiply 3 times 4 and then add that to 3 times 3 8. actually let me zoom in here so you guys can see what i'm doing and i know that 3 times 4 is 12 plus 3 times 3 8 is 9 8 which i can also write as 1 and 1 8 and i add them together and i get 13 and one eighths so now i know that the knee knees weigh 13 and 1 8 pound for three of them so now i'm going to do the same thing but i'm going to do it for the brown pelicans so there's two brown pelicans and they each weigh 7 and 5 8 pound so i'm going to rewrite this to 2 times 7 plus 5 8 don't forget your parentheses they're very important so 2 times 7 plus 2 times five eighths and i'm actually going to go up here 2 times 7 is 14 plus 2 times 5 8. i know 2 times 5 is 10 and my denominator stays the same i can rewrite ten eighths as one and two eighths so you get fifteen and two eighths so now i'm gonna add those together and you are left with 28 because 13 plus 15 is 28 1 8 plus 2 8 is 3 8. okay so let's erase my work so i have room to do number four which weighs more five seven eight pound greater road runners from new mexico or four one and one-eighth pound ruffled gross from grouse i think is how you say that from pennsylvania so oh sorry guys i just dropped my my charger um so we have to do multiplication just like we did in the last problem so let's figure out how much the road runners weigh first so there's five times seven eighths well i know that 5 times 7 is 35 and the denominator stays the same 35 8 what is a multiple of 8 that gives you close to 35 well i know 4 times 8 is 32 so 35 minus 32 you're left with three eighths so that's how much the road runner weighs five road runners weigh four and three eighths of a three-eighth pounds now let's figure out how much the um pennsylvania state bird weighs so there's four times one and one-eighth so there's a whole number times a mixed number so we have to do what we did in the last problem and break one and one-eighth apart so i'm gonna rewrite this as four times one plus one-eighth and then you do four times one remember parentheses you can't forget them here plus 4 times 1 8 and 4 times 1 is 4 plus 4 8 which would be 4 and 4 8. so 4 and 3 8 the road runners and then 4 and 4 8 which is the state bird from pennsylvania which weighs more well for ruffled grouse which i think is how you say that but i could be mispronouncing that so that's something if you want to look that up let miss mold know about it and by how many more ounces well the fours are the same and there's a difference of 4 8 minus 3 8 which would give me 1 8 and i know that 1 8 is 2 ounces okay guys watch the next video for your math boxes", "IxDpQB6iVY4": "\u266a\u266a\u266a My name is Ronnie Coleman and\nI'm an 8-time Mr. Olympia and current IFBB pro, and I'm\nhere today to tell you guys more about my training,\nnutrition and supplementation. \u266a\u266a\u266a Real quick before we get\ninto that, let me tell you a bit more about me. I got into bodybuilding and\nI did it working full time as a police officer. \u266a\u266a\u266a It kind of goes\nback to growing up. When I was a kid, you know, my\nmom pretty much had a strict regimen that we followed. Before she went to work, she\njust laid out everything she wanted us to do\nbefore she came back. When we went to school, we had\nto come home and do our homework right away, you know, before we\nwent out and played and stuff. If it wasn't done\nwhen she got back, you was in a lot of trouble. A hard head makes\na real soft behind. Just been--just followed\nme all throughout my life. I've been training all my\nlife and I had a pretty good background in just training\nbut, you know, not training as a bodybuilder but just training,\njust to keep in shape and training for football and\ntraining for the college team and that kind of stuff. I went to college for 4 years\nand got my degree, it was a BS degree in accounting and kind\nof graduated with honors and everything, so I was at\nthe top of the class. Couldn't wait to get out\nof school so I could get a job in accounting. So I'd go out and I'd\nput in probably about at least a thousand resumes. I'd get called on some\ninterviews and the thing that they wanted most, I didn't\nhave and that was experience. So I was bored so a\nbuddy of mine said, \"Oh, I'm going to Dallas.\" I'm like, \"Okay, I'll go out\nthere with you 'cause I ain't got nothing to do at home.\" So I get to Dallas and I'm\nlike now, you know, I ain't got nothing to do so I need a job. Finally got a job, you know,\nworking Domino's Pizza part time and stuff. I figured that I'll just\nstay there until I can get a job in accounting. So cut to the chase 2 years down\nthe road and I still don't have a job in accounting, you know? And I'm thinking,\nthere's something wrong here. I used to get the paper every\nday and the only job that they had that you didn't have to have\nexperience was a police officer. I used to have a buddy\nof mine, he's like, \"Man, you need to apply.\" I'm like, \"Dude, that's the\ncraziest job in the world.\" It didn't sound so crazy after\nlike, you know, 2 years so I just broke down and I applied\nand I was hired probably about 3 months later. I've been out on calls where,\nyou know, before I got there, you know, there was a big\nargument going on and the people yelling at\nscreaming at each other. And then all of a sudden, I\nwalk up and they look at me and they stop, right away. And then the focus is on me. \"Man, you're pretty big.\" Yeah, a little bit. I didn't know anything about\nbodybuilding when I got into it. Weightlifting, I try to tell\npeople all the time, it was like a hobby for the and the reason\nwhy I started because people used to always ask\nme if I worked out, and I used to always say no. I got to the point where\nI got tired of saying no. I'm like, if they ask me why I'm\nworking out, maybe I should work out and see where it can\ntake me so that's why I started working out. It was all a stepping stone\nto where I am today. It took me about 8, 9 years of\ndieting, training, working full time in the police department\ntrying to organize all this with a family. And first we had to get, you\nknow, out of the amateurs, then we had\nto get to the pros, then we had to get\nestablished as a pro. And then we had to get good\nenough where we could, you know, win a Mr. Olympia. \u266a\u266a\u266a Yeah, buddy. \u266a\u266a\u266a I try to train every body\npart about twice a week so I'll try to train like 6 days a\nweek, spend about an hour, an hour 15 minutes a\nday on training alone. And if I'm getting ready for\na contest and stuff like that then, you know, it's another\ncouple hours a day of cardio. I take Sundays\noff, 1 day a week. My rest day is like, you know,\nget up early, about 9, have a little bite to eat, go to\nchurch, come home, take a shower and stuff and get\nready for work. People always ask me how do you\nbuild muscle and how do you get strong and all\nthis kind of stuff. It's two different things. I did both, you know, I was a\npowerlifter and when I was a powerlifter, we only did, you\nknow, like a few reps at a time. And we'd like do like, six, four\nand two, something like that. That was to build strength. But to build muscle, you know,\nyou do a lot of reputations like 10, 15, 20 and that's\nhow you build muscle. It's all\nlightweight to me though. It wasn't a big transition\nbecause I only did powerlifting for about maybe 2 or 3 years. Now when you got like 800 pounds\nof weight on your back, you ain't really thinking\nabout no competitors. You thinking about trying\nto got the weight off ya. Every rep, that's what you\nbasically thinking about. I've always wanted to train with\na partner if it's somebody that can, you know, challenge\nme and do the same weight that I'm doing. But if not, then I\nrather train alone. Coming up, you know,\nwe pushed each other and it worked out\nreal good for us. So I much rather train\nwith a training partner than to train alone. I like to tell people just, you\nknow, do it like I did it and get a personal trainer and that\nway you know what you're doing. You're doing it the\nright way and you're not going down the wrong way. You're not wasting your time. \u266a\u266a\u266a If you don't have the right\nnutrition, you're not gonna grow and I learned that the hard way\nbut I learned it in a good way. When I was playing football and\njust doing stuff like that and not actually trying to get\nbig, all I did was eat like hamburgers and fried chicken\nand all that kind of stuff. And I was wondering why I wasn't\ngrowing any muscle 'cause I was eating a lot of food, but I\nwant eating a lot of good food. Protein is what build muscle but it's gotta be good,\nquality protein. I try to eat about\nsix meals a day. What I try to do is get like\n2 grams of protein for every 1 pound of body weight. I try to take in about 600\ngrams of protein a day, like 100 grams of\nprotein per meal. My mass building muscle\ntechniques are chicken, steak, and turkey. It's a strict diet and we\ndon't deviate not one bit. Nutrition to bodybuilding is\nwhat an engine is to a car. If you don't have the\nright nutrition, it ain't gonna\nfunction properly. Just like a car, if you ain't\ngot an engine in it, it's gonna be kind of hard\nto drive around and get to where\nyou're trying to go. \u266a\u266a\u266a Without supplementation,\nyou can't do it. When I first started in\nbodybuilding, we didn't have as many supplements\nas they have today. We were just basically taking\nstuff like aminos, protein and you can't get not 1 ounce\nof muscle without protein. You kind of like, you know,\nlearn with the curve as time went on. Of course, you got pre-workout\ndrinks and post-workout drinks. You got your nitric oxide. It gives you a, you know, a good\nboost before you get in the gym. It gives you a good pump\nonce you get in the gym. It gives you a little\nbit of motivation also. It just got better and better\nas I've gone on year after year. My top three are basically\naminos, protein, creatine, basically are your main ones. Bodybuilding is all about\nbuilding muscle, who got the biggest muscle, who\ngot the best muscle and who got the most\nquality muscle. I don't think I could have\ndid bodybuilding without supplements, matter of fact\nI know I couldn't have done bodybuilding\nwithout supplements. Yup, you need to\nget the right one. That's the key right there. \u266a\u266a\u266a Whoo! For my full training,\nsupplementation, and nutrition program, check\nout the page below.

hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just sitting here no you're not going we get in one hundred and eighty dollars worth of Highness dog like who do you know is smokin a pumps let me know down in the comments if you guys have tried this grenade like cookies rolls in the lift tickets so now I know where the concentrate is the concentrates in the paper so the papers made will concentrate yeah I've heard about CBD infused papers and even - yeah smoke vibes everything so we're here cookies I bought hell of I papers and I like wrong something wrong though do you really do you think vibes are better than wrong honestly it's like keeping I do I do is the rice ones they taste hell it feel like I've been smoking all the flour rice ones it's like almost like there's no paper I don't know I don't know what the everyone making papers so I you're right there like it's not healthy yeah it's just kind of like a competition with one another now I don't know I'm not gonna get into politics let me know if you guys could still see cats crying in the back I'm gonna open the window you guys know I know I will say there's a good graph look at that they turn on tasting you never know you just said it's a pup go I'm not tapping out let's do it I think it's been this boxy before us we only did it one time can we smoke that guy's let me know if you guys would go to the club and cop this guys you get it at the local cookie store I think they're limited edition right there's a lot of them made a certain amount only like a certain amount of people got to try out I've been lucky to try it after coming through yeah if you're I could use them and I still come see me I'm Jason yeah go visit him out cookies Modesto he works there shout out cookies right shout out the way be fair I hope you guys like this video and if you guys did make sure you guys like it subscribe make sure you guys comment down below my eyes are burning oh and we love you guys stay lit keep rolling I will see you guys in our next video I usually don't like getting smoking like crutches this alright coming to and you guys I'm about to crack the hot box for you guys let me hit that one more time for the long time I believe you guys I'm crying look you guys you see how much has run like the other side open look at that but I'm still live let's crack this thing go you guys ready with this to most Greg big real smoky yeah we love ya stay alert stay positive keep rollin you see on the next one [Music]", "Gv5JFKMolpk": "hey guys welcome back today we're going to be doing another shotgun ballistics gel test in my last video I did a 12-gauge broad head shotgun slug and I wanted to go ahead and compare that to just your standard 1 ounce rifled hollow-point slug so what we're going to be shooting today is the Winchester 12-gauge 2 and 3/4 inch 1 ounce hollow-point slug the velocity on these is 1600 feet per second the shotgun I'll be using once again is my Benelli supernova 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and as always the gel block we'll be using is my clear ballistics 20% ballistics gel block so I'm gonna go ahead and go out and set everything up and we will run the test [Applause] [Music] all right so here's the entrance to our foster slug on the left that little red thing it's from the broad head slug I did before and you can see the just devastating wound Channel again the one on the right over here is from the broad head slug but the foster slug stopped much shorter and had a much bigger wound channel and broke apart there's one piece there in the middle and one piece stopped right there you can see over here it started to break through the side of the gel block [Music] so here's our one ounce foster slug it looks like the furthest piece stopped right at eight inches and the first piece that broke off stopped at about four inches again with it just a devastating temporary wound cavity from all that energy all right guys this is what I was able to recover from the 1 ounce hollow-point slug this looks like it's probably half of it the other half I'm not sure what happened to it I think I had it I lost it honestly but that is a pretty good chunk of it I mean that's a heavy piece of lead and then some of this paper from the wad is all I was able to recover of that one ounce hollow-point slug well that's it guys I hope you enjoyed the video quite a different result from the broadhead slug that we did in the last video that one passed all the way through the gel whereas the hollow-point slug in this video just kind of stopped probably less than halfway into the gel however the wound channel from the hollow-point slug was it's much bigger and it just looked like it you know had a lot more energy than the broadhead slug did so they're both devastating rounds both you know 12-gauge shotgun slugs pretty much anything out of the 12-gauge is going to be devastating except for birdshot and yeah they're just super impressive and you know super-powerful rounds so if you have any questions or anything else you'd like to see just go ahead and leave a comment for me thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "IlpALhO3BQw": "how many Ounces are in

look at or get you guys ready for section 1.8 and 1.9 okay so again um what we're doing here how we're working this now is one of one i'm going to introduce 1.81.9 in these videos okay then on your own right so on your own then you would go and try these sections the book work okay you're gonna go through the book try it on your own then you're gonna meet with your group okay and you can do this a little bit at a time or you do it all at once then meet you know just one time or a couple times whatever you guys want however you want to work it right but it's um you know watch this video right get get the idea down go try the book work on your own okay then you can ask me questions if you like or meet with and eventually you're gonna meet with your group and you're gonna solidify you know uh what you guys get what you get here when you get there and then talk about it and then we can meet again right if you have questions ask me i can meet with your group if you guys want or we can do it through email whatever okay but again it's the the the steps are watch this video get introduced to it try it on your own do it together as a group and then clear it all up right with me if needed okay all right so this video 1.8 1.9 so 1.8 again it's all about mean okay uh you've probably heard of mean before right but we're going to dive a little more into it and 1.9 is all about interpreting graphs right using graphic things again hope you'll see this this class is all over the place right topic wise okay but it's again nothing in this class is kind of new so hopefully it's kind of solidifying what you know and getting rid of some misconceptions okay so in the group work again make sure that you know when you go through it make sure i mean you're reading through the whole thing for sure but these are the main things i'm looking for in section 1.8 make sure you check out the explorer one which is problem one and two and then three four five and six in the book okay and when you get to 1.9 make sure you check out that explorer 1234 and then make sure you do problems five and six okay i'll show you what i mean by that when we get through uh get to it okay 1.8 it's all about mean what does the mean mean um again hopefully we've seen that before if not nobody do but what does the mean it's one type of average right it's really what it is or think of it as it's a way of describing on average where is the data set so we got a bunch of numbers right so we're trying to describe on average what's happening the middle of it the center of it okay we'll see later but there's other ways to describe the average well as well right there's things called median there's things called the mode we'll get there later okay and for most of you when you take 115 which is the next class you really get there but anyway so what is the mean the mean is a collection of numbers is one type of average or it's a way of defining the middle okay or what's happening in general okay so how do you find the mean so you add up all the data values and then you divide by the total number of points that you have okay and that kind of gives you where the middle or the center of your data values are okay so let's figure out an example so let's say you spend twenty two dollars forty five dollars sixteen dollars and thirty dollars on consecutive trips to the store right yes with me so you go to the store you spend 23 dollars later or some other time you spend 45 another time you spend 16. another time you spend 32. what is your mean spending on these trips okay so what that means is you would take the 23 the 45 the 16 and the 32 right now how you do this is entirely up to you as far as you want to add these all up right if you want to write it vertically like this you want to write it as one big row use the calculator whatever okay it's up to you um a couple quick things i mean just you know if you can do this by hand one thing you could do is you could say like five because three is eight but instead of adding the six how about add the two right because this is eight plus two that makes a nice ten plus the six would then be the 16. right um so you could also do things like this is six seven plus this three would be ten right six seven plus three would be ten plus this one is eleven so it's 116. okay again use a calculator whatever okay then you would take your 116 and since there are one two three four data values you would take the 116 and divide by four again you want to write it like this or using the division symbol right 116 divided by four whatever so that's a fraction or with the division what it's up to you right again you want to do that by hand that's up to you or use calculator whatever but either way you're going to get 29. okay so now make sure you understand what this is saying what this is saying is that 29 is your average spending okay so on average you're spending 29 per trip to the store now again makes you realize sometimes you were below that sometimes you're above it sometimes you were below right kind of i mean i think it's like it's a little bit below way above right way below it just barely above it okay but on average that that's what was happening right well roughly you know you're spending 29 per trip okay um another good point that i want to make to that is the average is kind of like the center right so sometimes you're above it sometimes you're below it okay so things like okay let's first example think of 23 you could think of 23 what is 23 23 is below 29 but by how much right it's six below the average right because 23 to 29 would be six 45 well that one's definitely above it okay but how far above it is okay so 45 down to 29 um again i personally what i would do is there's a five here and there's one here so that's six and then 30 to 40 is 10 so 16. use a calculator whatever but it's definitely 16 above okay then the other number happened to be 16 right 16 is definitely below but how far below right it's you know 1 3 right so 13 below and then the last one is 32 which is definitely above but again how much is it above it's only you know three above right 29 30 31 32 if you want to do that 39 above so again what you want there's a bigger point here than i want to make but hopefully you guys realize that if you're talking about an average if you're talking about a mean then that that's kind of what's what's happening in the middle of it right you can see how there's some things that are above it and there's some things that are below it okay um so you're the the mean is never going to be the highest it's never going to be the lowest it's in the middle right there's always going to be something above it something below it okay not only that not only is there some above and there's some below but ask yourself this um if you're six below it has like a negative feel to it right that whole net an integer thing we're talking about before so this kind of has a negative feel to it 16 above kind of has a positive feel to it 16 below definitely has a negative feel to it and the three above definitely has a positive feel to it okay now ask yourself this this is one of those times it's really good pause the video and see if you can figure this out what i'm doing and then come back right what i'm asking here is what do you think these would add up to right if you truly understand what a mean was this required no work whatsoever what do you think these should add up to well hopefully you if you think about it or you go through the process well you can do okay so negative 6 plus 16 there's 10 right then 10 minus 13 would be negative 3 right then negative 3 plus 3 oh that's 0 right but why why is that 0 think about that remember this is the middle this is the center right so if that's your center whatever is above it and whatever is below it have to be the same right because look the total amount that's above is really this one this by itself is 16 above this one by itself is three above so there's really 19 above the middle but look here the ones below negative 6 and negative 13 there's actually 19 below so it should make sense that the amount of stuff above it and the amount of stuff below it should have to be the same right if it wasn't then you didn't have the center right i mean think about that if there was more stuff here and there was only a little bit of stuff here right then that wouldn't be the center or same thing if you had more stuff below and only a little bit above that wouldn't be the center right the amount of stuff below and my stuff above would have to be the same okay so keep that in mind that might help to figure out what's going on with some of these other more tricky problems later is that you know the amount above them below have to be the same okay um so let's check out this one here oh and while i've got the book out let me show you what i'm talking about as far as so when you do the group work 1.8 what i'm looking for is make sure that you are focusing on the explorer right try these okay definition of what i mean is you can just read over that we're going to talk about this right here okay um definition of a mean what that is right so so far the only thing you have to turn into one and two right and then it talks about what's you know some other uh generalizations but you got to do then three four five and then six right so that's what i'm so one you see that sheet here on the beginning of each section it's going to tell you the numbers that i'm really looking for to make sure that you're completing on your own and uh talking about in your groups okay so let's check this one so basically i want to i want to dissect this problem but that's what i mean in this example okay i mean it works it all out here okay but i want to talk through this a little bit more diligently here um so in the graph shows enrollment in chicago uh community college in 2014 what is the average enrollment okay so this is also getting you used to graphs as well right that's what 1.9 is really about but you guys have probably seen bar graphs before right so each one of these bars is talking about a different college right so daily college right this high kennedy king malcolm x right so it the bar the height of the bar is expressing how many you know people actually attended that particular community college right so for example at daily it tells you those fifteen thousand seven hundred eight and that's why it's slightly above 15k right the k for abbreviation for a thousand right so kennedy king is ten thousand that's you know a little bit above ten thousand slightly above ten thousand uh malcolm x is eleven thousand right so forth and so on right so you can but having the bars it's more eye appealing right because you can just look at that and say oh look that's definitely the least enrolled right because it's way lower than the other ones without having to rely on the numbers you just look at the picture and say oh look that one's the highest one without relying on the numbers or you can see these two are pretty close to each other or these three are kind of close to each other right so bar graphs are kind of nice because you can see how things relate to each other but it also gives you the actual numbers okay so what they want to do is first off is what is the average moment okay so how would you find it um i will leave it up to you because it's already done here for you like if you really want to you could go through the whole process but how would you find the average enrollment using the mean you would take the amount here here here here here here here and add them all up so take this number plus this one plus this one because this one plus this one this one because this one you add them all up you're gonna get some huge number but there are one two three four five six seven right so you would add those all up and then divide by seven and you do that that would give you the average okay again test yourself if you want to you could pick up a calculator and do that but they already did the work here for two miles we'll uh do it from here right so if you add up these seven numbers it turns out to be that number hundred 100 thirteen okay now if i take that number and divide by seven because there's seven different institutions here right you're gonna get this number fourteen thousand three hundred and thirty okay all right so step one understand what the picture is all about step two answering the question of average enrollment okay so you add them all up divide by seven that's what you have in enrollment okay but a larger point that i really want to make with this is see this line that they put here right that was the average right because when you calculated it up with fourteen thousand but see this is fifteen thousand so slightly under that is the average okay so an even better idea hopefully you wanna see is each data value is either going to be above or below the average okay so for example this one here you can see it's slightly above this one here is well below a little below a little bit less below above very low but it's below but but not by the much this one's above okay so hopefully again this is what they're talking about is this is kind of like the middle of it or that's the center of it or hopefully you can realize that whatever this overage is here whatever this overage is here whatever this overage is here if these were all my positive you know those are all the ones that were above it right and then i were to calculate how far below how far below how far below how far below if you were to add up these four belows it should be the exact same amount or size as these that are above right these would all just be positive because they're above it and these would all be negative because they're below it right so what i'm saying here is if you were to take the actual here and subtract the um the average okay you're gonna get a positive number here you're gonna get a negative number negative number negative number when you subtract positive when you subtract negative when you subtract positive when you subtract right and if you were to take and add up all those pluses and minuses above and below it should still come out to be zero okay and that's the idea okay so finding a mean is relatively easy sure you just add them all up and divide by however there are but do realize that there is deeper meaning here that it is the center of it so some of the data values are above some is below right so all the overages and hundreds should always add up to zero right otherwise you wouldn't have the middle okay so do keep that in mind okay all right let's check this different problem over here so let's say joanna has a test coming up okay on her previous test she has earned scores of 73 91 86 and 65. so again when you do these types of problems don't just read the whole thing and try oh the answer's four no no make sure you understand what's going on she's got a test coming up oh so there's another test coming so on her previous test she has scores of 73 91 86 65 right so it's kind of like a c right it's got an a in that one right a high b that's good oh not so good on that one that's like a d right so she took one two three four tests already and she's got another one coming up okay now joanna is pretty confident that she can get a b in her overall test grade category okay what score should she need on the next test in order to have an overall average of 80. so in other words what this is saying is think of it as she had a 73 she had a 91 right she had an 86 she had a 65 and then her next one we don't know okay so what she wants to know is what would this need to be to get an average of 80 okay so this is slightly different in the aspects because the previous ones they gave you all the numbers and wanted to know the average okay this is different because you're giving part of the numbers but you're missing a number but you're given the end result right so think of it as you're given all the numbers and you want to compute something or just do some basic arithmetic add them all up divided by how many they are right you're given the inputs you want to know the output of mean basic arithmetic here you're missing part of the inputs but you know the end game the output the result it needs to be 80. okay so this has more of an algebraic feel to it if you want to go that route because you're missing an input anytime you're missing an input like this or that's what they want to know right you see what i mean by input output i see here is you're given all the ins they want to know the out arithmetic here you're missing it in but you know the end game you know the end result you know the output that's what's streaming algebra if you want to do it that way or you could just do it by you know just numbers right the numerical approach it's up to you but hopefully you can see the main difference is um we don't know what that uh data value is but we know the end game of average okay now let's for a minute pretend we knew what it was right how do we find an average you would take one two three four five you would take these five numbers and you would add them all up right so think of it as you would take all these numbers you would add them all up and then whatever that is right that's going to give you some number once you do that then you would divide by how many there are but there's one two three four five of them right so whatever that sum is when you add these all up when i divide by five i want my average to be 80. okay so basically what we're talking about here is i need to know what this number is so then when i add these all up this turns into some other number now when i take that out of the number and divide by 5 i need it to be 80. okay so again you could do this like an algebraic approach right or you just think about it but ultimately think of this i'm looking for a number when i divide by 5 gives me 80. okay so think of how what are we talking about here right this would have to be a relatively big number right because i'm talking about this would have to be a big number so when i take that number and divide by five it's 80 right or in other words think of it as what does division mean you're talking about repeated addition right so that means i want to repeatedly add 80 five times to get up to this one right or you could just get rid of this division by multiplying by five and you could check it out on the calculator but you could take 80 and just multiply by five right forty zero so forty and then zero so four hundred okay and so sure enough if if we knew the sum was 400 right 400 divided by 5 right 400 divided by 5 does in fact give me my 80. okay so now what does that mean that means when you add these all up it better add up to 400 okay now i don't know what this is but i do know that if i took 73 plus 91 plus 86 plus 65 right just adding up the ones i have so far is 315. so i had to have 315 plus the score on that last one there which you can call x if you like a variable deal right but that's got to add up to 400 right so this one plus this one plus this one plus this one plus this one right these add up to three fifteenths that means three fifteen plus something have to add up to four hundred okay so what number plus three fifteen would give you four hundred again you could do more algebraic approach and think hey i wanna get rid of this addition by subtracting it or just what number would you add is basically literally the same thing as saying subtract okay so that number would have to be 85. so what that's saying ultimately is if she got scores of 73 91 86 and 65 so far if when the next test comes if she gets an 85 on that one she's now gonna be an 80 overall average which again you can check right so you can take 73 on the first one 91 in the second 86 on the third 65 in the fourth and 85 on that next one that we just figured out oh sure enough it doesn't do that to 400 and if you were to find the mean of that by dividing by the fives you know because there's five scores sure enough she's at an eighty percent right okay different one now can she get an a in an overall test score so now what i'm saying is again we're not we're not going to a sixth one here so i'm saying you know this is the day before the test right so she's sitting there studying for the test and wants to know how hard should i study if i'm shooting for a b overall yeah you need an 85. so you might want to study pretty good okay but let's say you know what let me bust my butt maybe i can get an a right or this person joining right so she's got 73 91 86 65 right she wants to get an a right or in other words that addition when you add them all up right when you add up all these scores right when you divide by the 5 instead of an 80 we want that to be a 90. okay or in other words now we want my adding them all up to now be 90 times 5 or 450 right because if this number if all five of them add up to 450 when i divided by 5 that would give me 90 now okay but remember she's only got 315 so far right so that means 315 plus the score on our next test should add up to 450 right but what would that number be well you could subtract it off or think about it what would i need to add to 315 to get the 450 right i mean you could i don't know personally i do three to four is 100 15 to 20 right that's a nice roof of 10 15 to 20 is five but then 20 to 50 is 30. right so should we need 135 again you can use a calculator but she would need a 135 so what does that mean can she get an a nope because the best you could do is 100 right so no right as a matter of fact you can figure it out you could say okay if i took my 73 plus 91 plus 86 plus 65 plus the best you could hope for on the test is 100 there's an a right and if i divide that by five you're going to get an 83 right so basically what this is saying is if she gets an 85 she'll just barely get an average of 80 overall right and the best you could possibly do out of all this is an 83 average because that was assuming you got 100 right and again you could also check by just seeing link if you actually change that to a 135 right there's your 450 and divided by five sure enough she would get a 90 right so again if she could get some bonus or something like that if she could get 135 on the next test she could get an a but assuming no bonus or anything then okay so the main things are are seeing um how to find an average above and below right and then also this is another good type of problem we're trying to figure out what would one of the data values be to get a desired output of me okay one other thing with this we're gonna do is this idea of a midpoint right again i don't know how much algebra you guys have done so you may or may not have seen this for whatever right but just forget the algebra just pick a midpoint what is the sum going to oh that's the point in the middle right so if you have the midpoint of something it's the point that is halfway between the end points okay so for example in a one-dimensional system or like on a number line imagine here's four and here's ten right so if i look at 4 and i look at 10 what is the number that's smack dab in the middle so that the space here and the space here are exactly the same right so basically what are we talking about we're talking about the middle but it's the middle of two numbers so it's the mean of them right on average where's the center of those two so you can find it the same way except there's only two of them right so you would add them all up it's 14 and there's only two points so divide by two there's seven so the midpoint is literally the same as the mean right but also you can hopefully imagine something like here's seven and the reason why this works is because there's a space of three here and there's a space of three here right so that is truly the midpoint is because it splits it into two even spaces okay so in numbers like four and ten you could probably just play around with them to get the midpoint okay but that's not always going to work because sometimes the number might be a fraction or a decimal or whatever but this idea will always work what is the midpoint it's basically the mean of those two numbers add them and divide by two right so you could think of this as a formula but just use your brain right if you're trying to find the middle of two numbers it's just it's literally the same thing as we're just doing it's mean adam divide behind r there's only two of them so divide by two okay what about a two-dimensional system now okay so now remember this plotting of points instead of looking at just the number line what if i had a full-blown point here right so let's say we had the point two one right so here's two one and the point six five right so now i mean it's it's already done before you can kind of see it here but hopefully you imagine if this is the point here and this is the point here then it should stand the reason that the midpoint should be somewhere in this area right midpoint's not gonna be over here it's like over here right so if i look at the beginning and look at the end the midpoint should be smack dab in the middle so that it splits it into two equal groups okay but how do i do that basically just treat it as two separate problems basically do it as a number line going this way and then a number line going this way right so just basically go back to the one-dimensional and do it the same way so what i mean by that is like see the x-coordinate at this point is 2 and the x-coordinate of this is 6. so imagine here's two so here's here's two and here's six but looking at just the x coordinates so the x coordinate is two and the next one is six now you can do this idea you could i mean this one you could probably just play around that hey between two and six that's gotta be four because that would give me a space of two here and it'll give me a space of two here or you could find the average by adding and divide by two right so the number right in the middle there is four right and then you can do the same thing with the y coordinates right the y coordinate of the first one is one the y coordinate is five so looking here you could do the same thing you can add them one plus five is six six divided by two sure enough is three right so now if i put those two midpoints of the x coordinates and the midpoint of the y coordinate there together that gives me my actual midpoint of the whole thing right so basically when you're two-dimensional system you just do it twice so looking at the x coordinates find the mean add and divide by two look at the y coordinates add them divide by two put that together there's your midpoint right relatively simple hopefully so let's check this out okay so let's say i wanted to find the midpoint a line segment connecting the points 2 3 and 6 4. now you don't have to but man if you got a graph look at the graph right because i mean you could do this without a graph hopefully right but a graph might help what i mean by that is the we got the point two three right so if i go to two and then up three right and then i have the point six four right so six four okay so six four okay so what i'm saying is if you were to connect these with a line we're looking for the midpoint of that line so you would expect the midpoint to be somewhere in this general area right it's not up here right it's not over here over here right none of this around here should be the midpoint it's got to be somewhere in the middle of those okay so when you're done with this that midpoint should make sense okay so how do i actually do that so what you could do is looking at just the x coordinates here right the x coordinates here are 2 and 6. all right so come on to the 5 side take 2 and 6 right it's 8 and then take and then divide that by 2 right so 8 divided by 2 is 4. again if you look at your picture here here's 2 here's six so then the middle of just the x coordinates would be right there at four okay and then you could do the same thing with the y coordinates three and four so take the three and add the four which is going to give you 7 but then you would divide that by 2 right all right so add and divide by 2 but 7 divided by 2 it's a crazy decimal but it is what it is so that's 0.35 so again here's when uh 3 here and here's the four here so it stands the reason that's right in the middle right this one's a three this one's a four right in the middle three point five so if you take and put those together you should get that point right there which definitely looks like the middle of that line okay so keep in mind your actual answer here is the point four comma three point five right because it's a midpoint the x coordinate is four the y coordinate is three point five there you go okay okay oh one thing i do want to point out here it's not a huge deal but it's more of a using the terminology and the symbols correctly what i mean by that is if i write this symbol i mean i know you guys i know you guys know what this means but do you do you really because people abuse this four symbol all the time right this is an equal sign what does that mean that means if i write something here and you write something here whatever you write here and whatever you write here have to be exactly the same if what's sitting here and what's sitting here are not equal then you've abused that symbol it's not what that means right what i'm saying is this is an equal sign so what i wrote here and i wrote here are they the same yes here and here are they the same yes okay so what i mean by that is if you had done this problem and you said to yourself oh okay well no it was i'm sorry it was two plus six so you say okay my first thought is i want to take two plus six and then i'm going to take that and get eight okay now what i want to do now i want to take eight and divide by two is going to give me four right so i add you how do you find the mean you add them all up right that gives you that and then you divide by two because there's two of them so there's four yes you have the right answer but no you just abused that equal sign because is two plus six the same as eight divided by two no it is not okay so you need to either write it all or two plus six is eight now i have two plus six is eight i got an answer if i got an answer i'm gonna do something with that answer you gotta start over again right then eight divided by two is four see the difference there because this and this are they the same yes they are they are equal this and this are they the same yes they are equal okay so if you're gonna do something you know an action get an answer and then do something else with that answer you need to either write it over here as well or start over it otherwise you'd abuse that equals so watch out so same thing here now we got to worry about these negatives right so that whole plus or minus thing you got to worry about here but the idea is exactly the same so negative 3 negative 4 go left 3 and then you would go down 4. right so there's that point negative 3 negative 4 and the other point is five negative two so that's five negative two right so again when you plot those again you probably whoops i can count one two not that one one two not that okay uh but anyway so if you connect those again you would expect the midpoint to be somewhere in this general region right because if you connect those that's definitely where the mid of that line would be okay so now coming back the x coordinate here is the negative three and the x coordinate here is five so you take the negative three and you would add the other one which is five now again if you're gonna do this in stages what is negative three plus five right again this is a negative number right so when i add 5 that this size of this one is larger than the size of this one so adding a positive is going to bump me over the zero right so i think it was negative three to zero is only three spots but if i want five then i need two more spots right or you could do five minus three if you like or you could use a calculator whatever but now we wanna take that result and divide by two which is one okay and then do the same thing with the other the y coordinates here all right so the y coordinate is negative four the other y coordinate is negative two and remember we are adding those right so now if i'm starting with a negative number and i'm attack on another negative number it should be more negative right so that's really going to be the size and this one's four the size of this one's two so it's really six but since it's more negative would be negative six then you could take your negative six and divide by two which is negative three so then ultimately you have the point one negative three okay which if you go down here and you say okay here's one and then x would be or that x is one then the y of one two three would be right in there and if you were to connect those sure enough that point looks like it's the midpoint awesome right again you could kind of do the same thing like if you look at the negative three and five right what might help is picture the number line here i'm looking at just the x's here's negative three and here's five so again you can kind of visualize hey there's one two three four five six seven eight spots so there's eight spots it better be four in each way right one two three four one two three four oh sure enough i got the same one here okay you do the same thing with the other ones see like this one was at negative two and this one's at negative four so this is negative two negative four what's in the middle of negative two and negative four it pretty much have to be negative three so sure enough one negative three right so again you can do it from the picture from the wrist from the arithmetic numbers whatever honestly it should be able to both okay last one at least with this midpoint stuff same idea but yes it does have the crazy fractions okay but don't panic it's literally the same thing right so we're looking at these x coordinates negative seven fourths and one half so we're gonna do the negative seven fourths plus one half okay now again use a calculator whatever okay but if you do this by hand remember in order to add fractions you have to have a common denominator so they talk to each other right basically with this forget the signs but what's this thing is you took something and you broke it into four pieces i want to keep seven of them right this is saying in terms of something that broke it into two pieces and i want to keep one of them the size of the pieces are different sizes you can they can't talk to each other right i mean like i mean that would be like if i said you if i had five dollars and i had three cents and you added those together it gave me eight that doesn't make any sense right well but five dollars and three cents are in different units they can't talk to each other yet you'd have to convert it to all dollars they're all cents exact same idea here okay so common denominator here this is going to be a four right so negative seven fours you could leave alone but i could take and multiply top and bottom this one both by two because now that would give me a four on the bottom and then the top is two again saying you have half of something is the same as saying break it into four and keep two right it's still half it's just that now the size of these pieces are the same as the size of these pieces now you can add them together to get the negative five fourths right the negative seven plus two is negative five over that four right okay so again that we just added them up okay now we would take the negative 5 4 and i want to divide that by two right again it's crazy fractions i know but it's literally the same thing add them up divide by two okay but how do i divide by two that's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal one-half right or think of it as if if you're dividing something by two you're doubling the bottom right the bottom is now going to be twice as much because you're breaking up even more pieces now right because you're cutting in half okay so this would be negative five over eight make sense okay so there's your x coordinate then do the same thing with the y coordinate this one's a little bit easier maybe but here's the y coordinate negative five plus five so you would take the negative five and add the five sure enough that would be zero and then technically you still need to divide that by two right you add them and then divide by two but zero divided by two is still zero so we should have the point negative five 8 0 right that should be my midpoint okay how the heck do i graph that though right to help see if this really worked or not well okay this is where the calculator might be handy right that first point is negative seven fourths negative five so you could take negative seven and divide by four if this is helpful to get the decimal right negative one point seven five right so negative one point seven five that means it's more than negative one but not quite negative two right so you would go down the negative one but not to negative two and then technically would be a little bit closer to negative two right so there's negative one point seven five and then down five so from there you move on one two three four five right and the other one is a half five so here's zero a half would be in here right halfway it's like point five if you like and then up to five so it's right there okay so my first point is right in there the second one is right in there so if you were to connect these with a line we're looking for the line the middle of that line which hopefully you would again expect it to be somewhere around here in this general area okay well the the negative 5 8 come to zero again you could do the same thing you say negative five divided by eight right is like negative point six two five which means it's it's lower than zero right because it's a negative number but it's not quite negative one so that means you didn't go all the way to negative one so it's still somewhere in here but the y coordinate is zero which means you don't go up or down so it's right there right negative five eighths this way and then don't go up or down y zero and sure enough look at that you're right on the line and it even looks like it splits it in half right so i mean if you graph these things and you can do it with you know using the arithmetic it should stand the reason you know every i mean you know like especially what i'm saying is especially when the test comes you look at the picture you know where you're writing it like like if you found the middle and you got a point over here problem right that's not good you know you're wrong okay a good good test taking skill i know everybody painted me the test but let's say you were to plot this point here and plot this point and let's say you did all these calculations and you found the midpoint to be over here and you went crap i know that's not the right answer but i don't know what i did wrong what you should do is put a line here and say and write in words i know i did something wrong i know this isn't the midpoint but i don't know what i did wrong okay if you write that then i know that hey at least they have the the common sense to say hey this is not the right answer right and at least they have an idea of what it means to be a midpoint right and i would be more willing to give you partial credit and if you just left that point there and then moved on now i think you think that that's the right answer you see i'm saying so if you something like that when you get to the test right and something that's timed like that you know use that to your event okay so that's what 1.8 is all about is that uh mean stuff okay so 1.8 is all about the mean or the average right so you can check all that good stuff out as far as 1.9 is concerned honestly that you just most of it you just gotta do straight from the book and we can uh talk more about that as we uh after you guys check it out you know on your own and then groups okay but let me just roughly talk about what's going on here just kind of get the blood flowing so 1.9 is all about pictures graphs different types of graphs again i would imagine you've seen these different types of graphs right so these are like bar graphs for example this one's talking about you know the hour in the day and how many calories right so the height of the bar tells you how many calories but the location this way tells you how many calories you were burning at that time right um pie charts pie charts are really good at comparing things right let me just look at it the thing that pops out is most here is blue so what is this person talking about well sometimes they're sedentary meaning they're not moving much sometimes they're kind of active sometimes they're fairly active right they're really moving around and sometimes they're really like working out so you can just the point of pie charts is percentage-wise you just look at and say what was this person doing most of the day nothing what were they doing for a little part of the day really active you know what i'm saying so pie charts are really good at percentages read through this it'll make more sense but bar graphs are showing quantities compared to time in this case and pie charts are really going to show in percentages right how the how much things are in relation to other things right again you can work through this example if you want right but i think um oh like so when you get to 1.9 the one two three and four that's the explorer here that's this stuff here and i know we're gonna talk about this one because i know there's some tricky stuff here you gotta try it first right so try these okay then five they want you to actually create a pie chart right um so you might it might help to read through that example to figure that out again we could talk about this if you want um another type of graph is like i said a bar graph okay but a bar graph basically just shows you the height of something in comparison so like in this example here they're talking about it's called the pareto chart not a big deal but pareto chart is it's a fancy name for a bar graph when the order doesn't matter right the way you put it like here this is a true bar graph right because if i took this bar and this bar and flipped them would that make sense no way right i mean 8pm is not going to come before 10am right there's an order to this right so the bars have to be in this order okay uh for example this one here california alaska nevada if you were to switch them would that change anything no i mean it would look different right but there's nothing inherited to the name of these things that says california has to come first i mean they put it in this order just so that you could see the trending of things but there's nothing inherited in the names that said they have to go in this work okay so not a big deal but that's what a pareto chart is when the data itself doesn't imply a order whatever but the main point is the bar graph right so they're talking about average gas prices right so the height of the bar would be how much gas it is in that state and the reason they did that is because california has the most expensive gas working its way down to wisconsin which would have the least amount at least in this one okay um some bar graphs right and another one in this i air we'll talk about this one i know i guarantee we're gonna have to talk about this one for sure but another one is like a line chart right but again you gotta you gotta try this stuff first here but a line graph again this one is talking about the dots time versus the amount of in this case the drug acetaminophen okay but read over that and then you can understand it okay so what am i looking for and then when you guys do the group works 1.8 you can do all of that mean stuff and then 1.9 check out the explorer and then check out basically five and six okay uh there's one more here it's kind of silly number seven you don't have to do that i don't care right but five and six those are the key ones right but the main point of all this uh graph stuff is the different types right bar graph what is it good at doing right uh pie chart what is it good at doing okay gradle chart or bar graph right what is it gonna do line graph what is it doing right so as you're going to see those problems on your own and then groups ask yourself those questions as well what type of data is good at this type of uh chart what type of data would be better suited at this type of chart okay so check all that good stuff out on your own right then you can start working in groups compare notes what you guys got and then we can uh come back to me and i can fill in any blanks that you guys got okay all right", "dlcaKsEe17M": "hey there i've got 45 minutes until the uh to the sun sets down and i gotta mow the lawn fertilize the lawn and seed it let's do it well guys welcome back to my yard it's been quite a while since you guys have seen it and uh let's just say we've had a good season i just haven't showed you guys much of the lawn um today we're gonna fertilize it get some some grass seed down talk about a couple things and uh we have no time to waste because as i said there's not much daylight left so today here's what the lawn's looking like and uh what we're gonna go ahead and do is overseed with the gci turf cool blue grass seed it's this new blend of turf type tall fescue and uh kentucky bluegrass and we're gonna go ahead and oversee that as well as apply some of the next green pop 1621.2 that's going to be our starter fertilizer as well as probably some rgs humic 12 and airaid we're going to go ahead and do that today get this lawn back into shape well it does look good there's just some areas that have struggled over winter i.e right here as you can see it's just i don't know what happened just then so we're gonna get it back into shape i'm gonna actually go show you guys the seed talk about that for a quick minute i'm not gonna bore you with every other mother and their brother showing you content on how to overseed your lawn so i'm just kind of gonna quickly do this and not bore you with content so let's check out that seed real quick [Music] here's what we're dealing with guys we got some thor tall fescue blacktail tall fescue falcon ib tall fescue blue coat bluegrass and uh zero point zero percent other crop seeds one point six percent inner matter and zero point zero percent weed seed that means it's a good seed no weed seed that means that everything that's going to germinate in here is either grass or grass so we're going to go ahead and throw some of this stuff down uh big thanks to mr pete dunny with gci turf for sending over a 25 pound bag of his wonderful seed and uh we're going to oversee this long here um actually i need to actually mow it first so instead of boring you with mowing footage ready one two three nice and mode [Music] so the first thing you want to do is you want to cut your lawn lower then you want to aerate or liquid aerate i'm not going to share my opinion on it because i don't want the hate in the comments do what pleases you aerate it or liquid aerate it it doesn't matter do it your way i'm not sharing my way i'm sure you already know my way i'm not sharing because i don't want the hate in the comments aerated or liquid aerated it's up to you honestly then mow it down short the next step is going to be seed right now we're going to apply the seed we're going to do 5 pounds per thousand on my yard my yard's pretty thick we're just filling in some bare spots so five pounds per thousand times three thousand square feet we need 15 pounds of grass seed do you really think i'm going to get a scale out and measure 15 pounds no i'm going to pour about half this bag of grass seed into the spreader and spread it down right on the yard we're supposed to have fun here not be so particular so let's go have some fun look at that sunset though all right guys so it has gotten dark out but i'm going to go ahead and apply this with a little head lamp on just because i need to get this down as you can see 16 nitrogen 21 phosphorous 2 potassium applied a rate of 15 ounces per thousand for warm season and 15 ounces for cool season i'm actually deficient in nitrogen so i'm going to do this rate 15 ounces per thousand every one to two weeks with this product and uh get her down just to kind of get this seed going so great product here from my friends over at green county fertilizer we're gonna get this down right now with my head lamp on and uh there's gonna be no looking back on this product as well as some rgs airy and i think some humic 12. go ahead and mix it up in backpack sprayer as well as right here i have some propaconazole so i'm going to throw that down for fungus since we're going to be watering quite a bit so we'll go ahead and since it's dark i won't show you guys any of the process you know what it looks like but i got a backpack sprayer right back here fill it up three gallons of water get the one that's right there spray it actually i don't know if you can see it but the sky yeah you can't but because the clouds are right there but the sky looks super super cool but uh we're gonna go ahead and get that down and uh then uh i don't know because i'm thinking here this is completely raw um i'm thinking that depending on how much content i get out i may be able to show you guys results of the yard um as we finish up because i may not even have the video out yet so we'll see how this video turns out right now the date is september 5th i'm actually getting to the aeration seating's a little bit late um actually mine i did all mine last week in september but uh my personal one i'm getting to a little bit late so i guess we'll go ahead and get this mixed up and without further ado we'll get spraying what's going on guys so i just want to go ahead and walk you through a few last things you want to consider when seating so first you want to go to greencastsoiltemperatures.com that's going to be a website that you can plug in your zip code or your town and find out what exactly your exact soil temperature is you want to seed when the temperature is just below 70 degrees but no less than 60 degrees so between 60 and 70 and you're golden to seed you also want to check your 14 day forecast make sure you're not seeing any night temperatures in freezing obviously make sure all that looks good so that way you're not going to see the seed freeze or anything crazy like that also on top of that you want to make sure you're watering consistently without consistent water that seed is not going to germinate you want to make sure the soil that you're seeding in stays moist so for some people that might be watering two times a day for others that might be watering three times a day for me i recommend going ahead and watering early in the morning around six or seven o'clock in the morning and once again around three or four o'clock in the afternoon if you need to add in an additional one if you decide to seed early because you're trying to do a full renovation or something like that then you might want to water three or four times a day and maybe even substitute in some manual watering those are all things you may want to consider when seeding but other than that a typical over seeding probably only needs water for about two weeks every single day twice a day then you can back off to once a day and then back off to your normal watering before you go into your freezing temps to slow down that's really as simple as it is don't over complicate it just follow these simple steps and you will be gold into overseeding my lawn looks absolutely great now i actually have some pictures because it got dark and i need to get this video done so i will roll those pictures at the end but if you have any other questions about this process please leave them in the box down below but with that i'm aiming for maison landscaping thank you for watching hope you guys enjoyed and i'll see you on the next one peace you", "tpVjuPNUzFE": "the top 10 saltwater trolling lures for the money hey everyone welcome back to the channel i'm captain peterson this is your first time here and you like big fish boats and cool gear don't forget to hit the subscribe button below we got many more videos to come thanks the guys from brownells for sending us these gloves the hats what do you got buddy most of these lures you can buy in amazon or at your local store and i wanted to make this video just to kind of show everybody that you don't need to break the bank to catch cool fish you don't need to have six eight rods and reels and you know spreaders and downriggers and all this stuff you know you can catch plenty of fish with just two or three or sometimes even four rods off your rod holders off the back your boat with some not necessarily so expensive lures and just some 80 pound mono or some 80 pound fluorocarbon leaders in this case some of these lures come pre-rigged some of them don't all right let's get into it number 10 fish wow four piece three ounce lures you can cast them you control them 25 26 bucks i mean the hooks are kind of crap on these things i got them and tried them out a few times been a couple hooks you can even drop these things down bottom fishing and hook a fish every now and then because they got enough weight on them if the current is not real bad number nine the nomad design dtx minnow goes down to 50 feet it's 55 bucks if it was cheaper it'd be way higher on this list because this thing is a wahoo slayer the wild card we got the yozuri crystal minnow the hooks on these could be a little bit more beefed up if you ask me they work really good they're you know a little bit more expensive you know think kings maybe a wahoo if you get lucky but they're probably gonna break them hooks off number eight the man's magnum stretch 40. for 47 this is a good value but still a little pricey they're pretty durable if you're you can you can use these things to troll for grouper you can catch king mackerel you can catch anything you can catch trolling you can catch on these things but some reason you know the crystal river you know carabelle uh steenhatch area they troll these things in 30 to 40 feet of water for grouper all the time you can catch big fish hey dive down really deep which is cool uh just use some you know lighter braid and get down to super deep with these guys number seven the yosuri bonita all over the world it's no secret that the yozuri bonita is a wahoo slayer they're very durable they rattle like crazy you control them pretty fast you control them kind of a little bit deeper if you don't go super fast they got a good wobble to them and they're very durable the yozuri bonita for 25 to 30 dollars it's also used for a lot of commercial fishermen when they're trying to catch king mackerel number six eat my tackle 10 inch slant head saltwater trolling lure these things work really good i've got the purple ones and the green ones i like the purple ones they seemed a little bit better in fact the first time i threw out the purple one over rack it got smashed and we lost it on something big and silver i believe it was a wahoo they got big strong hooks the leader's good on them you know it's a good high quality thing for 30 bucks you can't go wrong number five forgive me if i pronounce this incorrectly the kim you cutie six and a half inch six piece lure set for 38 bucks for six lures that's a pretty good deal yeah good quality mono these uh have stood up to test the time i've had these things just sitting in a rod holder when a client like left them there and i've had cobia come up and whack them by themselves so not only can you troll with them but uh you can catch kobe on them apparently we've also had king macros come up when somebody just left them in the rod holder and smack them too so they work when they're moving and when they're when they don't number four the captain j 12 inch for 19 this is a high quality lure we use these uh on the charter boat just because it's got a single hook it's a little safer than having big trouble hooks flying all over the place we usually rig two rods up with single hooks so we can throw them out real quick if we run across a school of bait fish or birds diving and not have to worry about clients uh flipping them in the boat and getting uh all hooked up number three the captain jay fishing uh with the wire and for some reason this little bit cheaper the 14 one we use the bonita color one and we catch a good amount of kings on it we've gotten some mahi on it it's super durable you got to watch that that wire it'll start burn up on you after catch a couple fish and it'll poke the crap out of your hands but it's a good solid lure for 14 that's why it's made a little bit higher on this list the number two overall lure the williamson speed pro for 15 to 27 depending on the color you choose this is probably my first favorite lure because you can go really fast with it it dives down reasonably deep um but they they seem to just catch a lot of fish it's one of my favorites they don't seem to hold up quite as well and that's why they're not number one on this list i'm partial to the sardine and the black and purple ones but they're really good number one on the list the rapla xrap magnum 30 for 20 to 38 i've had a half a dozen of these on the boat i've lost a couple of big fish i've had one get kind of weirdly tuned and that's another thing you'll have with that williamson speed pro once you get one or two big fish on sometimes they kind of get out of whack and won't run right and i'm not smart enough or something to kind of fix them but i've had better luck with the rapla xrap magnum 30s they're more durable a little bit more expensive and they know it and they're proud of them but that's my number one top 10 saltwater trolling lure for the money keep that in mind um if you're a guy that doesn't print money at your job and you just want to buy a couple lures or you just want to try trolling you know i'd recommend just getting that max the rappler x wraps and then getting some of them speed pros and kind of going on down the list from there try it a little bit and see what you like you know some of the lures that put off the smoke and with the jets and all that are fun and they work good i like to have a spread i'll usually run one deep one kind of mid-range and one up top just to kind of see what's out there you never know what water column the fish are going to be hitting at and again if it's just quick it don't you don't need to be down deep i'll just throw out those two little single hook deals and uh you know you'd be surprised at how big a fish you can you can catch on a trolling lure you catch a 16 inch fish on a 10 inch trolling lure sometimes it's kind of crazy i believe in continuous improvement and getting a little bit better every day so if i forgot anything on my list or you have any other options or stuff that you've tried that you really like please share it with me in the comments below maybe i'll give you a shout out and if i use one of these things i'll put it in a video for you and thank you that way too good work guys that is a monster king oh man i can't even lift this thing he don't fit in the cooler this little hook where's my little hookers at that is a monster king all right you ever caught a fish that big on that little rod probably not on that that little one i'd like to thank the guys from brownells for sending me this awesome hat and the guys from biscayne rod for sending us the awesome gap hey [Music] if you believe what we believe that living a

you all pull up my chair and I make some no fuss chicken enchiladas I'm first going to make the uncial odda sauce probably have to yell at you all as usual because this noisy little burner let's put in about two tablespoons of vegetable oil to that I'm going to add about two tablespoons of white flour that's what the texture I want right now it's not too pasty white light - then I'm going to add as I call my usual culprits and to us sauce is spicy so start with a little curry powder you know wrong video let's add to that some chili powder 2 tbsp let's stir that around a little bit just to get that incorporated with that flour and vegetable oil that's good enough I'm gonna add about 10 ounces of tomato sauce nicely mixed together I'm going to add 2 cups of water Buster as I go don't want any lumps garlic as you know kicked it enough of it TSP let's bring that to a boil I'm gonna reduce it then simmer it for about 10 minutes and then we're done I've got 8 ounces of cream cheese here just a package normally I would blend it up I just put a microwave at this time about 2 minutes on high just till it's soft I love to use the frozen spinach because it's inexpensive and it just yields so much I've put this in a towel actually paper towels and I don't get along and I dried the hell out of it look at that right okay that's it just in there I'm gonna stir that up break it up as we go that's right that's all that I'm doing so far just like that let's try 2 cups we'll go from there that's just straight I didn't do anything fancy with it let's mix that together it's looking like I have more spinach than I do chicken so a little more chicken I don't what the let's dump rollin let's add some salsa what kind any kind you like doesn't matter in this one at all some people may want chunky I just have just a mild little sauce I had so that's why I'm using how much am I gonna add let's say you add about 14 ounces the homemade enchilada sauce has been simmering now for about 10 minutes and it's thickened nicely let's start by you I'm not gonna spray anything on it I'm just going to put a little bit of the enchilada sauce in the bottom of my pan just you know can you see that I'm just coating just rocking and rolling in the pan perfect now to the rest of it I'm gonna get a little crunch I'm going to add that sell sound I'm going to put about a third a cup of each one of these little wrap guys I've just poured most of that enchilada sauce a little bit left over I probably warmed up and serve it with a meal but kind of what I like to do just spread in between each one of them because I put that delicious sauce to get in there and just every time we cut out a piece that sauce is there I've got a blend here I think some mozzarella I've got some cheddar some that Jack died Montezuma's Jack I think he's called okay I like it I'm gonna cook it in an oven let's say 350 for about 30 minutes that I'm gonna look at it the meat is already cooked everything's already cooked we're just gonna melt the cheese and get it warm so let's check it out 30 minutes and see how we do so what do you think I think you and I did a good job they look fabulous let's cut them open actually why don't we try one we're gonna need two appliances to pick this baby up that is some easy nice-looking chicken enchilada let's dress it up a little bit little lettuce hands are clean some

they're easy ciao for now", "zaR1EVybUgc": "I were out on the ranch today so bear with gunfire you hear in the background bird shot in your home defense shotgun well before I even go there let me say two things first a while ago I did a couple of video presentations entitled introduction to shotguns and shotguns don't suck for home defense so today in the interest of brevity and to avoid redundancy I'm going to give some really brief explanations of a couple of things and if you'd like a more in-depth explanation you can watch either of those videos secondly the idea of choosing a shotgun as your home defense gun is in itself debatable that's why you see things like videos called shotgun suck and why I made a video entitled shotguns don't suck for home defense so for today we're going to approach this from the standpoint that a shotgun is what you're going with so that having been said let's get to it the question is birdshot a viable option with which to load your home defense shotgun well to answer that question requires that we ask a few other questions the first one being what is birdshot well let me show you now this is buckshot and that's just a few big pellets as opposed to birdshot which is lots of little pellets this is number four birdshot and this is number eight which you can see is a lot smaller the bigger the number the smaller the projectile so now that we know what birdshot is the next question is why why would you select birdshot in your home defense shotgun buckshot is made to shoot large game like deer that's why it's called buckshot birdshot is made to shoot small game squirrels rabbits and birds so why would you put birdshot in your home defense shotgun there's actually quite a few reasons but the primary reason is because you believe that it will penetrate less through common building materials like sheetrock plywood household appliances whatever and therefore with less tendency for over penetration it has less potential danger to innocent bystanders well that brings us to our two big questions that we really have to answer one is that true does birdshot penetrate less than buckshot through common building materials and two will birdshot give you the desired effect on the intended target well I've got some birdshot let's shoot it and see if we can shed any light on that if you've seen our shotguns don't suck for home defense video you've seen this setup before we have three walls set up six feet apart we have to condense the distances a little bit to fit it all on the range you've got a two by four frame half-inch sheetrock on each side another two by four frame would happen sheetrock on each side there are no studs in here most houses have studs set up on 16-inch Center and if you shoot through that wall you got about a 1 in 10 chance of hitting a 2x4 stud so we've just removed that extraneous variable oh and these are just get the whole thing to fall over our exterior wall is sheetrock on the inside half inch and then on the outside half inch plywood and then some cheap particle board siding and then down here we've got our innocent bystanders now again if you've seen our shotguns don't suck for home defense video you know that big buckshot like double lot will go through this smaller buckshot like number three or number four won't but it's only stopped by the exterior wall it'll go through the sheetrock side of the exterior wall so let's go back to shoot this with some birdshot and see how that compares so we're loaded with 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch one and one eighth ounce of number eight birdshot and I'm going to shoot from the prone so later I can shoot from the kneeling and not shoot through the same holes so you see that that birdshot goes through our first interior wall but not through our second interior wall so it penetrates a lot less than buckshot does however one in 1/8 ounce of number 8 birdshot is a fairly light 12-gauge load let's try a heavier 12-gauge load and see if we get any different results well you can see when we go to the bigger birdshot it easily went through both interior walls but this sheetrock the interior of our exterior wall it had just about no energy left when it got here you can see a lot of holes here but none of these actually go through the sheetrock some of them are stuck kind of halfway in you can feel the lump of the pellet and a lot of them just hit and bounced out there's quite a few pellets laying right here so although this did a lot more than the number 8 birdshot it still pales in comparison to the penetration of buckshot and just to illustrate that I'll reload with double-aught buck and shoot through this wall and see what happens and there you have it the big buckshot like double lot goes through as you saw in the other video the smaller buck shots like number 3 and number 4 don't and as you make the transition to birdshot it goes through even less and when you get to the really small birdshot like number 8 it goes through even less so our first question does birdshot reduced potential for over penetration and therefore reduce the danger Dinis applies damage and the answer is absolutely yes it does but our second question will birdshot especially that smaller birdshot deliver the desired effect on the intended target that's a little harder to illustrate but we'll give it a try so at typical home defense distances and bird shot get the desired effect against the intended target well we've got our favorite target soda jugs and I'm back to the one and 1/8000 number eight shot let's shoot these and see what happened well we proved that was fun but let's try something else that might be a little more definitive so what is a good way to test whether or not at close range birdshot can give you the desired effect on the intended target well we can shoot soda bottles water jugs in ballistic gel and they tell us what they tell us but probably the only real definitive test would be if you got a large animal like a deer and then somehow got it smoked meth and then took it out and shot it with a shotgun well I'm not going to do that but let's see what I can do I've got a ratty old hoodie sweatshirt some duct tape a couple of hearts I got them from the butcher shop not the coroner some pork steaks it's important ribs some frankfurters now in case you didn't know this the skin of most hotdogs is made of an intestine and the contents of most hotdogs probably does pretty well simulate the contents of your intestines yeah and some margarine this will simulate that fat layer we all claim we don't have so let me see if I can put all this stuff together into a target that will tell us something so to start with what I've built here is I've got a pork steak which will simulate a pepper also behind that pork ribs and behind that heart now it's a beef heart but I think we'll be okay and then we'll cover that with our foot and I know that's not four layers of denim but it is there's plenty and of course we all know that hoodlums wear hoodies no that's not where the term put them or hoodie came from anyway we'll also take on these repair centers find the center of our target put that there in about the center so I know the right spot to shoot and we'll go back five yards and shoot it with shotgun now we shot those soda jugs with 12 gauge 1 and 1/8 ounce of the number 8 shot to shoot this meat target I'm going to use the stand gun it's a single shot Iver Johnson 28 gauge this particular load has 3/4 ounce of number 9 shot you can get more powerful ammunition than this but the reason I'm going to use this for this particular target is because this combination of gun and ammunition happens to be the least powerful shotgun I own how'd we do well peeled off all our duct tape unwrapped our heart and our first layer our steak is just pulverized the ribs they stopped most of the pellet some got through and our heart has about eight or ten pellets in it so is that an effective hit you be the judge but remember that's about the lowest powered shotgun I can get so let me make up another one of these and we'll go back and shoot that again with a more powerful shotgun so with the 28 gauge that was marginal now let's go back to the 12-gauge we've got the exact same steak ribs heart targets set up under here and where the 12-gauge we're going back to the 1 and 1 8 ounce of number 8 shot which although more powerful than the 28 is still as 12-gauge ammo goes a pretty light load well before we go dissect our heart I wanted to show you this a lot of the pellets went clear through the heart and into the sheetrock wall now none of them came out the other side so still your wall stopped it but quite a few of the pellets achieved full penetration now let's go dissect our heart and see how that looks well we've got this all torn apart and of course our steak is polarized the ribs didn't stop very many pellets at all and our heart is riddled with shock pellets and pellet holes again that 12-gauge round although more powerful than the 28 is really not all that powerful as 12-gauge rounds go but even with a mediocre round you can see pretty good effect with the birdshot so let me generate one more of these targets and we'll shoot a really powerful 12-gauge birdshot round well I'm out of ribs so we're going to have to make our next shot at gunshot so I got our boxes of margarine actually two thicknesses of them and then some pork steaks to simulate an abdominal muscle wall and then our intestines so let's hang this up and we'll shoot it with a more powerful 12-gauge level so we got our gut shot target set up and I had to fold the sleeve of the hoodie across here to get our layers back and what I'm going to shoot it with is federal 12-gauge three inch Magnum two ounces of number six led birdshot that is not the most powerful 12-gauge birdshot load you can get but it's getting pretty close and we'll shoot from five yards and there's the result pulverized our target blew a big hole in our wall now some of the pellets did go to the next wall but all they did was hit and bounced off after going through our target in this wall they had virtually no power level so what does all this tell us well does birdshot as opposed to buckshot reduce the potential for over penetration therefore reduce the potential for danger innocent bystanders yes but is birdshot going to give you the desired effect on the intended target if you use a fairly powerful birdshot load yes so the bottom-line question is birdshot a viable option in your home defense shotgun and I would say again if you use a fairly powerful birdshot load absolutely yes it is so as always don't try this at home I'm what you call a professional and thanks for watching the birdshot vs. buckshot video", "0v-ulU_mi7o": "when it comes to baking cooking is a science and in science accuracy counts precisely measuring ingredients makes a difference in how your recipes turn out so measure up with good quality measuring spoons and cups you don't need too fancy or expensive ones just simple basic and easy to use here's what every home cook should have measuring spoons liquid measuring cups and dry measuring cups let's talk spoons first they come in graduated sizes that include 1/8 teaspoon 1/4 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon 1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon measuring spoons work for wet or dry ingredients to measure a dry ingredient dip in the spoon and level it off with the back of a knife to measure a wet ingredient hold the spoon level and pour in the liquid until the spoon is completely full next our measuring cups it's a good idea to have 2 different types of measuring cups one for liquids like milk water or oils and another set for dry ingredients like flour or sugar the basic measuring cup for liquid is usually clear and has measurement printed on the side this type of measuring cup also has a handle a pouring spout and plenty of headroom in case ingredients expand the most useful measuring cups are heat proof microwave safe glass or hot ingredients as well as cool to read a liquid measure accurately put the cup on a flat surface and bend down so you can see the measurement at eye level sticky thick liquids like molasses honey or corn syrup are measured best by wiping down the inside of the cup or measuring spoon with a little oil or butter before you pour the thin coat of grease helps it pour out again easily and completely for shortening scoop it out of the container and press it into the cup or spoon to force out any air bubbles or pockets then level it off and four stick butter just measure using the increments marked right on the paper wrapper slice off what you need don't be tempted to pour ingredients into your measuring cup or spoon while holding it over the top of your mixing bowl it's too easy to accidentally spill in more than you need now let's measure dry ingredients dry measuring cups are different from liquid cups and common sizes for 1/4 cup third cup 1/2 cup and one cup to fill the cup use the dip and sweep method for dry ingredients such as rice or granulated sugar just dip and fill the cup then sweep level with a knife flour and powdered sugar take a little extra finesse white and whole wheat flour is easily compacted so it should be stirred first then spooned into the measuring cup and leveled off powdered sugar needs to be sifted in order to remove lumps before measuring brown sugar has more moisture so pack it firmly into the measuring cup or spoon before leveling with the knife also pay close attention to how our recipe is worded if it says one cup sifted flour make sure to sift the flour first and then measure one cup 1 cup flour , sifted measure it first and then sift it it's always a good idea to follow the recipe the way it is written the first time you try it then improvise later when you're familiar with how the ingredients all come together with inexpensive and basic measuring spoons and cups you can measure ingredients with accuracy and cook with confidence you", "281GDzKgNIw": "Welcome back. Almost done. We're on problem number 19. Let me read it out loud. At a bottling company, machine\nA fills a bottle with spring water, and machine B accepts the\nbottle only if the fluid ounces is between 11\n7/8 and 12 and 1/8. So let me say O for ounces. So the ounces have to be\nbetween 11 and 7/8. That's O, not 0. Maybe I'll use x.\nx for ounces. That's an x, that weird\nlooking symbol. And 12 and 1/8. That's what B accepts if the\nounces are between that. If B accepts a bottle containing\nn fluid ounces, which of the following\ndescribes all possible values of n? So they're actually saying\nn for ounces. We could just say this. So n is between these two terms.\nAnd they give a bunch of choices that involve\nabsolute values. And what I'm going to do is\nactually-- I'm going to draw this on a number line, and\nthen I think the absolute values are going\nto make sense. Let me do another color just to\nchange things a little bit. So if this is the number line\nand this is 11 and 7/8. And this is 12 and 1/8. And n has to be between\nthese two numbers. n can be anything between\nthese two numbers. So when they're doing absolute\nvalue, I guess you can see that they're saying that-- they\nhave all these 12's and all that-- and I think you could\nimmediately see that 12 is right in the middle\nof these two numbers. 12 is right there\nin the middle. Let me do a different color. This is 12. It's right smack dab\nin the middle. And as long as n is a little bit\nless than 12 or a little bit more than 12, we're OK. The machine B is going\nto accept it, right? So how much more than\n12 can n be? This is n. n can be anywhere\nin this range. Obviously if n is 12,\nit's like perfect. It's just like right\nin the middle. It's definitely nowhere close\nto one of the bad ounces. It's kind of the\nperfect ounces. The perfect number of\nounces in the bottle of the spring water. Let's see. So how much more can--\nit can be 1/8 more. This distance is 1/8. How much more can\nn be than 12? It can be 1/8 more. And how much less? Well this distance\nis also 1/8. So we know that n minus 12-- the\ndifference between n and 12-- and we don't know if n\nis greater than 12, or n is less than 12. So we'll say just\nthe difference. And we're going to take\nthe absolute value. Because if n is greater, the\nabsolute value doesn't matter. And if n is less, then n minus\n12 will be a negative number. But we just care about the\nabsolute difference. We don't care whether one is\nnegative or one is positive. So we say that n minus 12 has\nto be less-- the difference between n and 12-- and that's\njust the absolute value of n minus 12-- has to be less\nthan or equal to this kind of tolerance. You probably haven't done much\nmanufacturing yet, but if you do this is the kind of thing\nyou'll deal with. So it has to be less than\nor equal to 1/8. And I want you to play\naround with this. I mean you could say, well\nn can't be more than 1/8 more than 12. So you could say that n minus\n12 has to be less than or equal to 1/8. And then you could also say\nthat on this side, n minus 12-- right, if n is around\nhere-- n minus 12. So this if n is greater\nthan 12. And then if n is less than 12,\nthen n minus 12 has to be greater than or equal\nto minus 1/8. This might be more confusing\nto you, and I'm debating whether I should\neven write it. But these two things would\nalso translate into this. But the big picture, absolute\nvalue just means the difference between\ntwo numbers. I don't care if one is bigger\nthan the other. I'm just saying that the\ndifference between these two numbers cannot be\nmore than 1/8. So n minus 12, the absolute\nvalue is less than or equal to 1/8. And this choice-- well actually,\nit's between these two values. It can't equal these values. So it can't equal these\nvalues, so it's not less than or equal. It's just less than. So n minus 12 is\nless than 1/8. That's choice C. And we are on the\nlast problem. Number 20. Almost there. The least integer of a\nset of consecutive integers is minus 25. So the least, the smallest\nis equal to minus 25. The least is minus 25. If the sum of these integers is\n26, how many integers are in this set? This is interesting. So I have minus 25 plus\nsomething plus something plus something. And when I add up all of\nthe integers, I get 26. So it's the least integer\nof a set of consecutive integers is minus 25. If the sum of these integers is\n26, how many integers are in this set? Well we start with minus 25. So the rest of the integers are\ngoing to have to equal-- this is an equation--\nminus 25 plus all of these random things. So let's add 25 to both\nsides of these things. So the rest of the integers are\ngoing to have to equal-- so you know, let's call it this\nis I2 because this is I1, integer 3, integer 4 plus\ninteger n, because we don't know how many there are. So that means that I2 plus I3\nplus bup, bup, bup, bup, bup. We don't know, a bunch. In is going to equal-- I'm just\nadding 25 to both sides of this equation. So that is equal to 51. Let's see, the least integer\nof a set of consecutive integers is minus 25. Oh, I forgot. That's consecutive integers. So we would actually know what\nthese values are, consecutive. So I2 is going to be minus 24--\nyou could almost ignore what I said just now. Let me actually clear this. I didn't read that\nconsecutive. It's important to read your\nproblems properly. So it's minus 25 plus minus 24\nplus minus 23 is all-- and then we don't know how high it\ngoes, but that is equal to 26. So what do we know? We know that we go from minus\n25 plus minus 24 plus minus 23, and we're going to\ngo all the way to 0. And then we're going to keep\nadding that to 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4, and we're going\nto add-- so you know. Well let me write it this way. Minus 25 plus minus 24 plus\nminus 23 plus bam, bam, bam, bam, bam plus minus 1 plus 0\nplus 1 plus 2 plus 24 plus 25. So I claim that the sum of all\nof the integers from minus 25 to 25 is going to be 0. And how do I know that? Well because minus 1-- let me\nswitch colors-- minus 1 is going to cancel out with 1. Minus 2 is going to\ncancel out with 2. Minus 23 is going to cancel\nout with positive 23. Minus 24 is going to\ncancel out with 24. And negative 25 is going to\ncancel out with positive 25. And so the last term, 26, has\nnothing to cancel out with it. And that's the sum because\nall of the other terms canceled out. So how many terms are there? So to go from minus 25 to minus\n1, that is 25 terms. Then to go from 1 to 25, that's\n25 terms. And then we have 0 is one term, and then\n26 is another term. So 25 plus 25 is 50\nplus 1 plus 1. 52 terms. And that\nis choice E. And we are done that\nfirst section. I hope you had fun. I'll see you soon.", "r_Pe74mPoDk": "[Music] hi class we are going to study today about optimization and modeling part one so this is after all these derivatives that you have to study it comes with a word problems and we will see real problems here then how we are going to apply calculus and I break into two parts so basically you're gonna do whole complete three pages with me and then second part is going to be I'm going to help you have up to the making the function and then you are going to do derivative part with the textbook and then there's a last part that you are going to do two questions by yourself so I kind of break it into like a game part level 1 level 2 level 3 so while you go through this one I hope that you understand the power of the calculus okay so it will be fun actually I really really enjoyed this part and um it will be a little bit difficult but just pay attention to my explanation and then you will you can do it after you do like 10 questions you may see some parents that's what happened to me so just bear with me and then enjoy so farmer has a 2400 feet of fencing and he wants to fence off rectangular field that borders are straight river he needs no fence along the river what are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area okay so when you read this question always I wanted to raise two times or three times that's what I will do and then first of all this would be it briefly and that is a circle although the important information and try to see that what I try to use what I try to use as an X and then what I like to get as output so this is like a for me computer programming so because all the programming will have about one or two inputs and then output like password and then domain of your email address like that so now when you read it if you don't get it let's just forget the clue what's going on with drawing some figures so there farmer has a twenty four hundred feet of a fantasy so it poor amount that he can use friends length is a twenty four hundred and then he wants to find someone one side is River so here's a river and there's a boat and she liked to fence around like this three side so no offense along the river and these total three sides of the length is 2400 then what they want to get here so when you see what is that dimensional they feel that the highlight word would be largest area that's what we'd like to optimize when will be the largest area so when you look at this one largest area is going to be my output so that's going to be area then input will be what I like to find the area then your input had to be no one on this side so I will set this one is X so info will be X length of the side then as you see the rectangle this is going to be X as well and also think about while with the top then there will be who do I have a 2,400 as a total length of offense but I use a 2x that part would be to 2,400 minus 2x and now I want to find the area of a rectangle that will be length times width so how can I write the function here so area function of input X will be length times width in this case will be these two numbers so 2,400 minus 2x times X that's what I like to optimize because I want to optimize the area so that's why I multiply length times width I'm going to tell you when you do this one with me it looks really easy and when you did by yourself you will have a little fun there so just pay attention together with me and in here why is it going on let me just to tell you what's going on in here first think about if I have a just a poor ol rectangle and if the 2,400 feet I can only use one side don't just give yourself example here I can probably make it a hundred and a hundred and a hundred does it make total 2,450 right then what is the area this time my area is going to be 6,400 square feet and this time necesita if I can built a triangle with and rectangle with different measurement here if I 100 that will be 400 right then this is going to be 1600 so total when you add it makes it 2400 feet then while with the area let's multiply this one and that's wrong Oh Winston I didn't mean to do this one Wow so they actually give you stain dimension is that correct uh-huh then I'm going to make it a little bit different so this time let's try with actually thousand here this will be thousand my graph is not that great and this is me twenty four hundred and thousand thirty two and then four hundred twenty four hundred feet then what will be my area I'm not making me stay oh I need more zeros right through zero that math teacher zero zero so here this is going to be forty one two three four yeah sorry about that and then so now I will write it my area carefully so did you notice there actually I have a stain on ma no defense length but you can totally have four hundred thousand verses sixty-four that's actually fifty percent more than this one then if your farmer you want to actually do this way with the other way right there's a full fun I wanna actually go for six hundred because I feel that six hundred could be our answer just by looking at those 600 600 then that's going to be twelve hundred twelve thousand twelve hundred right then let's look at that's a twenty four so what do I get now I get seven eight two two three four zeros so this time if you look at you see almost twice bigger that's what we call optimization in company you guys gonna use all that sorry I got a little bit distracted explain it recap but I want to see that why we need to optimize because although I have the same length 2,400 feet but depending on what dimension you said it you Cleveland put so much more twice a month that you can actually put your animal there right because the area is it that much bigger so that's what we like to optimize in this case what will give me the largest area okay so now I'm not going to explain more details about I hope there you see the reason why we have to optimize and now how we're gonna find it that's the equation we actually write it as a on programming language basically over this whole my observation so why are they asking here in order to find largest area if I put this one out I know that my function is going to be quadratic function with concave down right this way so our largest means it's gonna happen at maximum how do we find maximum that happens at first derivative so we are going to take a derivative of area which is area derivative will give me this will be easier than using the on product look so let's do this one negative 4x plus 2400 and let's factor it out by negative four and now I get X my 600 uh-huh so from here if I say equal to zero to find them on critical value I see that X has to be 600 then we need to check that if this one is a maximum or minimum so if you graph this one you will see that 2400 and the slope is a negative 4 so this coordinate will be 600 right your Y intersects intercept is a 600 as it here says so what does it here say from critical point my first derivative left side is a decreasing and then I'm increasing lifestyle isn't first when I will get 430 tip this tell me that my original function is increasing and then after 600 it's going to be decreasing therefore my maximum is happening at 600 so Jana is this the same question to find him vertex yes so I found the my x value as a 6 which we actually found it by plugging numbers by so I got six hundred as one side then what will be the other sizes we have to find the dimension that gives me twelve hundred feet as a dimension gives us seventy seven hundred twenty thousand feet square as area maximum area yeah that's how we solve this one so this one was an appetizer so now we have a on same question I change the number so I wanted to practice at one time and then compare the answer with me okay class let's look at in class activity one and how did it go so this storm wasn't too bad right so I graph input was a side of the length and the area is output I want to find so my function has to be length times width this area sothanks times width in here then I took the derivative and then what they're saying is or what is the largest area so you have to see the input X output area largest area means when i graph it odd that represent a maximum value it has to be the vertex so with our prekow we can actually graph this one as a bird zero and then passing through 1800 if you factor it out by negative two you see that X minus 1800 and times X so I had two x-intercepts and if i graph it by symmetric i actually see the answer it has to be 900 right so i also want to verify with first derivative when i take the word first or the tip day i want to find critical point so i set equal to 0 then my critical point is going to be 900 so i have to see that what is this valuable connection or minimum so i check right here with a first derivative graphed the here says increasing decreasing so 900 has to be local maximum local maxima and therefore I got the proof that that's a maximum and by plugin 900 by 1,800 would give me max area over 1 million six hundred twenty thousand v square ok so that's the answer that's continuing class so now we gonna the main dish and let's look at the question he so we have a cylinder e-content is to be made to hold one liter of oil by the dimension that will minimize the cost of the metal too many bachelor they can so I want to actually give you some example here so class so I try to quickly prepare what I try to say so look at here I got three one two and three different kind of a cups and I filled up this one with the water and I want to see that if among those are three cups which one would be actually the biggest volume so let's compare so I'm going to put this water into next Cup and I didn't feel it completely so that I don't drink it on the ground and if I put this one as you see it's actually same volume and then if I pour this one to our two serving dish and if I point here let you see a drip summer but but also if it's here can I say that all these three have the same volume yes this one is actually eight ounce as a one cup so now Oman does a three among those are three cups which one will have this smallest surface because if you are the owner of the company then you want to actually make it biggest container we're using the smallest material right so this is a question we are going to talk about we have a 1 liter of oil and then I'm sorry that I was going to calculate the volume and then volume is eight ounce but I was going to calculate the surface area for you but I don't think in the really really exact form on those are three cases we saw those a three cups and then one of them will give me the max on minimum surface area which you wanna have small it's a surface or material that you wanna buy and then you want to maximize the volume that's why we try to find here so all these three cases are the same size as a 1 liter of oil just think about like that then depending on the radius though the surface area will change which we saw earlier use implies explain to you with the on farming area so just think about that example and then let's try to now see that what we need to figure here so what would be input if you cannot find the input then try to find what is the output what do you want to maximize what you want to optimize what do you want to minimize so if you use the minimum maximum that to optimization so here's that I want to minimize the cost of the metal so output will be cost of the metal how do we check the price price is going to be money times and then material I in this case we have to see they didn't actually tell us the amount so we are going to find the minimum area that will minimize our cost so you have to see hidden question is I cannot find the cost but if I find the minimum area minimum surface area that will minimize my cost here to find it so we are going to say our output is going to be the minimum area of a cylinder okay and then what do we need to send now input path this is a cylinder do we use XOR we are going to use our as radius of 10 so I'm going to set that as R and then we'll try to find minimum area of a cylinder so what can I do if I want to find the area of a cylinder I need to open the cylinder and the area of the surface will be open this way everybody see why it is shaped this one top part bottom part and then around the middle part so I want to find the area only information I know is this is R then what is the area with how part of the PI R square which is the same as the bottom part PI R square then what's the area of a middle rectangle well that length here is going to be same as my circumference of the circle so that's going to be 2 PI R and then why is this I don't know so I have to use this one as H as a height then that is going to be area 2 PI R H so the function day I want to find this area of a cylinder input these are so you can only use the art in here so look at I have a 2 PI R square adding it plus 2 pi RH but when you look at here this is a function but I cannot use the two variables you can use only one variable art but I have H so how can I get rid of the age H is going to be come from my height but do I know that volume yes so what is a volume of a cylinder when the radius is R and height is H so this is R and then height is H then always the volume is base times height so why does the base base is going to be PI R squared and what is a height H uh-huh so I got the volume is PI R square H but they were to give me what is that that's one later exactly so well I'm going to do is I'm going to replace that h value in terms of X that's I'm going to approach it soon but looky here I cannot still use this one yet because my units are different this is a leader but radius is going to be probably centimeter this one we have to use a centimeter why because one liter different unit we cannot use it we can change that into same Union one liter is the same as 1,000 square Q centimeters so here shows that PI R square H is 10 at 1,000 so if I solve for H if I solve for H I get 1,000 over PI R square so if I replace this one it substitute into this age then I can rewrite all my equation in terms of extra R so this will be you is Rudy by plugin by plugging in H here then that's only 2 PI R squared plus 2 pi R thousand over PI R squared and you see these cancel out this one can slap so it turned out to be simple 2 PI R squared plus 2 thousand over R that's what I get as my function that's why you want to put it as a function so when I look at this one I cannot have a more than one variable so if I say input are you have to change everything in terms of art right here okay no two variables so now we got the first derivative a regular function regular function which it is we are going to use this function and what is this that is a surface area so if I want to minimize I need to take a primitive so let me take a derivative here a derivative would be 4 PI R plus 2 minus 2,000 over R square I did everything mentally I did everything mentally so foci are closed - because that's arsenic it's 1 minus a 2 thousand over R square but I want to find critical point so equal to 0 then let's set up 4 PI R is equal to 2,000 over 4 PI R is equal to 2,000 over R square we can do cross multiply is my R cube is 2,000 over 4 PI multiplied divided by 4 PI so R is going to be cube root of 2000 over 4 PI that's the answer that's the answer and from here now we need to punch in that number so what will be 2000 divided by today 1/3 power it's me five point four one nine two that's my radius centimeter okay then from here we need to talk about a little bit more we need to talk about a little bit more so you know how can you verify that this is a minimum because I didn't verify it yet right so how do I verify this is minimum well then you need to see that the first targeted graph when you plug in five point one nine two that will make zero so we need to plug in five I'm going to plug in five quickly and it's going to be 5 into I'm doing test point five here and I'm going to plug in 6 here into here so that I can check my sign to 4 pi times 5 minus 2000 R square then that gives me negative seventeen point one six and I'm gonna do the same thing with plug in six so if you don't see the graph like how I explained then you Joseph from the critical point critical point plug in number one down number one bigger then I got negative 273.16 when I plug in six I got 19.8 for that already shows that my graph is gonna look like this way right Leggett so that's positive of a first 32 graph so ah this number is going to be decreasing increasing so I can say that that's local minima I need to still verifying part on your paper too so always try to plug in and then verify if you cannot find the graph so that's now minima then answer we did not answer yet because our value is at this when R is five point four one nine two then while this roof is area all we need to do is plug in here so let me use that number if you put in this number that would be perfect answer and if you put in this one it's gonna give me some wrong the answer right so two pi and I will just use a five point four one nine two okay then I got s550 3.58 that's a surface area so it's gonna be square centimeters okay so what does this mean what does this mean I want to say five point four five point four is about this much five point four and when you have a radius about this much so it's gonna be this much as a diameter and then if you about this much can when you make it you want to make radius as five point four then if you plug in this number to your art you're gonna get H value I believe that with my experience probably twice bigger so let me find my let me find the H value for users for fun so thousand divided by five point four one nine two exactly what I guess so I got ten point eight three eight seven so let me draw five centimeter is about this much so doubling it so my radius is about five point one four two and then it's used in my highness same length as your diameter right that's a ten point a four at the time you will have maximum you have biggest volume which is one meter with a small little surface area that's you want to spend about this much okay all right it's a little bit confusing right so I want to actually plug in and then see that what happened when I have five point full month or two I got area as a 550 3.58 there's a full fun I want to put two centimeter what if it is a two centimeter half not even half it's going to be about two centimeters so I'm gonna make it this then your surface area is going to be change although your volume is the same so I'm going to plug in tube in here into my surface area and what will give me as a minimum surface okay so if I plug in 2 I get actually thousand twenty five one three okay I want you to see the differences you see there if I have a radius five point four two you only need a 550 degree swerve it basically Roundy if you use a two centimeter then how much you have to use for surface 1025 you use it about twice more about twice more that means that as your factory owner or you are the CEO you don't want to see that right because that's totally wasting money of the same amount that you can hold it so that's why it's very important optimizing in the company because you can save twice among the money of your material so that's what we are doing but yeah all right this is still hard then I can I will show you with the decimals okay okay class so let's look at that smooth as you see the function over 2 pi x squared plus 2000 over X you know how do I know my answer is correct because that's the point you are looking for right before the calculus we cannot find any other function besides a quadratic and now you guys can so I punched in and then I just click that one do you guys see that five point four one nine gives me area 553 if it matches then yes you got the correct answer that's how you can check then earlier we also check with a to write how much the surface area will be when the input is 2 so if I plug in 2 here about to then do you say thousand 23 I don't know sorry I clicked it around here then that gives me same number about up here so also so you see how do I know depending on if you get even bigger radius that means that your surface area gets also worse again so what is the ideal size ideal size of the package usually as you stick this side this size about the same yeah so when you see this one this one is the same there would usually minimize the surface area pretty cool right so the answer is going to be when our value is five point four one nine two also you can write it this one and those ones you should be able to do without calculator or two here then you will get minimum surface area 553 I think about that only this much right ten centimeter by 10 centimeter so that's this much that is one meter so imagine one meter how much is one meter above real with this one it's probably one meter right so think about that of the amount okay so we will do one on in-class activities just similar question and then I want you to compare the answer with me okay so comfortable answer we need how did it go so say the input output the surface area then my surface area if I simplify in terms of everything are as you see in please are we cannot use H there so force to change in terms of our gave me this function so I took the derivative and then I say equal to zero to get critical point so my r-value turn out to be four point three or one three okay so when I plug in this R value gave me my surface the area as a three hundred forty eight point seven three four then again you're not want to check the answer is this really correct answer so you can always go back to here but I actually need to see all your work as well if you look at you see the four point three one comment three hundred forty eight point seven three four exactly so if you graph that's what you thought so let's conclude that earlier as mentioned if we have those are three different kinds of glasses what do you think that actually gave me the least amount of the surface area first one second one third one actually this case this one whenever you have a right proportion of this one this one will give me the smaller surface area although they hold this thing then when you see here I want you to also see that here to here if you reducing your radius in half then as you earn yourself your cost of making surface area could be twice more so if you see that can buy the coca-cola can I don't think okay this is not a candidate I tried to show you but do you guys remember those a coca-cola can why do they make that now I want how to mathematics to because if you make this one there will actually cost more if you make it this size it's definitely gonna fit with a death size it's gonna cost less that's why they made a coca-cola I can shape as a let's shape exactly because they calculated all these kind of a parts now another thing I want to talk about is a volume earlier we had a 1 liter now I have a half liter exactly half um another volume earlier we had a radius 5.3 will be maximum I remember about 5.30 say that so when I wasn't thinking oh my volume is going to be 1/2 then did you think that my radius has to be also 1/2 like 2.5 ish instead of 4.3 because when I saw this one I wasn't more guessing oh my answer I want to see about 2.5 but I support point 3 I was like whoa what happened because I didn't think ice is gonna be very close to 5 point 3 was the 5 point number we got earlier one why is that think about this way I have area as one if I'm gonna increase it twice then that side is 1 then my area is 1 but if I'm doubling it if I'm doubling it my length then it becomes area because of 4 if you double your side then your volume becomes actually eight times more because area is a four times volume is going to be eight times more so I want you to I want you to think about this time why I didn't get half over early over five point I fell five point three or five point one is your three sorry if I'm messing up but why it wasn't two point something - a 4.3 because now you have a half amount that means your length will be only 3/4 reduced basically I wanted to feel that if your length is inputting twice and then your area equals four times your volume increasing eight times that's what do they ship is this one is a centimeter to the volume relationship that's why they are going to be not half of the radius only quorum man will be reduced so think about that if you're not getting it so completing me so that's it implants activities and let's do dessert okay so let's start the dessert today is the most highlight part and it's gonna be one of the most difficult one so listen and then let's do it next activities and by yourself so that you can make it yours so a man launched this is both point a on the bank of this trip Weaver and three kilometers why three kilometers wide this is a three kilometers wide and then he wants to reach point B from point A and point B is a 9 kilometers downstream on the opposite side of the bank so this length is ninety meters and if she can roll about four kilometers per hour and he can run eight kilometers per hour where shoe heel and to reach he as soon as possible know what's going on is that he wants to cross the river he wants to cross the river then I want to see that how he can reach there so as you see there are three cases this question have to really squeeze a spot so I have a three cases one case is you can just go straight like this that's the first case second case is you can go this way and then third case will be what we were looking for let's just walk run about here and then take a boat through this way so there are three cases then let's try to read a question again what do we wanna find where should he learn to reach B as soon as possible so you have to read a question are we looking for distance are we going for rate or time what I like to find here I wanna where should be very should he be too rich yes as soon as possible do you see that this is a little bit tricky so my output as soon as possible what does that mean that's going to be true this time to this time when when I landing here so I can set this distance as X this distance as X right then before we get into green color we want to see that Y have to break into those three cases let me explain to you with third one second case first so what is the time time distance is equal to RT then time is the same as the distance over R so in order to find how long it takes to run 90 meters and crossing three kilometers we can see that the time is going to be input as time is going to be the distance is a 90 meter over why was his rate of running he can run about eight miles per hour and then he can roll about four miles per hour so time that he run here is an 9 kilometers over 8 plus now he has to go 3 kilometers with speed Y so if I add this one that's going to be 6 15 15 over 8 that gives me about 1 point 8 7 5 hours to get there then let's look at first case that's we go straight here that means you just roll your boat all the way so how do we find this distance we have to use a Pythagorean theorem right so 9 kilometers squared 3 kilometers squared so that's going to be 81 plus 9 is 90 so I gonna take square root of 90 gives me the distance of as 9.8 and for it so I got square root of 19 so this length is square root of 19 which is about nine point four eight six eight so if I want to find what is the time it takes to cross only using row the boat that's going to be square root of 90 divided by speed was both speed is four then it gives me two point three seven hours it's a lot longer right a lot longer so if you go this one definitely I'm not going to go that way because this is gonna be shorter than what you thought right this takes a 1.75 this one takes two point three seven hours then can we find is there any point users to lending so that I can get to there so I said that one is X and watch carefully why is it this length that's going to be 9 minus X that would be 9 minus X then let's try to calculate this part of the tiny tape so time taster while running on day along the water is gonna a total X amount over what's the time it takes that is going the speed is going to be a miles per hour plus because a tiny the distance over R and then now why is this distance what is this distance we have to find that distance that's going to be our Pythagorean theorem so 9 minus X square plus 3 square has to be this distance square therefore that distance will be split off 9 minus x squared plus 9 over the speed of crossing the water definitely slower than the land which is a point now do you guys recall that we learn how to take a derivative this mark right so if you look at the previous part and you will see this one answer you will see the answer here let me pull it if I can find the answer so class I haven't start the question yet but if you actually take a 32 which we'll learn about three point four point two if you take a derivatives that equal to zero and then solve for X then you will get your x value as a seven point two six eight what does that mean that means when this one when you run about seven point two six eight when you have about one point seven three to left then that will actually take about one point seven seven five hours do you see that which one would actually get there the fastest time oh definitely not this definitely not this then we have to find where I start taking boat and after you run about seven point two six eight meters then you can roll the boat to the other side will give me the minimum time which is one point seven by about 1 hour 45 minutes but you know why you didn't show me this one well let's hope put it this one how I want to do so we've set input as X by X this time was a distance from where you're starting to where you wanna take off but this time I'm going to switch my graph of x to a little bit off which means off but differently so it's still my question is saying I'm crossing the river and try to get there and this time instead we're setting X here I want to set X here why I wanted to see little differences if this is X then that's going to be 9 minus X and if I want to have this length as a 3 do you see that the diagonal will be only x squared plus 9 you see that your equation becomes a lot easier so what is the distance of the water to we're going to take off with 9 minus X and what's the distance you are going to take a boat that's going to be square root of x squared plus 9 from Pythagorean theorem then let's try to find a function at the time so time input output is X but I switch my X from this X to other one basically saying if I get the X subtract that X I will get the same answer so time means distance over rate so what is this distance square root of x squared plus 9 over what the rate is 4 plus you have to walk this much and when one this much with your way 8 ok basically this first day in question I just set the X other way around why did I do that because it will make it easier to take a derivative so let's take a derivative I hope they have a room I'm not sure so I have to squeeze it a lot so if I take order T to this one 1 over 2 and then I have that 1 over 4 before then 1 over 2 square root of X square plus 9 and chain rule 2x plus take a derivative that will be negative 1 8 do you see other 9 over 8 minus 1/8 X right so you can change the linear and then take a derivative so I get that that has to be equal to 0 pi so if I continue it's going to be 2x over a square root of x squared plus 9 has to be 1/8 then can I multiply a both side so those are gone now I have 2x over square root of x squared plus 9 equals 1 so let's do cross multiply that gives me 2x is equal to square root of x squared plus 9 square both sides that gives me 4 x squared is x squared plus 9 and that makes it 3 x squared equal to 9 X is equal to plus minus square root 3 but it has to be positive so I'm going to use only slow drop 3 which is 2 point 2 3 and at one point seven three two so square root 3 is about one point seven three two so now let's check if I set this one as X and I got that value as one point seven three two so subtract from nine then do you see that I get exactly same it's a seven point two six eight but you know why you don't put it that way well earlier when you're the four point two that's how your text will approach for me I will approach it this way and you see that my derivative is so much better so much easier and you know how do you check that this is your minimum same thing you have your point seven point two six now you can plug in here seven plug in here eight and if you graph it it will turn out this way then my graph is going to be concave up so original function is concave up so I can indicate that this value is going to be my okay then how you check same thing you just punch in two decimals and let's see if I can see that tell you if I punch the decimal do you say seven point two six eight and then that's the value I found so did we finish answering did we finish answering no I didn't answer yet but if I plug in this number either way so this case IVA X tells of square root three then you have to plug in your number to here to get the answer and if you use your functions that exit this side the derivative is going to be a little bit more challenging than the other one but you see that you get the same answer now if you plug in one point seven three two what you're gonna get as your answer staying answers one point seven seven five so I minimize the time it takes after you walk seven point two meters and then row the boats rests upon wool if you didn't mean mom time to get there it's pretty interesting right so I want you to understand and then your answer will be one point seven seven five hours as a minimum time okay so there's another question same one but that is different number so I want you to be careful but X just to try to see that what are you defining it it's hard to describe but if you graph it I will understand so you see that depending on where you stay at the life will be so much easier or harder good luck okay how's it going class so as I said you guys would keep everything on the last chapter one two three to do these questions and I wanted to feel that how beautiful it is how smart you are how wise you are to figure it out and I love calculus because it comes everything about math you learn in your life you put in here and then now it makes sense why you want this right so that's why for me optimization is a very powerful question you basically pick her twelve years to do questions like this so good job so compute the answer input X and we want to minimize the time always the hint is the shortest of still possible and those are the word so minimum time then time we write as a distance / way so I found all the distance and the only rate and then I just put it together pleasedon't sub-array plus the distance of array so that I can find the time of a together going to different segments then I get X to the seven point five one nine three earlier sorry I made a mistake as a kilometers but since the miles per hour all my unit has a miles so after you walk in 7.5 about taking on board will give you the minimum time so if you plug in but this time I change my X to this side then you see my distance of a rowing boat is going to be this and then you're running will be 10 minus X so as you use it distance over speed was a four distance over speed was a nine and I took the dhurbey to this one in some of the other one because you experience that that was all one harder you can do that way - nothing wrong with me then I found it it gives me two point four eight one so I subtract from ten it gave me seven point five one nine but we need to see how long it takes so I'm going to plug in and then you also need to plug in and tell me the time because that's what we want to figure out and as you use as earlier I show you this one this way will take longer although this will be shortest distance so if I plug in two three hours so it's nothing longer than earlier one because my distance is a little bit longer - so when you walk seven point five and then rowing the boat that total trip will make about two point two three hours two point two three hours okay so this is it and then we are having a part two so part two will be I'm going to set up up to here and then you guys gonna do the derivative and then upload it so with next four questions keep playing with me kid playing math with me then when you do more you will get better", "nLhsjA1at4E": "thank you okay just to let you know I record each lecture and so what I'm going to do is wear this microphone it's blinking which can be a little bit of a distraction it's not like my heart rate monitor this isn't what do they call that when you have pacemaker I'm not iron man this is just a microphone and so this records the audio it's also capturing the screen I'm loading it onto YouTube and what my methodology will be is that after each lecture it takes a while to process the video file but then I'll post the link on mu online I won't email it to you or anything like that but if you need to review a section of the lecture because you couldn't understand something want to go through it again or if it's a spreadsheet demo and you need to take a look at the formulas that I used a second time the recordings can be useful for that I'll have one or two instances during the semester where I'm away at a conference or at a meeting and then I'll just post the recorded lecture online or maybe you'll be sick and so this is a way for you to access the lecture where you maybe wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to go through it again on the other hand if you are like don't want to be on mic then whisper your question and I'll try and hear it but the microphone won't you know like if you're really paranoid that if your microphone gets recorded it'll take your voice away that's sort of like sort of that stuff thank you let's go through a couple of announcements we'll look at the syllabus and we'll just dig right into the material today the first item I wanted to remind you of is that you should either buy or rent the textbook as quickly as possible did everybody get the email I sent out at the beginning of the let me last week to let you know the great bargain that's available on you on Amazon to rent your book I think what is the book to rent 38 bucks or was it even less yeah yeah you mean the e-book yeah sure iPad iPhone I don't know anymore yeah you can use it in whatever format you'd like yep that's just fine as long as it's the same edition there are you know nine other editions out there previous editions where they they've changed the homework around and that wouldn't be good - by the 9th edition although the text is mostly the same did it as quickly as possible because I'm going to here's your first homework assignment homework number 2a does everybody have a copy of these notes you can write in the margins off to the side you've actually got your first two assignments I'm gonna give you this introductory assignment right now since it's been a while since I taught most of you and some of you I've never taught before at all I want an opportunity to get to know you a little bit better and so I'm going to encourage you to stop by my office during my office hours with this introductory assignment you don't get points for completing the assignment unless you come during my office hours so that's part of the thing is to let you know when my office hours are you know break the ice because sometimes it seems like students are a little bit shy and nervous about coming to the professor when they've got questions or when they're confused about something and I don't want you to feel shy and then have it hurt your grade it's always a pity when you know you were willing to do the work but fell behind and then ultimately didn't learn the material so introductory assignment is due Friday before noon the reason why it's before noon is that that's the end of my office hours for the week as you can see from the syllabus that I handed out earlier my office hours are Tuesday from 12:30 to 2:00 Thursday from 12:30 to 3:30 and Friday from 10:30 till noon so this introductory assignments pretty easy it's the easiest points of the semester stopping by and shooting the breeze with me and I think there's one technical thing I asked you to find out is what is it the pressure or what's the pressure at the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean so you're gonna actually have to google that or something find that right so alright that's homework one it's due on Friday and then homework 2a is due the following Tuesday September 2nd now of course we don't have classes on Monday because it's Labor Day but we'll just have our normal schedule here on Tuesday and homework 2a will be due that day so those are the announcements so let's just jump into this syllabus a little bit more and the syllabus mentions that my office is just down the hall at L 113 it's the first office on the right as you come in the building from those far doors I've got my office phone and email address listed here and there's a reference to all of the university policies that govern academic behavior like the excused absence policy Computer Services inclement weather and so on feel free to read through those university policies at your leisure the purpose of this course though is the principles of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics with computer applications this course includes a lab and we have lab today as a matter of fact we'll all be meeting our lab is scheduled from 2:00 until 5:00 o'clock today we'll meet back in the lab there are some desks there we're going to have both an introduction to safety as it pertains to the equipment we'll be using the semester and also I'm going to talk to you about the required lab format so we have three hours set aside each week for lab and we rarely will use the full three hours so today we'll probably finish early today you know like maybe at 4:57 4:58 at the latest all right I guarantee that we'll finish at least two minutes early today that's my humble promise to you the course objectives is to continue your education in the science of mechanics introduce fluid properties we did that today some fluid properties start talking about fluid statics and close conduit flow next semester the continuation of this course is a hydraulic engineering that's C III 31 and it's important that classes be taken in a 1:2 sequence because they're so closely interrelated in next semester in hydraulic engineering we'll start talking about open channel flow a little bit more than will be able to touch on at this semester you can see a list of course outcomes here and I won't read through that entire list you're welcome to read through the list of 10 course outcomes but often you'll want to jump right into the grading scheme here and see that we have two midterm exams each one of them is worth 19 percent so together they account for 38 percent of the course grade your homework assignments are 17 percent of the course grade quizzes or 10 percent and we'll have quizzes on average a little less than once a week you'll sort of feel it when there's a quiz in the air like there's a quiz brewing you know sort of like a storm in sense it often times it'll be after you submitted a homework assignment or you'll just start to know final exam is 20% and then the lab assignments whether it's a report or some other activity that's assigned with the lab together accounts for 15% of the course grade any questions about the grading basis okay I've got a schedule of topics and that's in the syllabus but as far as the schedule go what I think is more useful and important is this gray shaded spreadsheet table that I've given you does everybody a copy of the course schedule document what it shows is every class for the semester lectures 1 through 28 the subject for each of those lectures what book chapter corresponds to it and I really encourage you to use the book not only just to find the homework problems but this textbook can explain things in a different way than I'm gonna be able to explain it and so it's an alternate point of view to reinforce the material you're supposed to learn and it's important for you to read the textbook whether you do it or not it's still important for you to do it so you know the a and B level students will be the ones who take the time to read the explanations in the textbook this table also lists the homework assignments for the semester when they're due and then the labs that we're going to have each week and so the labs will be every Tuesday and the lab that we're doing today for example the homework assignment that goes along with that will be due a week later so it'll be due during lab next Tuesday so this one page here the course schedule gives you a glance of when the exams are we'll do the exams as you can see during our lab time just so that gives you a little bit more time to solve the exams so our first exam will be on the 30th of September our second exam is on November 18th and then the final exam is comprehensive but it'll have added emphasis on the material that isn't included in the first two exams you can see that we even have the final scheduled for the Thursday the 11th of December so there's no mystery about the course it's all there before you any questions about this course schedule the meaning of anything that's on here the homework assignments are labeled to correspond with the chap the book chapter so the reason why there's a homework 2a and 2b is because both of those assignments correspond to chapter two I don't know why I do it like that but let's just I do I think they're I i've been using this textbook for a long time I think it's excellent and so I pretty closely follow the way the material is presented in the text and that's why the homework assignments are labeled I guess that way so let's jump back to the syllabus here and take a quick look at the homework and academic dishonesty policy the schedule of labs and the schedule of topics is in that standalone schedule that I've just given you my homework in academic dishonesty policy is that as far as homework goes I don't accept late work you do the assignment on time and it should be here on the table before class starts already stapled together not folded though some of the other professors ask you to fold the work together I don't want it folded it doesn't matter the personal preference but it should be stapled on engineering paper and at the front of the table here before class starts and I don't accept late work unless it's an official University excused absence and the way that you get that is outlined in the course policies that I linked to there is a form that Student Affairs wants you to fill out and then the Dean of Students will make the determination of whether your excuse is going to be a university excused or not and so as far as honesty goes one important thing that I'll mention to you is that copying homework assignments is not allowed and that means you shouldn't copy another student's homework assignment and you shouldn't copy information out of the solution manual the homework problems to this the solution manuals out there on the internet and I'm sure you can track it down if you want to but I'll really encourage you not to do that number one because it's just gonna hurt your education if you short-circuit the growth process that's required to get stronger then you're not going to know the material for the quiz you're not going to know the material for the exam and most importantly you're not going to know the material when you go out into professional practice if you copy the homework problems out of the solution manual but another reason to not do that is that once in a while in that solution manual there's errors and I know what those errors are but you may not know what those errors are and so when I'm grading the homework it's really easy to tell who's copied the solution manual because you'll use the mistake that the author has in the author solution manual you'd think after ten editions he'd give me a solution manual that's right but no it's chock-full of errors and I found them so twofold reason not to copy the homework is because it's wrong and hurts your learning and also it's easy for me to catch you and I'll give you an F in the class if you do it so the the smiley faces and the frowny faces helps to distinguish between what I consider acceptable behavior and what's inappropriate collaboration so it's okay to talk about the homework with other students and it's okay to check your answers with another student and even to help another student find mistakes in their solution but what's not okay is to sit at a table with the student and both of you at the same time are working the same problem at the same pace and what's wrong with that is that inevitably when you have two people sitting together one of them works more quickly than the other one it's not that one smarter and ones Dumber it's just that they work at different speeds naturally and so the one who naturally would work a little bit more slowly will just sort of copy what the fast one is doing to keep up and it won't sink in in the same way as if they've done it themselves so don't sit at a table and work every step of a problem with somebody together because group working problems simultaneously just means that you're gonna be underprepared when it really counts another thing you shouldn't do is give your completed homework assignment to another person because you don't know what they're gonna if they copy it then the grater is going to say these two assignments look identical and both of you are going to be in a little bit of hot water for inappropriate collaboration so when you finished with your homework assignment hang on to it until you turn it in it's okay to collaborate but just not to collaborate inappropriately any questions about that all right hopefully it won't come up again the next two pages are tables of course outcomes implementation method evaluation method and how that ties into both the degree profile and our program outcomes I don't know if any of you will be really interested in that these two pages but it relates to like your whole education what are the main goals that we have for our BSC degree and so this is just showing how this course achieves some of the program goals that we have for your BSC degree any questions about the syllabus all right so you've got the schedule you've got the syllabus you've got the introductory assignment and today in the lab I've got some handouts for you I won't give you that now and you've got the class notes for today right so much paperwork it would be useful if you have a three-ring binder that you hang on to for all of the handouts I'm going to give you through the semester I'm going to I'm gonna give you notes each class period with some space in the margin for you to write down your work so I'd encourage you to have a binder to keep it all together okay well let's get in the material unless there's any questions before we move forward we'll smart start by talking about the difference between pounds mass and pounds force and this is confusing and the traditional unit system also sometimes called British gravitational units BG is what we use when we're talking in terms of inches and feet and pounds and ounces I used to teach overseas actually I used to teach in the United Arab Emirates and I'd occasionally throw problems in in the traditional units for students over there just to see what it's like and they were absolutely bewildered by the British gravitational system they are thinking why are there 12 inches in a foot why not ten inches in a foot wouldn't that make more sense and I had to say yeah of course that we make more sense but that's the SI system in in terms of force we have a Newton and a lot of this will be review for you a Newton is a kilogram subjected to an acceleration of one meter per second squared in traditional units we have what's called a pound of force and a pound of force is analogous to a Newton in that they both have units of mass the unit of mass in SI units is a kilogram the unit of mass in BG British cavitational or traditional units is a slug instead of accelerating it at 1 meter per second squared if you accelerate a slug at 1 foot per second squared it's going to require one pound of force in order to achieve that level of acceleration so that is a slug can be subdivided into 30 2.2 pounds of mass remember a slug is a measure of mass but the confusing thing is that there is both pounds of force and pounds of mass and so you may be wondering how do they fit together how do you keep straight pounds force and pounds mass here's how I think about it that you can have a pound of force by taking a slug and accelerating it by one foot per second squared because remember up here earlier I said a slug accelerated at 1 foot per second squared is a pound of force so that's one way to think of a pound of force another is this way and it's maybe the more meaningful way a pound of force is what you get when you have a pound of mass accelerated @ 32.2 foot per second squared and what's significant about 32.2 what is that that's G right acceleration of Earth's gravitational field so if I have a pound of mass on earth it's going to exert a force of a pound force if I accelerate it at any other gravitational constant then 32.2 then pound force and pound mass aren't going to be the same but when they're static the two are equal all right put a big star next to this slide because you'll be coming back to it in chapter 4 you'll be scratching your head and be thinking I remember we talked about pounds force and pounds of mass and you'll be able to find this slide again ok so if we just talk a little bit more about basic units by the way when do we finish it's at 12:15 right these classes on Tuesday and Thursday always throw me for a loop so if I start talking too long you know do the thing with your backpacks you know the zippers that'll let me know when I start hearing zippers I'm like oh I'm running out of time all right and if I ignore your zippers just start standing up well it's been great you know just make your way towards the exit all right you don't ever have to stay late for me wait is the effective acceleration on mass you'll notice that in the handout I gave you today it's just natural for I I wanted to say how much will the cup way we are accustomed to talking that in that man when we're thinking about measuring something but really I had to force myself oh it's not how much does it weigh it's what is its mass because I was gonna be measuring it in grams not in Newtons weight is a measure of force and so one kilogram of mass on earth has a force of 9.81 Newtons because in SI units acceleration is 9.81 m/s^2 our basic units of temperature absolute terms is Kelvin and remember probably back to chemistry you converted between Kelvin and Celsius with the conversion factor of two seventy three point one six is how you can convert between the two the freezing point of water is 273 point one six Kelvin zero Celsius work or energy is measured in joules and the Joule is a Newton multiplied by a meter so it's the amount of energy required to cause a Newton of force over a meter of length and so if I was going to lift something if I had something that weighed one Newton if it was exerting one Newton of force and I pushed it through one meter then it would have taken me 1 joule in order to accomplish that and then power is where time comes into it it's the exertion of a certain amount of energy per time and so a watt is when you were exerting one Joule per second it's a rate all right if we want to convert between SI and traditional units the textbook gives us a handy reference in the front of the book it's got all the information that you'd want to do to convert between SI and traditional units so it's got length speed mass density all of it so I'm saying here that a foot is thirty point four eight centimeters you can find that same information here on the table F one in your front cover it also has some commonly used equations and that's nice they've just started adding these equations in the tenth edition that we're in now previous versions of the book didn't have that conversion between slugs and kilograms pounds force a Newton meter power is measured in terms of foot-pounds per second sometimes also called a horsepower when we about 550 of them here's a tricky one is the conversion between Fahrenheit which is always thinking Fahrenheit I mean I can maybe do meters and kilometers but Celsius is just absolutely meaningless to me even when I lived in a foreign country for four years still Celsius never made any sense to me but the way that you can think about a Fahrenheit is that the degrees themselves are smaller so a Fahrenheit degree is only five nights the size of a Celsius degree and then there's also the difference of their freezing point of in Fahrenheit it's 32 degrees for the freezing point of water and it's a zero for Celsius absolute temperature in traditional units is measured in raking and so degrees r18 is 460 plus whatever the temperature is in Fahrenheit so let's just you work an example here today I'd like you to give this a try if it was 43 degrees Celsius in Dubai yesterday what is that in raking so you'll need to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit and then Fahrenheit - raking", "ZfPBAqOMajQ": "[Music] that's 60 yards number 4 well it's good to be back in Turkey campus that starts tomorrow brother yeah we were lucky enough to go over to Alton and what we saw when we went to Winchester literally blew our minds they were teaching us exactly what this new ammunition will do we've got some brand spankin new prototypes from Winchester when they said prototypes they meant prototypes every one of these shells is this numbered we've got fours fives and sixes they're so new they don't even have boxes made yet so we're kind of anxious to shoot them they're saying we'll gain 20 30 40 yards consistently and that's the key so we're kind of anxious to shoot and see how they do well here we are at the Winchester ammunition booth in Las Vegas Nevada at the 2014 shop show and something that you and I really have a hard time getting excited about but this was one of the most exciting revelations that we've seen in years and that's that long beard XR I can remember Terry when we first started some 25 years ago if we went out to the patterning range and we got a gun that would put six to ten shot in a turkey silhouette head at 40 yards we were elated we went to the patterning range and we were lucky enough to test these last spring and tell us about some of the results we saw well again you know if we got fifteen or sixteen in the head and neck at 40 yards we were like this is a gun I got to use this is the choke I got to use this is the combinations that's going to kill that turkey out there long range well we found out by patterning fours fives and sixes through these new guns and new choke combinations that all of a sudden our downrange at 60 yards 70 yards was effective that we've never had before and being in the video business you and I both know that you want that turkey in close but it doesn't always work like that you know there's so many birds that have slipped through our fingers at 50 60 and 70 yards that we were always afraid to take that shot not anymore not anymore and one of the things that impressed me the most was how much downrange energy and punch this ammunition had oh they're in trouble that's 40 Wow it'll easily use sixty based on that oh you see city yeah let's try sixty car no [Music] I'd say sixties year maxed which could be a choke issue the thing we have just experimenting with or a variety of chokes to see what it would do jokin Utz that's the one I don't know if we got I do have an old Mad Max with me for that gun we could throw it in there and try it once this is the original Mad Max this constriction is a 655 okay that's we were taking Birds at 40 yards on film and literally lifting them up off their feet and setting them down at 40 yards because you're putting so much shot in the air and it all retains its shape so that downrange energy is unmatched well and it's hard to be excited about some things this day and age but long beard XR was one of the most exciting revelations that we've seen in a long time it's hard to leave a meeting as pumped up as we were but we could have ran through a brick wall that day because we were absolutely jacked about long beard XR they said they had a new shot shell and we were like yeah hold on we went over there and we left with our jaws hitting the table so you can find more out about it at Winchester comm or come over to jury outdoors calm and check out some of the turkeys we killed last spring with it amazing ammunition absolutely 80 yards never I've never thought in the Maine years of trying this one so it's a bonafide 70 to 75 you wouldn't want to try eating well the rains are about to pour down upon us here but we prepare for it with smiles because we just shot the best shooting a munition we've ever shot in our lives those are done Thor's at 60 yards number fours I think the choke size constriction has got everything to do with it so you can't just put it in your gun and say I'm gonna gain 40 yards 30 yards you got a really pattern it and find out which shot selection you might want to use we tried a 655 a 660 and a 665 restriction and everyone varied and we shot them all so make sure you spend some time on the range with this new ammunition it'll pay dividends but it did definitively gain 15 to 25 yards that we didn't have before so look at that pattern we know a few birds are gonna be in trouble this spring [Music]", "cl21Doe9xpk": "hey because there's this is mrs. vandeleur bringing you chapter 1 section 8 solving chemical problems this is otherwise known as factor labeling or maybe dimensional analysis this is a skill that will be helpful throughout the entire year and these initial problems may seem kind of simple to start with things that you probably did in your first year chemistry class but trust me it's going to get more complicated as we go on and if you know this skill it will really really help you and the whole idea is that you want your units to cancel out and how do we do that whatever units on top you put on the bottom whatever unit may be on the bottom you want to get rid of you put in you know and on the top and hopefully you know you had a lot of experience with this last year when we did moles and grams and and leaders and and a number of atoms and things like that and we will do that again but we'll do more with it in this in this following year so please make a concentrated effort to learn the skill because it will pay off big benefits in the long run okay so how do we do this to convert you want to multiply your quantity by a conversion factor that cancels the undesirable you don't want and put the desired unit in the numerator so consider a pen measuring two point 85 centimeters in length was is lengthen ish inches now I know you probably had a little bit different how to factor label I have always done it were a question mark unit that you're looking for that way you are focused you know exactly what unit you need to end up with if you don't you know tell yourself initially how you know what unit do I want you may get lost in the shuffle there so this is my focus I want to get up inches when I'm all set so I go question mark inches equals alright done you're given alright so what you want equals what you're given and notice you have centimeters here don't be lazy write down your units so centimeters are on top you're going to put centimeters on the bottom so they cancel out just like in a division problem nine over nine cancels out to one centimeters over centimeters cancels out to 100 so what the needed do you want you want inches the question is do you know relationship between inches and hopefully you all know that it's 2.54 centimeters equals that's what the about that bar is like you're in equals one inch okay so the centimeters cancels out leaving you only inches on top well hey that's what you want inches right here and so life is good and if it's in the denominator so two point eight five is to be divided by two point five four they get one point one two I said notice the given measurement determines the sig figs this is unlimited remember that undefined or I'm sorry I infinity if you will so there is no you don't use your sig figs here it's a definition you only use your sig figs here so I have three sig figs my answer is three sig figs all right so the next one is how many centimeters are in 12.5 inches all right so what are you looking for in this case you're looking for centimeters so I would go question mark centimeters equals here's my given 12.5 inches so what unit goes on the bottom inches what unit goes on the top centimeters why centimeters because that's what I'm looking for right here so my relationship is 2.54 centimeters equals that's what the division bar is equals one inch notice that the inches are going to cancel out here we go inches cancel out and what unit am I left with I'm left with centimeters that is what I'm looking for and so I'm ready to do the problem so now it's 12.5 times two point five four two point five four is on the top so you know times it any a thirty one point seven five centimeters that's what my calculator gives me so what would be my answer with correct sig figs we'll go back to this number again how many sig figs are in 12.5 you got three of them so we need to round this to three sig figs so we go one two three so I have to round up my answer is thirty one point eight centimeters okay so we're going to try some of these you probably want this read it carefully because it may help you later so proud number 27 convert yards and two centimeters folks this is more than a what I call one stepper you have to do a couple steps here so why don't you pause check it out when you're done all right so go ahead and pause you okay so let's see how you did so convert one point seven six yards to centimeters so put question marks centimeters and so I'm looking for equals my given now what unit doing that why I don't want yards so put it on the bottom now I know converting the ARDS and inches there's 36 inches in a yard that would get it to me maybe you actually used that because you knew there were 36 inches in the yard I'm not sure but I went up here and you see this right up here I actually used this where it says one meter is 1.09 four yards so here is that so my yards ends up cancelling out and then what well I have meters left on top do I want meters anymore no I don't I don't want meters I want centimeters so guess who I put meters on the bottom and I put centimeters on the top so what's the relationship between meters and centimeters it's not up here nor will it be got I know that which is a bigger unit a meter or a centimeter a meter is look it's the one and some tea means a hundred so now I'm ready to actually you know go through the problem all my units are working out great so now Smit are using my calculator so I get one point seven six this is in the denominator so you divided by 1.09 for this is on the top so on at times and this is what my calculator gives me now that's not the right answer is that you got to use your sig fig so how many sig figs are whoops right here I think it's three so I need to go one two three so does this eight mean I need to round up and so my answer is don't forget your units 161 centimeters okay so why don't you go ahead and do the next problem pause this all right so I don't know if you know your relationships with courts all right so we have a how many cubic centimeters our 1.8 courts courts Kalon the bottom I don't know anything about course I know there's you know couple quarts in a gallon but that doesn't help me so I go over here to the volume and that didn't help oh oh look at this alright that helps me so I have one liter as 1.05 7 quarts so I use that to come up with this relationship and then leaders had to go on the bottom because I don't want leaders again right so I cancel out here I can sell some courts cancel out some leaders and cubic centimeters are now on top which is what I want I saw that relationship over on that chart and so whoops sorry guys that works out this cube accelerators that I want and I'm ready to do my math so 1.8 the divided by 1.05 seven times a thousand this is what I get but how many sig figs are in 1.8 only two so now I need to count over two sig figs I have one two sig figs two sig figs and what happens then I need to stop here so it's not 17 it's just 1700 these zeros are not significant because I didn't you know that zeros are not going to be significant two sig figs I guess 1,700 cubic centimeters now what's the different about this next one I want you to change it for me the speed limiting hideaways is if I have miles per hour what would be the number posted and kilometers change that to minutes okay whenever you have a unit that is split into a numerator and invited like miles per hour all right I would write it out where it's not like a slash it's an actual fraction so kilometers over minutes is what you're looking for you're given miles per hour and what you're going to have to do is work with both the numerator and the denominator so what I did first is I went ahead and worked at the miles so I found miles and put miles on the bottom and if you looked at the top part up here do you know relationship between miles and kilometers and the answer is yeah right here so I dunno relationship between miles and kilometers so I put a point six to one for miles and the bottom consists for my unit was and one kilometers on top hey guess what isn't kilometres what I'm looking for for the top it is yeah sure so my numerator is all taken care of but what about my denominator all right what about my denominator well I need minutes on the bottom well what do I already have on the bottom of hours so I don't want hours anymore so I've to put hours on the top that's right so then you have minutes in the denominator and that's exactly what I want so life is good I'm ready to do my math so that's 55 divided by 0.6 to 1 4 divided by 60 again and this is what I get in my calculator how many sig figs are right here I think there's two so I go one two this is a seven so I need to round up to 1.5 kilometers per minute okay all right let's go the next page so what happens if you want to raise units to a power okay you'd have to raise both the number and the unit so if you want to convert inches to centimeters I know that 2.54 centimeters is one inch so I'm going to square both sides and when you square both sides you're square both the number and the unit okay you square both the number and the unit so 2.54 squared is six point four five cute r squared centimeters equals a 1 squared is still 1 1 squared centimeter all right so what are we gonna do here calculate displacement five point seven zero liter on engine there we go two cubic inches well how am I gonna do this well I'll help you out here five point seven two liters I put liters on the bottom and cubic centimeters on tops of my leaders cancels out so now I have cubic centimeters I don't want cubic centimeters I want cubic inches so I kind of wrote it out three times that forces me to divide by two point five four three times or in a sense cubing it I I'm going to teach you how very long I'm and people that just cube you know on the bottom will on occasion forget to cube the number so when I write it out three times I am not forgetting to do that so what happens this is a cube and the hair is to the first to the second and then to the third so I do cancel out these units and inch times n times inch is inches cubed all right so just that matter doing your math so five point seven now times a thousand divided by 2.5 4 divided by 2 point 5 4 divided by 2 point 5 4 and this is what I get here I do that math and again I have three sig figs and so I go one two three I have to round up so 348 inches cubed okay why don't you do this on your own pause and check your work you you alright welcome back let's see how we did so here we have meter squared and I want a cubic I'm sorry squared centimeters so one meter is a hundred centimeters again remember your units the bigger unit gets the smaller number the small unit gets the bigger number so one meter is a hundred centimeters but I did do that twice because this is squared so here's the first here's the second I want squared centimeters so centimeters to the first I'm sorry and centimeters squared so it works out so this is what I get now what what's wrong with this answer missus visa why you forget about sig figs well you're right so how could I fix this so I have one two three sig figs I have one two three sig figs so put a line over the zero that the first zero to give you three sig figs well how else could you have done this you could have used scientific notation and you said one point two zero times ten to the fifth and that would be also three sig figs but the line works just as well hey so what's going on here so we can go back to our our old buddy density again all right so the density of a diamond is grams per cubic centimeter if the vibe of a diamond is found to be two point eight milliliters what's the mass well masses grams isn't it so really you're doing questionmark grams all right you can do that and then here is my density and notice that cubic centimeters are on the bottom for the cubic centimeters on the top that's my volume isn't it so density times volume the cubic centimeters Pat cancels out leaving you grams and that is the unit of mass and so here is my work why don't you go ahead and do the next two problems pause this and see how you do well maybe they it took you a little bit maybe the letter C took you a little bit maybe you let her be didn't so it's just again a you know canceling things out you are maybe not familiar with what a carrot is but you can still factor label and so the carrots cancel out those you spelled that carrot not not like the vegetable and then grams goes on top I don't want grams I want cubic centimeters so once again I used my density I put mass on the bottom because that's what cancels out I'll put my volume on the top and so again with two sig figs this is what I get now look at letter C I can like letter C because what is the length well mrs. Van der Weide nothing in here gives me maiara meters all right what am I supposed to do well you do have volume and if it's a perfect square you know perfect cube if you will that's what I'm assuming when it's at a perfect square diamond there this is my volume of a point one one cubic centimeters well all I did is I took in a sense the cube root I couldn't really type cube root out very well so I made it to the one third same thing as saying the cube root so here the same thing as saying the cube root of this and I just you know took the kubera point 1 1 and I found point 4 8 centimeters so this um perfect two carat diamond that's a perfect cube is point four eight centimeters okay yeah I believe that's the end as always don't wait to be great bye", "9AMatvQNyrU": "[Music] welcome back one hot biters we are making something so much fun today we're gonna make a filo dough pizza so we're going to use phyllo dough sheets not the puff pastry so it's going to be layer on layer on layer on layer of crispiness in between each of those layers is going to be cheese we're going to use three different kinds of cheeses we're going to use feta cheese parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese so and some seasoning so we're going to throw that together we're going to layer it and we're going to top this with fresh basil green onions and fresh tomato so this is you can have it as an appetizer

just kind of pull it all together let's make our cheese filling first before we even get started you guys welcome here i love that you're all here thank you so much for watching and supporting me i really really appreciate it i feel like we've had a lot of fun here and uh please subscribe down below give me some likes give me some comments i love chatting with you all so let's get rolling [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so we have our cheese mixture all done we're going to set it aside and now we're going to work with those delicious thin gonna turn into the crunchiest little layers so let's get our phyllo dough out our filo dough sheets all thawed and they're in this little bag then we just have a cookie sheet and cooking spray and of course we've already made our our filling so now i'm going to show you how we're going to layer these beautifully so our oven is preheating at 375 degrees i am going to go ahead and lightly coat our baking sheet with cooking spray and then we're going to go ahead and get our sheets going okay so we're going to carefully unroll our sheets and they're super delicate okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna cut all these sheets in half okay let's bring our cookie sheet over so we're gonna take one little sheet on our and it's lightly coated with cooking spray coat each sheet with a little cooking spray here's number two number three okay here's where we're going to add two tablespoons of our cheese mixture [Music] just kind of spread it out as even as you can alright here we go again three more layers one spray two spray three geez we're gonna do this five times okay this is our fifth layer we're gonna do only two sheets this time one okay we're gonna spray our last layer another two tablespoons of cheese and we're gonna thinly slice our tomato [Music] we want to get rid of any moisture as much moisture as we can so we're going to put all of our tomatoes on a paper towel [Music] we're gonna pat it dry [Music] [Music] we need to add our remaining cheese on top like any other pizza and pop it in the oven for 20 minutes okay all out of the oven we are gonna go ahead and add some of our fresh basil on top and

in on thursday", "8R0u1pg7iQk": "okay welcome to this tutorial this tutorial is going to walk you through how to do inventor of her one through eight actually we're going to talk about one through eight so this is part 1 this is part 2 part 3 4 scroll off 5 6 7 & 8 alright so a little bit of background here i am recording this so obviously so you can see it okay but I am also what I'm doing is I'm gonna make it a little bit easier on you if I click with my little left which is the default by a left click on the mouse which is the default click which is my pointer finger it's gonna turn blue if I right click it's going to turn red so right is red right is red left it's blue it's gonna help you to understand what I'm doing and also as I hold down the mouse key if I hold it down for whatever reason I'm like right now I'm holding down the left key imma let you know what's going on okay so let's start off by doing parts one through four and what we're going to do is when I go through inventor real quick real easy and we're gonna make this the the fast way okay we did this the easy way so this right here is the front view everything that we see here all this is the front of you so we're gonna make this the fast way it's a little bit up inventor started we parse if I need to I can go up to here the big guy and open up a part that way now the monitor that I'm using is quite large it's actually a lot bigger than the one that you have so you may have to minimize this to make it easier for you to to work okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to basically just draw out these lines making sure that they're perfectly ninety degrees to one another as you can see they are 90 degrees I'm just going to make this the shape and then extrude it up alright let me show you so I want to click on the big I new standard IPT create start 2d sketch click on my front view click there okay I'm gonna grab my line tool and what I'm doing is I'm just gonna draw the shape so I'm going to click there and release I just put them release draw it off over if you notice how it says 90 degrees at the very bottom there at the bottom there so 90 90 90 and if I bring this up you know it's all kind of like lines up with the other one there there 90 degrees bring it down and notice how that turns green there knows that I want to click it and then want to snap them together bang okay so from here we're going to go back and look at our dimensions and we notice the bottom is 5 that's our dimension right there bottom is 5 and this one's too so let's go ahead and make our dimensions 5 and 2 so let's go over here click on dimension click bring it down click again that opens up our dimension type in 5 hit the 5 in the hit enter now you notice how it kind of vanished over here not a problem click on front and all of a sudden it makes it bigger for us and I'm still on my dimension tool so I'm gonna left click here click again to okay so now I've made the 5 and the 2 that's similar to this 5 and this 2 okay now I wanna dimension this line right here which is also 2 and then this line which is 1 which is this line here okay so I'm gonna do two and then one watch so I'm gonna do is I'm use the the ball on my mouse I'm just gonna pull pull it towards me okay this line right here should be one so let's click dimension okay just bring over to here click it again 1 enter notice how it also made this one one okay so we just did this one right here not this one's gonna be 2 which is this line right here click here click to enter perfect click on my front of you okay it's starting to take shape here it looks a little funky but we'll deal with that let's make this one right here which should be one inch so click here one enter okay and if I look the overall size is 5 okay this is 2 this is 1 so I know that this is 2 plus 1 equals 3 so this has to be 2 so if I click on this it's probably gonna give me an error it says hey listen you can't dimension this because it has to be 2 so let's click and see what it says look exactly what it's saying okay over constrain always hit cancel if you get this so we know that this is this is 2 it has to be okay and it's show me that it's too perfect cancel I go to finish sketch I'm gonna click on my little house over here now that I finished sketch everything is closed out I'm gonna click on extrude and right here or over here either one this box or this box down here I'm going to click on direction to and if I look back here I can see that it's extruded out three inches okay so I'm gonna make this one 3 inches as well click ok click on my home view and now I've just made a part one so I'm gonna go to the big eye now go to save as ok I'm gonna click on that document so I'm gonna go all the way down to the bottom where I see my name now your name's gonna look different it's gonna have your first initial your last initial and a bunch of numbers or it could have your first name dot last name okay but basically when I go to your xDrive and then you want to create a new folder here so create folder you should have 8 X 7 folder or if this is for DDP you should be in your DDP folder ok whatever it's for so make that so we're gonna make that mmm and then we're gonna put it into an inventor folder so let me just name this inventor so inventor I double click on that and this is part 1 I'm gonna save it as part 1 click Save I've just saved part 1 okay if I look down here at the bottom of the screen it even says part 1 now let's go ahead and let's make part 2 okay alright so we just finished part 1 let's move on to part 2 big I click new double click standard IP T star 2d sketch I'm gonna click on my front view click right here alright start with the line tool come on up how are we gonna bring this off we're gonna do this a little bit different okay we're gonna bring this one off and notice I didn't click anything yet bring it up straight okay I just had the line there straight click to and then enter alright and you notice it's still attached up here that's fine okay I'm going to bring this over doesn't make a difference how long right now click it okay I'm gonna bring this one down perfectly 90 degrees does not make a difference so long click it bring this one over it doesn't make a big deal how long click it I'm gonna bring this one down okay right to this line here click it and because there's no line here I have to make one so imma bring this right over and click so now I've just created a full shape okay I've just created a full shape how cool is that with only one dimension now let's click on my dimension tool and go back to my front view and I have two inches here so let's do the rest of this let's do five I know it supposed to be 5 ok let's click back over here how big is that top piece this piece right here is 2 so let's click here and go to click it again ok this piece right here how big is that supposed to be let's take a look one let's click one mmm that's one right there then this piece right here let's take a look is two so I just clicked to to enter and what happens is that automatically adjust this angle to fit the the correct size you finished sketch click on my little house extrude I'm gonna come over here and type in or click on direction to so it's going away from us change this from one to three hit enter click on my little house and we are good to go that's it that is part two very simple okay if you could do part one part two should be very simple as well now we're gonna work on part three in part four and for this one we have to work on three different I'm sorry two different planes so let's let's start and work a little bit slower for this so that's part number three let's work on that but before we leave it's got a file save as say this is part to save perfect good go to the big guy let's go to new standard IPT such the part file alright so we're gonna start 2d sketch we're gonna go to front click on the front view now we're gonna make a rectangle we're going to the old-fashioned style just make a rectangle so I clicked it there after clicking the rectangle notice the rectangles and blue over here okay I just clicked and I release the mouse so I'm gonna type in five hit the tab key and then hit two and then enter hit my front view and look there we go click on my home view so it gives me that nice asymmetrical look okay now what we have right here is we we have our basic shape okay if we look back here we have just a basic rectangle I know it's not all here but we just have a basic rectangle we'll have to do is if they go back to inventor and we're gonna finish our sketch and go to extrude click on Direction 2 and we're going three inches three enter click on our little home view so now we've got that rectangle the way we want it we've been working on our front view now for part number three what we're going to do is we're going to work on our side view so let's click over here the top right let's click over here click on our right view perfect and we're looking at it from the side okay we have one inch that goes up we have two inches that go over and then we have an angle that comes down here that we don't really know what that angle is okay so let's do this the easiest way we can so we're on our right side already okay you changed it over see I'm on my right side perfect start 2d sketch click on this plane so it knows where I want to work I just scrolled the mouse and an ounce of it so it helps me click on my line tool I'm gonna start at the top left corner and I'm gonna make a line and there's my line there bring it down perfectly 90 degrees type in 1 hit enter awesome I'm going to right click then click OK left click OK now I'm gonna click on my line tool again ok and I'm gonna click the same spot that I started that before but I'm gonna come over right along this line to get to cool and notice how it's still attached I'm going to then come on down here and click and I have not created a triangle one inch by two inch and if you look that's the size here one inch down from the top two inch back from the top the top left mmm okay now what I'm going to do is I'm still on this sketch I haven't closed the sketch out I'm stalling my line tool I watch what I do I'm gonna start over here click on the top right corner come over to this corner click click again see I have a line click click again see I have a line I'm gonna click to each corner what I'm doing is and that's that line is still attached there click what I did was I just basically created a box around the whole shape okay using the existing lines the reason being is if you notice over here I'm on sketch - it doesn't know the difference between sketch 1 and sketch 2 so I have to tell it so I basically made a boxed just to tell the computer hey listen I'm gonna you know I want you to extrude something for me but this is the shape I want you to extrude it out of which in this case is a box now I'm going to click on my little home view ok and I'm gonna do finish sketch so I finished sketch and I've got my little rectangle sitting right there that we worked on okay I wanted to extrude and as I do extrude it's nothing selected yet okay I had to tell it what I want to select so I'm going to select the top area okay and if I look down over here I notice this top area is selected this triangle here okay that's the part I selected and I want to bring it back I'm gonna bring it back three inches okay bring it back three inches so notice it's going in the wrong direction let's select direction - so it's actually taking it away click OK and there we go that's it that's part three file save as so can be saved as part three click say clicked on her and we are good to go alright so let's move on to par for the big I click new double click standard IPT nope sorry about that this part 4 part 4 is interesting let's take a look at part 4 oh boy it's got a slant on the fronds it's gonna things got that okay so let's let's make this easy on ourselves let's go to start TD sketch click on our front view click again and it's gonna move stuff okay light start my line right here I'm gonna come over and I'm gonna make this fun 5 and I'm just going to scroll the mouse back and forth basically the wheel okay until I can see what I'm working on I put the mouse where I want it to scroll into okay so I put it right there and I just scroll alright so now I want to bring this this up I wanna bring this over perfectly ninety degrees okay and then I want to bring it over to here down to down to there click okay so all I did was I made a line in another one ninety one ninety then I just made come like a slant all right you're gonna say mister see that's not the right size it doesn't look anything like the other one I know we'll work with it so click on right now we're on our line tool click on your dimension tool that's five let's click here this and we're gonna make this - it's supposed to be - all right let's click on my front view all right it's starting to come together a little bit now here's the thing this is five but the top we don't know the size let's go back and look at it the bottom is 5 we see right here it's 5 we know we went up - that's right there oh let's how big the top is it's 4 okay so install my dimension tool let's click here bring it up click again and let's do 4 notice that when I do this it automatically gives me this angle I don't have to figure it out I don't have to do any math it gives me the angle right away so let's do finish sketch sketch is now finished let's click on my little home view perfect let's go to extrude I click on extrude we have to go in Direction 2 we know we have to go 3 inches and I'm gonna hit enter and there you go you have the basic shape of part number 4 but wait a minute we are missing a chunk out of the back of it here I'm sorry out of the right side we're missing a piece out of it so how do we do that well let's take a look it is one inch over it goes all the way up it's one inch by two inch okay it's let's let's do this together so click on my right side over here on the top I'm clicking my right side and I'm gonna go start 2d sketch and I click on that I am now in sketch mode first thing we're gonna do grab my line tool start at the top left you notice how it turns green click click click now in the last shape I did this afterwards right now I'm just doing it in the beginning it doesn't make a difference it's all the same turns green and I click so now I've just boxed in this entire shape and you notice that I still have my line tool attached okay and this is why so I'm going to come over bring my line tool still attached right along the top I'm gonna one-click order bring this down 90 degrees click OK click here again I'm gonna bring this over 1 hit enter I bring it up perfectly 90 degrees okay perfectly 90 degrees click again you notice I have three separate sections here 1 2 3 okay let's do finish sketch let's click on my home view now let's extrude again we have to tell the computer which one of these sections we want to extrude ok you have to carefully select the one that you want to work with oops I made a mistake I click there on one that's ok click cancel go back and click extrude so whatever one I want to work on I have to be very careful just to highlight that area okay thanks sometimes it takes a second okay it turns dark and soon as it turns dark we know that's the area we want we want to highlight we want to click this is just part of the program it does this unfortunately just have to get used to it a lot of times if you zoom in sometimes it helps or even if you change the angle and sometimes it actually does help as well I just changed for I'm coming from okay okay finally got it it is that tricky to get the right one so if you're having trouble with it just keep working on it okay so I I've got the part selected that I want let me just take a look how far back do I want to go I want to go back two inches so I come back here I select two but I'm still going the wrong way so let's do direction too and then I click OK it's like I'm a little home view and now I've got the shape I'm gonna go file save as this is part 4 click Save okay this is the first four parts they should be relatively easy the next four parts 5 through 8 are a little more complicated okay and let's start on part number 5 got a new part okay let's take a look at the basic shape of part five okay so I kind of have an idea here what I need to do let's do start 2d sketch and let's do the standard rectangle so I did start 2d sketch I clicked on my front view clicked on my front plane clicked on my rectangle clicked here okay and I'm gonna do five notice how the blue area is highlighted right now five I'm gonna hit the tab key and then do to click on my little house okay now I have that rectangle I'm gonna click finish sketch click extrude I want to extrude in direction to I want to extrude three inches and click enter I'm a little home view so I can see everything that I'm working on now just like I've done on my on part three I'm the same thing here on part five before I go any further let's do file save as and change this to part five hit enter perfect I'm gonna work on the right side view so I'm gonna click start 2d sketch and I'm just gonna click that view okay I'm just gonna get it to where I want it perfect now this one's a little tricky because you have angles here that aren't given to you they don't tell you the exact length they don't tell you much of anything really so let's work with what we do know this one point five we know that the peak of this is directly in the center of this three inch box so let's use that to our advantage watch what we do line tool I start at the bottom left what do I do I'm gonna box it in like a heaven box on everything else and box it in you notice how it changes color it goes right to green when it gets to that corner sometimes it'll go to yellow that's fine all right so now I have a box around the entire thing notice I'm still in sketch - I haven't done anything else okay it's so my line tool what I'm gonna do click the bottom left corner I'm going to come over 1.5 I typed in 1.5 then I hit enter that is directly in the center of this three inch box now I just bring the line straight up notice how it turns green there when it gets to the top notice how it says two inches which is perfect before it should be and you notice where it says 90 degrees it's exactly what it should be as well snob just divided this box into two separate but equal sections here okay they're separate this is 1 point 5 by 2 this is 1 point 5 by 2 they're separated okay but they're both equal in size now let's take a look over here if I notice I have a line that comes down from that point all the way down to the far back side which in our case that we're looking at it is the right side but on this side I've got a line that comes up 1 inch and then it slants over to the middle so let's worry about the let's do this all in one shot okay and let's start by going to the bottom left-hand corner so we're gonna start down here I still have my line tool selected make sure you still have that selected I'm gonna click here and I'm gonna come up how far was that do you remember should we take a look one inch bring it up put my line right on top of that line type in 1 hit enter okay notice it's directly in the center and it's still attached I'm gonna bring this right over here click but click this again my line tool right over here click click on my little house alright now I'm gonna do finish sketch and you can see the the lines that I just made her right there click extrude now does it know what you would you want to extrude so you have to tell it already I'm gonna hold down the ctrl key click this one and I'm gonna highlight just this area oh no I made a mistake it's okay remember hit cancel do it again extrude I want to highlight just this area here hold on ki home pulling down the control key click with zoom in a little bit and I want to highlight just that area there okay so I basically just highlighted both those areas that I want to want to extrude okay I'm just moving the view around so you can see different different sides of it okay I want to go direction too but I want to do the whole distance so this is just one inch I know that it's five inches altogether so I'm gonna do five hit enter I have now made part five if by any chance holding down ctrl and clicking them doesn't work for you just do them separately if I go back I could always do it this way click extrude highlight the area that you want to extrude okay if it does that again that's just a mistake just highlight the area that you want to extrude make sure it turns light and color not dark okay again it can be tricky sometimes to work with so that's my I'll just start with that one that's five I'll go direction to click okay and the reason why I want to show you this is because all of a sudden you notice those lines that were there before are no longer visible this happens a lot when you're working with inventor don't panic don't raise your hand be like oh I don't know what happened I'm about to tell you over here on the left hand side where it says extrusion to an extrusion one these are what I've just done these are the extrusions that I've just made I'm going to click this extrusion to okay and sketch - as we're just working notice fight if I roll over if you look back at the piece you notice how those white lines come on back we wanted to be back there we want to make them visible right now they are invisible so I'm going to right-click sketch - and then left-click visibility and if you look back all of a sudden there they are they're back again so now I can go back into extrusion and I can play around with this a little bit more again you may have to change your angles I a lot of times I tell students just change the angle maybe that'll help you out a little bit you want to get it so that it's light-colored and Oh got it okay okay take some time so be patient with it all right do direction to click okay now a lot of times you'll be you'll have your sketches your sketches will be left on that's okay but we want to turn them off the same way we turn them on it's the same way we're going to turn them off you're going to right-click on that sketch so it for this in this case it's sketch to right-click and then unclick visibility click on my little house and there we go we have just made part five how cool is that we've already saved this but let's just click the Save button again just to make sure we save it it's this little disc right here okay it says save so you can just click that and you can save it now let's work on part six so new part click on that it's gonna open it up for us let's go to the big eye again that's what a save as and let's make this into part six click on her now we're at part six we just saved it let's do starts 2d sketch and now we've got our planes in front of us and let's let's take a look at part six okay part six looks a lot like part three okay so if remember who did part three the same we're going to do part six alright so this is part six let's take a look here we're gonna do a five by two rectangle and then extrude it out by three inches so let's start by doing that here's my front view front rectangle start down here at the center bring it up type in five I hit my tab key I then hit two and now I hit enter from here I'm gonna click on my little house I'm gonna do finish sketch I'm gonna do extrude and I'm gonna go direction too and I'm gonna go three inches beside of the highlight of that I deleted it three click on my little boom okay so we have the standard 5 by 2 by 3 I just want to stop you here if you ever are not sure the size of something if you're not sure what size it is that you made it click on the inspect tab at the top here and click on distance ok click on distance and what you can do is you can just click on lines and I'm sorry you click on points it will tell you from point to point how big that line is okay so if I click on this it tells me it's 2 if I click this point to this point it tells me that it's 5 ok if I click this point to this point tells me that it's 3 it's exactly what it should be ok a 5 by 2 by 3 rectangle ok so getting back into 3d mode here we want to start a 2d sketch on our right side now I can either click here or I can click here does not make a difference ok so I click there then I clicked here alright so now I am on the right side view and let's take a look at what I need to make okay so I have to make this this weird-looking thing here so what's make this easy on ourselves let's make a line that goes up 1 a line that goes over 1.5 and then another line that comes up and we don't know the distance to that but we do know that it goes to the top right ok so let's just work on that so let's make a line that's one line at 1.5 another line that's over to the right so watch again we're on the right view ok we're on the right side view so I start at the bottom left click I got my little line tool here okay comes up and we're gonna go1 hit enter I'm still attached my line is still attached I want to come over 1.5 now before I hit enter do you notice it says 90 degrees at the bottom there you notice I am 1.5 I'm ready to go enter okay everything's good now I want to now take this line that is still attached and click it over to here perfect do you notice how my line tool is still attached now let's say for instance that your line tool goes away I just smooth mine go away you can always just click line again and as long as you're in the same sketch which I haven't finished sketch or anything I haven't done that long doing the same sketch you can just keep on working okay so I'm gonna click back over here and I'm gonna make that that piece that goes around the outside okay the the frame that was around the outside okay so now I have finished sketching now I have all my lines all the way around it no do you notice how it looks do you notice how everything looks looks purple or blue depending on what series of what version you're running with okay I have I click on my house view I've got like that really weird shape in lying out okay now I have one up one I went over 1.5 now here's the question how far do I bring it back from here to here how far do I bring that back it's a little interesting because there really isn't a measurement for it okay I'm gonna do a little bit of math here alright the overall is 5 this piece right here is 2 so 2 minus 5 is 3 so I know that this line from here from here to here is 30 so that's gonna tell us our extrusion distance so let's click on extrude and I want to extrude just this oops I made a mistake click cancel extrude again okay so now I have just that part selected the part that I want okay and I'm just gonna show you some different angles here a little a little show for you alright so click on my home view I add the part that I want to work with it happens to just be three which is perfect so I want if not just type in three and then I do direction to click okay boom I had exactly what I want alright my home view look at that I have now made part six click the little Save and fills you that why don't know what that icon is it's actually called a floppy disk we don't use those anymore believe it or not when I was a teacher that's why I'm sorry when I was a student we save everything on floppy disks and well you don't see them anymore because the month they won't even hold a song that's how a little of space they have but that's but that's what that is called a floppy disk alright so you click on the Save icon and we've saved part 6 talk to the big guy let's go to new standard IPT again going to the big guy and clicking on new or clicking or just hovering over new and having it go to the parts thing it's it's the same thing a standard IPT in a part file is the same exact thing if you notice look down here at the bottom you notice how these have part one has part one dot i PT part two dot i PT ok this tells us that these are all in better parts ok that's what these odds so these are in better parts so we know that they're a part that we've made and they're not like an assembly or a drawing or anything else like that ok so I've just opened up a new a new part file unfortunately it's saying it's part 9 so let's crack that let's go to the big eye that's what a save as and this is actually part 7% save okay all right I'll start 2d sketch click on the front view click the front plane the correct angle click five to [Music] okay go to finish sketch extrude direction to change this to three perfect now what I want to do is I want to go to start 2d sketch I want to click on the right side and what I want to do is I'm gonna grab my line tool click here click every corner here makes a nice box around what we need all right hmm let's start part number seven new standard IPT starts sketch let's go to front click rectangle start down here five tab to enter click I'm a little house finish sketch extrude I want to extrude three inches in direction to perfect click on my little house click on start 2d sketch again I'm gonna go to the right side I'm gonna grab my line tool and I want to go click on the bottom left corner click the top left corner Whittle turns green click with turns green click and green click perfect I have now made a box around the the right side of it now why did I pick the right side because if you look at part 7 I made the overall box but on the right side I want to extrude out the letter L so I want to just get this this L shape going for me so I'm gonna go from the bottom left corner go up 1 over 2 go up 1 and over 1 okay ready sorry I saw on the right side okay I'm on the right side I'm just gonna show you this ok I'm strolling sketch mode so I've got my line tool go up on enter go over to make sure I'm perfectly 90 degrees to enter go up 1 make sure I'm perfectly 90 and go over here BAM right click OK click I'm a little house want to finish my sketch extrude extrude just the just the top part here so I can get just that highlighted sometimes it does take a second okay maybe was gonna zoom in a little bit okay so I've clicked on just that top portion if I look around you can see it's just the area that I want I want to go in direction to but I want to go five inches okay now my house view now I want to work on this front and create that whole that belongs there if I look here there's like just this gap in the middle okay those are two inch by one inch rectangles at the front here so let's start by making those and then just extrude out the middle so start 2d sketch and I'm gonna click just on this area okay just in this area click on front watch one do the same thing I have been doing grab my line tool click here click here click here here here okay and what I did was if I look at my side view okay I pretty much just outlined that whole front area they are then going to be working on now with my lights will stoically connected I'm sorry right with my line tool click here I'm gonna come over to I just put it right there over to enter I'm gonna come up to that line which should be one which it is perfect then I'm gonna come over here click perfectly 90 or in this case 180 either one it's fine click to enter okay and then finish sketch now I have three boxes to buy one a 2 by 1 and then a one by one right in the middle there I'm gonna do extrude I'm gonna select the center area okay if you accidentally select the whole thing it's okay just gonna cancel click extrude and we just want the area that you want to be highlighted mmm I want to go in directions to and I want to go 3 hit 3 plus 3 then enter and if you notice I've just created part number seven okay let's make sure we save this file save as part 7 okay and we are good with part number 7 check that out now let's do part number 8 let's take a look at part 8 part 8 is a weird one ok let's take this one step at a time okay so we're gonna start by making our 5 by 2 by 3 standard block okay so let's go to file file new double click standard IPT start 2d sketch I'm gonna click run click on the front like rectangle click the center there 5 tab to enter click I'm a little house finish 2d sketch extrude I'm gonna straight out 3 click on my little house ok now we can begin to do a little bit of work on the the area here that we're never trying to extrude which is going to be part of part eight so let's go ahead and just save this real quick save as part bates typed in part eight there you go so we save party let's work on the front view which is this view right here we got this line that comes down straight it comes over one then it comes up at an angle and then it goes over to oh boy okay let's relax here let's figure this out let's do this let's do start to e sketch we're gonna click on this area now I know this is already part of sketch one but we've read even work on sketch one so we're going to add another sketch on top a sketch one named sketch two and it's just gonna work out a little bit better for us we're gonna do is I'm gonna grab my line tool and I'm just going to highlight all the corners so I started at the top left come down here green clicked Green clicks turns green I'm gonna click click I'm just basically making a rectangle around the rectangle now what I want to do is I want to make that weird-looking shape that was there and I want to strip out the area that I don't need okay so the top line I'm gonna make here is gonna be to the bottom line is going to be one and then we're gonna connect them okay I still on my line tool so I'm gonna click here I'm gonna bring this over to enter I don't I don't know where this line is gonna go yet I don't know how far over one inches so I'm just going to right click and then click OK click back on my line tool now I'm gonna click on the bottom left-hand corner and I'll make this one click it and then I'm gonna come back up to where that two inch lines stop you notice it turns green and I'm gonna click that now I'm gonna do finish sketch okay and I clicked on my home view now what I want to do is I want to extrude the area that I don't want I want extrude and get rid of that okay so let's take a look here how far back this does this extrusion go from here to here how far back won't we look the whole thing is 3 we know that okay there's this little indentation here is one this piece over here is one so this has to be just a one-inch which means that this whole area here has to be extruded back 1 inch okay so extrude I like the area that we want okay which is this area here now we're do directions 2 and 1 inches are selected for us right here okay so I click OK now we just made that odd little shape on the side there okay if you see how this looks similar to this over here really cool alright now I want to do is we want to make it this indentation that you see in the back shouldn't be that hard okay and here's why we're gonna do start TD sketch we're gonna click on that area that we want to work on okay what I want you to understand is you need to ignore the shaded area here when you're looking at the square here because we're not working on that plane anymore we're just working on this shaded area so watch what I'm going to do and be careful to do it like this I'm gonna start at the top right corner bring it down I clicked and I'm gonna bring it down clicked remember every time I click left click it turns blue or to a ring break like a turn red okay I'm gonna click right here ok which is the edge of this box now here's the thing the computer might not recognize the edge of the box so you might have to tell it hey listen I want to go to the edge of this box so if you notice I just turn my view there click that much for my view back click that and then right here them to click that Wow if you notice I just made a box around this entire box right there now what I want to do is I want to create that one-inch piece that goes that's gonna be extruded back on that on that far side so I know what's gonna be extruded back or it's gonna be one inch but how far is it gonna go back good question all right so let's just worry about making the 1 inch box and then we'll do the rest in a minute let's start here at the top right I'm gonna come I have a line I line tool selected I'm gonna come over one enter gonna come down perfectly 90 degrees make sure you're always doing any degrees here to select yep now click on my little house do finish sketch and now I want to extrude back this piece so I'm gonna get that selected now I want to shoot in direction too but I don't know how far to bring it back let's take a look here I want extrude am i shooting this area right here okay if I look the whole thing is 5 what I have a left over is 3 which means that this piece has to be 2 so I've already got this here I'm ready going in the correct direction direction to which is also 2 inches put it in a 2 hit enter I have now just created card eight click Save and I wrap it up I have cards on parts two are three parts for parts 5 part 6 part 7 part 8 ok that is all 8 shapes when you are done make sure that you hit save and that is the completed tutorial for parts 1 to 8 with inventor thanks for watching", "fzFHAzX-_ww": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] you", "tQ9XaIu6MXE": "hello there it's sarah from paper lovely thanks for joining me today i am back with part two of my 10 cards one kit using the simon says stamp march 2021 card kit so we are gonna go ahead here and jump right into card number six if you missed the first five cards you can check those out in the video that i posted yesterday i am working here on a panel trimmed out from mft's black licorice card stock this measures three and three quarters by nine inches just grabbing my ruler here and my pencil and creating some plumb lines for the centers of this panel i have grabbed three of the cut aparts and trimmed those out i really loved the patterned paper that was included in this and it came with a bunch of cut aparts i enjoyed working with those with this kit so i have chosen three of those that i like there and then i had some of the sort of rip strips from the top of the papers that i had saved i always save every bit of paper because you never know what you can use um so i've got a light medium and dark tone there and i thought i would add these in a gradation going in between the three panels now i did need one additional color there so i picked out another pink sort of going in that same gradation from light to dark that one has a slight pattern to it and i've just trimmed that down to the same size these measure about a half an inch wide like i said the other three are that top portion the rip strip from the pattern paper so i just took that other pink pattern cut that out to a half an inch and then they all measure roughly two and three quarter inches so i'm going to pop this first panel up here right in the center and then i have all of this laid out i'm going to add some art glitter glue to the back here i'm just going to slide that underneath so i can get a nice consistent flow from the colors and the panels with no break in between there and then while i'm doing that i'll go ahead and add the one underneath as well not being super careful i didn't measure this out i just sort of eyeballed it and made sure i had about the same amount i'm peeking out on the top and the bottom of that i'll continue on here by adding my top panel and that lightest strip right above that and then my bottom panel again just doing my best to create an even look there and finally i'll add that darkest pink at the bottom there i'll go ahead and erase those pencil lines that are left and then for the inside i have a neenah panel trimmed to the same size three and three quarters by nine inches i'm going to stamp out the sentiment spring is coming i have created a card base using some mft snow cone card stock that measures four by nine and a quarter i had a little extra piece of that from when i trimmed down my card so i'm going to add some scor tape behind that and just create a little line under my sentiment there to give my inside panel a little bit more interest i'll place that down and trim off the excess i'll add some atg to the back of my top panel and pop that on my card base and again add some atg to my inside panel and place that down as well and that will complete card number six here for card number two i'm going to do a little bit of water coloring so i have pulled out this simon says stamp a watercolor paper that was included i'm going to stand out stamp out this curved window and i'll stamp that a few times this is a textured water paper so i want to make sure that i'm going to get a nice crisp image i will then go ahead and fussy cut that out i left out the coloring it was really straightforward i really love the look of something stamped and partially colored so i actually left the window and box and everything just that black and white and then added a little pop of color using the markers the distress markers that had been included in the kit that green the sort of orangey yellow and the pink now i have trimmed out a panel from this windowpane pattern paper that measures four by five and a quarter i wanted to soften that a bit so i also pulled out this vellum and i trimmed that slightly smaller at three and three quarters by five inches i'm going to layer that it'll soften the back and that'll help the window that i have cut out here just to stand out a little bit better this pink checkerboard i'm gonna trim down to an inch and a half wide and i'm just making sure that everything is going to look the way that i would like it to next i'm going to stamp out my sentiment you'll see i'm pulling out those rip strips there i decided to go with the lightest pale pink i'm going to stamp out the sentiment hello friend for the inside of my card i'm gonna stamp out the sentiment i hold you in my heart and thoughts i'm not sure where i got this card base from um it was green on the outside and white on the inside it must have come in a card kit at some point but i have no idea where i got it i'm gonna add a little flagged edge there to my sentiment and then again just layering everything up to make sure that i've got it where i would like it to be so i have popped up my window here with some pop dots i went ahead and layered everything down on the top of my card base using some atg lost a little bit of that footage i'm not sure quite what happened there and then i'll add that leftover piece i trimmed off of that pink checkerboard along the inside just for a little bit of extra interest and that will complete card number seven card number eight is fairly simple i really fell in love with this patterned paper wanted to use it again i used it in one of the cards on the first set of five and this is the leftover piece so i ended up layering these together i left about a quarter of an inch top and bottom and i wasn't worried about that piece in the middle because i knew i was going to cover that up with my seed strip here so the measurements finally ended up being a one inch which is the pink three quarters of an inch which is the strip from the seed packet paper and then two inches which is that pretty sort of turquoise blue up at the top i'm just layering all of these i will trim off that excess there to make sure that i can get this smaller seed strip straight across there that we can use the measurements on my grid i was really working with leftovers at this point trimming off that excess there and then i have gone ahead again and layered this beautiful sentiment together three times i did also pull in the green checkered pattern paper and i cut out the shadow that goes along with this doesn't that look so pretty i just love the way that helps this stand out makes it easy to read just a really beautiful to add both of those together again i'll add my dots there just to complete my sentiment my card base as well as the beautiful sentiment have been cut out from mft's jelly bean green and once i have that ready i'm going to lay that out on the top of my card base i did pull in another one of these tim holtz sentiment stickers and i decided to go with happy day just gonna use my little tool there to hold that make sure i get it nice and straight and then i'll add some more art glitter glue behind my cutout there and place that right on top for the inside i'm going to use another one of these stickers grabbing my ruler to make sure i can get that nice and straight and i decided to go with shine brightly for the inside always wanting to add a little bit more i used that same checkered pattern paper from my shadow i'm going to trim off about a quarter of an inch of that add some scor tape behind and i'll run that along the bottom of the inside of my card and that will complete card number eight for card number nine i am going back to my copic coloring here i'm gonna do this window that sort of has the cabiny feel to it i'm going to layer on some pretty greens for my shutters and i am using yg41 and yg45 for that i'll then use the same colors that i used for that circular window for the box i'm using e15 and e18 for the actual glass of the windows i'm using bg 10 and then for my flowers i'm going to fill those in with yg25 yg45 r43 r35 rv66 and y35 and again i will have all of those linked for you on my blog post i have gone ahead and fussy cut that out and i've grabbed a little bit of twine from my stash here i believe this is mink twine from close to my heart if that's still available um i will link it for you this is leftover from a kit from several months ago and i'm not sure if it's still available this is actually the last little bit of it that i had in my stash so i'm just going to go ahead add some atg to the back there to hold that in place and then i'll tie that in a little bow i have once again used that beautiful cut out sentiment this time i've trimmed that out using paper tray ink plumb pudding really pretty purple i thought that went beautifully with the green of those shutters i'm going to pop up my window again using some foam dots and i'm working here on a neenah card base just laying everything out i'm going to glue down half of this die cut to my window just to get that in place and then once again i'm gonna go back to that foam tape that i had trimmed out and actually cut down to about a sixteenth of an inch wide i really wanted to have this popped up and keep that nice and even with the window so i will meticulously go through here and add that at the thicker portions i did actually do a double layer of that to make sure everything was nice and even here i'm peeling away all the backing and then i'm going to pop that down on my card base so for my full sentiment i want it to read thinking of you beautiful and i will again go back to those tim holtz phrases i'm gonna pull off one of those stickers that says thinking of you oh first i gotta add the um the dot from my eye there just layering those on top making sure that's nice and thick and everything looks even and now i'll pull in that sticker um so again because i'm placing this sort of half on half off that window i will need to add a little bit of foam tape there just to keep everything nice and even and i'll pop that down in place for the inside again grabbing one of those tim holt stickers and this time i will go with sending love again using my ruler just to make sure i get that there nice and straight and that will complete card number nine for card number 10 i decided to go back to my copics and i this was a labor intensive card it took quite a while i have sped things up here there you'll see i've stamped out this window on some masking paper i'm going to do three of these windows in a row and then i wanted to create the look of bricks behind them so i needed something to cover over that when i stamped the bricks so because i wanted to make this one layer i didn't want to have to fussy cut out a bunch of everything so this is going to be a one layer card but giving it a little bit of dimension with the bricks behind the windows so i am measuring out the center of my panel this is a neenah solar white trimmed to three and three quarters by nine inches i'm going to find my center and i will stamp out the center window and then i will measure out to keep everything nice and even and add another window on either side of that here i'm stamping out that first one i do skip ahead a bit here as i said this this took quite a bit of time it was a bit tedious getting everything lined up because i wanted those windows all you know exactly layered and placed right next to one another there all three of them are stamped i'm going to place down my mask on the center window i trimmed that out for everything except those little flowers that peek out on the side i just carefully placed my brick so that they would not be covering those and then i've laid out my brick stamps here you'll see i'm going to stamp those down for that i wanted a bit of a lighter color so i went with lawn fawn hippo ink and there you'll see i peel away that mask and it looks like the bricks are behind the window i'm going to do that same thing just filling in with bricks here and there on the other two at the side and i do make sure to have some that are sort of going off the top as well as off the bottom of my panel just to give this sort of a continuous look make it look as though there is building above and below those windows skipping ahead again i have gone ahead and colored these exactly the same as i did the one in my first video so used all the same colors did all the same techniques if you want to go back and watch that again it is the video that i posted yesterday popping this large panel up here using some of my foam tape and i have created a card base using mft's steel gray the card base measures four by nine and a quarter center that down right on top there and i'm going to pull in then one of the circle sentiments that i had previously stamped and cut outs the one that reads love you so just deciding where i want to place that i am going to add one more layer here adding some pop dots and i'll place that down there on the center window for the inside i've got another neenah panel this is again trimmed to three and three quarters by nine inches i'm going to stamp out the sentiment dreaming of the day when i see you again using my simon says stamp intense black ink and then i have a little leftover piece of that snow cone cardstock measures about a quarter of an inch i'm going to add some scor tape behind that and i'll place that along the bottom portion of my panel i'll add some atg to the back place that on the inside of my card base and that will complete card number 10. here are a few close-ups of the finished cards you'll find additional photos as well as links to the supplies i used in my blog post listed below if you enjoyed the video please leave me a comment or a thumbs up and subscribe for more thanks again for watching and i'll see you in the

the story so at that time we had the newspaper right it wasn't you know the online pictures and he wrote in his ad partial vegetarian liked walks on the C&O Canal and what was the other thing Oh loved theater so we've been married 12 years now we've taken four walks on the C&O Canal we've been to the theater maybe four times and he eats sausage and bacon I love him to death and he would die if he knew I was telling that story online various well my just we won't get into the real date it's not going to be centered on dating don't worry you guys but I went on some classified ad dates when I was getting started after my divorce getting back onto the dating scene because the the internet was just barely picking up and people we're very squeamish about it yes selected some of those classified dates tickle anyway um I i want to start suan by talking about your story we those of us who were in playing big have really got a great connection around how how powerful stories are and how important our own stories are for playing big in the world right for sharing our important messages that we have to shape their and bringing our value into the world because stories are really how how we connect and it's how we learn most effectively is through stories and your story Sue Ann is so inspiring so I want to ask you first to tell me about a little bit more about what you do as a food-based healer and how you got here hmm I was a teacher for 30 years so this is my second career about maybe three or four years before I was of retirement age I got sick I had i think i was in completed renal failure i was diagnosed with osteoporosis and i was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroid disorder and I remember thinking at the time you know how can someone as healthy as we exercise not taught aerobics for I don't know at that point of mice must have been like 23 years like how can i end up with crumbling bones and who's hashimoto and what is he doing in my body and of course both doctors wanted to prescribe for me a pharmaceutical you know that would be a lifelong drug and I didn't even take advil at the time so I began my own study you know I just began a study tenacious study of cellular rejuvenation and my vehicle at that time was through raw food nutrition and so I became convinced that that I healed because of the work that I did and then I decided that of course i had to tell the whole world about that because that's what we do and something were successful at some things we want to share it right so I went back to school to study nutrition and then I went back to school again to study culinary arts and I combined those two skill sets and became a culinary nutritionist but now I call myself a nourishment counselor but it wasn't very long into this this new path that I discovered that I still had a lot of my own food story to unravel and i discovered that um sitting across from a client one day and she was in the raw food community and she had called me to say that she needed my help and I said what's what's up with you and she said that she was binging and so she came in and that was the time when I was actually seeing clients face to face now I see 99% of my clients online she was sitting across from me and she's sitting on this couch this little wisp of a woman I mean tiny and she was obviously very distraught and very contracted and very tiny and I said to her you know what are you binging on and she said salmon and sweet potatoes I was expected to hear like hot fudge sundaes and peanut butter with a spoon at midnight and when she said salmon and sweet potatoes you know it just gave me pause and I said okay and in my mind I'm thinking like how do you been John sweet potatoes because the last time I had made a sweet potato it took at least 45 minutes to bake that and I was just trying to really wrap my brain around the idea of a binge on to foods that even though I was you know a high raw advocate I did not feel we're bad boots at all in fact you know salmon is a really healthy food as long as it's not farm raised so what came out of this conversation was that she was trying to adhere to a very very rigid raw vegan diet low fat raw vegan diet and and her body was clearly clearly calling for something different and so my question to her was you know can you go there can you honor your body and check it out can you give yourself permission to eat a piece of salmon and not call it a binge can you give yourself permission to eat a sweet potato that's baked and not call it a binge and it turned out that she was really worried it really worried frightened that if she allowed herself those indulgences she would die of cancer and when we unraveled that story a little bit more it turned out that her mother had died of cancer and she was convinced that she was on the same path and she wasn't willing that was my one unsuccess story she wasn't willing to go there she wasn't willing to let go of the rules that she had in her head around nourishment and at that time I was back in school once again only this time I was studying the psychology of doudoune out in Colorado and I came face to face with my own food rules because when I looked at her across from me I realized that that much of my story around was still very rigid not that rigid but still very rigid even though at that time I wasn't following the hundred percent raw food diet i was still it's not a lot of food rules and one of my colleagues challenged me of that when i shared this story and so i did a complete you know rehal of my own my own food story and really started examining what I had been doing and in school and in my work and that was like providing legitimacy to my own food rules like I'm going to teach this now right I'm going to convince you that it's the right way because it was the right way for mood and so my work since that point has shifted into nourishment and really unraveling the food story so that when we are choosing the foods that nourish us they truly nourish us at every level and it's not just because in our heads we believe that certain foods are bad or we believe the latest guru or the latest diet or nutritional system that is bueller you know in the sign of the times so that's kind of a story of how i got from there to here the chocolate story is a whole nother chapter so maybe we'll stay save that for the end right well I that's so interesting to me especially since my own relationship with food and in my body and body image and everything was so tied up in rules and when I was I was very viciously bulimic or I'd have to go back and count eight or ten years or something and on and off you know they were worse times and not so bad times and and what ultimately helped me heal from that was a combination of many things 11 was meeting a man like falling in love for the Simon having a man tell me that he thought it was beautiful just the way I was and I wasn't dancing I had been a dancer and there's nothing that will create exacerbate and or create body image issues like being in the dance world and standing in front of a mirror in a leotard 48 hours a day and and having a model of that's so beyond like the norm in terms of skinniness right the dance world is tends to be like much much much skinnier like the the ideal is much skinnier than that the general public and and a studying feminist theory and understanding how the personal is political and that all of the energy that I was spending to like why was I believing what these magazines were telling me that I was supposed to look like where why how I into that I started questioning that and I stopped the rules so I had been in a fan I grew up in a family where they had very strange looking back very strange relationship with food for a philosophy or attitude about food that there was no real scarcity in my house at all a middle-class family we always had enough food but there was this sense of if if the brownies get eaten there's not going to be any more brownies so you better grab that brownie now and the guy that I was dating who is now my ex-husband his family had a totally opposite relationship with food his mother was constantly cooking and baking and they had boxes of see's candy that had gone stale because they were so much around that people never had to worry about scarcity there was never a sense of like you better have that last piece of see's candy or it's knocking you're not gonna get any again which was how was in my house I know it looked for me I had to just stop saying I can't eat x y&z and allow myself to eat anything and although i don't know that i was coming at it from a place of nourishment consciously i think that's really what was going on you know what what did what is going to nourish me in this moment rather than oh my god is this going to add two ounces to my inner thighs or what yeah if you've told me that story and each time you tell it I'm just struck by the the scarcity abundance abundance conversation because for me with all of those years and what I haven't told you about my own history is in I was a fitness instructor at the time I was teaching and an exercise nut you know I really believed in my life that my mother is overweight was overweight as long as I can remember and she was also in a perpetual diet and so I grew up in this food paradox where I grew up in an Italian household family food grandmother made homemade bread homemade pasta apple pie lemon cake you know homemade sauce canned her own tomatoes beautiful food environment with a mother who was always on a diet and she was on a diet not just with one but two organizations so she had diet workshop and as backup reinforcement weight watchers so here I was you know like in this place of you know we eat but then we repent and let me give ourselves permission to eat and then we repent because we're destined in my mind were destined to look like that you know that biologically I was destined to become my mother and so I'd be very careful and if I got a little pouch writer if I gained weight then I was really convinced and i would get back into that cycle of over-exercising to give myself permanent to eat or starving micing of all kinds of crazy diets that were not healthy and so it's no it's no surprise to me now that my bones were in trouble because really when I look at women who come to me now and they want that just five more pounds I just need to lose five more pounds or you know i was so much happier at 112 or 110 and when i say to them well when did you last weigh 110 112 it's they were in high school you know or college or they were a dancer right and and what I've learned about estrogen and what I've learned about the whole hormonal cascade that occurs as we age is sometimes we need those pounds of protection so how do we change the mindset from nourishment you know or actually from looking good to being healthy and and it's a struggle for women it's a real struggle so back to abundance and scarcity if we're coming from this model of scarcity rather than abundance I think when we get called into that weight loss war zone yes definitely absolutely and my mother I mean still to this day she's always trying to lose the last five pounds my mother is a slender she's always been slender she's always like friends always tell me how pretty my mom is and uh and she's in her 70s now and she's still always reflects five months so you know we grow up in this stuff but what's what's striking to me most now is looking back I've been thinking so much about all of those years and all of those know hours and days and weeks and months that I spent obsessing over changing my body in some way basically which boiled down to although I didn't think of it this way then boil down to a kind of self-hatred and all of that energy just add morning it now that what I might have created with that energy and that time and that focus if I had applied it towards a Legacy Project something created some art and also which brings me to one of the things that I really love about what you do is you really approach food as art and that's something that was not part of my upbringing really really at all you know there's a little bit of you know a little bit of presentation here and there my mom tried to make things you know she's not a foodie she tried to make foods that we would like and stuff but this notion of food is art was you do it that so beautifully and so many of us think of food as an enemy right but when you approach it it's more you think of it as an ally and as art can you talk a little bit about that I will and I also see a question coming in from emily rose and i just want you to know Emily that I will speak to that yeah so the food is art piece and you talked about it you know when you talk about the attention okay so for me and that that's why the name of my business is conscious bites nutrition because I think that we've been largely unconscious about the plate you know if we're in our heads and we're thinking about what we should eat or shouldn't eat and we spend all that energy in that place then we never really appreciate the sensual nature of food and and so there's a little science here too it's called the cephalic phase digestive response and what that means is when we pay attention to the taste the pleasure the aroma the visual impact of a meal it actually increases our metabolic power and it it helps us digest food assimilate food in a way that we don't write when we're eating on the run or not eating on the run which is what many women do they starve themselves all day save it up for you know their slave up their calories for dinner so by paying attention of visual impact of a meal we're doing two things we're taking our body into a more relaxed state into the more of a parasympathetic response which is also also a great place to be for digestion and assimilation and for the first time for many of us were paying attention to the meal and I find in my practice and in my world that when I spend time arranging the food on a plate i'm actually eating food or eating less food you know it's it's like becomes more of a conscious what what am I satisfied with as opposed to an unconscious just eating or filling a void so I also think it's a beautiful way to approach food it's like whoa what if we take a picture of what we're eating you know could that be a piece of art so I think that what brings people into my work are the luscious photographs that I take and splash all over social media or over my website or newsletters and it's like for people that aren't eating that way or don't view that food that way its new with something new it's a different way okay fit nourishment yeah I just think about um like I cook a lot with my boyfriend we cooked together and we'll make we'll make these very simple but really delicious meals and how much more pleasurable and nourishing that is for my entire being to sit down at the table with my boyfriend with like last night we had this whole grain pasta with this amazing yummmy vegetable stuff that I made on to put on top and it looked so pretty and we're sitting there together and that is so much more pleasurable than just like okay open the refrigerator whatever's there shove it in which is okay I've met it I do eat like that sometimes I'll do we do and that's okay you know it's for me it's like I don't expect people to make these amazing dinners every night and eat by candlelight every night I'd like that but first of all it can be really simple but also I think honor the fact that there are times that we are busy especially if we're creatives right like when I'm in a project or I'm in my creative muse I don't want to take time to eat I even forget about food which is another story that we want to talk about right because truly when we're not obsessed with food or counting calories or tracking grams and all that good stuff that we do when we're dieting think about the energy that is cleared for our creative pursuits but what I have noticed with women and what I hope to bring to light you know in the coming months what I engage in my next program is that what I've seen is when they start to get into their creative lives and they give themselves permission to spend an hour a day writing or paper art or painting or whatever it is they would always always wanted to do but never give themselves permission to do the distraction you know the food distraction is no longer there it's I think there's a relationship between being satisfied in our creative world or or enticed by our creative world that takes us away from the obsession around food and I'm I'm deeply interested in this connection I definitely see that in my own life the place where it for me it got it particularly tricky is my first big creative expression was dance and dance has such a complex relationship with food of course and in Bobby because your body and your body is on display so that that added a very complicated interesting layer but I think back to my life when I had to stop dancing because I got injured and it took me many years to realize that I was a creative person and to finally start creating I really didn't know that I was a creative person for oh my goodness almost a decade I was in academia and academia is not a creative place to be and and I remember that time of my in my life which was some of the some of the worst times of my eating disorder or during that period and it was also a time where I I did not feel a sense of purpose or identity because i didn't know that my purpose is to is I'm a creator and I wasn't I wasn't feeding that part of myself because I didn't know about it and what i would do is obsess over food and also over other things like i had us an obsession randomly of antiques I wanted to find an antique stained glass window which I didn't have the money to buy but I just like spent weeks and weeks shopping in antique stores like Hello I realized that for me my personality is I have to have something to dive into and if I don't have something productive to dive into I will dive into something unproductive so thankfully I have discovered productive things to dive into that his sofa healthier for being a lot better for the rest of the world to than somebody shopping for antiques stained glass windows or whatever um let's see so Emily rights in the chat she writes I this is fascinating I've been changing my diet and it's incredible how much better I'm doing in my mind and my body my mom projects her insecurities about her weight and since she got a gastric bypass it got worse since she weighed less than me now and I wonder why she treats me like that any ideas Emily um you guys might hear sorry the gardener is here and so you might hear loud noises because I have a very sensitive microphones I apologize for that Emily if you if you want to if you have a microphone and can turn that on I'd be really curious to hear more about to have you you know flush out a little bit more as it were what you wrote in the chat you can click on the microphone icon anybody who wants to share your audio up at the top little green icon that looks like a microphone and then you have to click on the there's a white box you have to click on approve to allow your sound to be picked up and then click on share my microphone and make sure you can talk first and make sure that the little bar is moving so that you can see that your microphone is picking up sound if you if you don't have a microphone oh there we go hey Emily Rose can you hear me I can't and yeah my bluetooth plentiful support yay and so for a really long time oh my mom was really overweight and she was on I don't know every diet imaginable and we had our own garden and she kept like that's all of our food that we were really poor and I didn't know that until I grew up and moved away and then became poor myself and then found out that I grew up poor look like oh I never realized that not everyone went to the church to get their groceries but she was overweight and then um whenever I got overweight um she started um yes like poking fun like not necessarily in a mean way but she would do things like grab my stomach and be like you need to lose weight or have you been exercising and what are you eating all these really intrusive questions and just painful experiences um and then she got her gastric bypass and it got worse and I had to tell her like I don't even know how many times does not talk about my waist because it huh um I don't know why she treats me like that yeah that I can hear the pain in your voice Emily and maybe my first thought is my mom doesn't doesn't treat me around it's not wait around you know the issue died mom that I get stuff from my mom but um just the other night at their house and her uncle died and he was the last of that generation and I walked in the door and she said something about that and I said yeah I got the email from so on so anyway she's not in the email and she was really upset about it because she thought that she had been left out by the family and she went off talking about that for quite a long time and talking about something else for quite a long time and then and then I was talking about something completely unrelated and she started getting very angry at me that I wasn't saying it wasn't given to the video out about her uncle when she had changed the subject and what I realized was that she was really upset she has her own issues she has her own fears and her own stuff going on and when people are stuck in their own stuff they throw it out other people and it's really painful and it's really hard and your mom probably doesn't even may not even be aware that she's doing it and that that it's hurting you so much Sue Ann do you have any any thoughts yeah so the first thing that comes to mind is that first of all that when people are in pain in their own pain they project that pain on others and so that could be where your mom is you know around the pain but also what comes to mind for me is when that happens in my world or when I see that happening in the world of my clients we take that as an invitation to have a little boundary exercise like so what is it that we need to do to take care of ourselves you know and for many of us what's the language you know people just don't know what to say they don't know how to respond because if we go back to being like six right when we're confronted with a situation that feels scary or that puts us back into a juvenile you know position how we felt when we were at six or ten or twelve and so I often say to my clients let's practice this you know in the words that we practice our I'm struggling like can we just remember those two words like I am struggling you know when I hear the words that you speak about my weight or my body or struggle when you grab you know my arm so that we take it back to this is how my response to you and when it doesn't become this this conflict but rather a communication and sometimes you know there's an opening there and sometimes there's just not but at least we're exercising the boundary muscle and I think that for us in life especially around parents and loved ones because we I find I'm much more our ticket with people I don't know right then people that I care deeply for that I just need to keep it right here with what is my response because often our realities are different and I love this the other exercise that that I use with clients is you know to draw on a felt sense of when I was feeling powerful or strong or confident and if I just closed my eyes for a minute and think about some place in my world where I feel that way and I draw on that energy in these situations I stand differently so that's really tricky because there's a lot there you know at stake you know the relationship between you and your mother your own self concept but I hear you're I hear your struggle and I know that that your your place is to take care of yourself so if you can try that you know maybe that will shift the relationship with your mom encoding yeah um what I I moved the way from my home state which is where they still live and feel a lot better now to my general Staal confidence went like basically skyrocketed but when I a couple times that I've seen them you know during family events or we've all traveled to go meet in a central location but never in Minnesota yet I haven't gone back to the DeSoto um but a couple of times the first time push last year and then the second time was this year but I saw her and now I've invited her to come visit me here and she she's better hmm the second time I saw them this year since I've moved away but I'm so afraid because there's the general sense of fear because it's been happening basically my whole life and I just you know want to be confident and I don't want it to seem like I'm losing weight for her because I'm not I'm losing weight because I've changed my diet because I realized that the foods i was eating we're making me miserable and i was finding out with logic to things and gaining weight because of them and not about stopped eating them i just lost weight and I don't want her to think that I've lost weight for her hey I totally me I'd really big challenge I just say keep your side of the street Queen you keep knowing you know that you who are losing weight because you've chosen health you know I say to people we don't lose weight to get healthy we can help you so that we can release weight that is nervous to carry and unfortunately sometimes the weight it metaphorically is the weight of relationships so keep doing what you're doing for you and and try as much as you can not to worry about you know things that you can't control all thanks for sharing alkyl thank you the advice I really appreciate it have another question Deirdre hi Deirdre she rise question from the perspective of a mom I hope you guys can hear me at there's so much noise out my window and can you hear me I have a firm the perspective of a mom what is the healthy way to live with my daughter's poor food choices wow that's a loaded one is then III hahaha Sue Ann you have any not stood to share on that he has like lots to Sharon that but I'd love to know how old her daughter is maybe she couldn't type that in the box it's deidra still with us yes it's not on Deirdre no it's on hear me it's not a distorted but I can hear you oh my god 15 oh she doesn't so what I coachin thin that um mark tried to remedy breakfast even already breakfast she like a pattern to ocha lesson about and then we have a pretty mer you know I can make him every night and I didn't call cheese during the day no I don't want to but she yellow and gray one short knees my thighs powering Shalini she's humble she was talking to mom she wants me a machine together and combination ba ba ba ba an American pilot so I've done what really set the house on any kind of sound before and that you'll to remove these logs you'll eat like chips and and and there's the abundant conversation so what we really live with a scarcity of food and find it before I can solve them great questions so um the first thing I what acknowledge is it's really hard for us as parents to watch our children make poor choices especially if we have a consciousness around food you know and the food intake not only what we're eating but how much we're eating so to watch her come home at a hungry time I call that for kids after school too hungry time and indulgent vixen be eating in the not equal nourishing food is tricky I also find that they don't have the consciousness when they're in their teams you know they just want what's what tastes good so in the first that I hear you say is that you who thinks a little yummy you know shake or whatever in the morning that she will drink you know my a facet of my business I don't know if you know this is called chocolate for breakfast so my business is conscious the fights the person but a facet of it is chocolate for breakfast and and the reason that I I started that whole movement is because I felt as though we were we were being so rigid in our rules around food that we had lost the deliciousness of food and I also wanted to give people permission to indulge in chocolate or in something tasty but to find a way to uplevel it to elevate it so myself is yes keep the junk out of the house but don't make it forbidden food because then when you get into that scarcity so go out and over indulge in that food so you know for me I say okay let's make that food those foods a treat for young youngsters but also maybe a vehicle for something more nourishing so for example like pretzels and they're dipping the pretzels in almond butter you know at least we have something there besides a pretzel that has no nutritional value but for me it's like changing like if I make a chocolate zucchini bread and I know that everything in that red is in a there's one on my website if you're interested in the recipe for this but it's buckwheat flour so there's no gluten in it the moisture in it is sweet potato mashed sweet potato and shredded zucchini and cacao powder and some really high quality chocolate chips and it's like eating this amazing decadent brownie well you only need a little square you're not going to eat the whole way too much so if I haven't hidden food made up of nourishing food and I feel better that it's good that I know we're not eating a brownie mix right and it's not the forbidden food any snowin in my home is going to be looking for it much like you talked about Melissa when we talked about this scarcity of when there were brownies in home you better eat him because you work at a sealant again right so I invite people to try and come from that abundant place I'm going to have this food in my home but it's going to be high-quality high-quality groaning sigh quality foods that are treats and made from some real food the up and there was a great example that somebody I interviewed on one of my program said once his name was Mark David and he he's the founder of the Institute the psychology of beating he has a teenage son and we asked him the same question because we wanted to know what your perspective here you are a nutritional psychologist and you've got a teenage son what how do you approach food in your home and he shared the story he said well he's always kept this conversation like for example of his son once a starbucks at ten o'clock you know Mark would say okay you know go ahead and order that and then he let the kid drink the Starbucks you know be up all night and then he would casually say at breakfast you know like so tell me how was that for you you know did how was your sleep last night you know so that the kids are saying I don't know I feel really good what I eat ice cream for snack and then can't eat dinner but they have to in some white own it and come to that conclusion like we do you know yeah they're going okay they're not going to die from a Twinkie you know or pretzels but if we make eating experience so tempting and so beautiful that and we're enjoying the food on the table even if they snapped out right and are not hungry when they see us enjoying something beautiful they may be drawn in to that food so I like to be patient and same requirement and again it was what can I do around my food that looks more inviting than trying to control someone else's food and for me to it my husband is a great example I don't have a teenager at home but my husband we've been married 12 years now when I married him his plate I kid you not was a piece of chicken a a pile of mashed potatoes and pilot cottage cheese not a vegetable in the stands diet and I wasn't about to change him he was in his 40s when we married we were you know a late marriage so I just kept making my amazing salads and salmon or whatever it was and started a garden and you know I would say it's been a process but he kept looking at my plate and now you know really we are eating pretty much the same thing it used to be that he still had his plate and I had my plate but you know more and more he just saw the amazing food on my plate he couldn't stay away from it anymore cheese nips and potato chips my sweetie was a voided greens like the plague also until I was always making salads and I eat tons of vegetables vegetables all the time and I remember walking by a restaurant in my hometown it's a salad place and I was like hey you want to go here this is one of your dating and he's like and maybe six months later he was taking me there because he'd gotten so he'd gotten to love salad so much and discover that they can be so delicious and nany and yum yum and it just needed to experience a little bit and now he he still will you know I'll eat his greens and we go out to a restaurant he won't eat the greens but we everything I make at home I just bring grains into everything anyway what is right helpful d do you have any other questions around my it is but I'm certainly with dinners I told them around two things that she need not drive or anything that you like and so it's not so much so that I pork at dinnertime it's just it's more than another and another guy our relationship is so huge I'm getting a lot of boys but I hear the voice how about you Melissa were you able to hear what she was saying last section Deirdre was very dissonant we couldn't understand we couldn't hear you I could be you know the whole mother/daughter relationship around como you can detect I feel and but you know if the info you don't really pick your battles another 15 rollover City battle and you want to make it around home it's just to keep them you know and the mother in that in this part of the relationship and then see where she's about 20 pounds overweight at this point um you know just going to be doing what I'm walking on eggshells you will rob the whole thing because it can have laughing at other people's been talking about i can run laughing percussions through someone's whole life about how they take a daily practice of immersing particularly concerning for you knowing that she is overweight you know and that as she carries that weight and it continues to grow she'll be at risk help edit and health and health risk so my question too is she conscious of her weight in a way that that it matters to her I think she is um I think she is high foul yeah yeah i think so i think what i'm going to do this in organs were um she needs exercise that's just been like that's like hen's teeth trying to get her to exercise so i think i'm going to find the proper aquafit removing provided at a camp and then maybe he'll have the police stations as we go to the boffins all the next number of months yeah i think that just being there for her as opposed to trying to to manage this is was probably exactly the portal that she needs is knowing that you're there you know but sure but you're not trying to manage it because when she comes to you for help or this then there'll be an opening right right now even the mother-daughter relationship is like this for all mothers and daughters everywhere right it's you said earlier we have to pick our battles and so I would just say keep providing beautiful food and plenty of fruits and vegetables and be a model for that and helps have some trust that that there will be a point where she grows into her weight you know when she becomes is enough that the foods that she's eating are not making her feel good and she feels better when she has a you know a green smoothie for breakfast instead of a pop tart or whatever kids grab you know from the machines at school just keep providing the best food you can and don't make an issue out of it and I think that she'll be able to lean into it much more readily on to suggest both for Emily who just wrote in the text chat that that sir sighs in and of itself is a boring thing to do I know for myself she writes I need something to activate my brain and needs purpose and i'm just posting in the text chat a book that i have been reading that has really changed my life it's called spark that the new science of the revolutionary new science of exercise and the brain and i don't know if it will be helpful for your daughter Deirdre but it actually got me to exercise and I am a physical person I like there are lots of physical things that I really love to do like dance and yoga and walking but I'm I've not been doing anything aerobics for years and this is the book that got me on the exercise bike every single morning for the past two and a half weeks so far and it's all about how exercise groat literally grows our brains changes our brains increases our ability to learn helps with addictions helps prevent um um what's the worker don't work dementia that's the word and I'm not able to access the venomous how's the depression just lost your voice Melissa oh you hear me now oh ok so this book is I think it has an eight maybe and it's the this all the science neuroscience of the exercise in the brain and I highly recommended it we are very close to the top of the hour and I want to be respectful of everybody's time and assuming I wanted to get to your story of how you got from conscious bites to chocolate for breakfast which you mentioned just briefly but since we only have a few minutes would you I would love to hear more about this program that you have coming up it just sounds so wonderful you're you're well nourished woman program would you share with us some about that that have two websites one is conscious bites nutrition calm and that's on chest with an S and bites with an S people always have a hard time finding that one and the other one is chocolate for breakfast calm and the program that i'm going to be launching in mid-september is called the well nourished woman and the first half of that program will be focused on the plate right and just the whole eating experience and and how to tackle you know the kitchen in a way that we can make elegantly easy meals that are absolutely luscious and they can experience a food around that and that will also be imbued with my conscious bites concepts which I teach in all my programs and my individual work and then the second half of the program is going to be you know a study of our creative lives it's in the first part artful eating in the second half artful living and how we can embody you know this place of really listening to the creative voice inside and shifting that focus from I want to have perfect body the perfect way to I want to have a well-nourished like a well-rounded life and I'll have some great guest speakers I know Jennifer Loudon will be on the call with one of the calls with me you'll be on one of the calls with me Melissa another really amazing woman by the name of Kathleen prophet who is well versed in depth psychology and the embodied arts will be on one of the calls so that'll be just a really rich discussion and conversation of creativity and in that space and time we will also embarked on some creative project whether that means just taking pictures of our food or writing and unraveling our food story or dabbling in pain to a poetry we're going to play do a lot of play and that is a three-month program and I have a much shorter program on the cut on the chocolate for breakfast and that is just the kitchen experience so some people will come on just for that six weeks to do the clueless in the kitchen program and then others will sign up for the whole program and very quickly we went from from conscious bites nutrition to chocolate for breakfast to do this to lighten up the conversation and really you know examine what it means to have a luscious relationship with food and you may want to check out the luscious legacy project on that website because that's where I interview women around their struggles around food and body image and with their daughters right so you can see some models for how people work with that you know and it's nice to see other people's stories we learn through people's stories right which takes us full circle Melissa so yeah check out both of those to sleep what a beautiful way to to wrap it up sue anna has just been such a pleasure to have you your your program just looks so amazing and again there's so many parallels that you and I share so I just feel such a resonance with you this has been such a treat to get to to hang out with you guys for this hour I will post all of sue Ann's contact info when i get this recording up and i'll send an email out when when it's done keep the conversation going and thank you everybody have a great rest of your day and maybe i will see you at the next hangout go get creating ha bye i'm melissa", "Hk6dQDDCCdg": "hello everyone I'm Jeff Stanley with Stanley handcrafted and today we're gonna be talking about a question that comes up quite a bit in the groups and that is weighing your wax trying to fill trying to figure out exactly how much wax and oil so that you can fill a container perfectly and not have leftover wax or not enough wax to go into it now this is one that I can't believe I haven't covered before it's come up in a lot of the groups that I've been in for the last couple years and the confusion comes from adding the wax and getting your oil percentage so basically let's use the basic ratio the 16 ounces we're gonna use 10% so if you're you're adding 10 percent to 16 ounces of wax you're basically doing 1.6 ounces of oil so if you're taking the 16 ounces of wax you're adding the 1.6 ounces of oil you're coming up with 17 points 6 ounces of total wax and oil together now that's not a problem if you're filling some of the 3 the 8 ounce jelly jars it's gonna fill three of those just perfect but the question comes up what happens if you wanted to fill a jar that that's exactly 16 ounces and that becomes a problem because you've got extra wax and oil that's of course not gonna go into that now you could of course just poor couple melts but a lot of people like to be exact and what ends up happening is a lot of people will get their measurements they'll weigh the 16 ounces of wax they'll get their percentage which is 10% 1 point 6 ounces and then they'll actually subtract 1 point 6 ounces of wax and then add the oil so that they come up with a grand total of 16 ounces now of course on the surface this seems just fine you're removing the wax you're adding the oil you're still coming up with 16 ounces but what happens is once you remove some of that wax you've already made calculations on that weight the 16 ounces and when you reduce that down to basically 14.4 your oil stays the same and you've essentially increased the oil percentage up to around eleven and a half percent this one gets glossed over it's real easy to just kind of gloss over and I think about this one I have definitely done this one and the reason I wanted to bring this up is because the discussion came up in the group the last week and Maria McDonald actually came back after discussing in one of the threads she actually came back with the formula to come up with the exact wax and weight ratio to basically fill a container so if you're 16-ounce or a 20 ounce or 30 ounce this is the formula to come up with exactly how much oil you will need for the wax that goes into it so we're gonna go ahead and cut right over I'm gonna get out the the chalkboard again because a lot of people like that one and just do like a quick overview and show the formula on that one all right this is a question that comes up quite a bit in the groups I've seen it around for a long time and it came up the other day and it was discussed in one thread and then it was brought back up and made very clear in another thread by Maria MacDonald so I kind of wanted to go over that with this one because one of the formulas that she posted in there was really good and I wanted to highlight exactly that so most of the time when you're doing your waxes and you're coming up with your weights let's call it 16 ounces because that's typically what everybody goes by 16 ounces of wax and if you want to get 10% oil of course you're gonna do times 0.1 which is 1.6 ounces of oil what you're going to do is you're going to add that 1.6 ounces to the 16 so you're gonna get a grand total a seventeen point six ounces of wax and oil and then of course if you're pouring that into like the the 8 ounce jelly jars you're gonna get three of those but the point has been made but what happens if you want to fill a container that is exactly 6 ounces or 16 ounces what do you do now I've seen this come up a lot what they'll do is they'll take their container which is 16 ounces they'll take their oil which is one point six ten ten ounces and they'll subtract the one point six from the 16 ounces which comes up to fourteen point four ounces of wax and then they'll add the one point six ounces of oil which of course equals sixteen ounces total now I've seen a lot of people do it this way and this is definitely not the right way to do this and the reason why is once you take basically you made your calculation off of 16 ounces of wax which is one point six ounces so when you go ahead and remove the wax you've made enough room to add your oil but what you've also done is if you've also increased your percentage so fourteen point four times ten percent is actually one point four ounces so what we've done is you've basically up your oil percentage and what you're adding isn't ten percent anymore it's actually more like eleven and a half percent now depending on the wax that may not be a big deal but if you're going for a certain percentage like a nine or like a nine percent this is definitely gonna come off it's gonna be very wrong quite kitty now for me when I've done this before I've always taken the container which is sixteen ounces and I've just subtracted two ounces because I knew the oil was going to be around like 1 to 1.5 which is just under 16 ounces we're looking at like we're looking at like just under 16 ounces fifteen point nine five and for me that's always been just fine I've never really cared too much to get exact but Maria McDonald actually came up with the formula or posted the formula which is actually why I wanted to do this video because it was a very good formula which will calculate exactly how much oil you need in your wax to fill a certain ounce container so if we're calling that one 16 ounces so instead of the other one where you multiplied by point one zero which is 10% so with the other formula you're doing 16 times point one zero which is 10 percent so with this one we're going to go ahead and we're going to add a 1 so it's one point one and we're going to divide instead of multiply so you're going to do 16 divided by 1.1 which is actually 14 point five four and then if you take the fourteen point five four times point 10% you actually get one point four five which is exactly 16 so that's gonna be the best formula to figure out exactly what you need to do for a 16 ounce container or 32 or whatever container you're putting it into and of course that works if you want to go up to 12% or drop it down to 8% so 1.7 four ounces of oil which comes out to exactly 16 ounces once again so let's go ahead and try that with a 20 ounce jar so if we wanted to fill this it was exactly 20 ounces worth so if we want to fill the 20 ounce container we're gonna take 20 divide it by 1.1 which will be our 10% and we're gonna get 18 point 1 and then of course if we want to get our 10% oil I amount out of that we're gonna multiply by 0.1 zero which comes out to 1.8 which is just under 19 obviously these go out a little further I didn't add those in there but it comes out to roughly 20 ounces all right so that's pretty much it I hope that one I hope I didn't gloss over anything I got to rewatch this video I was trying to keep everything together and kind of calculate everything to make sure I was coming up with all the right calculations with a calculator and on the chalkboard at the same time so I think I got everything covered pretty well in the the chalkboard demonstration and I won't know until I watch this back but that's pretty much it right there the formula is going to be you're gonna divide by the percentage that you want which is going to be 110 112 and then you're gonna break that down to one point one one point one two if you're doing 8% you're gonna do one point zero eight nine percent one point zero nine and you're actually going to come out with the exact amount of wax that you need to remove from 16 ounces or 20 ounces or whatever the container size is so that you can get the correct amount of oil in there now if you're doing something like 8 or 9 percent in the wax holds up to 12% this isn't a huge deal if you end up with more oil like if you actually did the 16 ounces weighed your oil and then you remove the wax and still had it you would bump up from 8 percent to like 9 percent or 9 and a half percent it's not gonna be a big deal because that wax can hold that but if you're doing a wax that has something like 12% and you actually add the 12% oil and then reduce it you're basically gonna up that to around 13 or 14% which could affect the candle and you could get a lot more seepage you could get a sweating and beating at the top of the candle so it's definitely something that you want to pay attention to and of course for those people who are getting down to exact measurements they know exactly what their candle holds and what they put in each of their candles this is definitely a formula that you want to pay attention to so huge thank you to Maria McDonald who posted the formula in the group I've always done it crazy ways and I've never even looked up the formula so it huge thanks to her for posting that in there the feedback on the last chalkboard video is really positive so I wanted to get a couple more of these out if you have something that you'd like to see a little bit more or basically something that goes into a little bit more detail like this please let me know in the comments down below and we'll try to add that to an upcoming video and again if I glossed over anything in the video or if something wasn't clear enough and I think I got everything but I haven't watched this part back yet so I want to go through and make sure that I covered everything if I didn't I'm gonna go ahead and throw some of the formulas up in the video so that you can see them but if I did gloss over something or you want something in more detail please let me know again in the comments down below and I'll try to go through answer every single one of them and I hopefully put it in another video and of course you can follow me on all the social media platforms listed down below my website Instagram Facebook my email address if you want to reach out to me and if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching", "csH10VkBfxc": "everybody ran here in East garage thanks for joining us for another live video on facebook and youtube today we're going to go over mixture ratios were going to explain them i'm going to show you how you can get an exact and precise ratio using mixing cups it may sound simple but it is it should be but we're going to show you exactly how to use them and why you need them plus the report lids gonna show you a couple paint guns and masking station and we're going to explain why this truck is sitting behind me now as always if you have any questions don't be afraid to post them in the comment and in the comment section on facebook and youtube Scotty seized over here you can see them nice shirt Scott yes stand up for your fans I don't get a good luck let them breathe in and so if you have any questions or comments all you gotta do is post them Scott's gonna dance answer him if it's something i can answer here or demonstrate I'll take care of it so first thing if you're mixing paint that probably means gonna be pouring paint out of a gallon like this now we've all done it and what happened Jennifer with the paint all around the lip you end up with a mess everywhere well you might want to go to eastwood and check out these port lids jewelry in here on it good alright so real simple just take the lid push it down on it seals tight and now when you want to pour you a poor out of here to set it back down it's sealed backup you don't have any mess at all in fact we even have them for courts to so no matter what size can you're using are going to portland for that's something that makes it makes a really nice when you're mixing paint so speaking of mixing paint let's get into mix ratio this jump right into it so i'm using this gallon jug because it's easy for demonstration purposes because it's going to be really easy to say we've got pints and quarts we got about all sizes you're going to need if you visit Eastwood we sell them kids and everything alive you're going to use in courts and we sell them as well so let's get right into it now these mixing cups are have about every ratio you want and we if we can get we're going to cut in here ok so there's a 211 three two one two one now that means say three to 11 which is what we're going to be using that simply means three parts paint one part activator one part reducer now if you're not using a reducer you can totally forget about this and you just use 2321 column and it and has four to 12 15 6 and 8 and around here is is just your standard measurements announces and milliliters to say want to mix 96 ounces and say you have one-to-one ratio you just pour up to 48 and then add your activator up here 296 now it's something beyond that you can use one of the charts i just showed you so job in june first I'll show you what we're gonna be mixing if we cut to jail here so what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be mixing it in eastwood single-stage everything which is a three-to-one ratio which is three parts paint one part activator now some people going to want to add a reducer so that's how you end up with your 3 2121 because you would add this also at one part so that's what we're going to do we're going to three parts paint one part activator and we're also going to reduce her to show you three two one to one ratio and now if we come back here to our to our large mixing Cup now say i decided i want to mix about 96 ounces so what I do is ok I take the 96 ounces right here and i would spin around the cup until I come to my 3211 right so 96 ounces puts me right there now you can see where that's at it's somewhere between this two in this three and my good here ok now somewhere between the two and three now remember these numbers here are not units of volume they're not units of measurement it just helps with the ratio so don't think yeah we're going to mix about 96 ounces we're not mixing exactly 96 ounces and these cups are just going to help with the ratio so we're mixing try not don't think that we're mixing you know like 30 ounces of this 1010 we're just going for about ninety six so we can mix a little more and use this and use this 3 or we can mix a little less and use this to now the 96 plus a little closer to the two so I'm going to mix a little less and use this to so what that means is the reason of all the way over here into this column is because i'm using three things so by the time I add the reducer I want to be over here so i would add the paint at the activator and the reducer so the final tally I want to be right about here which puts us at this too so the first thing I would do is I'm going to add i want to add the paint to the first two so this too is just the columns that we're going to use now all you to the first two then I'll add the activator which goes from there to there then we had the reducer from there to there so remember it's a 3 2121 so the first one is three parts and this ratio is just one-third of this ratio and this ratio again is just one-third 3 2121 if we want to mix more you would just use one of the other ones so we can get so now you may ask why you want to do this over just cups it's because it's very accurate or mixing stick a lot of times you use a mixing stick and what happens is is that the cups your bucket of your mixing in it may be tapered like this so if you're using a stick that has a measurements on it's based on a perfect cylinder so when you stick it in it it doesn't know it gets bigger so your ratio is going to be way off because cup grows it's not an accurate it's not actually won't be an accurate ratio anymore because the cups bigger and the sticks based on it being a perfect cylinder where these come in it's all that mass already done for you you're gonna get a perfect ratio every time because it's built into the bucket so the first thing we're going to do here if we cut back if we can come back to this close-up of the bucket is i'm going to add the peat up to the first two because again we're mixing three two one two one two you see I'm getting close so as you can see right here i'm in the three column and i'm using the tools because i want to end up here after i add all three parts the paint the activator and the reducer I want to end up there so my first one was three parts paint so I went to that too I'm gonna go to the next to with with the activator so now i'm going to have the activator up to that too so now you can see so now we have the now we have the paint and we have the activator so if that's all we needed if we were only using a three-to-one ratio if we if we only needed the paint and the activator we'd be done we can mix this up and we can go paint but because we also need a reducer we're going to go to right there so now we add the reducer and there we go we have a perfect three two one to one ratio of paint activator and reducer so before we get into a before we get into the paint guns and some other stuff around here Scott you have any questions or how we make it out here so far you've been explaining it really well you knocked it out of the park and thank you susan I've been practicing practices for about three weeks you can tell so help so I'm so anyways let's check let's check out the check out the paint guns um if you're looking for getting started to painting or if you're just looking for another gun spray some bass clear you want to check out this concourse LT a nice gun great price comes with 1.3 needle nozzle so it's good for spraying your bases and clears you cannot get other needle novels from eastwood if you want to spray your primers ah but over here checking out you get in here the coup de Gras the conch force pro two gun set really nice set I actually have this gun spray is really nice the kit comes with a regular gun and a detailed gun which is really nice to have hard-to-reach areas the detail cock gun comes with a one-point O'Neill nozzle and the concourse Pro comes with a 13 or 17 and a 20 so you're going to be all the spray everything from your primers all the way up to your base and clear codes so this kit is going to lie to pretty much spray everything you need on your car plus it comes with a regulator and it comes with your cups and right here in this box is cleaning kit and your gun wrench so if you're looking for your first your first HVLP pink onset this is a great set and if you're just looking to upgrade again it's a great set because it's got everything you need to spray from base to clear and primers so now that we got through that let's check out Oh check out i'm asking station so after already was set up i rise I should have I should have thrown a tip that you guys but I kind of ran out of time because we're scheduled to go live at three if you've never seen one of these masking trees masking stations the really nice we sell smaller version and if you're watching this live you might want to go to eastwood.com and check out our daily deal because every day we pick out a product we give you ten percent off and free shipping on a product so if you go to use with dot com take apart your daily schedule in the morning you don't check it out and see what products we have and I believe today we have a small masking station which holds one size paper it's like a store it's it's it's it's pretty nice and i think that might be our daily do today so if you're watching this live today only don't try calling in three weeks from now and telling our customer service department I told you get a great deal and then you gotta do it today but anyways well it works is it automatically puts on the tape so the masking tapes here the papers here so you pull out what you need and you rip it off and the reason i said i remember this was because a lot of times if i was going to paint the first thing i would do is i drip off a few feet of that and i would put it down here wherever i'm working so i put down one row of this one working because it's really nice to work on if you're mixing paint everything else because if you spill when you're done you just ball it up and you throw it away and it keeps your workstation nice and clean for the next time so one last thing all you people you probably want to know what this truck is behind me the truck behind me just arrived i believe its a 50 Chevy if somebody out there really knows their trucks and tells me to 51 I'm like believe you but the reason is here Andy whatever product engineers have seen them in some videos from our wedding videos he does gotta be brought in we push it into the garage today but tomorrow we're pushing it outside we're going to strip it with a contour SCT new product brand new Eastwood exclusive and incredibly popular if you would have saw Empire fabrication posted on Facebook them using it couple weeks ago 640 650,000 views about 1,200 comments so it's a really popular product and tomorrow want to strip this and you're going to get to see it live maybe for a while maybe a few times I don't know exactly what time we're going to go live at but make sure you check out eastwood.com make sure you subscribe to our YouTube channel and make sure you follow us on Facebook so when we go live going to see it in action so Andy and ryan we've also seen a lot of videos they're going to be taking turns stripping this whole thing the plan is to strip this entire truck tomorrow is gonna be a beautiful day here in pottstown so if you want to see it live for a little bit see this in action make sure you check us out tomorrow on youtube facebook or just visiting with dot com will be a banner there should be a banner there well let you know where the videos at well are there any other questions I did a good job today did awesome thanks a lot Scott so make sure you get it you tuning this week we've got live videos three live videos next week we're coming out your monday morning tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning so our schedule a little differently next week with thanksgiving so yeah so just make sure you follow us and subscribe to us and check us out next week and don't forget to go to eastwood.com for daily deal to get your mixing cups and make your you're painting a lot easier well take care see you next week actually maybe i'll see you tomorrow", "lj6JgdciDtg": "what's up guys ian here is on landscaping welcome back to another video today in this video welcome back to episode three of lawn fertilizer application business uh fertilizer treatment rounds today we got 10 on the schedule it's not the whole route but we got a good amount of them today um so i'll tell you what let's go ahead and uh get loaded up here uh we're gonna hook wagon to the tractor get all of our fertilizers here we'll hit the road let's do it [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Applause] so [Music] well guys i filmed the next diy video on one of my clients yards while we were spraying i'll leave that linked in the top right hand corner um right now i'm hopping on the mower real quick ooh blown out real quick um we're headed to do i think the last property we've already sprayed 10 gallons let's do it [Music] do [Music] do [Music] all right guys well i thought i'd take a quick minute to walk you guys through the applications that we made because i didn't quite explain what exactly we were applying in the video so i figured right now i take a quick minute and go over that so first let's start with my irrigated yards if your lawn is being irrigated either by an in-ground irrigation system or an above ground system that you set up you're gonna be treated every four to six weeks with a third to a half pound of nitrogen on your lawn that's going to be all season long during the growing season you're also going to be treated by the next biostimulants or a soil amendment from them as well so that's how we handle our irrigated yards if you're not irrigated your lawn is going to be fertilized from may or from from march to may and then we're going to take a couple months off while it gets hot and like this year it's august we're getting a lot of rain so i came back in and hit them on a low dose 18 ounces per thousand of 1801 green punch and you know maybe substitute in some 402 on a couple of yards couple of them got 402 and 002 micro green so it all depends some of them were fertilized later so maybe it was like june but it's still hot so maybe i just did a 402 and a 002 micro green it's just all about finding out how to push low nitrogen amounts keep the green keep the color going during the summer on these yards especially if they're not irrigated then you're not going to want to push them hard because you can burn them out so most of them have been getting treated every month with just a soil amendment and then this month with all the rain i went ahead and hit him with a low dose of green punch a low dose of 402 with zero zero two just something like that maybe some 700 if they're looking a little deficient in iron based on their soil tests from the beginning of the year the best thing i can recommend is just kind of go around and find what they need and keep all your levels consistent because there's no need to push hard nitrogen on lawns that just aren't going to grow because they're dried out during the summer that's my best tip for you and also i wanted to mention for you guys that don't know 1801 green punch that's going to be your nitrogen source from green county fertilizer that's going to be their main product that pushes a lot of nitrogen four zero two floor green is also actually a garden turf or ornamentals flowers that kind of stuff so it's meant for that so that's why it's lower in nitrogen so it doesn't get used in the lawns a lot but if you're looking for a good color pop during the summer definitely a good product i recommend and use and if you mix it with the zero zero two micro green then you actually get a good amount of iron in there so you're gonna notice a lot of green up because iron is basically a micro nutrient so you're going to notice that there you can also mix the 002 with another product called 700 green effect that that is what's called the double dark and that's going to be your iron source which you can give your lawn a deep dark blue green look if you put down iron especially if you're in like the florida where you go into blackout zones where you're not allowed to apply nitrogen during the summer the zero zero two is a good product to apply you can't do the 700 because it's got nitrogen but it'll give you that green color because it's got the iron in it anyway guys i figured i'd just take a minute to explain those applications and i hope that helps you guys if there were any comments that were going to be confused by what was getting applied now let's get back to the video well i have my camera set up on the seat of the zero turn all ready to go nice and cool and you know what i forget to do hit record before i started so give an update we went ahead fertilized this yard and used the irrigation system on hand gave everything a quick five minute per cycle watering in and i'm just checking to make sure it's back on schedule everything looks good there so other than that i really do enjoy working on this property irrigation system so i can water in right after fertilizer applications are done other ones have to wait for rain sometimes there's just nothing you can do about it but i'm standing under this nice tree here getting some shade and i figured i'd close out with you guys um hope you enjoyed this little vlog of me doing doing some properties just walking around my neighborhood catching up showing you guys what's up anyway guys hope you enjoyed the video if you guys have any other questions leave them in the box down below but with that i'm made from amazing landscaping thank you for watching hope you guys enjoyed and i'll see you on the next one [Music] peace [Music] you", "uBBuSXHqJUw": "you hey it's Kyle with git zone we're here at the night for smooth taking a look at some new optic check this out what you got hey Kyle for 2018 you've got something really exciting tonight for us it's a brand new product family for us it's the NX 8 and what sets this apart is it's an eight-time zoom ratio very nice so what's pretty exciting about this is true 1x optic goes all the way up to 8 X so you can shoot both eyes open like a red dot there's daylight visible aiming point plus if you want to shoot out the distance you can crank it up to 8 X you've got enough travel enough information the reticle you can really make precise long shots - now this looks like it shares a lot of characteristics I know it's a new line right but with some of your other higher-end scopes what's this one going to be like price point wise yeah so price points going to be pretty attractive

workbook open to page 566 math workbook on 566 and we're going to do a few pages in here on line plots so the first problem says ronaldo collects 10 shells at the beach and weighs each of them he uses a line plot below to display the data what is the difference between the weight of the lightest and heaviest shells naruto collected show your work so we have the word difference which means subtract and we want the heaviest and the lightest while the heaviest number is 12 there's no shell that weighed 12. so our heaviest number that actually has a an x or a data over it is 11 and 3 4 so that's our highest and then our smallest number is right here what is that number we have to see how many tick marks are between 9 and 10 to know what that number is so that's one two three four five six seven eight so that's nine and one eighth because each of these is an eighth so minus nine and one eighth subtracting mixed numbers we're going to get mad first so 4 times 11 is 44 45 46 47 4. 9 times 8 is seventy-two plus one more is seventy-three eighths we need a common denominator our common denominator is going to be eight we multiply this by two over two let's see 4 94 and we multiply this by 1 over 1 and so it says 73 so we have 94 8 minus 73 8. so 4 minus 3 is 1 9 minus 7 is 2 and our denominator stays the same 21 8 this line means divide so we're going to divide 21 divided by 8. i'm going to come do that over here so that's going to be 2 times 16 that's 5. so 2 and 5 8 is the difference between his heaviest and lightest shell the next problem what is the total weight of the shells ronaldo collected that weigh less than ten and a half ounces so ten and a half is right here we want the total weight of all the shells that weighed less than this so we know this one is nine and one-eighth nine and one-eighth so this is 1 8 2 8 3 8 4 8 5 8 this is 9 and 5 8 9 and 5 8 and then this is 10 and a fourth but we have two of those so 10 and a fourth plus 10 and a fourth is 20 and two-fourths right we can work it out over here oh y'all can't see all that so ten and one fourth plus ten and one fourth is twenty and two fourths which is twenty and one half so we're gonna add our nine and one eight nine and five eighths and twenty and one half so we're going to get mad that's 73 8 two seventy three same fours and five six six seventy seven eighths uh 41 halves but we need to make it a common denominator so we're going to use eight so we're going to multiply this by 4 over 4 and that is 164 8. this is going to stay 77 8 and this is going to stay 73 8. so now we're going to add 73 77 and 164. 73 77 and 164 so that's 10 14. 14 21 2 3 314 8 but then this line means divide so we're going to divide 314 divided by eight eight goes into 31 four three times that's 24 seven bring down our four that's nine nine times eight is seventy-two remainder two so that's thirty-nine and two-eighths 8 can be simplified so it's going to be 39 and 1 4. that's the total of all the shells that are less than 10 and a half ounces notice we didn't include the 10 and a half ounces because it wanted things less than 10 and a half ounces all right what is the total weight of shells ronaldo collected most often so we have to look at the one he collected most often let's go back up to our line plot the one he collected most often is right here because it's got uh three x's on it that would be 11 and one-eighth but our answer is not 11 and 1 8. they want us to add 11 and 1 8 11 and 1 8 and 11 1 8 because they want the total weight of what he collected most often or that would be 11 and 1 8 times 3. either way there we go 11 and 1 8 times 3 would be 33 and 3 8. all right moving on to page 567 we have a new line plot it says how long a line can miguel make using all the 3h inch straps show your work so first we have to figure out what the numbers are on this line plot we have one two three four five six seven eight so they're counting by eights one eighth 2 8 3 8 4 8 5 8 6 8 7 8. and they want to know all the length of the line he can make using all the 3 8 inch straps so 3 8 is right here that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. so 3 8 times 7 over 1 that's 21 8 and if we divide 21 by 8 divided by 8 that's 2 and remainder 5. so that's 2 and 5 8 and that's inches because it's inches up here in our key or in our label on our line plot number two what is the difference in the length between a line made with all the 3 8 inch strips so that's 2 and 5 8 that we just figured out here and a line made with all the 3 4 inch strips so we're going to have to figure out all the three nth force strips before we can figure out the difference before we can subtract well if i look at my line plot i don't see three-fourths on there all i see is eights but what simplifies to three-fourths 6 8 simplifies to 3 4. so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 times 6 8 6 8 times 8 over 1 is 48 8. if we divide 48 by 8 we get 6. so now we're going to subtract 6 and 2 and five-eighths six minus two and five-eighths now several of you might think that this is four and five-eighths that is not four and five-eighths you have to get mad okay you can't subtract 0 minus 5 8. so you have to regroup and it's easier to get mad than it is to regroup so remember this is 0 8 so we're going to get mad with both of these this is 48 8 this is 16 17 18 19 20 21 8. now i can subtract 48 minus 21 and get 27 8 and if i divide 27 by 8 i get 3 and 3 8. notice if i just subtracted six minus two i would have gotten four and five eighths not the correct answer six and three eighths the next page miguel uses two of each strip length that he has to make a line how long would the line be so he's going to use two of these two of these two of these two of these and two of these so one-fourth plus one-fourth is two-fourths three-eighths plus three-eighths is six-eighths one-half plus one-half is one whole 5 8 plus 5 8 is 10 8. 3 4 plus 3 4 is 6 4. now we want to add all of these together which means we need a common denominator our common denominator is going to be eight so we're going to multiply this by two over two to get four eighths this is going to stay 6 8. one whole is 8 8. this is going to stay 10 8 and this is going to change to 12 8. so now we have 4 plus 6 is 10 plus another 10 is 20 plus 12 is 32 plus 8 more is forty so that's forty eights and what is forty divided by eight it is five miguel adds another data value so that the difference between the longest and shortest strip length is three fourths what tape length did miguel add so the easiest way to think about this i want to get three fourths the difference between two numbers so i have a number minus another number the difference between those two numbers is three-fourths well if i subtracted four-fourths minus one-fourth i would get three-fourths i already have one-fourth in my data line plot and i don't have four-fourths four-fourths would be one but that's what the question is asking what tape length did miguel add so he could have added one whole or four force to his uh tape length so he added one whole or four force because i ran into my work there because four-fourths minus one-fourth is three-fourths is that the only possible answer no but it is the easiest if miguel makes a line with all the five-eighths inch strips what is the total length in inches so we're looking at 5 8 on our line plot one two three four five so we're going to multiply 5 8 times five over one that gives us 25 8 and if we divide 25 by 8 we get 3 and 1 8 inch for the length of all five of them how could miguel use strips of different lengths to make a four inch line so he wants to make something that's a total of four inches long and he wants to use different strip lengths alright so i could use three-fourths plus one-fourth that gives me one inch go ahead and write that down three-fourths plus one-fourth equals four-fourths or one whole so if i wanted to use if i wanted to make four holes i would need three more three-fourths and three more one-fourths three-fourths three-fourths 3 4 running out of room there plus 1 4 plus 1 4 plus 1 4. so that would equal one whole that would equal one whole and that would equal one whole and that would be four total inches so that would be four three fourths and four one fourth is that the only possible answer no an easier answer if we look back at our tape links if i took a half how many halves would i need to make four whole inches i would need eight of them one half times eight over one is eight halves and eight divided by two is four inches so there are more than one and there is more than one answer i could use eight half inch ones or i could use four three fourths inch ones and four one fourth inch ones to make a four inch line number one on the next page we have a new line plot with burger weights use the line plot in the example mel cuts the smallest burger in half what is the weight of the meat in each half show your work so first we need to figure out what the smallest burger is so we've got to figure out what they're counting by one two three four five six seven eight counting by eights so this is one eighth and he takes that 1 8 and he cuts it in half what does cuts it in half mean when you take half of something you divide it by 2. so we're going to take 1 8 and divide it by 2. 8 times 2 is 16 but remember if you start with a fraction you end with a fraction so it would be 1 16 of a pound notice that line plots are really doing operations with fractions we've multiplied fractions we've added them we've subtracted them and now we're dividing them so it's really about knowing your fractions and how to do operations with them not just about reading the line plot on number two they give you a set of data an animal doctor scale weighs animals to the nearest one-fourth pound the list below shows the weights in pounds of the last 10 dogs the animal doctor saw and it wants us to create a line plot using this data so we're going to need a number line and what is the smallest number on our number line going to be let's see i got 14 so i think i should use 14 and i have 17 i have more than 17. so i think my smallest number is going to be 14 and my largest number is going to be 18. hopefully i made this enough long enough so 14 and it looks like we're going to count by force because that's what our data shows here so fourteen and one fourth fourteen and two-fourths fourteen and three-fourths fifteen fifteen and one-fourth fifteen and two-fourths fifteen and three-fourths sixteen sixteen and one fourth sixteen and two four sixteen and three-fourths seventeen seventeen and one-fourths seventeen and two-fourths seventeen and three-fourths eighteen i made it right so remember this is one-fourth two-fourths three-fourths so if this is two-fourths that's 14 and a half so i'm gonna go through and put my halves in here fifteen and a half 16 and a half 17 and a half now i'm going to put x's for my data 14 and a half x seventeen and a half x fifteen and one fourth fifteen and one fourth seventeen and one fourth seventeen and a half fifteen and one fourth x fourteen and one fourth x sixteen x fourteen and three fourths 1 4 2 4 3 4 and 15 and 1 4. we've plotted all of our data now we're going to use that data to answer the next question so now we're going to look at the line plot that we just created and see which statement about the data is true the heaviest dog is 4 and 1 4 pounds heavier than the lightest dog so the heaviest dog is 17 and a half the lightest dog is 14 and a fourth so that would be 17 and a half which is the same thing as 17 and 2 4 and minus 14 and 1 4. since there is no re-grouping involved in this i can go ahead and subtract without uh getting mad so that would be 1 4 14 15 3 and 1 4. well no that's not a true statement because it's three and a fourth not four and a fourth the three lightest dogs weigh 43 and a half pounds combined so the three lightest dogs are all right here that's fourteen and a fourth fourteen and two fourths fourteen and three-fourths so fourteen and one-fourth fourteen and two-fourths fourteen and three-fourths so that's three four five six fourths six-fourths is actually one and two-fourths which is one and a half and then if we add 14 14 and 14 12 1 2 3 42 plus this one is 43 and one half so that is a true statement but we're going to check the other ones as well the three heaviest dogs weigh 52 and a half pounds combined the three heaviest are right here so that's 17 and two-fourths let me find some space here seventeen and two fourths plus seventeen and two fourths so that's two fourths plus two fourths is one whole 17 and 17 is let's see 4 1 2 34 plus what that's 35 plus we have to add 17 and 1 4 and 1 4 so that would be seven eight nine ten eleven twelve three four five fifty two and one fourth not fifty two and a half and then the 16 pound dog is closer in weight to the lightest dog than the heaviest dog so the 16 pound dog is here the lightest dog is here that's one two three four five six seven hops away or the heaviest dog one two three four five six hops away so no it's not closer in weight to the lightest dog it's actually closer in weight to the heaviest dog so that one is not correct michelle chose a as the correct answer how did she get that answer um she must not have subtracted correctly she did not subtract correctly alright moving on to the next page juan drives a race car the race car the race tracks vary in length to prepare for racing season he records the links in miles of the tracks in the list shown below which which line plot correctly shows the track data so we're not instead of making our own we're just seeing which of these line plots matches this data so let's take one fourth because it's the smallest number in our data and we're going to count them all so this is one two there's just two there's just two for one fourth so if we look at our line plots this one has two over one fourth this one has two over one fourth this one has two over one fourth but this one has four so this is not it all right the next piece of data is a half so let's count on all our half pieces of data one two three four five now let's go back to our line plots and see which ones have five x's one two three four five one two three four five oh this one's got a 3 8 in here interesting one two three four five so would 3 8 actually go there if we were counting by 8 would 3 8 go there 1 4 with a common denominator of 8 would be 2 8. so we could have 1 8 2 8 3 8 4 8 yes it would go there interesting so it looks like this line plot has the right the numbers in the right order let's check the other line plots so this line plot here 1 4 one half 3 8. is that in the right order no because this is 2 8 and this is 4 8 and when we count we don't count 2 8 4 8 3 8 that's not counting correctly so this is not correct this line plot here doesn't have 3 8 on it at all do we need 3 8 on our line plot let's go look at our data do we need 3 8 on our line plot yes we do because there's a 3 8 right here which should have one x over it which this line plot does so it looks like this is our correct answer but we're going to finish checking it just to be sure we have three fourths next how many three-fourths do we have one two and we do have two x's over three-fourths we have 8 with 1 7 8 we have one whole 1 whole and we have 1 and 1 4 1 and 1 4. so letter d matches the data and the numbers are in the correct order so letter d is our correct answer now we're going to use this data here to answer these questions the longest track is six times the length of the shortest track well the shortest track is one-fourth let's see what we get when we multiply one-fourth times six we get six fourths which simply which converts to one and two fourths which is one and a half and i had to squeeze that in there so is one and a half our longest data longest track no it's not so that is false it is not six times the length the combined length of the three shortest tracks is four eighths so we're looking at the three shortest tracks which would be right here two eighths plus two eighths plus 3 8 2 8 plus 2 8 plus 3 8 that's 7 8 is the combined total 4 8 no it is not that is false the combined length of the three longest tracks is three and one-eighth the three longest tracks is right here so if we add one and one and one-fourth that's two and one-fourth so we're going to add 2 and 1 4 plus 7 8. we're going to need a common denominator of 8 so this is going to stay 7 8 and this is going to change 2 2 and 2 8. so that's 9 8 so that's going to be 3 and 1 8. oh that one's true yay we got a true half the length of the shortest track is 1 8 of a mile so if we take the shortest track which is 1 4 and we cut it in half which means we're gonna divide by two four times two is eight but if we start with a fraction we end with a fraction so yes half of the shortest track is one eighth that is another true answer our last page sarah owns sarah's hardware she made the line plot below to compare the fuel tank capacity of several lawn mowers she sells what is the most common capacity of mower she sells well the most common would be right here because it's got the most x's but what are they counting by let's see one two three four five six seven eight they're counting by eights one eight two eights three eighths four eighths five eighths so this is five eighths one and five eighths so the most common capacity of the mower shoe sells is 1 and 5 8. mark buys the lawnmower with the smallest tank capacity so that means he bought this lawnmower he uses three full tanks of gas mowing in the summer how much fuel does he use so we're going to take one and one half and we're going to multiply it by three so we're going to get mad this is three halves times three over one which is nine halves and when we divide nine by two we get four and a half so he used four and a half gallons mowing in the summer and finally jordan looks at the line plot above he says the difference between the most common capacity and the least capacity is one-fourth gallon he says he knows the difference without subtracting explain jordan's mistake then find the actual difference between the measurements so he seems to think that the difference is one-fourth did he actually subtract the right numbers i don't think so because what he should have subtracted if we're subtracting the highest and least capacity would be two and one half and one and one-half that is what we should subtract so let's go back to our problem here two and one-half minus one and one-half so if we subtract a half minus a half that's zero and two minus one is one not ten so the difference between them is one gallon not a fourth of a gallon so jor i would say jordan's mistake is he didn't subtract the correct two numbers subtract the correct numbers so that was a lot of work today involving a lot of operations with fractions if you don't understand something please shoot me an email", "Pv54Vkz0p64": "[Music] at channel islands everything that we do is performance oriented we're not satisfied with just making boards that go straight and fast we're interested in speed we're interested in flow and glide and getting that feeling that we're all after but you've got to be able to do the turns that you want to do you've got to be able to do your best surfing so this is the philosophy that we took into our new mid length straight rail board that has all that speed and glide you can draw those high lines and get that flying feeling but you can also really turn down the face and up the face and surf the board well [Music] one of the cool things that we have at channel islands having been around for 50 years is this incredible design library of templates and history and rockers and all the things that go into making a board and in the 70s my dad had a board called the huevo caliente which was this really beautiful looking mid-length egg sort of board and we've been looking at pictures of that around the factory lately we felt pretty inspired by that so we dipped back into the archives pulled out some of those old templates to accomplish those curves and yet updated the bottom so that the board performs like a modern board but has some of that classic feel and vibe that my dad created so long ago and in trying to put those things together and come up with a board that is sort of reaches back into the past but pushes us into the forward we into the future we want to engage with someone who knew those boards so our guy devin howard has been surfing these boards really well for a couple decades and so he was instrumental in the design process of us achieving our goals with this board for me personally i wanted to work on a board that blended all of the different characteristics of mid lengths that i really love into one and if you could do that what would the board look like and what would it be ultimately the ci mid is the best of everything that i love about mid-length surfboards you know having the low rocker the ease of paddle the glide but then being able to have a board that when you want to step on the tail and really turn and really get critical it's really expanded what i thought you could do on a mid-length and without getting too hyperbolic or really overblowing this i feel that the board that we've come up with is almost in a genre of its own when you put one of these under your arm i hope you see the love and the passion that went into this board and really i hope you have as much fun riding it as we have designing and building it for you [Music] so [Music] you", "oLHXG6JXnSA": "hello ladies and gentlemen welcome back to lads you could make it welcome to our channel where i'm mr thompson it's our job to show you that math is fun bow ties are cool we're going to go ahead and show you a couple of different ways to solve quadratic equations solve for the zeros the roots and the solutions but today let's go and get rolling with completing the square all right some of you may have already seen this example we did this one with factoring but i'm going to show you how to solve this with completing the square so completing the square on this the first thing that i want to do is i want to get it set up so that i can create that perfect square trinomial now typically what i end up doing for completing the square is y equals 2x squared plus 3x plus 1. i like to have everything as a y equals deal with it all on one side of the expression and then at the end when i go to solve after i get it worked out through vertex form then slide the k to term to the other side square root and we're done all right so that being said let's go and get this thing set up for completing the square well y equals 2x squared plus 3x plus the space plus 1 minus whoopsies i wrote the space first i have to write the minus and then the space remember when we're adding and subtracting the same thing on the same side of the expression all right i've said it a thousand times it's so much easier to do completing the square when a is one so let's factor out that too all right there we go factor this out we're gonna pull out the two right so y equals 2 on the outside that says x squared plus 3 over 2 x plus the space plus 1 minus remember we have to multiply by that 2 times the space well and good so far now b over two this is the part that really kind of freaks people out right so this is b over two squared but in this case b is a fraction complex fractions it's not that bad i promise 3 over 2 all over 2. now that whole thing is squared right but remember that's a whole number two so that's like a really a two over one kind of thing all right so this complex fraction a fraction over a fraction i can write this side by side because remember the only thing that divides a numerator from a denominator is a little line fraction of the people get that joke it's the same fraction of people that five thirds of people struggle with fractions all right here we go this is three over two divided by two over one now that's all squared kentucky chicken flipping keep change flip three over two times a one over two now remember that's all squared straight across the top straight across the bottom three fourths squared all right now so what happens is this is 3 4 squared which is 9 16. so we're going to go ahead and drop in the 9 16s here and here i'll write that one out for you make that a little bit neater y equals 2 times the quantity x squared plus 3 over 2 x plus 9 16 or b over 2 plus 1 minus 2 times 9 16. now let's work out the k term and then we'll deal with our factoring the perfect square trinomial kind of as we're doing this whole thing step by step so this is plus 1 minus 2 over 1 times 9 over 16. i see some common factors in there 2 goes into 2 once 2 goes into 16 eight times so multiplying straight across the top and straight across the bottom this becomes positive 1 minus 9 8. straight across the top straight across the bottom so now common denominator so that we can subtract i'm going to change this 1 into 8 over 8 minus nine over eight just negative one eighth there's your k term folks there we are at negative one eight now we've taken care of we've multiplied by the stretch factor it's all good i promise you we have 1 8 here 0 2 is our stretch x squared plus 3 over 2 x plus 9 16 and remember that's all equal to 1 all right we got our 8 we got our k now let's get this thing into vertex form so we can solve by taking the square roots nice and easy when i factor this remember that the factored expression is what we had right before it was squared so this is going to be x plus 3 4 and x plus 3 4. so writing out vertex form vertex form says y equals 2 times x plus 3 4 squared minus 1 8. now we're in vertex form let's go and solve this thing go ahead and solve it five first set the expression equal to zero plus three fourths squared minus one eighth all right adding an eighth to both sides one over eight equals two times x plus three fourths squared all right i need to get rid of my a term you get rid of the a term so in this case normally i would say just divide both sides by two it's going to look a little bit easier if i just say okay multiply both sides of this expression by one-half okay the 2's cancel on this side your a goes away everybody's happy when the a goes away now this is 1 16 equals x plus 3 4 squared ounce out of square root both sides square over here square root there so really this is the square root of one over the square root of 16. oh that was plus or minus almost forgot i almost forgot the plus or minus equals x plus three-fourths so now we're plus or minus one-fourth equals x plus three-fourths so in order to finish this guy out go ahead and subtract three-fourths from both sides subtract three-fourths from both sides so that says three-fourths plus or minus one-fourth equals x so i'm going to be able to do that as my two separate cases negative three-fourths plus a fourth and negative three-fourths minus a fourth there's a negative half a negative three-fourths minus one-fourth is negative one and both of those equal x and we've already shown and go back to our graph if you didn't catch that graph on that one previously here let me unhide that 2x squared plus 3x plus 1 comes in at negative 1 and negative 1 half being able to use completing the square all the way through vertex form all the way to our solutions to find the solutions let me double check it on our graph okay speaking of checking things out if you want to check out another way to solve another quadratic function go ahead and click this video here i'll see you guys on the next one", "o_v3UUsr__E": "alright we're going to look at the first lesson of this tight on problem solving where we will use all the skills that we've been working on in previous lessons all right when you have an application problem sometimes called a word problem there are some basic steps that you need to try to solve to use in order to get a good solution number one familiarize yourself with the problem situation if it's presented in words and it could be in a chart this means to read and reread it carefully until you understand what you're being asked to find it might help you to make a drawing might help you to make a list of facts assign a letter or a variable to be a numba organize things in a table or chart find further information like look up a formula and maybe guess or estimate the answer okay you will not have to do all of these but as algebra comes becomes more complicated more of these become involved in trying to solve a word or application problem all right then we're going to translate the problem into an equation using the variable using i'm going to use X probably each time then we're going to solve the problem the problem will be solvable using the two skills that we learned in the previous lesson check to see whether your possible solution actually fits the problem situation and is really the solution of the problem you just in other words is it logical for instance if you were asked how much time and you've got a negative number then that would be an issue because times not supposed to be negative okay then state the answer clearly using a complete sentence and appropriate units in MyMathLab you won't be typing the sentence but the sentence will be there and so please notice that when it comes time to do some translation or at least understand better what's going on you might write down this list and

quantities so these different phrases fit with certain operations and remember when we see the unknown what we're looking for we're going to let X equal the unknown ok let's look at problem number one the first thing we're supposed to do is get familiar with it all right here we go an eight ounce serving of an energy drink contains 81 milligrams of caffeine an 8 ounce serving of coffee contains 22 more milligrams of caffeine than the energy drink how many milligrams of caffeine does the eight ounce serving of coffee contain all right so the question how many milligrams of caffeine does the eight ounce serving of coffee contained so I'm going to make myself an initial note x equals x represents the caffeine in the coffee the problem talks about eight ounce servings eight ounce servings so that's just letting me know that for the same amount of drink all right now let's go back and it says the 8-ounce energy drink contains 81 milligrams of caffeine the coffee oh that's what I'm looking for the coffee contains has is equal to 22 more milligrams of caffeine than the energy drink so the caffeine I'm sorry the coffee is oops I'm so sorry 22 more than the energy drink and the energy drink was 81 well away I don't know why I'm not getting to have a cam there we go alright so the coffee has 22 more than the energy drink so if I wrote that coffee has 22 more than energy drink and then I fill in coffee as now many times the verb has is was will be that's your equal sign 22 more than the energy drink so it wants to know how many are in this so let's see X is 22 plus 81 22 plus 81 113 oh I'm sorry how about if i add correctly 2 plus 8 is 10 not 11 so it is 103 so I could say if I were writing a sentence oh they have my sentence the eight ounce serving of coffee contains 100 three milligrams of caffeine I know that you probably could have figured this out without an equation but we're trying to do some preparation for future classes when you will have to have an equation to be able to solve an application problem alright let's look at number two it says there are five hundred six members in a band and they are marching with 23 members in each row how many rows are there okay that means that we have lots and lots of members we have 500 six of them and as a band director you're saying I want 23 in this row and 23 in this row and 23 in this row so how many rows will there be can you see that you are tight but I'm sorry and go back x is the number of rows now if I went back up to this finding equal quantities okay you are taking this mass of people and you're dividing it into groups of 23 and you want to know how many there will be so you are taking 506 and you are dividing it by 23 to find out the number of rows one row two rows three rows so this was a case where kind of drawing a little picture or thinking about it in my head I'm literally taking 506 and taking off 23 23 23 so now if I do that division 23 does not go into five so nothing in the first position but it does go into 50 well how many times how about 22 x 23 is 46 subtract and I get I can't subtract so I have to borrow 6 from 10 is for nothing there bring down a 6 just 23 going to 46 yes we already saw that it went in to x 2 x 23 is 46 and then manger 0 that means that 22 is x my statement up here says the number of rows is 22 so if you have 22 of these 23 s you would have 506 let's look at our third one an office building is 1600 seven feet high and a hotel is 849 feet time find the difference in the height between the two buildings so X is a difference in pipe can you notice that I abbreviate sometimes when I'm saying what my X stands for difference means to do what I mean subtract so X is 160 7-8 49 this will give me the difference 160 7 8 49 I can't subtract their can't borrow from the 0 got to go all the way down here drop off a 1 borrow from it now I have nine from 17 is 84 from nine is 58 from 15 is seven so the difference is 758 the difference in the height between the two buildings is 758 alright let's look at number four a computer screen consists of a small rectangular dot dots called pixels find the number of pixels on a screen that has 500 rose with 800 pixels each let's go back up to our words a rectangular array 500 rows of 800 pixels each so X is the number of pixels so X is there are 500 rose there are 800 pixels on each row so I have 500 x 800 0 x 0 0 1000 ton spot scoot over 0 x 0 0 x 0 0 x 5 click on my two placeholder zeros eight times 0 is 0 hello eight times 0 is 0 8 times 0 is 0 8 times 5 is 40 excuse me i have 0 0 0 0 0 or put the comma in there and i have x is 400,000 naming that period so in here you will type there are four hundred thousand pixels alright let's look at number five we've got a chart our graph the graph shows the average monthly rent for a one bedroom apartment in several cities in june of 2008 ok let's look city a city the city C D and E it has the average rate this is rent per month so this must be money how much higher is the average monthly rent in city e then city c b and c how much higher what's the difference so x is the difference how much higher run off the screen there alright so i'm going to take the bigger one which is 779 and take the difference between 757 that should give me the difference so i'll come over here 779 757 that's too that's too ah it looks like 22 is the difference and that's money it is 22 dollars higher in e than it is in c oops make it go all the way away there we go this is number six the average monthly rent for a one bedroom apartment in a city is 735 dollars Phil Scott and Julio plan to rent a one-bedroom apartment immediately after graduation sharing the rent equally I hope it's a big bedroom if all three of them are going to share what's the average monthly rent each of them can expect to pay all right let's go back up here to our words see what applies we're going to find equal quantities again alright so in other words we're going to divide the rent three ways so X is each person's rent and I have 735 and i'm going to divide it three ways and that's going to give me each person ok and i guess i need to do that 730 firmer divided by three now three does go into seven it goes two times so i get a number above the 72 x 36 get a 1 and bring down the 3 3 goes into 13 well it goes four times four times 3 is 12 1 bring down the 5 3 goes into 15 5 times 5 times 3 is 15 so I have a remainder of 0 each of these guys needs to plan on spinning 245 dollars now the way I set these problems up because of the kind of problems they were you didn't actually solve them as equations where you add to the same side or subtract from the same side or divide instead I made sure I was looking directly for the unknown and I was trying real hard to use these key phrases or concepts so I think you can do just fine doing this with your problems I strongly encourage you to make a statement for yourself what are you looking for and take the time to actually write it down that will be very helpful in future profits", "_AQXwqrpwk8": "[Music] hey you to walk bad guys so today I got this boxing for you got to check it out I'm rack me this is the digital kitchen scale with the who L display so the display extends out thirteen point seven centimeter or equivalent to five points four inch for obstructed viewing so as you know if they're like a big box of big container and then you try to weight it and it's covering the display it's kind of hard for you to see so this one will solve your problem measures in both dry or liquid weights it weighed up to 22 pounds or 10,000 gram or 352 floor hounds or ten thousand milliliter in a one milliliter increments or 0.01 four ounce or one gram increment or 0.125 increment announced this one has that low indicator eliminates to show how much capacity is left yes backlit digital display with a large numerals for easy reading ad and weight zero function for additive measurement the dimension for this is eighteen point five centimeter by two point nine centimeter by twenty four point four centimeter or seven point two eight inch by one point one four inch by nine point six inch so this includes for the triple-a batteries included and it is for indoor use only it is a made in China by holder lifestyle solution so it's just I got this at the Rec tag sell for $2 he says that compared at $30 on the Missy was original price on this so this is original price about $16.99 so I save about $5 and this is that low battery indicator appears on screen when the berries though or the power is low scale automatic turns off after three minutes without use the magnet home pool display allow for easy written placement nice so let's go ahead and open this up [Applause] Wow looks pretty nice and this is a glass so over here is a instruction right here and then I'll see if it berries right here so I come with that for the triple berry so I need to pull this tab I helped okay be sure to put this plastic tab out so now you have a contact so it's going to turn on now and then I'm gonna select a berry cover back in Rossi and these allow you to pour out and then you get that plus a protector I hear oh my god it is on so let's say for example if I put his knife on top right now see announced so it shows a 2 ounce so this is pretty nice I have the regular innallaha scale so this is at each toe so be nicer for me to shebar item and stuff at the hair so I don't it try figure out did I go over or not so lettin know how should I how could I change the measurement so right now sign a power change to a crown [Music] oh right here I didn't know this is touch Wow pretty cool alright so right now it's in a pound so the max is twenty two pounds and if I press that unit right here it shows a to flow ounce I press a unit again fifty-seven gram if I press the unit again now it's a milliliter cool so with the pounds 22 pound maximum and then with the four ounce is 350 to flow a house right here on the display and then on the gram or kilogram it shows a 10 kilogram max and then milliliter is 10 liter max all right so the on and off and then I see the sensor right here I first thought I got a presser right here but oh so it's kind of weird so yeah it is right here somewhere around here cool so this is a particular investment I've been trying to look on ebay but the region dose was a necklace or so I got a price it on and off to reset it now I put it back in change the unit so now it shows two ounce and then that 1/8 anyway offer you guys

Welcome to the kitchen. Today, we are going to make LEMON BARS. For this recipe,  you need one cup all-puropse flour, a half a cup confectioner's sugar, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, four ounces (one stick) of unsalted butter cold and cut into half-inch pieces. For the filling, you need two LARGE babies, one cup ~superfine~ or baker's sugar, two tablespoons all-puropse flour, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of finely grated Meyer lemon zest, and a quarter cup freshly squeezed Meyer lemon juice. The first step is to take one unclothed lemon and you want to cut it apart. Squeeze it like the neck of your worst enemy. [the juicer creaks] Preheat the oven to three hundred and fifty degrees. Spicy. Paint me like one of your French girls. Measure the flour. Next, measure the sugar. You got-- got a little something on your... Oh-- Measure out two eighth-teaspoons of salt. Delicious. Cut the butter into half-inch pieces. Okay come on, we have to get this right, okay, um, so what where's the, how do you use this thing? No, come on, that's, that's not right -- ok what, what is an inch -- it's a half an inch! What does an inch even look like?! It- we learned about this, it's an inch! It's one inch, and then a half, it-- What, last year in first grade? What? No! It was in kindergarten! It was this year! (Gosh, lookit--) Put the butter in the food processor. Scrumptious. After... the food processor does its job, test to make sure the crust will taste Good. Couldn't quite taste it. S e a l   i t s   f a t e . Whisk together the sugar, flour, and salt. Two tablespoons flour, one cup of sugar, and an eighth of a tea-- of a teaspoon of salt. I take pride in my well-organized kitchen; it's the mark of a True Chef to have your recipe memorized and your things where they belong. Amen. Next, take two lemons and zest them. Beautiful. Next, add two babies. That's a big baby. *gasp* Twins! Whisk the baby. [live vocal percussion begins] [music ends] Add the lemon. [screaming] [more screaming] Make sure to taste-test your filling before you put it in to make sure it tastes Good. Um, I need a little bit more. Pour the filling into the crust. [louder screaming] [screaming] Beauty in a box~ [original score begins] Presentation is everything.", "gUIWuEdq1Ps": "we're going to start with questions 1 through 12 on the newly released Jenny 20 Dan uary 24 2009 teen region suppose 2010 scores have the same mean image with different standard deviation and the second standard deviation is bigger than the first so right away they're my first sighted introductory day of standard deviation we talked about this the bigger the standard deviation the bigger the variability the more inconsistent so if the second set has a bigger standard deviation then data set 1 has the greater variability that would be false data set 2 is the one with greater variability that's just understanding the concept of standard deviation the data sets are not the same variability and certainly it's not that no conclusion convenient number two we have a log paragraph for the base of three and then G of X is going to be the image of it after a translation five units to the left which this is just basic transformation stuff if you have an F of X then five units to the left is going to be f of X plus size where the X plus five is plugged in so the log base 3 of X plus 5 plugged in option one this one would be a vertical shift outside this would be a shift right side and this would be a vertical shift down side remember all things horizontal happen backwards so even though plus five would seem like it to the right section to the left when you factor this when factoring to reveal the roots of the equation which equations can be used so I would just go ahead and just factor this the way we know how which is would be by grouping take out an x squared left with X plus 2 they got a negative 9 you're left with X plus 2 so that's one way that's part way through the process which I actually immediately realizes this one so this one certainly can be used my next step would consist of realizing okay those match so I'm going to take an X plus 2 out in front and I'm left with an x squared minus 9 which wants to be that one but the plus two is a minus 2 and so those would never be equal everything else is the same and then I would take it X plus 2 and then difference of perfect squares X plus 3 X minus 3 and that's not an option so this one never came up but if we just explore it a little bit this is almost like midway through grouping so if I were just to take that a step further these x squared minus 9 match so I would pull that out in front and I would be left with X plus 2 which is the same thing just a different order of that so this one could also be used it's in a trickier order you'd probably have to rearrange your original and group it differently in order to see that come up but if you just pick up from there and pull your x squared minus 9 out in front you can see it's the same thing so 1 & 2 are the 1 some of the next one when a ball bounces the heights of consecutive bounces form a geometric sequence so we're the constant ratio constant multiplier to get from one height to the next site to the next height so if I picture a ball bouncing it's dropped from some height it bounces and every time it gets a little bit less by apparently a common ratio so the height of the first bounce so I'm going to say this is the first bounce this isn't technically a bounce you're dropping it from that height so the first bounce is 121 so that would be a sub 1 it's 121 and the height of the third bounce is 64 so not the second but the third bounce is 64 went to the nearest centimeter what is the height of the fifth bound so not a sub four but a sub five we're really looking for what that is so the key here is figuring well what is that multiplier sorry about that what is that multiplier this times what times what would get you there and we obviously we have a geometric sequence formula to write in your reference sheet geometric sequence is this a sub N equals a sub one times R to the n minus one so let's say I know my third term is 64 so we'll let n be three so a sub 3 would be 64 a sub 1 is 120 one time your R is what we're looking for and n was my third term so 3 minus 1 would be 2 so this allows us to solve for R so we'll divide both sides by 121 Oh can't get away from the all right as well all right so 64 / 121 leaves us with this point five two eight nine number and then square root that number to solve for R you get 0.72 repeating so R equals 0.72 so this times that point seven two repeating number gets you here and then times that again so we can just confirm that 121 times that answer would give us this times that R value again we can go back up and grab it should give us 64 which it does times that our value again would give us the fourth term times that take the 64 number times that our value that will give us this is forty six point five and take that number and multiply it by your R value to get us fifth pounds which is thirty three point eight five so 33 point eight five is closest to 34 I sort of did that conceptually you could go and use this again if you're now looking for your books that was nothing for them that was a subfloor in this case of us if I wanted to find my fifth bounce height and I wanted to stick with a formula rather than seizing it through a sub 1 would be 121 my R value is 0.72 repeating to the I'm looking for the fifth so five minus one power and if I type that in just directly 121 times point seven two seven two seven to them to do that a whole bunch of times to the fourth power will give me that 30 25 the number 5 is just a I'm a quadratic solve it and it looks like there is an imaginary possibility so they might also be testing that but we can't solve a quadratic until we get it equal to zero you take your subtract your 9 over that will give us 5x squared minus 2x plus 4 equals 0 you can try solving by factoring or you can kind of just based on the look of the four answers not factorable to set radicals in it so negative B is 2 plus or minus the square root of B squared is 4 minus 4 ay C all over 2 times a so there's your quadratic formula that's going to give you 2 plus or minus the square root of 4 minus 4 times 5 times 4 gives me a discriminant of negative 76 okay so there's your imaginary numbers a negative under the radical so those are out and then 76 I think a 4 goes into there so 76 divided by 4 would give me this is the same thing as negative 4 times 19 so that's going to give me my 2 I so 2 plus or minus 2i root 19 all over 10 and this this and that are all divisible by 2 so 1 plus or minus 1 I root 19 over 5 and then this is common it seems on the reasons they split this up so they do the 1/5 plus or minus I root 19 over six have you even read it but I can see exponential growth happening and they give us a formula so that's nice we start with one mm growing by 4% every one year which equation represents the amount of money in terms of a monthly growth rate so mm is manipulating percentages growing by 4% every one year if we want the one month growth rate we're going to have to plug in one month the issue is you can't have one month in one year in different units so it's probably easiest to change your 1 year to 12 months and then just type this in 1.0 4 to the 1 over 12 power 10.04 raised to the 1 over 12 power and that will give us our monthly growth rate so our starting values still 2000 but we're growing at one point zero zero three to seven and that's every one month so tea is still being used which is in years so if I did that that's happening every one month where she is still in years I want to keep this in year so it happening every one month is that it's the same as the frequency of happening 12 times per year and that's kind of that frequency formula that we dealt with so with the percent chapter we have the T over P concept and that's when your that's what we used here but if it's a certain frequency and the number times per year that means 12 times per year which would be option 3 number seven is I see tides I think tricks so Tiger a periodic rise and fall of ocean water sea you know your tides go from high tide to low tide to high tide to low tide on a typical data sea port to predict the time of the next high tide most important value have would be the so high tide to know when the next high tide would be would be to know really what the period is with the length of a cyclist and the time between consecutive low tides is the same as your period that would be a good thing to know and that's essentially about just giving you your period and if you know your period you can know when the next high tide will be number of the number of milligrams of medication given here from the zero hour 36 hours over what time interval is is strictly increased just look at it okay you get a plug in just knowing the features of a graph what increasing what secrecy and also knowing how to mess with your window so in our window we're going from a time of zero hours to six hours and we're talking about how much of a 400 milligram sample is left so 0 to 400 milligrams would be an appropriate y-axis and we're looking for strictly increasing which is from here to here it's increasing and that's at 2:00 in that stuff increasing so it increases from 0 to 2 and that is knowing how to look at a graph and understand features", "jNShNSwClKc": "[Music] teriyaki rules it's a lifesaver for weekday dinners hi everyone welcome to cooking beautifully what are you cooking today i am reading chef ivan organs the gaijin's cookbook and he was talking about teriyaki chicken do you like teriyaki i like teriyaki so much that i want to share my teriyaki chicken recipe with you we are going to make a teriyaki chicken burger that's so delicious we will make our own chicken and also the burger bun from scratch so for us to make our teriyaki burger the first thing if you want to you can make your own burger bun it's really fun to do because burger bun is the east dough so the most important thing is you need to activate the east you know make the east work and what does east like first they like they like warm environment and also they like something sweet just imagine they are a little baby you need to let them uh rest give them something sweet and then they will start to burp okay so you know the temperature of your water you know like has to be around like 110 pretty warm and then just need to add a yeast here they like something sweet so either sugar or honey will work and just kind of stir stir stir and kind of uh wait three or five minutes when you start to see it gets foamy and gets a lot of bubbles you means your yeast is working okay all right now as you can see our insta and water mixture is getting really foamy it means your yeast is working well it's time for us to make the dough to make this dough is really really easy first you just need to put your yeast mixture in the mixing bowl and then add your flour after the flour is in add some salt and also we have one egg after we add the egg let the machine do the work slowly add the butter in when it forms the dough put it in a ziploc bag that it proof you're all set now my dough is ready look at this how beautiful it is so now i just need to quickly you know shake the dough like this [Music] okay then you can put your dough back here cover it and then let it proof hey look at this now my dough is double volume is ready for me to shape it so this is really easy you just need to take your dough out and you need to wait them so usually what i do is i do three ounce per burger dough let's see oh three ounce so now i want to show you how you shape your dough you want to use your two hand use here and just you know shape your dough like this and it has to look smooth and shiny like a baby's butt that means it's ready you can put it on your baking sheet and then later it's gonna grow double the size again proof your burger buns until they are about one and a half times bigger then it's time to egg wash sprinkle some white sesame and bake them look at this look at those look at this my burger buns see shiny and smooth like baby spot and now they double this not really double but almost double like one and a half times bigger means they are ready what you want to do is you want to brush some egg wash on top so egg wash basically is i usually do one egg and one tablespoon of water if i want to give my burger a shiny look if you want to give it a soft look you can try heavy cream if you just want it to look crispy but not too crisp but not too rich then you know you can do water and sprinkle some white sesame on top i usually toast the sesame you know just so your bun is is more flavorful my burger buns are ready i'm going to send them to the oven bake it i would say around um 18 to 20 minutes until it's golden so now i'm going to make my teriyaki sauce first i'm going to add half a cup of orange juice half of cup of soy sauce 2 tablespoon of mirin and ginger scallion garlic i also have some brown sugar 2 tbsp of honey i have 2 special spices that i want to share with you one is number 17 yoga from a shopko la bois this one has some lemongrass and palm sugar i think it'd be wonderful to give it a little bit tight spin and then the other one is number 13. this one has some honey anise and cinnamon i'm going to add a little pinch to it too and now we just need to cook this bring it to boil cook 18 to 20 minutes until the amount of the sauce reduce to half of it then you are all set after we cooked our sauce for 18 minutes you can see it's getting like so much more thicker now what you want to do is you want to strain it [Music] then we just need to wait until the sauce cool down we can use it to marinate our chicken so now our sauce is ready i have some meat here we're just gonna put those meat here marinate it give it some massage give it some love and then let's marinate this for two hours or overnight then we can grow them so now after 12 hours my chickens are ready to go what i need to do is now just prepare a pan i would prefer a cast iron pan but if you don't have it you know it doesn't matter um also if you can find a pen that has this so you can get a mark on your knee that would be better but you know just um you don't need to break your back pocket just to buy a pan to pan sear your teriyaki so just work with whatever you have and now we want to heat up the pan also you want to have a pastry brush and prepare you know the oil that can endure high heat will be ideal and you want to wait a little bit until your pan get really hot what you're looking for is this sizzling sound and there are two options you can do you can either just pan sear it and then it's going to take a while or you can pencil it and then put it on a tray bake in the oven the most important thing when you are handling chicken is it's not like beef you can get medium rare or medium chicken has to be cooked so now i think my pan is pretty hot okay let's see if i get a sizzling sound whoa beautiful good oh smells so good whoa okay this is the dish i think perfect for barbecue july forest but also any time of the year like teriyaki rules so now let's just wait a little bit see if we get the mark and now see there's a beautiful mark on our chicken it's time for us to make them you can just transfer them to a baking tray and then put this in our oven now the chicken is in the oven we are going to let it bake like 8 to 10 minutes until the temperature is 160 degrees and then we can start to assemble our burger now i have my burger buns ready my teriyaki chicken ready how do you tell if your chicken is cooked you want to check the temperature at 160 degrees perfect okay so now i'm going to let the meat rest a little bit i also got some really beautiful heirloom tomato that i can use for my burger if you wonder how to tell if your tomatoes are ready just touch them if they are still very hard you know just let it [Music] rest for another couple of days check on them this one is really soft so i'm going to use this heirloom tomato one tip for you is never put your tomato in your fridge you know so just let it set at room temperature they will be just fine now we are going to assemble our burger first thing take the beautiful bun that you just made use a knife into half like this and then i usually prefer to have some iceberg you know a pure veggies here and then some tomato teriyaki chicken and i always love some cubey mayo so cute mayo here [Music] top [Music] tada your teriyaki burger is ready look at this my teriyaki burger is ready i can't wait to try this i'm starving [Music] oh this is amazing so delicious if you love teriyaki if you love burger must try this recipe please subscribe to our channel thank you for choosing cooking beautifully where memories are made you", "cR__enGHErk": "hey everybody I hope you're all having a fantastic day if you're not one of my beautiful subscribers please do hit the red subscribe button and also the notifications now so you don't miss any of my videos I'm Erica code and this is Erica coastal kitchen the water was boiling already I open my granules so I let that cook Wow I finished cutting it cheese's up so I got another block of cheese I'm using tell it was good at sharp cheddar cheese you ever cheese you want and I got one this is this is a lot for just one 8-ounce mm-hmm this is a lot but this is basically we just want one for just the you know it will be soon to meet the size all right so I'm gonna start this over because I don't want to confuse this with the measurements like I know this is eight ounce so I'm going to just go ahead and do this next block this is another eight ounce of sharp cheddar cheese it's gonna shred this ugly face [Music] and if you don't like all this cheese you won't have to have other cheese Emily that one is that one too so this is half an egg this one could produce more cheese on the Senate yeah yeah but that's not just the same alright so this is our sharp so I'm going to set this to set to the side then you got some Italian cheeses I'm one kid hey I had this is all depending on put that did they ever gonna start I got a block of this is New York white cheddar okay [Music] I knew who's been in there for what like maybe four minutes yeah make sure do your noodles you want to make sure that they or that didn't take you don't want to live a poem cuz they're gonna cook in the oven - all right so this is this little piece of I'm gonna leave this because I don't want my nose gone about you on it either unlikely you start looking your lips so I cut up all the cheese's i'ma set these two to the sack cause I want to make our cheese sauce now how salted butter you sold the butter but you know you just make sure you taste these if you're not make it something salty all right so just another they have a stick of butter down now that's nice and bubbly smells like something is burning up in here so you just want to mix that in your butter and I got this in the wrong hands so it's like really awkward this is gonna make the cheese sauce stick some and then some regular 2% mote just using a cups to start off with and I'm just more gradually it more dependent on the texture I like I don't like it like I like it's in because when you put them TVs in there it's going to start picking it up and I don't like that really sick texture like that so I'm just going to add regular 2% milk slowly according to the texture done before I think in the West because he was like really thick and it was this funky enough one that's good cuz I just got a whiff in his skin too [Music] all right so this cheese sauce is the texture I would like but I haven't added the cheese in yet so I'm gonna add some cheese in and then I may need more milk and I go along so I'm gonna go ahead um some sharp cheddar cheese in make someone looking here send it out a little bit so I'm just gonna taste it and see what that's pretty good I'm ask more cheese we gave more of a cheese flavor and I don't want to use all of it so this is real and spits it I probably used about eight and is maybe houses a sharp cheddar cheese two cups evaporated milk and 2% 2% more I'm gonna whisk this down and I already drank my noodle so I'm just going to it I got to UM think it's tablespoons of butter thanks how many my video I forgot to pay the ad so afterwards and so I'm gonna make sure in and out [Music] and this is the pending you know that we cook the news and so I'll be looking like I'm dirty I'm just the same the same pot so here's the cheese sauce I'm gonna dump that up in here mix this up and see how it's thick this is this is where I was trying to prevent I let it sit a little bit but I'm gonna just let it just be expand as this I'll find out I got these from Amazon and so I will leave the measurements in the description box to where you know where you can purchase them alright so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to first our spray the little bit olive oil in the pan so I want to take some of this mixture and just pour one into the bottom of here one layer and then we're going what we're gonna do is gonna take some cheddar cheese I have here don't just put that all in there that's the thing when you do grilled cheese it's like a lot thicker in some areas like this comes together so I'm gonna take some merrill cheese and so I'm a little taking my short cuz I'm gonna use that for the top I'm just gonna take something a mixture of cheese wherever she should go okay well mix that all together all right so my son took some of this drew we're not mix a I'm just gonna poke something take some more it's like the rest of it I'm gonna smear that across here take some cheese and take someone to smile chatter white cheddar sprinkle it all across the top my Italian cheese taking all the cheese's I have left except for the sharp because I want to have a sharp to keep the top I'm gonna Kappa mm-hmm really good soon all right so I'm just going to take this and poke again three burnout mixing it through just poke in this three I think it's just so thick so I get stuck on that spin but just swipe it off with your finger keep it moving keep going just get it make sure you get all spots cover it want some people again cheese make sure yep like I reason that's that so now I'm since I put that room just gonna take my sharp cheddar cheese I'm just going to cover the top you saw that cheeks uh-huh a lot of cheese it was that you want a good my friend cheese you want me Blanche eat my ran me won't get somebody something soccer go you bring it to the cookout again see you part the macaroni cheese Oh [Music] alright so that's that so I'm going to spray the top and then I'm gonna look more pepper on the top just sit just a little bit wrinkled alright so that I have a preview oven preheat the oven to 400 degrees so that's already ready and then we're going to put this in the oven for uncovered for about 20 to 25 minutes alright so the back for any of cheese just came up the oven it's been in there for 25 minutes on 400 degrees you can see the top looks very Brown looks good looks delicious I'm gonna let this sit for about five minutes 5-10 minutes and then we're cut into it and see how it looks so just go digging to see how the texture looks in the inside [Music] these stinky cheese looks good how can I just see how how good it is listen that's it yeah it spiked my heart I'm not trying to burn my muffin just not bring yes I can't even pick it up baby I'm gonna spin around [Music] thank you for watching scrap before you leave and I guess I'll catch you on the next video bye", "Zwgpy-hGmrM": "welcome back guys to beautiful Port Arthur Texas we're in this little marsh or about to be in this Martians mouth is right there there's practically zero wind glass

that's a red it's a flounder I keep miss calling Reds for flounders almost yep No there we go that's a fish that's definitely red oh yeah Wow it's clear back here that's a big fish Wow let's go guys got some big fish oh he did not fight hard that's a pretty pretty redfish took me out through the grass that it'll break you off right there check this out that's a big fish that is right at twenty six and a half that also makes our slam because we have floundering a trout right there and a redfish", "6odxfXJtDDI": "hi boys and girls this is Miss Christy and this is the video for our homework for tonight it's Homelink 7-5 multiplying mixed numbers by whole numbers oops the way okay so number one Michelle's grandmother sent her five small gifts for her fifth birthday each one we'd one and a half pounds how much did the gifts weigh all together number model with unknown okay so she has five small gifts and they each weigh a pound and a half so we're gonna multiply five times one half equals so then when we're doing our multiplication five times one is five five times one-half equals five halves which equals two and one-half so that so then we add five plus two and a half gives us seven and a half and that is the answer so I don't have pounds sorry that's kind of like mixed up over there between what two whole numbers is this seven and eight how many ounces did the give its way so we remember that one pound is equal to sixteen ounces so we're going to have to multiply 16 times seven and a half so we'll start off doing 16 times seven so 16 times 7 7 times 6 is 42 7 times 10 is 70 that's 112 and then 16 times one-half equals 16 halves G equals 8 so we add 112 plus 8 and that's 120 so it's gonna be 120 ounces okay next number - Rochelle bought 4 pieces of ribbon to finish a project each piece was 1 & 5 12 yards what is the combined length of the ribbon she bought so the number model with the unknown is going to be 4 times 1 + 5 12 4 times 1 is 4 4 times 5 12 equals 2012 12 goes into 20 one time with the remainder of 8 and then 4 + 1 + 8 12 equals 5 + 8 12 and you can simplify that fraction if you want also because 8 twelfths has a common factor of 4 so 8 divided by 4 is 2 12 divided by 4 is 3 so it's going to be 5 and 2/3 between what 2 whole numbers is this 5 & 6 how many feet is this so we know that there's 3 feet in a yard so we're gonna do 3 times 5 and 2/3 3 times 5 is 15 3 times 2/3 equals 6 thirds which equals 2 and then 15 plus 2 equals 17 so it's gonna be 17 feet ok so 3 times 4 & 5 6 so 3 times 4 is 12 3 times 5 6 equals 15 6 which equals 6 goes into 15 2 times with a remainder of 3 + 12 + 2 + 3 6 equals 14 + 3 6 and we can simplify that to 14 and 1/2 between what two whole numbers is this 14 and 15 and then our last one down here 6 times 7 and 3/8 6 times 7 is 42 6 times 3/8 it's 18 8 8 goes into 18 2 times with a remainder of 2 and then 42 + 2 + 2 8 equals 44 and to AIDS and we can simplify that to 44 and one-fourth between what two whole numbers is this 44 and 45 and then for the practice 3/4 plus 2/4 plus 1/4 3 5 6 6 fourths and we can simplify that to 1 and 2/4 which we can simplify further to one and a half 4 eighths plus 3/8 plus 2 eights 4 + 3 is 7 plus 2 is 9 and we can simplify that to 1 + 1 8 5 6 - 2 6 equals 3 6 which equals 1/2 in 88 - fifty seven hundred eighty eight hundreds - fifty seven hundredths equals eight minus 7 is 1 8 minus 5 is 3 31 hundredths and that's it I hope you have a wonderful night sorry I went kind of fast but I have to have an appointment and I have to get to you so I will

gentlemen cut", "6n3cIDsXyEY": "what we're going to do is we're going to change the oil and filter in this quad this quad has been sitting he told me for four years and storage this oil he has probably never changed this oil so it's gonna be a vitally important that we change the oil and filter on this four wheeler this four-wheeler was running pretty good I took it out and wrote it and was really impressed with it I hadn't written a full wheeler about three years or so I sold all my stuff and then I'm moving back in the crotch rockets and after riding this four-wheeler I'm gonna end up buying one so I'm not real sure I'm even gonna get a used one I might just go to the store buy a brand new one I haven't decided yet but this project really I really wasn't going to take on any more work from people because I don't really run a shop I just sell AMSOIL and then everything I work on sell my personal stuff so this little change will cover the Arctic a dbx 400 the Kawasaki KFX 400 and the Suzuki LTZ 400 this is a 2005 LTZ 400 but all those models will be the exact same so if you watch this video from start to finish then those models and I'll put the years in the link below will this oil change will work for that for those models and we're going to be running the AMSOIL 10 w 40 dirtbike oil not the ATV oil if you go to the links below on Amazon you can look up your quad and what oil that recommend for the ATVs you can really run through AMSOIL you could run the o w 40 depending on your climate and conditions now the manual won't state that you can run that but AMSOIL zero W 40 will cover up to a 10 W 40 protection so you're okay to run that if it's wintertime you can that will float to the top and faster if it's hotter you might have some dissipation issues where it may start trying to burn some of that lower weight oil off other than that you can also go to the ATV UTV ten W 40 which is completely fine or you could go to the 5w 50 which I don't really recommend you kind of want to stick in the 40 range I would say for this quad however those ATV UTV quads I am oil is kind of there okay for these that oil work fantastic for these sport quads that's more of a line of just ATVs you it's more utility based when you go and handle Amazon's website you'll see a lot of utility quads and whatnot there's a lot more utility quotes than there is market for the sport quads but once you get into the sport quads if you have engine modifications exhaust header jetting camshaft oversized Pistons a you know cylinder head porting bigger bowels you're gonna create more heat and you're gonna end up needing more engine protection and this dirt bike oil that was designed for motocross riders by amsoil for the sponsorship for the hams or dirt bike riders is what I would run in these sport cause no matter what sport quad you have be a raptor BMC you know just just a number of them I would run the dirt but not too fancy that's a two-stroke but I would run the dirt bike well myself there's different additives in the dirt bike oil which they give you more confident clutch feel depending on where you're riding where we where we used to ride around here you're in the woods and whether you're if you're gonna you know jump the quad out on the motorcycle track on the motocross track or you're in the woods you're going to climb a ginormous Hill and maybe you're coming down the hill you need to navigate around trees and whatnot clutch feel is vitally important so we're gonna run the dirt bike oil f---word for the added clutch feel and engine protection in this sport clod I really highly recommend it but what we're do is I will get this jacked up on the lift and this will end the series on the LTZ for Hunter we're gonna we're gonna warm this quad up and get the engine warmed up so we can get the oil to drain out then we'll go ahead and let it set for a couple minutes you don't want to do the oil when it's extremely high you can hear the pain running that new movement of radiator and that Dominator coolant boost that I put in nominator cool of Zeus will also let me get to get optimal temperature faster and keep it cool or longer which is actually really important when you're in the woods especially with no airflow so if you're gonna order some in so I'll go ahead and give that one and get the Dominator boots for sure and actually through some motorcycle octane boost in here but well let this end I'll get this up on the left and then we'll start changing alone okay now first things first your dipstick for either front oil canister will be underneath the front end of this quad and what we're going to do is we're just going to put our hand in here and then we're gonna remove it and it's stuck so I got to get a wrench so we'll just remove it [Music] [Music] there should be a dipstick on this the other is okay so we're going to remove the front oil drain plug on the front oil reservoir container and then we're going to go right to the engine the front one should be a twelve millimeter and on the engine it should be a fourteen millimeter and we'll just drain them out make sure your engine is warm that way all the oil will come out of it and then we'll move to the oil filter side and get the oil filter removed and replace and the one thing about the oil filter on these models is go ahead and get your o-ring seals from your dealer for the oil filter cap and internal oil filter oh ring as well I went ahead and got the spring because it was only a couple of dollars but I'm going to tell you something if you're going to go ahead and spend the money and invest in a good oil to prolong the life of your quad and and and basically save your quads value by running a good oil make sure you get those seals because if you throw out a thirty bucks for the oil in it and you don't get a new seal and then it starts leaking all of a sudden yeah you know you're going to run it out of oil so get the seals spend the [Music] just let the oil drain out then we'll just put the plug back in now we're gonna remove the bottom side plug to somebody really over toward that then we'll just clean this plug off and let it drain and reinstall it what we'll do is we will push this pan aside here and wring real dull this plug just make sure that you clean the magnetic tip on the end of it you know what no we're gonna let that all that drain out of there oh fantastic then we're gonna talk it down now for the last bit here we are going to remove the oil filter cover and if you look real close there's an arrow on the top side of this oil filter cover and that's the way that the oil filter cover is supposed to go on now these will be seven millimeters and eight there on there tight I'll tell you that just crack it and let it drain out of there from the bottom first there won't be a whole lot of oil but they'll be more than just pulling it off make less of a mess [Music] [Music] and there is the spring that I'm talking about talking about the spring and the seal the oil seal here sometimes you need to get a pic to get that filter out of her and I can't believe this this has actually got a stainless-steel reusable filter in it I believe and I'm not a hundred percent sure but I'm going to set this aside and I'm going to install the paper element filter now what I'm going to show you here is on the inside of this engine here as you can see there is supposed to be a or an o-ring seal in there so when the filter presses against here that you make sure that you get a good seal here on the inside of the engine and there is not one inside the engine here so this is another reason why you need to go and get your gaskets from the Suzuki Kawasaki or ArchiCAD before you get started that way you know that this process is being done properly it only costs about four or five dollars for those gaskets but you need to make sure that you're doing this right because you actually have engine failure if that if that ends up leaking and then it's not going to go through cycle through the oil filter itself and it'll blow the oil back through the outside of the filter and it won't get filtered so we're going to install that new o-ring there after we get this cleaned up [Music] okay so what we're going to do is we're going to place that over in place this o-ring back into where it needs to go I've got a little fresh oil here that we're gonna put on the o-ring itself before we install it see if I can get some light in here very important that that goes in there because that's the way it was designed you know I'm starting to start to notice that I'm starting to run into people that have watched my videos and want me to work on their stuff and they think they're smarter than the people that engineered and design this equipment I had a guy the other night that I had a guy the other night that showed up and he purchased some AMSOIL from me and when he did that his bike was having starting cranking problems and he had me listen to it when it did it so as the bike had the cranking problems I listened to it and within three seconds I knew what it was he had upgraded the motorcycle to a lithium ion battery and changed the headlights out to a xenon from a 12-volt system to a ballast operated system and the electrical current wasn't getting enough to the motorcycle to the starter in the sprag clutch and it was when the engine would be on the compression stroke of the engine of the motorcycle wouldn't crank over because it wasn't getting the power and a lot of people think that those 1tm ion batteries are just oh so much more training power yeah it might be but it's that bike wasn't designed for that that electrical system and he tried to sit there and argue with me because he works at a motorcycle shop and I just went through this with my other fellow in LA but I upgraded the battery cables in and dude I'm not gonna sit there and argue with you over what's wrong with that bike you know my dad had me a race car five years old and I was turning wrenches seven so when I when I see hear that stuff and see that stuff I'm 100% I know what the hell is wrong with it and this is another problem that I have my entire life here get all this oil off here get this new seal on there one of the main problems that I have is I've my entire life I've let people tell me what to do and that I was wrong and that I couldn't do stuff and then people they always were like oh you always like all this oddball and all this other stuff well I hate to tell you this but I put up that aprille MLA up for sale for 99 cents on eBay and got contacted by a luxury car dealer and he says well I'll take that bike and he said what other bike you got any other bikes I said well yeah I got a few other bikes so I've had some bikes in storage and he said I'll take every single one of them which that just re-evaluate just took myself that there's a market for all this stuff that I like but I like to get such this oddball stuff that around here now you just place your gasket in here around this area where I live at and I'm from people are into that stuff they're really just into Harley Davidson parts you know for motorcycles and I've actually been laughed at to my face because I wrote a Ducati motorcycle and these guys on these Harley's I just I just don't get it so basically what it's coming down to is I'm trying to get my house fixed and I really 100% believe that I'm worth 80 to 90 dollars an hour working on this stuff if I was to go into business by myself and with my knowledge and how much stuff that I've worked on and all this other stuff I don't see why I can't do that so and if you bring your quad or your motorcycle the mean it's going to be done right it might take me a little longer to do it but like right here on these on these on these over in gaskets dude if you took this into a shop they wouldn't even have changed these o-rings they would have just taken it in their change the oil and been done with you but yeah so that's kind of the goal is I want to start my little shop and build motorcycles and I might get back into the TV market but the thing of it is is that market isn't here when I used to work it Stanley Steemer I've been in more multi-million dollar houses than most people have seen in their whole lives so I know who the clientele that I want to deal with are like the guy who brought me this lift that sold me this lift that had the Ferrari that owned the Ducati that's the kind of guy that I need to be doing business with not these people that don't have a lot of money that wanted that don't want their stuff repaired properly and want a cheap out on the repair bill because they bought something that cost seven thousand dollars but then they want to sit and argue with you over and over that costs two dollars and and because they think they're right well it's their bike but I know what I'm doing so but we'll get this other third bolt in here and get this tightened up but this is just going to take me some time to do this and the other thing with the open in my shop in my business is I'm a hundred percent that free as of almost a year ago through the Dave Ramsey program so I've got to sell off my inventory of motorcycles to fund myself for the next business adventure so anybody that buys an ant oil the anvil purchaser really helped you know because it's helping me basically achieve my dream but the the biggest thing about this dream that I have is that I can't do it where I'm living I finally realized it I have to go to a heavier populated area that I just can't do it here in Illinois so okay so we got our three bolts snug and now we're going to put some oil back into the reserve okay so we're just going to prep the oil here and actually because of the location of of the front oil tank I'm going to use the nozzle and the adapter that I usually use in the majority of everything that I fill up you know these novels can be headed for by the dollar and these adaptor nipple pieces can be have for like a dollar sixty or something for like six of them not not 100% sure but I'll put the links below that way if your grams or then you can just see there but what we'll do is we'll go ahead and go to the front here and fill this up starting to sweat getting a little agitated if you do an oil filter change it says two point one if you just do the oil it says 2.0 so we're going to put about two point one to point two in there and then we'll just run it check the level and see where we're at with the dipstick and then you'll want to run it and then let it set for about three to four minutes and then check the dipstick and then if you need to add oil run it again and then double check it so let's get over here fill this out okay it's kind of hard it's kind of hard to get in the picture here so we'll just start adding oil to it and make sure that's not going to leak and we'll just we'll just do this as slow as possible we're not in a big rush for this what we'll do is well I'll add two quarts and then we'll run it after two quarts [Music] okay so we almost got this cord in here oh let's start the fart on me you might want to get it from a different angle it might be easier to get it all the fluid in there go up side with it between the shock and the front fender okay and we'll go get the second quart here [Music] and we'll go ahead and start adding the second Clerk there we go like I said no no rush here the main thing the main thing here is I'm trying to I need to get a beer garage guys I got this lift in here and I just I have no room to do anything anymore like this four-wheeler I mean I can't do anything I can't even move these motorcycles around I can't park in this garage anymore and it's super important for me to have a garage with a so I get my car in there during winter time if I'm if I'm living here because my whole life I park outside so it's a it's a really big deal for me to park in a garage it's just something I wanted when I bought a house now this will take some time with these nozzles of as you can see I've spilled a drop of this oil under this engine and you really with the wet clutch system on these sport quads you really need to use a ATV oil whether this is a dirt bike oil but an oil that is wet clutch compatible I watched a video where a guy went got engine a little for a car I just thought oh my god I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to make a video on this and there we go got a lot of air in it there we go there's the two forks there and now what we will do is we'll start it up first we'll put this dipstick back in there then we'll start it up and let it run for a couple minutes [Music] okay so what we're going to do is I'm going to lower this down a little bit and then I'm going to run the engine now that the you know all the engine oil and filters replaced and we'll let it warm up and then we'll let it set for a couple minutes and then check the oil again and see if we need to add any oil [Music] okay let's get this okay let's get this thing started up here okay and as you can see we're pretty much done here running the engine oil the m's all you could tell that the engine oil was starting to break down and it hadn't been changed for a while because if you go here I'll show you the lift or noise the valves have quieted down when I started running the new oil so that's kind of an indication also as well once the oil starts to break down and it's not as well maintained but another nap will check the dipstick and then probably be done okay we'll just pull the dipstick here and insert it back and I'm pretty sure you want to thread it all the way down and then we will see if we need to add oil I don't think we're going to I will tell you this that internal oring that was missing on the oil filter side if you paid attention there was actually metal shavings in the bottom of the the bottom of the oil pan after I drained the oil which is not good if that does not have a good seal on the back into that oil filter if you have metal shavings like that it'll blow past that oil filter possibly and go right into the engine so it's very important that you put that rear a ring on that oil filter on the backside so okay everything looks decent so we're pretty much done here call the guy and have him come pick this puppy up so I can start working on that other approval you okay I'm all finished up and this concludes this series if you're watching this video they'll be a

not make it but everyone that's here welcome william no i don't do uh boosting for hso boosting for cars anymore i quit doing that about five years ago well the truth is gas prices went way down so it forced a bunch of us out of business so i concentrated on some other areas looks like there's about a seven second delay between the camera and uh your comments that i before i can see them so it'll take me a bit to respond to him hi george okay so it's 9 35 so i'm gonna get going so a lot of you or a lot of people have been asking for an attachment for their browns gas machines to make the deuterium depleted water and i've come up with something that i just wanted to share with the community instead of trying to market it or sell it um what i will do is i'll put a list of materials in the bottom of this video so that you guys can go pick up all the parts and assemble these yourself at home not hard to do but it did take a while to figure out how to do it with these machines and i'm going to share that with you today but first i want to show you the concept of how it actually happens and how we can collect the uh deuterium depleted water um so so i've got uh here i've got one my browns gas machine here and then connected to it is a torch and the way that the water is created is inside the machine the electricity separates the water into hydrogen and oxygen that's where we get our gas and then it's pumped through the output port and into this torch and when you light it it it'll obviously burn and it's obviously flammable but something really cool happens when it is the flame comes in contact with with with metal or any material you can actually see how the hydrogen and oxygen recombine back into water and when it when it recombines back into water this is when it's it said it's the first time i lit a torch i was really amazed at the properties that the flame has but one thing i did notice is that uh it when you put it up against something you could see that water was being created i thought that was really cool but i didn't put two and two together until just last year i i didn't know anything about uh ddw uh until i started learning a little bit about it and then i put two and two together that uh it could you could create it by this process so i'm gonna show you uh how the water or how the hydrogen oxygen combine back together and form the water i've got a just a stainless steel plate here and i'm going to run the flame over it and show you how you can you'll be able to see the water forming on the plate so i'm going to go ahead and start up the machine get it going [Music] i'm not even really sure the stream is going anymore it's just uh it's just chugging over here oh there we go looks like it's got a real large delay now okay so so go ahead and light the flame it's really hard to see i don't even know if you'll even be able to see it there it's a little tiny flame now this machine is making about 400 to 500 milliliters per minute you can see it's not much of a flame but i'm going to see if i can get this on camera for you you can see now as i kind of touch the flame to that plate see that condensation there that's that's water you can see how it's the water is forming on the plate there there so what we want to do that that water there is pure and it's free of deterio mostly i'll explain later why it's not completely free but what we want to do is we want to we want to build a way to capture that water so that we can use the water and that's that's what i'm going to show you how to do any questions so far okay if i were to hold this torch to that plate long enough it would melt right through okay before we start building it let's talk a little bit about safety so this this technique is going to work on any bronze gas machine so whatever you've got it's going to work on but you're going to want to be safe so uh this flame the bronze gas flame has a perfect uh mixture of oxygen in it for for it to burn so if i were to light it here without this torch tip it would burn up through here all the way back to your hose into your machine and then when it hits an air pocket like here this is going to explode okay so what we do is we put a flash arrester in line so so when you quench this flame you'll always get a flashback so when i turn this off it'll flash back every time well most of the time not all the time when the flame is larger and you've got more more gas volume it'll definitely flash back so you're going to get a flashback every time you turn it off so we put a flash raster in line that flash comes through the line and stops at the arrester and i always recommend to have two safety measures so there's two flashback arresters in this system there's one inside if you're going to do this i'd run two of these in line just to be super safe because no one wants uh an explosion in their face so i'll put it bluntly okay yeah there's other ways of making deuterium depleted water this is one of the ways there's there's a better way to do it that most of the companies that are producing it are doing it but it costs a whole heck of a lot of money to set it up correctly this way can be done by just about anyone um the testing i got from simple lab here's the one test i did it was on a it was on a different uh setup but it came back at 44 ppm and uh i'll show you some ways that i think i can lower that number down that was uh pretty raw when i first sent it sent the sample out but uh i was a little disappointed in that i was hoping to get you know 25 or lower but it's a good place to start and another place i'm using let me get the kit here's a this is the one i'm going to use next time and i don't remember the name of the place all right let's see www.ddcenters.com and it's just a little kit here you measure out a little water in a vial and send it back to use a mass spectrometer to read how much deuterium deuterium's in the water i don't know what to do about the the freezing uh feed i'm doing this on my cell phone i don't have any of those the fancy cameras and that kind of thing but uh after this is done it'll be automatically uploaded so you can rewatch it i apologize okay so so what we're going to be building essentially looks like this it's a crazy setup but it works and i'm gonna show you how to do it so i've got the parts here all these things i got from home depot and you can use stainless steel fittings if you want so i've got a couple couplings a coupling an adapter a t and a couple nipples then i need some teflon tape and i've got a coil of 20 foot of copper quarter inch i try to use the stainless it's a little bit harder to work with but uh i suggest taking all these parts out and cleaning them thoroughly because once you start building the water through it's gonna pick up anything that's on the inside and just gonna you're gonna get it into your water and also um recommend after making some some ddw to distill it so you get any of the things out there you know in the lines and the copper lines okay so essentially what we're going to do is we're going to build a chamber that we can stick the torch tip into and we're going to seal the seal the top so the flame goes down inside and all the condensates collect and they run down the tube and as the the steam will be steamed there too as a steam going through the tube it'll condense on the walls of the tube and then form into water and we'll collect it at the bottom with a uh in some kind of container let me get all this stuff out of its packaging oh and also the the secret component that makes it work is this aquarium pump i spent a bunch of time trying to keep the flame lit with all these different configurations so i couldn't keep the flame lit until i added this to the system i'll show you how to use that i'm not an expert on frequencies so i'm not really sure i'm not actually not really sure that a frequency can be imprinted on a gas but it's it's possible i don't know how someone would verify that that was for john okay so what we're going to do is we're going to put these parts together i'm going to wrap these with teflon tape just a little bit of tape to seal it up okay wrap these two ends all right that's going to go in there this in here um this one down here and this over here that's going to complete the the chamber so this is where we're going to put our torch of course this torch just happened to fit in here really nice and we're going to put a little bit of teflon taper on this so we get a seal and then we're going to build our coil and attach it to here a condensing coil you're going to want to take these and we're going to want to tighten these down okay yeah okay so you always want to bubble your water that filters out some things some impurities and also to make the gas more more pure i guess for making deuterium depleted water uh you want to take out any moisture in the gas because any moisture in the gas could have deterium in it and then it ends up and ends up in your water so if you were to take and use a dryer and run your gas through a dryer this would dry the gas take out any moisture in the gas whatsoever so you just have pure hydrogen and oxygen this i think will lower the deuterium number greatly but i haven't i haven't sent in a sample yet which i'm going to be doing to see if that actually is true and inside of here this is just a water filter housing inside of it is desiccant beads that you can you can get those on ebay or amazon and that completely dries out the gas okay let's make our coil neat thing about these from home depot it comes already pre-coiled so if you don't want to coil it smaller you can just leave the coil big like that i'm going to make a smaller coil i'll show you how to do that so here i've got a six inch pipe i'm going to coil this around the pipe so i can make myself a six inch coil all right so let's just start the coil around if i'm lucky i'll get this all straight oops oh thanks for answering that question okay uh i don't know if i mentioned but this is a 20-foot coil so you're gonna need a pretty long coil because this thing heats up pretty good it takes a bunch of coils to cool it down but by the bottom of the coil it's cold and we're getting to the end here i could have probably coiled this a little tighter but trying to save a little time here okay okay there's our coil and we're going to need is another small coil let me cut this off so this is the tubing cutter get this at any home center in the plumbing department it makes a nice perfect cut all right so there's that coil now we're going to make another smaller coil to put the air into from the aquarium pump this is a four inch piece you could just coil it in any way you like it's just to dissipate a little bit of heat before it gets to the plastic so it's got some some rubber tubing in there that we'll use but we don't want it melting so doing a little coil here so it can dissipate some heat before it gets to that tube okay now this stand i've got on amazon it's a like a lab stand i'll put a link in the description down there so you can get one now what we're going to do is we're going to attach our main coil to this fitting here and then the smaller coil to this fitting here so so just put a bend in it there you want everything to always travel downhill so as your water is collecting or condensing in this line if you if it goes uphill and then goes back down you'll you'll collect a bunch of water in the tube and it'll take a long time for it to for you to get any water off the end so you don't want to collect them in the tube so do that now we're going to put this on here this is the i want to cut this in because it's a little bit mangled there it's not going to i'm not going to be able to put that on there unless i cut a little bit off see the end of the tube there if it's not completely round the fitting won't fit on so all right and that fits right on okay we're going to tighten that a little bit once you tighten this it won't come off that ferro will be locked onto the onto the tube there we go now we're going to attach this smaller one the side here everyone's still there or did the string cut out uh okay all right now we've got our chamber and our condensation condensation tube condensing tube and this here is for our pumped in air this here is to hold it all so there we go do i think i lost the feed it looks like i'm still there but no one's saying anything oh yeah i guess guess it's still gone k is still there okay all right there we go all right now we're going to hook our pump up the reason why we need this pump because with these bronze gas machines that don't produce that much gas under a liter per minute the flame will go out so we do is we add a little bit of air to the system so that our plane won't won't get extinguished let's start up the brown gas machine get it going this one here has a dual output uh i got it because you can adjust the flow on it i wasn't sure how much air would be needed to keep the flame going but um this came in handy being able to adjust the flow you'll have to adjust it uh and uh to the point where your flame stays lit so this here we'll need a extra piece of tubing come on so that's quarter this is 5 16. you need a piece of 5 16 slip your tubing in so it'll slip over the quarter inch here okay last thing is you can install your torch i'll put a link to in the description where to get these and also these flashback arrestors make sure you have two flashback arresters installed and then just install your output line onto the torch now on the end here in order to get it to seal up here on top we're going to put some teflon around this fitting here to look something like that so just wrap teflon around it look something like that that's going to seal it now we're going to go ahead and light it and then all you do is stick it in the top there it'll fit in nicely and seal and that's it now we're capturing that uh water that's condensed recombined together we're capturing it here in these tubes and it's going to cool as it goes through the copper line and then you're going to get deuterium depleted water out the bottom if we didn't have the air going through you wouldn't be able to sustain a flame so we need to put some air through it to sustain the flame also it's nice to have the air going through if your flame goes out all your lines will fill with brown's gas and then when you light your torch to put it back in the tubes will be full of browns guys you'll get a you'll get a big pop all the gas inside the lines will explode you'll get a big pop so this air going through it keeps the keeps the gas actually pushes the gas out of the tubes so that when you light it again and put it back in there you won't get that pop this this now is going to start to heat up it's going to get really hot you can feel that it's hot it's getting warm down here and then these are all still cool okay so here is the here's the kicker about this whole thing so you can only make as much deuterium water as the water that's being split inside the generator so if your machine can split an ounce of water in an hour the most deterium depleted wire you can get is an ounce if you have a high powered machine that runs at two three four five liters per minute it's going to be able to split more water faster so you'll be able to produce more deuterium depleted water so with this machine at about 450 to 500 milliliters per minute can produce one ounce of deuterium depleted water in about two and a half hours so it's not a very fast process i was able to get this from this machine in about two and a half hours now this here i sit in a large sample the other company had me take a large symbol but i filled this all the way to about here this i made with another machine that generates about four liters per minute and it took me about 16 hours to get all this at 4 liters per minute and then what i did is i ran it through a distiller i have a home distiller to take out any impurities and that this is the water that i sent the sample in that came back at 44 ppm so now it's going to take quite a bit of time before you you get a drop out of here but just put yourself a container or something to collect the water at the bottom okay ready to take some questions i'm not sure i understand your question hans no you don't have to run the gas through a bubbler if you're going to distill the water afterwards i don't think it's going to matter um if you don't have a bubbler that's fine but the bubbler takes out you know any lie that might escape uh if you don't take out the lye it's gonna end up in the gas and you may see it in the in the deuterium depleted water so i think it's a good idea to bubble the water first now we're real hot here now so now it's warm down to about here and super cool down here either the stream's lagging or there aren't any questions i'll leave the stream open for a few more minutes if anyone else has any questions i haven't done that calculation yet but at the rate uh the amount of money they charge for this water in my larger setup over here i could have easily saved a bunch of money making my own let me show you the other machine move this camera over here so this here is it's a little bit of a mess right here but this is the other machine um just to give you an idea how big it is there's my hand i've got a big hand too so that's it's 59 plates the plates are eight inches across it'll make five liters a minute easily uh water tank there and then i'm bubbling it through this large bubbler here safety first there's a flash port up there and then it goes down into a series of dryers i've got three in here now and then through this is a flashback arrestor also and then here is here's the torch i'm using for this one it's larger and then the chamber i use is right there and it's got the coil down here anyway i just set that up to uh to make enough water to send back for a test but uh yeah this machine it has the variable output here so you can control it that's that's the uh ac to dc converter because these generators run on dc and that just plugs right into the wall and over here i've got the my home so i distill the water before i send in for a test so this machine here will make the water a lot faster and it uses uh uses quite a bit of electricity but the amount of water you get out will be a lot cheaper than than buying it and before when i got the 44 ppm i didn't have these dryers here so i'm pretty sure if i dry the gas completely i can lower that number hans no the air pump keeps the flame from being extinguished it keeps the flame lit without the air pump if you're running a machine under a liter per minute the flame is going to go out so you need to pump a little bit of air in there to keep the flame going so that's what the pump's for yeah it's not it's not for cooling the air it's just to keep the flame lit it's also to keep the the lines free of any bronze gas in case of place in case the flame goes out it clears all the lines of brown's gas so that when you put your flame back in it doesn't ignite all the bronze gas in the tubing well i want to thank everyone for stopping by um appreciate you

sharing with you a very special project this is my july 2020 christmas in july project for rene of bouquets i have chosen these items to show you different things that you can get from renee bouquets and also to remind you of this month's special which is a coupon that will work on any beautiful board pieces that you may purchase i've used for this project a repurposed board i've also used items from spellbinders and of course little items from my stash that i have incorporated into this beautiful beautiful home decor piece to begin i wanted to show you an up close of all of these different items that i've used here which are the beautiful box small square shaker box the small shabby christmas tree different snowflakes a beautiful word that says merry christmas i've used holly flourish laser cut chipboards and the decorative scroll flourishes i've also used holly and berry tuck-ins here and there of course i've also as you can tell use the red mulberry paper poinsettias and holly leaves flower set i've also used jingle bells in the six six millimeter size and the cranberry translucent glass micro beads so let me point those out for you so you can see how i've incorporated these items into this gorgeous project the first thing that i did was that i selected a board that believe it or not was a sign for the fourth of july and i've stripped it away i took everything off and i just left it as the particle board in the background i then took some designer paper perhaps you can see some of the detail here it's christmas paper that i've adhered onto this board what i started doing was assembling this little scene that you see here with the little girl isn't she adorable and she's got her little christmas gift she's already opened that up and she's riding around with her little horse here but here's what i did i went ahead and tied some of these little bells that you can get from rene bouquets onto that little horse i just thought that that would be playful and fun as you can tell this is a very victorian style home decor piece what i did here was that i took the christmas tree now this comes in a nude color all of the beautiful board pieces come with no color at all it's up to you what you want to do with it so what i did was that i used three different colors of green and also some gold gilding i did back that up with a lighter green paper and i topped it off with all sorts of little bobbles just as you would see on a traditional christmas tree in anyone's home that's been decorated by small children and you know how children are they will put up anything that's shiny it doesn't even have to match children don't care about that sort of thing so that's exactly what came to mind when i was putting this little tree together so these little bobbles are actually made of felt these of course are little gems and i went with a red and green and just played around with it and had some fun um because i wanted this to have some whimsy to it just as any other project that i make here i made a little fireplace now this is one of the beautiful box square shaker boxes from rene bouquets that you can pick up so yes there are this is a shaker so even if it were to swing at any moment you could get that interaction there so what i did was that i created a little fireplace all i did was paint some paper i cut it out in the shape of flames and i also used a piece of felt ribbon that i layered on top to create that look of flames and those little bricks that you see there are hand colored bricks that i also made with beautiful board pieces from renee's shop on here you see this gorgeous holly with the ribbon this is also hand colored i went ahead and altered that to match and that is also available from renee bouquets as well as these gorgeous snowflakes that you see here every single one of these are also hand painted to match the background and i've also even added little dots of nuvo drops in bronze so that way they would coordinate with the background here's another one that i used to top off the christmas tree and i added a sequin and gem on top of that and it was just all so much fun to put together to make sure that it would be coordinating one with the other these beautiful board pieces here these corner pieces that you see what i did here with these flourishes was that i first painted them in red and then i used gold gilding and let me see if you can see if i hold it here at an angle you can see that so you can tell that there's some gold gilding there i did the same with the merry christmas and this is backed up with a nice dimensional frame here and i did use a spellbinders die to add this to the board and what i did here was that i painted the merry christmas and i also used the gold gilding and all of those little micro beads that you see there are the cranberry colored micro beads available from rene bouquets here's the little snowflake that i hand colored and added there and then topped off with a little red bead and they there are the gorgeous poinsettias that you can get from her shop so just to let you know regarding the poinsettias this is what they look like when you get them from renee's shop they do have a light beige colored center and these are just completely white what i did was that i altered mine and that's what's so great about these pieces is that you can make them your own so i'm having to hold this sideways so it'll fit in frame but if you see here what you can do is you can paint these to match whatever project you're making all i did was that i painted them with bronze and gold colors and then of course i sprayed them as well with gold so that way this would match the background here and these little flowers here these two as well as these smaller ones are not from renewable cases were given to me but the poinsettias are all from her shop and then i did add some nuvo drops to the center i just colored these centers with nuvo drops that way it would match my project there so all of these little holly pieces that you see here these beautiful board pieces are printed and they are also from her shop it's all available there as well as these pieces down here i'll be linking down below this video all of the details and the names of all of these products so that you can take a closer look they all come in as i mentioned before a nude color so you get to color them as you wish with the exception of course of the ones that are already printed but i also wanted to show you another example of the little fireplace that i made there that's a shaker box as i said before so here's another one for this one i used glitter paper and i used some of the snowflakes from renee's shop as you can see there and those i did not color so you can see that this is very versatile you can make them however you like and what's wonderful is that it is transparent on both sides so if you wanted to use it as an ornament even you can do that you don't have to of course adhere it to another surface but i hope that this serves as inspiration for you that you like this project let me know what you think in the comments below of course i'd love to get your feedback all of these items of course are available in the shop at this moment it's a wonderful time this month of july to get started on your christmas projects and all of your christmas gifts this one was very easy to make it was just a matter of just putting them all together and coloring them and having fun with the different pieces so i hope as i always say that you can be inspired and be blessed and i thank you so much for watching bye [Music] you", "uNtzUPT3IDY": "charm buying can be very confusing let's see if we can simplify it today\nwe're going to use the coin

you turn the volume down and um thanks for arms family homestead that just um showed our flag and gave us a shout out on his channel we're so thankful for that um and you know we reached it really quick so we're going to be giving some giveaways uh tonight so just want to give it some time to everybody get on um and we may do a tribute like 5m um homestead did last night we've always did the numbers but we may look into doing the uh actual tribute so we finally hit it 5 000. i would uh i mean honestly maybe if i point it up right way to go [Music] [Music] um it's raining here right now so we just got back from the creek was actually making a video but uh it's raining so we decided to come in here and actually do the live uh we just closed the video out in here we uh and i'll read some comments here in a second i'm always the one he's here i'm always the one whoa talks all the time don't know how to shut it up um nancy we did receive our package today and here you go kiddos what do y'all say [Music] here bubba or scoot over thank you so much raise them up and show everybody what nancy sent y'all awesome nancy said late in the chicken book so he can learn all about chickens um they haven't really got to look through it very much we like literally just [Music] we literally just got done closing out um this video we're going to post probably tomorrow so the kids super excited i don't want to get the here we'll put these up real quick and then y'all can we can read them when we go back inside okay and we also got a couple other gifts  won't let that one go um we also got a couple other gifts for the kids i don't know there was no name this is was just shipped in a box um yeah i'm not going to give them all to the kids but someone sent the kids all um fish nets so um we actually went to the creek today hoping that we could actually use these but the creek was up a little bit too much for us to actually go down there and use them so yeah we made a little like river thing out of rocks yep we did didn't we wow 38 people already in here um 40 40 people wow so here in just a few minutes we're going to uh do a giveaway we're going to give away one of our shirts um looks like this we have them in gray and you can also if you if you want the um the the writing and stuff in white you can actually um request that i'm actually going to change all of our shirts as soon as we get rid of the black ones i'm going to change all the the gray shirts to watch um walker farm fam they use white on theirs and it just sticks out a lot better so we're going to change ours to white just like theirs and here is uh a black one that's blue well it's dark blue this was one of the very first ones that uh we actually just got sent on this is one of our trial shirts that we tried when we first started making them and we just ordered a large bulk of shirts so um some some of them are just a little bit off but now that we got a place that we can get all of our shirts and stuff we're super excited about that my name is my name your name cassie said hey so what do you say thank you did you say thank you when she said hey when she said hey say hi hi she said she said hey cason too yeah wait can you say hi hi bye he's too busy looking at his butt did you put the other one super taps okay be careful okay so um anyways how's everyone doing we're getting a lot of rain right now hey stand up 47 people that's a bunch wait how do you win someone layton's the chicken man um we haven't decided we're going to do the numbers or if we're going to do the uh tribute like walker farm fam and uh 5 vm family uh fabio fabium homestead actually did the tribute last night as well um steph got kind of mad at me because he was not fast enough i was not fast enough i actually had the numbers in there and i thought i hit enter and she said hit enter and i didn't so we would have won but i forgot to hit enter i put the numbers in and forgot to get entered so she was upset we will win one of the five film uh hats um leighton is the really big hat man but their hats just stick out if y'all have not if y'all have not checked out 5m uh homestead is it isn't it 5am homestead yeah 5m homestead go check them out they're not very far from us they're south just a little ways in texas so we are going to be getting together here pretty soon and uh doing a collaboration video um they're new as well they started about the same time as walker farm fam also if you're not subscribed to walker farm fam go check their uh channels out as well um and all these channels that i say they're family channels and that's the reason why i will uh you know uh give them shout outs i want people to go check out these family channels because there's so many of them we got to the point now that all we do is basically watch youtube and it's our our family channel hey yeah easy with the books that that think that yeah easy don't tell them the kids absolutely love them nancy um so please you need to bend down now i can can you see them it just shows yeah thank you for posting the links um cassie thank you so much please go check out walker farm fam and um 5m homestead addison's the birthday girl every day yep she is she says it says right there it says nancy or addison is a birthday girl every day right there here daddy's gotta read comments wait see it please oh yeah okay um y'all smash that like button and that goes in effect or not if we hit 75 thumbs up we will give another shirt away so most definitely smash the like button everyone knows that in our live chats we

eyes were getting lighter they are pretty light today i think maybe because he has a gray shirt on because i know blue his eyes turn more bluish but then normally it's more like a hazel or more

helps out a lot wait don't shine your astra she emailed it you know yeah good job don't put you on the actual thing any neighbors we have one neighbor no from here from the new house but but it's an older couple that it's pretty friendly yeah and it will still be probably 600 feet um from our house it's still where our house is actually going to be where we're going to build our house you cannot see our house from the roadway um so that's the good thing one part oh yeah we hit 5000 too yes we hit 5000. i don't know how i forgot that is it bear property or home on it also it's bear property we're going to be building the home build our house all right i made a tick tock video about that but uh i was really tired and when i get tired i get really goofy um and yesterday i was what was i was off yes no i was off yes you were supposed to be but the day before right before i got off work we got dispatched to a crash on 35 and we was literally there for an hour and 20 minutes and i was blocking traffic and i was sitting in the middle of 35 so i was like you know what i haven't tried a actual live view with the membership yet so we went live on the member 66 on the member uh deal and it was absolutely awesome it worked out perfect just like i wanted there for a while we couldn't figure it out but you know um just basically talked about what we're going to be doing with the house and and the only reason why i did that is because when i do the law enforcement stuff i tried to do most of that on there just to keep the trolls away because most time the trolls isn't going to join a membership to chris criticize me and um we've had some people you know take uh some of our videos out of context and uh try to get me in trouble send it to my boss but you know just like he said on the uh videos i posted on some of my pursuits and crashes and stuff is he told the the person that called and sent the video in that it's no different than watching uh live pd or cops you know the trial the case is over the person's either been proving guilty or or or charges were dropped so it's just it doesn't matter what you do um somebody's always going to try to run uh the situation go ahead and talk net in my birthday no next month is your brother's birthday your birthday won't be around for another year because you just had your birthday two days ago yeah i i haven't really got to live in the country since i was about 17 18. no i was out of school so um it's going to be nice for sure hopefully you won't have problems with trespassing like dutch has had yeah oh yeah i hope not um but quit now um i'm not at in oklahoma now if you're a law enforcement officer you can actually have all your addresses and stuff anonymous um that's for safety reasons because um some cops was having people come to their house and um you know it's just i i have a lot of people come in the house now but it's for good reasons sometimes so um but anyways back on lobby so back okay let's start tick tock goofy video so i got off work at four o'clock come home lay down and and end up getting another call that we need to get to the interstate and we had something else happening and i was gone for about three hours and we finally got in bed about 12 30 and i got called out again that we had a signal 30 which is uh someone that is deceased and then when we got there it ended up to be in a uh a homicide so literally i did not get home until right at three o'clock yesterday so we was up 36 or i was up 36 hours straight and i was really goofy in making some tick tock videos so it was pretty cool phil said leighton really keeps things moving along producer beverage runner technical advisor i don't even know what that means means you do a lot around here oh yeah dude okay hi y'all next month is terry's birthday terry who terry raymond red reed mourns cindy said that was a lot of fun talking live with you yeah i absolutely loved it um which you know i posted that one and then i went back off of a buddy's account to go in to see if i could find the video without being the member and i couldn't so that made me feel better because i just don't want that out there to everyone um and it's only really people that kind of know about it so no we are not going to be around those train tracks well thank you you might um the stuff brad said people need to stop stuck you are not hurting nobody and people don't like cops if you have something bad to say about brandon and his family you will have to have me on your butt thank you brad uh hello rustic woodwork found your home thanks for joining us we we're still going to give some stuff away we gave a couple shirts away already two or three two we're still around the same area ruth so um we're probably what three hours away from

blank cross timber blessing and then jimmy houston fishing outdoors is here in our county wait fishing outdoors it's jimmy houston it'll be the big 60 on the 18th so happy early birthday that is our goal hopefully one day we will um get to meet jimmy which we've met him before but what my deal is i would absolutely love to get jimmy and see if he would take my dad fishing just for a little bit because my dad has talked about him all through his life and it would be so awesome to to to see it and uh i told steph if i could get that done i wouldn't even bring a camera i wouldn't even want to try to i just want to make my dad happy um it would be really neat uh to get that done so hopefully we can do that one day happy early birthday to earl too he would be 63 on sunday 63. oh kelsey i won't be i guess i won't be mad you aren't moving to northeast oklahoma if only his job would have let us dead yeah it wouldn't awesome well yeah a good old boy just turned 44 on the 31st i would it's actually beautiful i thought we had pretty much i actually thought whiz only one had mountains in oklahoma but y'all's place is absolutely beautiful um congratulations brandon wait yup i can promise you just for memories yeah i can promise you um god had his hand on us with this property deal it worked out perfect that would be cool jimmy houston could yes that would be absolutely cool so here we go i'm gonna let y'all choose should we do the tribute or should we do the number let's do the numbers and we're at 96. i hope we've hit 100 so far at one time no no no no she was saying the door come here get up there show that show them what she was doing hey how do you do that yeah no no no no no no no no there's never a dull moment at our house never a dull moment uh we have numbers numbers tribute trip uh trivia um numbers numbers numbers [Music] lazy [Music] i think um that's the one we was watching from rivage life right when we first joined ritual f awesome okay we're going to do numbers hey really hey hold on she's a doll they said you're a doll addison can write the number this time no they didn't say that yeah addison's gonna write this number oh did you already write what no oh that was upside down okay we have 98 so we're going to same same instructions pick one number only if if you for instance for instance if it's 100 and someone picks 99 someone picks 101 we're gonna have a drawing um one number only and then uh the closest will have a drawing if more than one person actually picks the right number we'll have a draw off and i think that's right and they're all just guessing one through 150 i'm sorry one through 150. okay so i don't even know what the number is no no they don't need to know what the number is he'll give it away yeah show us you'll see yeah so cassie i think i think we're going to kind of adopt your ideal on shipping your shirts as well i think we're going to let the kids make a little um a drawing or write something uh to send with their shirts so we're going to adopt that deal that's a good idea i had a lot of people on earth i had a lot of people when they ordered their flags they wanted to sign it but is this kind of hard for all the kids to sign it but we went and got a bunch of finger paint so maybe we'll take the paint and let them touch the back of the flags and stuff so i think i'm gonna put that option on the website because i know some people that aren't coming from the actual um quick quick quick quick some people ain't actually coming from youtube so we will uh make it to where it'll be optional some people hangs it outside so um that'll be awesome definitely if you're wanting a flag before christmas you want to get the orders in because we we're only guaranteed 300 flags by christmas time and if we do get 300 or we go all the way through and we have time we're going to build some more um just how the time comes along just so i'm going to give you a break 25 seconds yeah dead 10 103 people wow that's awesome 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 i can't stop no more numbers at this time no don't give the number out we're going to make sure no one numbers there's not i

lettering to all white it just looks better but if you prefer black please let me know but we're eventually going to go to all white to get eye cream yeah because we just ordered a a big big industrial roll of white so that'll work out perfect how many subs do we need to do she needs to change her red shirt to gray i thought we sent that now where linda you're saying that um um cassie said did we send it to the wrong linda no ask if she needs to change her red shirt to a great did was there linda tonight that won no that was i believe a while back remember we could never find the red shirts okay so we haven't send it no um linda what size i'm i'm terribly sorry that's that's let me make sure that's my fault that i don't write this stuff down and um we're getting a lot better

can cut anything please go over there and check him out tell him rustic would work and finally sent you over there and what that what that does for us as youtubers it just kind of helps to see what traffic is going where it it just kind of it's kind of like analytics it just kind of shows and helps so please go check those channels out once again zoom in here these are family channels we watch on a pretty much daily basis i don't know if you can see them very well let's see um we have four channels down here in southern oklahoma but the north northern oklahoma there is a big group of them but all of them are absolutely nice friendly i mean just it's awesome i'm hoping we will get the uh i'm hoping to that we will get the meet and greet or they will get the meet and greet rescheduled uh so everyone can come down that would be awesome we look forward to that um happy to say i am a subscriber from under earth oh yes you've been with us for a long time billy yes and it just seems like yesterday that we was at a thousand but actually it was about this time last year we when we did a another flag giveaway and uh that was with um daniel arms uh arms family homestead and keeping it dutch i got lucky as a youtuber that is like that's like gold um you know at the time both of them had 50 000 subs apiece uh dutch had come down and and to take his daughter hunting and i just got lucky and like say ever since i've started youtube we've had support from everybody and kind of directed the right directions they each one of the channels around here love helping out and that's the reason why i'm going to pay back and help out smaller channels that uh or family channels now here's the deal i have to i have to believe in in in the in the um the channels because i don't want to you know basically put something out there if it's got negative stuff in it and just don't want to do it um i'm i know as cassie cassie's got kids as well that you know they sit down and watch family channels and it's nice not have to worry about the bad stuff coming up um me i joined when you were arms yep it's about a year this time last year i'm just amazed like i say this a lot of live streams i take down just depends on what's said or if i accidentally said something that um when i go back and watch it and i just don't want it to get back there like say people do take things out of context um some of them i do delete but this one has been an awesome night i've never had over a hundred people in the live chat and i want to thank each and every one of y'all for that um it's just amazing so um and i'm gonna go back and read yes as cassie said yes family friendly is too much crazy stuff in the world you're absolutely right um you know in in my county i work in my county i clack on this county but um you know used to if we had a death or a homicide i mean that was that was crazy i mean everybody's talking about it but here in the last two or three years it's just starting to become uh we know one's coming up um and that's sad it's sad um people do not respect life anymore um people don't know how to love people and then when you it amazes me when we're out in public or if i'm at work i'll be on the phone with steph and um i just i ain't got nothing to hide so when i get me and steph gets off the phone every time he and steph gets off phone i'll say all right bye i love you i mean we say that but people will look at you like what i mean really i'm not i mean i love everyone now there was a time in my life when i wasn't such a good person but that's been 15 years ago well you know about 10 years ago um but everybody can change that's the reason why you don't judge a book on the outside you judge what's on the inside because you can always change the inside so anyways uh print yes print please leighton is actually just now learning cursive but yes please print they want to know if yeah i print i know i get started talking and it's hard for me to do a live by myself because i do all the talking and i don't read i got to have steph i just go off on a road and um die her dad i'm watching you on the computer you're watching my computer okay people don't know how to be no you're 100 right so anyways that's because yes we want to teach our kids respect as leighton has been told a couple times to go take a shower and he's not in the shire so i was doing my homework well go in there and finish your homework and take a shower okay yep and if y'all behave we'll go live again next week okay but you gotta have good grades and make 100 on spilling tests um if my friend makes good grades yeah well you got to make the good grades too so anyways um yeah at least we we i don't watch the news anymore not unless a big uh something big pops up is the only time i'm watching how old are the kiddos i have a leighton's eight addison the seven casein is five braylee is two yeah i think that's right yeah because uh addison just got a uh had her birthday this couple days ago haven't watched tv in 15 years wow um that's crazy i have much respect for you it's not our place to judge let's go you're right and he's going to do a lot of judging one day and it may be sooner than later so man i'm just stunned by everybody that has just joined us tonight yes dutch and daniel are great people they are absolutely my 11 year old son wants to write your kids awesome please that will be awesome which they're watching in there and i was trying to make it a secret but yes um it's gonna do nothing but but help them because here's the deal they like reading stuff so as me when i was in school and i didn't care for reading i didn't care for spelling up until i got in high school and uh and the reason why i had to learn is because i had a football coach his name is coach parker and he's actually the davis uh he's actually the head coach here in davis now and the man is he set a good foundation for me i was in um 11th grade and um i mean i i was in a the special ed class for reading and and spelling and and uh and that's just because i was lazy and and i always talk my way through it but i couldn't read so what he's he found that you know i love play football he's a football coach then he would bring me a newspaper in every week at the beginning of the week i'd read the newspaper the articles and he would pick the spelling words and all that out of that newspaper that's how i started learning how to read that's how i got interested in reading but you know he didn't have to do that i know he's a teacher in this way but he took the extra time to do that for me and i'm grateful and i'm thankful for that because if if i wouldn't have i wouldn't be where i'm at today i promise you i wouldn't be a cop because you got to know how to read and write for reports and going through school always said i didn't even read and write i'm just going to work construction why send yourself a low standard but i didn't really realize that because my main deals i just want to be out of school and uh now that i'm an adult now i want to go back to school um but no i mean you know people ask if if you could take it back would you think do things different um there's probably a few but not many because the things i did is what made me who i am today um you know as many you know i i don't keep it a secret i i drink alcohol at a young age and i drink a bunch of it and i do get to a point where there's a problem each relationship i was in it it caused problems and then i met stephanie and um that's when it all stopped and my life began uh oh okay leighton can read most cursive well cassie no yeah she's a schoolteacher as well um wow look at the comments 184 thumbs up 189. good lord i'm raising two kiddo grandkids there's i i i feel for you how old are they thanks ed i know you do we love you too ed well absolutely i i can even if we don't go live even if we don't go live for a week or so i can almost guarantee you your name is mentioned um at least once a week leighton asked if it's the the week or the month that you're going to be here to go fishing he's looking forward to that so your your name is mentioned it's either about going fishing or he's wanting to take the boat out which been super busy and that that's the only i need more time to do things but i keep getting myself into stuff but yeah he either mentions yeah so you're definitely appreciated ed oh wow daniel's on thanks daniel we reached thanks for the shout out we did reach 5 000 subs tonight or we actually reached it yesterday but i waited till the kids um got in because uh i worked super late but thank you so much for the shout out it helped us out tremendously in which as i said earlier um you and in dutch gave me the start and i would greatly appreciate it we have got many things coming and we just hope it takes off huh yeah i mean this this has been our biggest night on a live stream and uh which we gave away several shirts and and we're just thankful for everyone that has liked and shared our videos and we just want to show our appreciation as we said earlier um we are giving the the three flags away um that daniel did the shout out on uh that's going to be given away it's going thinks it's about a week and five days now so we'll give them away and we will put whatever logo or design you want on your flag and ship it to you free of cost okay and yep we are getting ready yeah ed's a famous man he's got a uh a studio as well and i'd like to try to find some ed if you got any music email it or send it i'd like to listen to some

great night may god bless y'all you", "iS2btOQiJWw": "[Music] we're making old-fashioned mac and cheese today so we have some very heavily salted water that is rapidly boiling you want it to kind of taste like like the ocean I know that sounds gross but that's the best way to do it when you are boiling pasta and then we have just the very small macaroni noodles I'll use any pasta really for this but this is what we have and we have four cups and then just give it a stir and you want to boil your pasta this will probably take about eight minutes or less because you want to boil it until it's al dente which is it's done but it's firmed in this medium sauce sized saucepan I have a stick of butter and 1/8 ounce package of cream cheese and it's on low I'm going to add 3 cups of whole milk just to help it melt down and so I don't have to babysit left the pot this may be enough liquid however sometimes I have to add another cut from the edge so you just keep this on low and just stir it occasionally and once the the milk kind of warms up a little then it'll heat the but it'll heat the butter and the cream cheese enough for them to melt so now that our pasta is finished I'm going to just rinse it really quick with some water so it doesn't stick too much because it's gonna sit until the rest of our stuff is ready to go point you pour in a large bowl now that our cream cheese milk and butter mixtures melted we're going to temper our eggs and this recipe because it's old-fashioned Mac I use six eggs but before putting them in you want to temper them with the warm liquid there's still a few chunks of cream cheese but that's okay I'm just slowly whisking as I'm pouring in the hot milk cream cheese and butter probably should have had a bigger bowl you just don't want your Mac to be Curt curdled you can definitely tell them it has eggs in it when it's finished but you don't scrambled eggs well let's do one where we go for to our macaroni noodles the chunks you see is an out curdled milk it's the leftover cream cheese and it'll melt down when you put this in the oven now we're going to add the tempered egg mixture with your six eggs two teaspoons of sea salt two teaspoons of garlic powder she's been at onion powder a couple shakes of cayenne it doesn't make it spicy it just brings out the flavor a teaspoon of black pepper but about a teaspoon of turmeric [Applause] [Music] to see spoons of butter tablespoons you get a paintbrush and you start painting them and a 9 by 13 hand and I'm on my third can pan now insert everything into your pasta add about two cups of sharp cheddar the same in mozzarella cheese and then fold that in I usually hold off on the fourth cup of milk to see sometimes it just seems like it's has more liquid than others if you don't want to use whole milk you can use half and half you can use heavy cream you can use you can lighten the recipe up a little and use tack milk and half chicken stock a chicken box and you just stir that in then you pour the mixture into a 9 by 13 pan then we take about a pound of cubed sharp cheddar try to evenly distribute it and just poke it under the surface you can use Velveeta at you if you'd like or you can just omit this completely this step but I personally like to brighten a big gooey half-melted pieces of cheese it's thrilling I just poke them down in there and if you don't like sharp cheddar you can use mild cheddar Colby jack or and then we top it with parmesan I've also done the bread creme and and butter mix on top because it makes it pretty and golden brown now you're going to make it 350 degrees for about 45 minutes okay this is what it looks like when it's finished and just so you know if you don't want to turn your oven on you can put this all in a slow cooker on low for three to four hours thanks for watching [Music]", "CSG2AukqjwA": "this is the homework tutors this video will cover the star test for 5th grade math this is based off the March 2017 sample keep in mind that the 5th graders will have a reference sheet at the beginning of the test that will refer to give you equations of a parameter areum valium and then also give you reference materials on lengths valuing capacity and waiting masks along with some graph paper at the front so let's get started with number one amber saved a total of 3 dollars and 20 cents over 5 weeks she say the same amount of money each week how much money they amber say so we know that she saved a total of 3 dollars and 20 cents and she's saying the same amount each week so this is a division problem because we need to find out how much did she save each week equally once you divide you will get 64 cent per week if you have time you want to check yourself all you would do is multiply 64 sit times 5 and that's how you would check yourself on that one number to a scientist compared to measurements 13 point zero six eight kilograms and thirteen point six hundred eight kilograms which symbol makes this comparison true the answer is G we know the 13 before the Destin place another 13 is equal it's the numbers after the decimal place that's important point zero six eight is less than point six six hundred eight it's just I feel like that's pretty self-explanatory six hundred eight is think of it like this six hundred eight it's bigger than 68 the same thing there that's what this basically saying point zero 68 is sixty eight point six zero a is six hundred eight 608 is bigger number three only has a box shaped like a rectangular prism that is full of sugar cubes each sugar cube has a value of one cubic centimeter the top layer has a width of six centimeters and a length of 11 centimeters there are three layers of sugar cubes how many cubes are in the box so this is two to figure this out you have to multiply you have to multiply the length times the width times the depth which is the three layers so multiply all three of those numbers well you multiply those two together you'll get 100 in 98 number for the shaded part of the model represents a fraction another fraction was subtracted from the first fraction what expression does the model represent so on the screen I drew that we have five going across so we have father-tsar with we have three going down so I know we have a total of fifteen boxes if you actually sat down and counting all those you would get 15 but if you know multiplication and she shouldn't fit great you know five by three is 15 so we know we have a total of 15 boxes out of the 15 boxes we have eleven of them that's actually shaded then you have to find out what is the amount that's crossed out we have to represent it was crossed out which when you cross something out we're taking away so therefore that makes a subtraction problem we have six out of the total 15 that's crossed out when we put six off for our first we have 11 over 15 that's in simplest form and then the Crocs out amount it's going to be six or fifteen but we know that's not in the zipless form because we can divide that by three and then we get two fits and that's why J is your answer number five the relationship between numbers and lists X and let's Y follow the rules y equals x plus two point zero five which diagram shows this relationship so the first thing I did was I just went to a and I took twenty nine point one and I add it to point zero five to see if I would get thirty one point six as you can see I did not get that one point six I got thirty one point one five so therefore that means a cannot be the answer I then went down to B and but actually before you even go to be before you going to be I looked across if you know it it's a and C they have the same numbers for X they all have it twenty nine point one is in both thirty four point one thirty nine point one forty four point one noticed also about the same so now that I've already calculated for a twenty nine point one plus two point zero five or seven point fifteen before I even move to be I can look across and see C has little white as my answer the twenty nine point one and it has to list Y X thirty one point one five which I know it's the answer so I automatically know that's my answer which it is now as I did when down will be if you just selling dog food for whatever reason you have some extra time you wanna you just checking your answers or whatever I did thirty-one point five plus two two point zero five and you see that it does not match the list why outcome which just real forms my point that's C is your answer but for the sake of the test once I once you do see once you see that what see you know that's your answer I will move on I'll only come back and extra check if you have extra time at the end of the test number six a rectangular billboard is 9.35 meters wide and six point eight two meters tall what is the perimeter of the billboard of meters record your answer and fill in the bubbles on your answer document be sure to use the correct place value so it's going to one kept like I shouldn't see this problem is not an ABC be multiple choice problem so you know makes you makes you think a little more you don't have that easy 25% chance of getting it right basically so on the reference sheet it does give you the equation for a parameter on the reference sheet it does show it as 2l plus 2w which means the length times - the width times - or as you see how I wrote length plus length plus width plus with basically multiple at all four sides you can do either way whichever makes you come to view if you like multiplying go and do it that way that's fine or you can do it the second way where you just add all the sides and as you see in my example that's what I did I added all the sides I did the length first twice out of the width and then out of the width and that's how you get it your final answer either way works perfectly fine I guess is just preference if you like multiplying or adding even went to my place they're gonna have the Admirals anyway so that's why I just added all the sides but either way works you should get the same answer if you're doing it correctly number seven the stem leaf plot shows the number of minutes the members of a team jump rope during practice and then a show system leaf plot here the question is what is the difference between the least number minute jump and the greatest number of minutes jump so as you see it has a little example down there how you posed to read the stem leaf so what has the number so let's just do number one one and then a half on the step side that has the leaf is not has two nines there what that is saying is it has 19 twice okay the stem is the first number is your tens place number in the leaf is your ones place number and depend on how many times it repeats on the leaf side is how many different numbers it is so for number one I do the first I do the first I'd be for stealing one in step two if you were to write this out in order you write 19 19 20 21 23 that's how the Stanley's password okay so now we have to find a lease in Brady's so the lease is 19 the greatest is 66 you look at the six you go all the way to the end six won't be 63 is not the first number that we it has to be the last number cuz it still looking for the largest number you simply subtract those and you get a difference before T seven last week number eight the math team does drills that each last one-sixth of an hour in February the team did practice real for total 24 hours how many practice drills did the team do in February so we need to divide 1/6 into 24 as you know as you might not know when you're doing fractions when we divide we never divide them like that we always flip the second equation called the reciprocal you flip the second equation I'm sorry not equation you see we flip the second fraction and then we multiply we change to a multiplication problem for whole numbers you always put it over one when you have to deal with them with fractions so we got the 2401 now we're multiplying because we flipped from one six and you flipped over to six over one so now we have 24 over six you might find that you're gonna get 144 and that's gonna be over one as you should know any number divided by 1 is itself so that gives us an answer of 144 and that concludes the math test hope you guys do well on your test good luck", "jyfrnylXwlY": "in the last couple of months i have filmed recipes either inspired by or from the kitchens of my friends and so far it's gone pretty well i've made taylor ham sandwiches green beans maple old fashions grantham gingerbread and clementine upside down cakes that all sounds fun to me at least today that might change this recipe for cabbage rolls from the family of my friend mackenzie is very cryptic and i am currently engaged in a text conversation with mackenzie about some of the specifics just because this is not something that i would normally make does not mean that i won't like it i'm mostly just daunted at faithfully recreating this well-regarded family recipe between the two types of cabbage and three meats i'm sure there will be something for everyone traditional polish cabbage rolls are simmered in a tomato sauce however these are no polish cabbage rolls they are ohioan instead of simmering the cabbage rolls in a tomato sauce this recipe incorporates ketchup into the filling a very creative and american sleight of hand and of course even if i manage to really mess this up at least i can rest assured knowing that it can't be any worse than the cabbage roll at the terre haute federal pen chandler roll the clip and then let's get to the kitchen and see how it all comes together thursday night to serve a wicked pepper steak can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls at the terre haute pharaoh pin for that oatmeal at the cook county slammer oh they're all pretty bad mckenzie's family actually makes this dish to celebrate the new year and this year i thought my family could do the same to start line a casserole dish with bacon i am using a 9 by 13 pyrex dish here and that needed 12 ounces of bacon i think you could make this recipe in a 9x9 but an 8x8 dish would be just too small mackenzie's family makes this in an enameled dutch oven place a layer of sauerkraut on top of the bacon i did not have exact quantities for this recipe but for a 9x13 dish i used two cups or one pint of drained sauerkraut for a smaller dish or a thinner layer obviously you would use less and for a thicker layer or a bigger dish you would use more top the sauerkraut with one quarter of a chopped raw onion the onion will cook and soften as this bakes in the oven the recipe calls for an unspecified amount of dill seed but i rolled with the punches and used half a teaspoon i think that quantity turned out pretty well alright with the foundation of our casserole all prepared it is now time to move on to the cabbage rolls at this stage our goal is to keep the cabbage leaves whole and to soften them so that they don't break and crack as we roll this can be done in a number of ways the original recipe calls for freezing the cabbage in a layer of plastic wrap and aluminum foil and then letting this thaw for at least 24 hours as an alternative you can boil or steam the cabbage i steamed mine i cut the leaves off as they became tender for eight rolls which is what this recipe makes you will need eight leaves with the wrapping prepared let's move on to the filling in a skillet add a small amount of oil and one quarter of a chopped onion cook the onions until they become translucent and then add a quarter cup of ketchup once the mixture is heated through add it to two pounds of lean ground beef if making hamburgers i would recommend using 80 20 ground beef but in this case none of the fat can drain away you are eating all of the fat that's in this ground beef so i'm using 93 7. to continue seasoning the filling add half a teaspoon of ground pepper white if you have it and black if you don't half a teaspoon of salt a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder two tablespoons of rice this is long grain white rice and one egg then get in there with your hands and give everything a good mix this recipe makes eight rolls and to make things easier for myself i like to divide the filling into quarters so that i can better gauge how much filling goes into each roll making the rolls is very simple to do so take 1 8 of the meat mixture and place it on the front third of the cabbage leaf form the filling into a log and then roll the leaf over tuck in the ends and then finish rolling then place each roll in the casserole dish i had a little bit of extra space in the casserole dish so i filled it with some of the leftover cabbage that i had be sure to season this cabbage with salt and pepper as well then cover the casserole dish with foil and place into a preheated 300 degree fahrenheit oven immediately reduce the temperature to 250 degrees and cook for two hours after two hours pull out the cabbage rolls and add one kielbasa sausage cut into two to three inch pieces back into the oven it goes for another hour and i removed the foil about half an hour before it was finished the total cooking time of this dish is three hours this is certainly not the prettiest of dishes but it is rustic cooking and it's very easy to serve additionally i think this is a complete meal and you don't need to cook an extra starch i served myself a cabbage roll and a piece of kielbasa sausage which promptly rolled off my plate and onto the floor but i gave it a rinse and now let's have a taste taste test time i've got a little bit of everything here on my fork it's going to be a big bite but i've got sausage bacon cabbage meat filling sauerkraut i think i mean it all looks the same now so here we go okay you know what that's actually pretty good simple flavors obviously but it's kind of home cooking comforting sort of stuff i was kind of scared i thought oh my gosh are we going to have another salmon moose moment here on chandler cookies my family loves cabbage and one of my struggle meals when i'm just you know out living in the world is sausage and cabbage because it's very cheap and we also have a dish in my family sweet and sour cabbage which is cabbage with bacon and it's in a vinegary uh sweet kind of sauce so this is sort of reminiscent of both of those things i thought this would feel very alien to me but it's more familiar than i would have first guessed and it's pretty good too okay that bite just had some sauerkraut in it and the flavor is definitely really mellowed out it's not sharp by any stretch of the imagination one thing that i'm not terribly keen on is the flabby bacon the bacon imparts a very nice smoky flavor however the bacon itself just doesn't look that good and i don't really care for soft bacon you don't taste the ketchup or anything like that i wouldn't even know that there was any kind of tomato product in here okay we're gonna play a game now it's called at dinner is my dad is my dad going to say we should have this again sometime okay and i will flash the answer on the screen so make your guesses now three two one anyway i hope you give this recipe a try even if you don't make it i hope it encourages you to do some experimenting in the kitchen because even though something may look absolutely absurd on paper in real life it can turn out pretty well so if you have any family recipes that seem really strange on paper but that you swear by i would love to hear about it in the comments a happy new year to you all and until next week happy cooking everybody", "0qGQZfKJmzk": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel my name is arturis too and if you're new here and you enjoy my videos please hit the subscribe button below and ring the little bell to get a notification every time i make a new video today i'm here to tell you about a video game that a friend of mine jeremy is working on with his brother dwight and it's called beckoned it's an old school style jrpg game and he does a weekly stream on youtube and 8pm on fridays so if that's something you're interested in definitely check him out i'm gonna leave his information like his website and his youtube down below that way you can check it out so during the weekly stream jeremy mentioned that food plays a big part into bonus in healing with main characters on their journey and ask for some feedback in making pocket type foods to bring along on their journey to help heal them when they're low on hp so i got really excited i love making food i love video games and i really jump at the opportunity to make something like this so as he was doing his streams he started making a character from the ground up and her name is nalka she is the mother of the main protagonist inel and she's known as one of the village elders and also is a skilled urbologist and very skilled in the kitchen as well so i had this idea of just uh nauka making a very simple but delicious sweet loaf for her daughter and her friends that they can enjoy around the table together after a long day just having fun enjoying each other's company so today that's what i'm going to show you how to make so this recipe is a simple pumpkin loaf and it has walnuts in it for an extra texture and then it also has a nice crunchy crispy sugary strudel on top and this recipe is best the day you make it but it can be enjoyed throughout the week my husband and i enjoy it in the morning with a nice cup of coffee or tea or preference and so without further ado we're going to get started in making noka's sweet gourd loaf i hope you enjoy it 5 tablespoons of packed light brown sugar 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon one tablespoon of softened unsalted butter one tablespoon of all-purpose flour and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt you'll need two cups of all-purpose flour and then you'll need one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and then half a teaspoon of baking soda a 15 ounce can of unsweetened pumpkin puree uh one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon one teaspoon of salt and a fourth of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and an eighth of a teaspoon of brown cloves after that you'll need 1 cup of granulated sugar and then 1 cup packed light brown sugar half a cup of vegetable oil four large eggs at room temperature and then fourth of a cup of buttermilk four ounces of cream cheese cut into 12 small pieces at room temperature and last but not least a cup of toasted walnuts chopped up and another quick reminder to have all your refrigerated ingredients at room temperature before starting 5 tablespoons of sugar butter and your cinnamon flour and that salt and then you're going to start using your hands to stir it together like a fine sand this is your strudel topping for your bread this is what it looks like and what consistency you're going for i'm using some vegetable shortening to grease to eight and a half by four and a half inch loaf pans the vegetable shortening definitely ensures that these will slide out of the pan with no problems after this you're gonna whisk together your flour baking powder and baking soda together in a bowl and set it to the side i usually like to put my dry ingredients first that way they're ready and all mixed together for when you have to add them to your wet ingredients later so for the wet ingredients we're going to take that can of pumpkin and put it in a large saucepan over a medium heat and then you're also gonna take the cinnamon salt ground nutmeg and ground cloves and you're gonna mix them together for about five to eight minutes and make sure you're constantly stirring it because it will scald at the bottom and what you're looking for is to reduce it to about or one and a half cups it's gonna start turning a darker richer color that's when you know you're doing it right and if you want to measure it after that's absolutely fine this is the coloring consistency and about the amount you're looking for after you reach that point you're going to take it off the heat for the next steps just be careful with handling the pot it's still really hot this is what your mixture is going to look like you're going to take your granulated sugar and your brown sugar and then you're going to take your vegetable oil and the cream cheese and stir it till it's just combined then you want to let that mixture sit for five minutes and then you want to whisk it all together so it's completely combined while i'm doing this step i'm just gonna let you guys know that even though it is a long ingredients list this really is a simple recipe and it's also perfect for this time of year and i actually can't wait for jeremy to try it we did send out a loaf for him had a few issues with sending it to him so we tried again he should be getting it today actually my husband and i had a lot of fun trying to pack this up so it looked like something straight out of devonis so we're really excited for him to get it so after you've let it sit for five minutes and you start whisking it together this is going to be the consistency that you're going for so now you're going to take your four eggs and your buttermilk and then you are going to whisk them together until they are completely combined and you know this is a really cool recipe because you don't need a kitchenaid you don't need a hand mixer just do it all by hand which i'm pretty sure that's how they do it in nevada's so you're going to take your pumpkin puree and add it to that egg and buttermilk mixture and once you pour it in make sure you get out any extra bits and then you are going to whisk it together till it is completely combined i love video games and i love reading so a lot of the stuff that i make are inspired by stuff i read or see and those things and it's always really fun to see how they come out so once that's completely combined we are going to take our dry ingredients and then pour them in gently so it doesn't poof out everywhere and you want to just start folding that together so there are barely any lumps a few you know flower lumps are okay but you don't want to over stir this at all [Music] and once that is almost fully combined you are going to add your toasted walnuts and then fold those gently in so you do not crush them into tinier bits finally we are in our home stretch where we are going to be evenly putting this mixture into these two greased loaf pans just take care so you don't spill any and you know it doesn't have to be perfect but try to make them as even as you possibly can using a rubber spatula to get the rest of it out and then finally you are going to put that strudel sugar mixture we made in the beginning and distribute it evenly on top of each loaf then you will be baking these in a oven preheated to 350 degrees for about 45 to 50 minutes rotating about halfway through so you have an even bake and then you can check once they are done if they come clean through a toothpick and you will set them out on a wire rack for about 20 minutes before you pop them out of the pans and once you pop these out of the pans patience is a virtue and you want to at least wait an hour hour 20 minutes before you cut into these that way they have a chance to set these totally make your house smell just like a beautiful fall day and too bad when we live it's not quite there yet after they've cooled down a bit you can use a serrated knife cut at a diagonal angle so it doesn't crush the loaf and check out that inside it's perfect if you guys try this recipe let me know how it turns out or if you have any questions please ask and i will do my best to answer them and don't forget to check out the website for backend and join jeremy and dwight on their live stream friday at eight o'clock eastern time and have a good day you guys", "F0C3TAo4Ptc": "all right guys we're gonna start a project and this is going to be more of like a get-together and create an album together um each week until it's finished now I'm using Kathy orders original hidden hinge binding system and I have put a link to her original video from seven years ago and I know she has an updated versions that version that is patent protected so I wanted to make sure Kathy got credit because I am sharing her original idea now I know that you can contact Kathy and get the the newer instructions directly from her okay so we're gonna do her original hidden hinge and make an envelope journal so I asked that you get a 6x6 pad if your envelopes you know if you you're wanting to decorate these the reason I said 6x6 is because I have a ton of 6x6 paper pads that I need to use up and I'm not buying any more paper until I've used some up so 6x6 or if you've got 8x8 and you have larger envelopes use your 8x8 if you've got really big envelopes you can use them but you could might need 12 by 12 paper so whatever paper pad you have that you would like to get used up you need a paper pad we're not going to use this tool probably next week because we're gonna do the binding today the decorating will come later but the idea is to use up a 6x6 paper pad or a good bit of it then you need six envelopes and I'm using invitation envelopes that are oh let's see that's four and three-eighths by 5 and 3/4 okay so that's what I'm using you can use any size envelopes to do this you can use toilet paper rolls to do this you can use anything that you can make a page out of you can use this hinge system with and then unique cardstock and I am using um I am using 110 pound cardstock I bought this at Walmart a while back so I've got that and you need that to create the hinge um if you only have lighter weight cardstock it will work it just will not have the longevity if your gonna give it to somebody that's gonna constantly flip through it or you know it takes it and shares it like a brag book where it's gonna get the pages turned a lot if it's a lighter weight cardstock it will have a tendency of breaking down quicker okay so basically today you need one sheet of cardstock and your six envelopes save any off cuts for tags and such for later okay so I'm gonna set the paper the extra paper and the paper pad aside alright alright did you find the link hi Vicki I'm only staying on for an hour today an hour each Thursday that's Kathy orders original video right there I just put it up and it's also in the description box below alright the first thing you need to do is because everybody's probably gonna have different sized envelope I want you to open your envelope and you can see let's see you see how your envelope comes up at an angle here we want to know the distance from where that envelope starts going up on that side and where it is on this side and mine came out to be 5 and 5/8 so we want to cut a 5 and 5/8 inch strip from our card stock in height five and five eighths so I'm going to cut that all right then to do six pages you're gonna need a piece that's nine and three-quarter inches long and remember save the offcuts you can use them later and I'm going to put all of my stuff for this weekly project in a gallon sized ziploc bag so that I can keep track of it all right so cut this at nine into quarters all right set that aside all right so if you've got the same size envelopes as me let's do got Teresa Church and Nancy and Rhea and Vicky Biggs and there's Mary and Samantha Owens and Vicky Ross and Don boss and Samantha Owens all right so get your measurement of what your flap is from where so that the hinge will insert inside the envelopes so that's why I say measure just a little bit inside this edge of this you see if I can find a different piece of paper here so you guys can maybe see this this is how I got my five in 5/8 where that flap comes up you start it just inside the envelope a little bit and then measure over to the same part on the other side and that's how I came up with five and five eighths so if you measure the width of your envelope mine's at five and three quarters you you're basically taking an eighth of an inch off the width of your envelope that might make more sense to y'all hi gloria so measure your with your envelope and then take an eighth of an inch away cut a strip that wide and then by 9 and 3/4 all right I'm gonna try if you guys need me to slow down so you can catch up just say it and we'll slow down and I'll chat and that kind of stuff I want this to be something where you guys can answer ask questions and get answers while we're doing it and I know that some people might get frustrated with me over that but the whole idea is to show you guys how to do one of these albums really quick all right once you get your piece the width of your envelope and nine and three-quarter inches long everybody will need the nine and three-quarter inches long okay hi Cheri huh bings then we're going to need our scoreboard um if you don't have a scoreboard this part I mean you can still do it but you you might have to do pencil lines and you know and then use your ruler and all that what is the large white sheet it's um the 110 pound cardstock from Walmart and like I said earlier if you don't have a hundred and ten eighty will work but if it's going if you're gonna gift this to somebody that's going to share it a lot and it's going to get a lot of opening and closing and people looking through the pages you might want to make sure you have a hundred and ten pound cardstock you don't want to go much thicker than that because then it won't it won't whatever this is emboss very well and it might crack this is to make the hinge marry we're going to make a hinge to put our envelopes on okay and this is Kathy orders original hidden hinge guide all right so once you get your sheet to 5 and 5/8 wide by 9 and 3/4 the first mark you're going to mark at one and a quarter all right so mark one and a quarter then you're going to do 1/2 inch so come over from one and a quarter to one in 3/4 so you'll do another half an inch so one two at two and a half is that right no that's too much two and a quarter but that's ok because the next mark is a quarter so you'll do one in one quarter then you'll mark another half an inch so from one and a quarter you'll go to one in three quarters and then from one in three quarters you'll go to two and a quarter and then the next mark you'll do is two and a half so you'll have two sections that are at 1/2 1/2 1/4 then we're gonna do 1/2 1/2 1/4 and you'll just completely keep doing that all the way across now if you guys need me to write down exactly where each of the marks are I can do that really quick after I get them marked okay it's 9 and 3/4 inches the long way and then whatever your measurement for your envelope is from an eighth of an inch smaller than the width of your envelope so you've got to measure whatever your envelopes are mine happen to be 5 and 3/4 so when I take an eighth of the way that's five and five eighths alright so I'm going to keep doing that and then when I'm done I'll write down what these measurements are for you if that would help Oh Lord I'm so sick of those warnings Oh Scott sent me a message to he said there's six hand turkeys I bet he had to go a different way to get the word six hand turkeys by the school water up to the bridge at the creek by the pretty cows oh boy that's a lot of water all right so one you do one and a quarter and then do you two marks a half an inch away from each other and then another quarter inch let me finish these and I'll give you the exact measurements so now we need to go a half inch at three and a half inch at three and a half and then we'll do a corridor so we're at three and three quarters now we've got to do a half an inch so that's four and a quarter another half an ounce just four and three quarters and then we need to do quarter so that's five okay and then five and a half and six and six and a quarter six and a quarter and then six and three quarters I'll write these down and put them in the description box six and three quarters and then a half an inch from that seven and a quarter and then seven and a half and then eight and eight and a half and then that you should have an inch and up by an inch and a quarter left on the end here alright so let me write these measurements down for you guys hi journey alright so your score marks score at one in one quarter one and three quarters two and a quarter two and a half two and a half three three and a half three and three quarters three and three quarters and four and a quarter four and three quarters for three quarters five five and a half six six and a quarter six and a quarter six and three quarters seven and a quarter seven and a half yeah then eight and eight and a half all right so that's this course it's gonna be hard to read all right so that was the score lines for anybody that's watching this as a replay the measurements will be in the description box as soon as I sign off from here all right so this is basically you suck it all right now we're gonna fold on these so fold the first one and a quarter inches fold it up like this go ahead and score it this will attach to the front of your book okay so the next one you're gonna make a mountain with it and then we're gonna fold it back the other way this way on the next you I'm the very next line it gets a little fiddly when you're getting down to the quarter inch score lines but you're gonna score on all of your score lines first okay but what you'll end up with is you'll have we're gonna put some glue back here on the half inch measurements and bring them together so that'll give you a place to glue your envelope this is just like we did on the paper bag album they last year was it or the year before year before the next one we're going to fold it's hard to describe this until I get to the second half inch so make a mountain we at your half inch centers because you're gonna do this will go on the cover so like if your book is open here's your cover so you'll have um there'll be an envelope here then they'll be a quarter-inch space I I did just like she did because you know how we fill these up with tags and stuff like that then this will be another hinge here and you're just gonna keep folding it so that it does this see how it makes that but I want to get them all all folded before I glue anything and you can use any color paper to make your hinge really I thought about using black paper but I didn't changed my mind and use why I actually have a multi packet of that that's got gray and black and brown I think so just keep folding on your score lines basically the quarter inch one the quarter inch scores they're a little bit more fiddly because they're so narrow but you really do want that space but see when you fold on it they both are going the same way so you're creating a flat valley like that so what if you're looking at it from the hinge side this will go up there goes my sump pump again like this alright you can see how the quarter-inch wants lay flat and you get like these ribs that this is where you'll attach your and so we'll just keep going you fold this back up and then you go back down on your half inch so that you've created another mountain on the half inch one I just find it easier to fold these um quarter inch ones if I kind of flip the paper back and forth so that it lays flat I had made one of these up but I figured you know if we are working along I would just make another all right now we're gonna do another mountain on the half inch piece and I look at chat here in just a second to see if there's any questions before I go on to the next step you just want to make sure that the the quarter inch ones make up when you get it between two mountains the half inch ones make mountains and a quarter inch ones make the valley in between so you want to make sure that that you don't want to fold the second one the opposite way you want to make sure that the half inch score lines are pointing in the second same way so they point up to create the mountain so it's a wide valley in between your half inch mountains alright and I've got one more mountain here score that and then we just need this last one to go back up this way all right see you end up please make all these valleys and if you if you count your mountains you should have six one two three four five six okay alright is everybody doing okay I don't know who all is um yeah I'm gonna put the measurements for the score lines and I'll remind you all you need an with six pages you need nine and three-quarter inches and then the width of your envelope less an eighth of an inch because you could you want your hinges to fit inside the envelopes everybody dude oh hey peg let's see Britney Hollow yes we're making an envelope journal alright so I'm not seeing any questions it's a rainy day we're trying to fill up time what you're gonna do once you get all your little mountains here you've got to glue them together some way now you can use glue or tape whichever you want I've actually got scotch quick dry inside my baby bot here so I'm just gonna put some Scotch quick-dry in here you can use red line tape or double-sided tape just don't get the glue on the quarter inch spots just the half-inch spots my stomachs growling at you guys all right and then just pinch your mountains together fiddly fiddly if you wanted to glue them one at a time you can I'm just pinching my two pieces together that's on the half inch side to create my ribs or my hinges all right so you'll end up with something like this it might take a minute for the glue to settle up so there we go all right I'm just trying to make sure they're um glued together well all right so this is your ribs that you'll attach your own thing that's okay dawn if you go back and just do the replay then you can stop me and work and then rewind and that kind of stuff that's fine hi Anne so is anybody having trouble with their hinge you should have something like this after you glue it together it'll look like that on the back and it'll have thins like that okay we're gonna set this aside and let the glue dry and now we're gonna get our envelopes and I want you to you're gonna think this is crazy but I want you to go through and glue all your envelopes closed and I would just lick this and stick this but these are like ancient old envelopes so I'm just gonna put a little of my Scotch quick-dry along the edge and just close them up that way and just close them up just don't get too much glue on or you'll glue it completely closed and we do need to get we need to be able to get back inside it in a minute and I did mean for this to be kind of a work along so that's why I'm focusing on just doing the project trying not to do a lot of chitchat in case somebody else you know doesn't want to hear all the chitchat I want Thursday to be more of a kind of a tutorial kind of day just glue all your envelopes closed there is another way to do this to use the flaps and all but I wanted to the first one we do together to be a little bit you know just really easy to do okay so they're all closed all glued close so what you're gonna do now is you're gonna take your cutter and you're gonna just cut just a little sliver off that both edges you're going to cut a little sliver off here and a little sliver off on the other side just make sure all of your envelopes end up to be the same width so whatever measurement you trim to on the very first envelope all of them need to be that same size okay hold up Janet we're making pockets don't worry about that we're good it's all good so I'm gonna trim just a tiny you just need to trim off enough to open it back up this way by doing it this way you don't have a flap if you um to get in the way you can get into the pocket and then you have a flat page surface to a full flat page so just trim off a tiny little bit oh my my blade came off hang on what what I'm gonna trim mine down to let's see I think I'll trim mine so they all are at four and a quarter I think that'll do let's see if that'll be good I think I'm open so after you trim you should have something like this okay Janet says she's just thinking out loud jeez back we're having pockets it's all good so I'm trimming mine to be four and a quarter inches um this way not the width the other way unless that's the way you wanted to do your pockets I just wanted more upright surface to um put pictures and things on okay four two four four and a quarter and I'm not keeping the little trim II bits off the envelopes I was noticing the Italian restaurant up the road has got um they're gonna have prime rib special for Valentine's thought that was interesting saw that today when I ran to the post office I waited for the rain to stop enough to go to the post office and drop the postcards in that I made the last night because it wasn't sure if the mail lady's gonna get here without the envelopes and you know postcards getting wet out there in the mailbox so it's just been a horrible day here today does that go all the way through yeah it's got a little glue on it that's why it's hanging up that's why you have to be careful up how much glue you put on so you don't glue your envelope close alright alright so you should end up with all your envelopes looking but like here alright so now you have a way to get into the side all right how's everybody doing are we doing okay alright so we're gonna bring our hinges back over here yeah they're gonna you can still put stuff in them it's just it'll be a nice neat square page then you won't have that flap in the way if you're um you still not glued down good enough or if it's coming up you can always add a little glue like I said these envelopes were down in the garage here so they're probably 30 or 40 years old the bottom of the envelope wasn't glued all the way so I need to go back and get those corners glued down it probably won't matter in the long run but it's bothering me so I'm gonna glue them down that'll give everybody a chance to catch up with me this is just where the bottom was not quite glued tube at the factory I think they probably didn't worry about it I figured it's closed finally got me a copy of my favorite magazines at a different grocery store I was so glad to finally find it all right I just want to make sure that my envelopes aren't gonna fall apart all right so I've got my envelopes so I can put a tag in the side and I can attach it to my hinge before I do that though what I want to do these have set up now is I'm gonna cut a little bit of an angle off from each hinge so that it'll sit nice inside these envelopes inside the envelopes okay so I'm just gonna trim and these do not have to be even they're going to be hidden inside the envelope anyway and I'll show you what this looks like when I get them all cut alright so all of my mountains now have an angle cut on a planet so fuzzy you'll see how that is maybe see how can we show you there you go there you can see that I've got an angle cut on each one of these see how the mountains have mountains on this edges alright now what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put some glue on both sides of my mountain I'll take an envelope and get the edge open again don't matter which way you put it on there and I'm just gonna slide the envelope over the mountain the only thing you want to make sure is your pages all line up as you put them on so take your time the only reason I can go quick at this as I've made several of these but I am trying to make myself slow down you can use tape too I just find that this quick dry glue works really good trying to get that to stick up there so it'll be out of my way here we go and you can spread your glue out with your finger too that might be a good idea and try not to get it in your valleys like I just did there okay now I need a wet one or something to put the glue all right take my hand below this actually slides on better if you got it down flat like this and because I am using quick dry all right just kind of make sure you're even and then pinch it along there you just don't want to push your envelope down so far down in that it's taking up space on either your valley or your um your cover flap what is my favorite magazine quilts and more and the reason I like quilts and more is because they have more than just quilt projects this one had a baby quilt and in a tote bag and pillows and all kinds of projects in it and it's only available on the newsstands at least that's what they told me but then I saw this company called xeno and they were advertising that I could get a subscription to it so I might order a subscription to it for the longest time it was available by newsstand only let's take your time oh man come on I will get it on there it's so dark and dreary today make sure you bring your envelope up so that you make sure your second page that you put on the same position is the first one you put on before you squeeze it down into the glue and if you have any glue running amuck this is when you when you clean it up real quick oh and another reason to not use tape is if you put tags in sometimes that tape will grab your tags you know and glue once it's dried it's dried and you can use tacky glue if that's what you have I just really like scotch quick dry I don't know why I just do all right we will need some chipboard too let's see what time is it now it's 3:40 I just want to make sure everybody is at the same point when we stop for today and then next week will you'll need the chipboard we might wait and do that next week since I didn't call for it today and that'll give you guys a chance if you want to use like left oh um if you want to recycle a piece of chipboard that'll give you a week to get it together if you don't have one on hand and I'm just working my way from one side to the other of these now I know Kathy Scott Kathy order has some other hinging options [Music] she has one this is hidden hinge and then she's got another one that lays a lot flatter so you might want to go check out Kathy orta's channel it's Kathy order something else now though she got married but she's she's on live sometime showing her her techniques and stuff they're pretty close I'm just trying to make sure there is even as I can get on put it that way this is just fiddly fiddly bits it's like she said in that video I shared in the description box you can make these any size you can go great big or you can do it e bitty or you can use toilet paper rolls she's done all kinds of stuff I actually found one of her books at the thrift store one time and I was like oh yeah yeah I know Kathy order well I know we're on YouTube but I don't know her in person but anyway I got all excited about it because I love her techniques and the ideas she comes up with amazes me as far as journal creating so I can't talk Kathy up enough and I would encourage you to go check out her channel one more and I'll have all six envelopes and see now this side is open and we can put tags in there now if you're using like the envelopes and card sets you can use the cards and I don't know if I have a card to show you or not I'll fold a piece of paper and show you what I mean hang on just a second I know Mary you had your pictures of some of your projects which you can do and map them and put them on these envelope pages and mat him and put him in the pockets that would be really cool [Music] yes I was gifted the baby bot and it works great for my Scotch quick-dry because I don't like to buy this scotch you can't really get it in a bigger bottle but it's my favorite glue because it it grabs quick and dries quick for what I'm doing you know I was I would say a lesson tutorial whatever and if you're if you um are going somewhere for a class or something I found that the quick dry works if you're having to work along it dries just really quick now if you are one that just needs more time to make sure everything is in position I would recommend tacky glue because it gives you more time to work alright so there we go and what we'll do is we'll create a we'll have a piece of chipboard here and then we'll have two pieces for the covers okay and we'll do that next week but I was going to say if you have the cards that go with your envelopes you see I'll just get one of these pieces of extra and I'm just gonna cut what do you guys say was the height on this five and five eighths I'm gonna do five and a half inch tall just make it like a regular card size and then I'll score it at four and a quarter so it'll be for a quarter by five and a half alright so say you have the sets where you have the envelopes and the cards you know like the ones they sell it go and Michaels and all that go ahead and fold the card this is kind of a finishing thing but I didn't want you to think you know you couldn't use those pre-made cards set things either but then you can take your card let's do it on the one that's already dried a long time you can just slide it in the pocket like that just slide it in the pocket it might have to be trimmed down a little but what it does is now you have a flap but you can still pull the card out and you can use this side on the inside and the outside so like the part that gets slid inside you have a place here in a place there and I think you would have to trim your cards because we got to take into account for the hinge we have in there so maybe yet trim it down so it's four inches wide instead of four and a quarter I'm just going to put it on here this is the fold of the card I'm going to trim the quarter inch off so then you you would have all of these spaces that you could put pictures or decorations or whatever and see that just folds out so if you have the card set you can use them and if you want them to go in farther you can trim even more off this is still sticking out too much for me three and three quarters let's see if transit over in July will do lets see because I'm I've got such a big hinge in there I'm having to trim this down there we go that's gonna that that brings the fold of the card to the edge here so just trim your cards and then you have a little flap that folds out and then you can still pull it out so it's like a flat card tag thing so you could do that for each of your envelopes then you still have room in there to add more stuff but we'll get to the decorating and all of that another time its 347 let's see our Janet thanks for the link to the yeah this is the-- this one is this is the baby bod and this was a gift somebody gifted this to me it's on Amazon but it's also from fast Capcom I don't know who has the better price but this came from Amazon but the original website is fast cap and it does come with two different tips I just like then the smaller tip so I just pitched the other one I didn't even save it isn't that horrible use whatever glue you have alright so is everybody to this point where you have your envelopes and your your hinges are created and your envelopes are on what's the thing with it what do you mean this here this right here is the cover to keep the glue from drying out and you can put it on the lid over here I feel like they should be paying me because I think I've sold a lot of baby bots and you can put it over here just to get it out of your way so you can see what you're doing and then you just take it and put it back on there to cover your glue so it doesn't dry out let's see I have the big guy too this has got regular tacky glue in it once you fill this up and you put this lid on here never open this lid again until you have to refill because you're what you do is you fill it up and then when you open this side and you squeeze the bottle when you squeeze it see how the glue look the glue just comes up and out this other side and you don't have to do that shakedown and then when you let go of it it pulls the glue back down away from the tip and back into this chamber if you open this you displace that air that's being utilized to move the glue around does that make sense but yeah baby by you you guys owe me some money okay so done good um let's see next week I'm just we've got the last ten minutes I'm not going to attempt anything else now if you want to by next week if you have cards and you want to do this number go ahead and get them trimmed to fit I might go and make a bunch of these cards just to put in here I am going to show you how to on the opposite side of where a card would flap over I'm going to show you how to make a pocket as we decorate so on the back sides if you jump ahead don't decorate the back sides of the envelope for a little while until if you don't want to learn how to do the pocket the angle pocket on the back side then don't worry about it but if you want to wait and learn something new I would say wait and just keep working along with me next week as well as your paper pad so you'll next week bring your paper pad again save your bits of trimmed off bits from your making cards or if you have the cards that came with the envelopes you can use those just trim them so they'll fit in your pocket so they are snug in there so like the fold of the card comes to the edge of your envelope do that you're going to bring your paper pad whichever size you decide to use and then you're going to need some chipboard and I will show you how to trim it down but it needs to be each let's see if it's six by if you have a piece that's about six by twelve that would probably give you a big enough not be enough it'll give you enough chipboard to do a spine and a front and a back and we'll attach that on there okay so this is something we're gonna do each Thursday and we'll go a little bit farther each Thursday and I figured this way it would be a project that everybody could work along and if they had questions they could be answered and if you needed more time to get to each stage you'd have all week so I only want to do a little bit of the project each week instead of trying to do a whole bunch of it and then we all end up with this journal that's half finished laying around blah blah blah so watch the replay barb just watch the replay and I will be back here next Thursday at 3:00 for another hour I want to keep these at an hour so nobody gets bored and next week bring a chipboard piece enough big enough to do a cover for your envelopes okay and your paper pad and adhesives alright and I will see you guys next week Thursday at 3 p.m. for this project 3 p.m. on Wednesday for dirty dozen or pick 10 okay thank you guys so much take care", "p3Kdj6b-eIA": "hey y'all welcome to my kitchen today my kitchen actually grown a little bit Michael's now added to the to the fly so it's st. Peggy Michael Teresa Eddie and me and of course three dogs and a cat and that's our crazy house I am gonna show y'all today probably the number one most popular recipe that I have ever printed and shared and this this recipe was given to me I can't take credit for it this woman was this recipe was given to me by a woman in Jacksonville that I liked very very much she was so funny she sent me the recipe and she said Paula this ain't my mama's banana pudding this is good food so it got it got home with that named nacho Mama's banana pudding and I don't care where I go in this United States whether it's the Midwest the Pacific side or the Atlantic side somebody is gonna say something about not your mama's banana pudding and I have to say it's the best no cook banana pudding I've ever eaten and it's really easy to make huh yes my no cook at all so I have the pudding mixed up here now we're using a five ounce box of instant vanilla pudding and it will tell you to add 3 cups of cold water but for this don't go by that recipe use 2 cups of cold water I mean cold me look I'm sorry no don't put wooden with water that would be awful so um 2 cups of milk to a 5 ounce box of banana pudding I'm out sparks of French vanilla pudding and two cups of cold milk now in this bowl we have what is equivalent to a 12 ounce container oh no this is an 8 ounce container of a whipped topping I personally I don't care for whipped toppings I always substitute if the recipe calls for a frozen whipped topping I always make my own fresh cream and I mix up to 1 cup of heavy cream I'll add 1/4 of a cup of sugar and to me that makes it the perfect sweetness so I'm taking this out of the picture because this is fresh whipped cream all right now in this bowl I've got 1 8 ounce package of softened cream cheese and to that I'm gonna add 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and this stuff is so good and every time I open a can of this and use it y'all I think about the one time that we had 17 inches of snow and I made snow cream snow ice cream I would go out and and get a bowl of nice clean snow no yellow snow no brown snow but pure white snow and I would pour a can of sweetened condensed milk into that ice cream with a little teaspoon of vanilla that you see best ice cream you'll ever put in your mouth so if you're somewhere in this country and still getting snow please make some snow cream because it's out of this world all right so I'm gonna take my little and mixer and I'm just gonna beat that up because you want your cream cheese kinda smiling and mine was nice and soft so it's gonna smooth out very very good so now all we got to do is incorporate these three bowls together so that's our sweetened condensed milk that is and our cream cheese now I'm gonna stir in our vanilla pudding which we beat the two cups of cold milk then we're gonna fold this together and not your mama's banana pudding cause the little chess man cookies but I have found it a shortbread cookie works very well too I can't actually remember the name of it maybe Walters but it's a shortbread cookie and it comes in a plaid wrap and those are really really good shortbread cookies and that works just as well - or you can even use a homemade shortbread cookie all right so now in goes our whipped cream I was actually showing y'all the wrong size because I think I said a 12 ounce container and that's what you're supposed to use a 12 ounce container or frozen whipped topping so that's that's the smallest size that they made all right so we're gonna stir this in boom phone you know me hmm and that fresh whipped cream just it just makes all the difference in the world y'all do me in this dish all right the recipe calls for two sacks of the chessmen cookies I find that I usually need three all right now I want to talk to you about bananas I slice my bananas and I sprinkled fruit fresh on them to keep them from turning dark and we're fixing to put this together with our chests and cookies and these little cookies really good y'all turn them up throw them home look like chess pieces okay now here's something else that we need to talk about oh you would have to determine this yourself do you like more custard or do you like more fruit I like more custard I just do so I think the recipe calls for like eight let's see what it calls for it calls for six to eight bananas sliced and I think I have six so it goes on to tell you to pour the mixture over the cookies and bananas and then I think this calls for like doing two layers of it but I do more than that so I'm gonna put some bananas over it and like I said I I just like I just like more custard and cookies and I do bananas here we go so many girls have told me they just that this recipe just made them a star and that makes me so happy to hear that all right this stuff makes up a lot of custard which works out good for me all right another layer of cookies that last layer you'll want to keep them straight and pretty but this one's gonna be covered up so it's alright if they're a little cockeyed so I've already gone through just go okay so that gives us two layers of bananas one thing about banana pudding yow you have to eat it pretty quickly before your banana start turning dark you think you gonna finish this I mean it's taken every bit of that cream this is perfect y'all just perfect and you'll want to make sure you cover those bananas because if they're exposed to air they will Brown a lot faster I can't resist it YUM so good it tastes like the richest of ice creams yes it tastes like ice cream all right so now if you've just bought two bags of chessmen cookies you're gonna be short on the top so that's why I recommend three boxes in that pretty yes my helmets pretty alright third sack now oh I want to tell y'all I have asked y'all to send in suggestions anything that you want to see prepared and a friend of ours from up north Gail she has asked me to make a peanut butter pie and so I'm definitely gonna do that one soon because you're talking about it easy pie that is so good and it's a basically a no foot point so they on will be doing that one soon and what else did somebody ask well Michael any want be somebody else for we've had a bunch oh yeah the chicken is out they wanted a a chicken casserole recipe and I made that yesterday so I'll be making that again soon cuz I ain't paying said that was best meal she says that she's been here in three weeks a chicken and rice casserole just easy easy I know that's not your kind of cooking ain't Peggy's never been a casserole Michael all right so y'all that's it nacho Mama's banana pudding she's a winner every time loving best dishes y'all", "bGquQJsbgjs": "hello and welcome to sweet leaf subarrays youtube channel for those of you who are new around here my name is faith Ann bode Annie and I am the owner and soap maker of sweet leaf so pari so tragically enough today is gonna have to be a little bit different because I lost two videos worth of footage and I have no idea where it went so if you came to my channel expecting a nice relaxing soap making video that I normally post I'm sorry this is not the video for you you can watch any other of my videos and we are going to figure out how much it is costing you to do your craft so I made a quick little example recipe I've never personally used it I don't know if it's gonna make great soap or not and I found out the price of each ingredient and then I calculated how much it would cost to make a batch of that soap you can use this method if you do another kind of crafting you can still use it so if you are a handmade scrunchie maker this will work just the same for you and without further ado let's go ahead and start doing some math so before I did this video I did a little bit of research so I just made my own recipe this is just a made-up recipe I have no idea if it makes good soap or not but anyway so I got my oils and then I calculated how much I would need in my batch and I'm doing it off of a 22 ounce batch and then I went to wholesalesuppliesplus.com and I figured out how much I would need to buy and its price and something really important to note is I went to nature's garden candle and I wanted to put an example fragrance oil in so for this batch size you would only really need one ounce of fragrance oil and 1 ounce would cost two dollars and 85 cents however it would cost me 10 dollars and 73 cents just to ship it so that will obviously make your price go way up so please factor in your shipping because it really does throw off your numbers two dollars and 85 cents compared to you know this together being 13 dollars is a lot it's a huge difference it's a $10 difference so just remember your shipping costs - okay so let's get into the actual math on how to calculate how much your craft is costing you so in my recipe we're gonna start with coconut oil and how we're going to do this is we are going to set up two ratios okay my first ratio is going to be how much it costs to buy the whole thing so my container that I found on wholesale supplies plus on Susannah oil and for the whole thing it would cost three dollars and 36 cents so this one over here is going to be how much is used in my recipe so in the recipe it calls for 6.6 ounces of coconut oil and it's really important to have your ounces on top and your dollars on the bottom you need to have the same things on top and the same things on the bottom okay so our bottom number needs to be our dollar amount and we do not know how much it would cost to make a bar of soap we don't know our cost of coconut oil for one bar of soap so we have a ratio set up now what we need to do is cross multiply so we are going to multiply this X and the 16 ounces and then we're going to multiply our three dollars and 36 cents and our 6.6 ounces so we end up with 16 x equals K we need to do three point three six times six point six and that equals 22 point one seven six and I'm just going to round up to 22 point one eight the next thing we need to do is we need to get our X all by itself so we need to divide this 16 on both sides of our equal sign so we'll end up with x equals let's see we have 22 point 1 8 divided by 16 okay so this is going to give me 1 point 3 9 if we're rounding one point three nine dollars another thing that I would like to point out is this is per batch so in my batch specifically in my mold I can get seven bars of soap so at the end I'm going to divide this by seven I'm going to do all of my other oils if you guys would like to see the full process so I'm going to do my oils in my lye and then at the end I'm going to add together all of these numbers and then I'm going to divide by seven because there are seven bars in my batch [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so if my fake little pretend recipe I use one dollar and thirty-nine cents of coconut oil $0.77 of palm oil two dollars and 89 cents worth of olive oil $0.83 worth of castor oil and I use zero dollars and eighty two cents worth of light I didn't do the fragrance I didn't do any colorants or water costs or anything fragrance oil is an optional thing you don't have to add fragrance oil so if you're trying to make the most cost-effective bar possible you most likely when an add fragrance or colorants and remember these numbers are per batch so I'm going to add these up so after we add all of this up we get six dollars and 70 cents and then we need to divide this by seven if we want to find the bar size so for my batch it would cost six dollars and seventy cents and for my bars it would cost zero dollars and 96 cents per bar if we're rounding and just nope I divided my batch number by seven because that's how many bars I get out of my mold so divide by how many you get out of your mold so that is how you figure out how much your craft is costing you so the recipe that I use and the amount of oils were for a regular standard sized bar of soap without any fragrance or colorant I also did not factor in any shipping but as I showed you in the video shipping can really fluctuate your numbers and again you can use this for any kind of craft that you do so if you make lotion or candles or if you are a painter you can use this as well this is not just a calculation for soap makers I know today's video is a little bit different we looked at more of the business east side of soap but if you like this video please consider liking and subscribing it really helps out my channel if you liked this business\u00ed different kind of video let me know in the comments below what videos I should make in the future and I hope you all have a wonderful day and I will see you in the next video", "-PDSekItbPQ": "today we are going to learn how to multiply fractions before we multiply fractions I want to review simple as 4 because it will help you today so on the bottom left I have 6 8 that's a fraction that's not in simple as 4 I need to think of a number that divides into both 6 and 8 and I can divide 6 and 8 by 2 so I'm going to do 6 divided by 2 and I'm going to do 8 divided by 2 so 6 divided by 2 is 3 and 8 divided by 2 is 4 so 6 eighths in simplest form is 3/4 they are both equivalent they're both equal but the 3/4 is in simplest form the 6/8 is not I know they're equivalent because I divided the numerator and denominator by the exact same number so on the right I have four twelfths so I'm going to put it into simplest form so I need to think of a number that I can divide both 4 and 12 by and I can divide 4 and 12 by 2 but I can also divide them by 4 I'm going to choose the 4 because it's larger and so I'm gonna do 4 divided by 4 and then 12 divided by 4 so 4 divided by 4 is 1 and 12 divided by 4 is 3 so for 12 in simplest form is 1/3 something else I want to go over is that in math of often means to multiply I'll show you what I mean so on the bottom left here I have a $5 bill if I have 1 $5 bill I have $5 but let's say that I have three of them three of them so there's one $5 bill there's two $5 bills now I have three $5 bills if I have three of them I have $15 so I multiplied three sets five will give you 15 on the right I have two ounces of rice let's say I have four of them so there's one two three four of them four bags of rice four sets of two will give you eight ounces all together so I multiplied so the of means to multiply so now I have 1/2 of 1/4 and we know that means 1/2 times 1/4 because I just told you that of means to multiply and I showed you how and so on the right I have a drawing of 1/4 I want to find one half of the 1/4 so I'm going to take my 1/4 and find half of it so I'm going to split it in half and there is my answer 1/2 of 1/4 well how much is that that is 1/8 so 1/2 of 1/4 is 1/8 it might be easier if I split them all in half so that you can see that there's 8 so this is one piece to piece 3 4 5 6 7 8 so there's 8 pieces so right here is 1/8 so 1/2 of 1/4 is 1/8 or 1/2 times 1/4 is equivalent to 1/8 so 1/2 of 1/4 is 8 1/2 times 1/4 is 1/8 because of is the same as multiply all so noticing something allons if I multiply 1 times 1 I get 1 and if I multiply 2 times 4 I get a look at that let's look at another one I have 1/3 of 1/5 we know that that is 1 times 1/5 but I want to find 1/3 of 1/5 so I have a drawing of 1/5 and I'm gonna find a third of it so there we go I split it up in 2/3 so my 1/5 if I divide it up into thirds if I find a third of 1/5 there's my answer right there 115 and look at that if I multiply the numerators 1 times 1 that gives you 1 if I multiply the denominators 3 times 5 that gives you 15 1/3 times 1/5 is one 15th 1/3 of 1/5 is 1 15th and on the next slide it's gonna repeat these steps the steps to multiplying fractions is to first multiply the numerators then multiply the denominators and then simplify if needed so in the middle here I have 2/3 times 1/5 I'm going to follow the steps multiply the numerators so 2 times 1 is 2 and 3 times 5 is 15 and I get to 15th and I want to make sure that I've simplified and 215 is in simplest form you can't divide 2 and 15 by any whole numbers except for one but we know we're not going to do that we've talked about that and so we have 250 here's another one 1/4 times 2 6 I'm going to multiply the numerators multiply the denominators and simplify if needed so 1 times 2 is 2 and 4 times 6 is 24 1/4 times 2 6 is 2 twenty-fourths but that answer is not in simplest form so I'm going to need to simplify here so I can divide 2 and 24 by 2 so 2 divided by 2 is 1 and four divided by two is 12 and so I've got my final answer here 112 here's a few more so I have at the top 4/5 times 1/2 I'm going to multiply the numerators multiply the denominators and simplify if needed so 4 times 1 is 4 5 times 2 is 10 and I am going to need to simplify here I hope you noticed - they're both even when the numerator and denominator are both even you know you can divide the numerator and denominator by 2 so I am going to divide or divide it by 2 10 divided by 2 and so 4 divided by 2 is 2 10 divided by 2 is 5 and my answer is 2/5 now the next one - 6 of 3/5 well I know that's multiplied so I'm just going to change that of to a multiplication symbol so now I could multiply 2 times 3 is 6 and 6 times 5 is 30 so first I multiplied the numerators and did 2 times 3 to get 6 then I multiplied the denominators I did 6 times 5 to get 30 and then at the end I need to simplify if I need to and I'm looking at that 6 thirtieths and I'm hope you're noticing that it's not in simplest form you can divide the numerator and denominator by 2 because they're both even but it's easier to find the largest number that you can divide them both by and you can divide the numerator and denominator by 6 so I'm gonna divide the numerator and denominator by 6 6 divided by 6 this one 30 divided by 6 is 5 and we got 1/5 now over here on this slide I have 1/3 plus 1/2 I just want to remind you how to add fractions so we don't start adding them like we multiply them so you don't say 1 plus 1 is 2 and 3 plus 2 is 5 that is not how we add fractions that's how you multiply them but it's how you add them so if I'm going to add 1/3 plus 1/2 what I'm going to do is stack them on top of each other because that's how we did it in class or it's probably how you did it in fourth grade so I'm adding 1/3 plus 1/2 here and I need to make equivalent fractions with the same denominator so my new denominator is going to be 6 and so 3 times 2 is 6 1 times 2 is 2 I hope this is looking familiar and 2 times 3 is 3 and 1 times 3 is 3 so 1/3 is equivalent to 2 6 1/2 is equivalent to 3 6 now 2 6 plus 3 6 is 5 6 and so 1/3 plus 1/2 is 5/6 I first stack them on top of each other like we did in class then I made equivalent fractions with the same denominator like we did in class or like you did in fourth grade and I added them up to 6 plus 3 6 is 5/6 and my answer is in simplest for now over here I have 4 fifths plus 1/8 so first thing I'm going to do is stack them on top of each other because that's the way that we practice in class you don't have to stack them on top of each other but since it's the way that we practice and probably the way you did in fourth grade that's what we're going to do and so now I'm going to make the denominators the same with equivalent fractions my new denominator is going to be 40 and so 5 times 8 is 40 4 times 8 is 32 8 times 5 is 40 1 times 5 is 5 hopefully this is looking familiar and now I have 32 fortieths plus 5 40th which is 37 40th and that is in simplest form and so four fifths plus one-eighth you is 37 40s now I'm going to do 4/5 times 1/8 and so we're going to multiply the numerators multiply the denominators and simplify if needed I actually think multiplying fractions can be easier than adding and subtracting because you don't need to make the denominators the same so we don't stack them like we did when we added and subtract them we can just keep them side by side so first we multiply the numerators four times one is four then we multiply the denominators 5 times 8 is 40 so I got for 40th it's not in simplest form you can divide the numerator and denominator by 4 so 4 divided by 4 is 1 40 divided by 4 it's 10 and we got 110 now let's do some more so I have 4 6 of 2/5 so I know of is multiplied I'm just gonna put a multiplication symbol right over the up and I'm gonna do for 6 times 2/5 first thing I'm going to do is multiply the numerators then I'm going to multiply the denominators and then I'm going to simplify if needed so now 4 times 2 is 8 6 times 5 is 30 my answer is 8 30 X and I need to double check to see if that's in simplest form and it's not you can divide the numerator and denominator by 2 so 8 divided by 2 is 4 30 divided by 2 is 15 and 4 15 is in simplest form you can't divide the numerator and denominator by any whole numbers except for one but we've talked about that so now at the bottom I have 2/5 times 1/3 I'm going to multiply the numerators multiply the denominators simplify if necessary so 2 times 1 is 2 5 times 3 is 15 that isn't simples for and so my answer is 2:15 and that is how you multiply fractions you multiply the numerators multiply the denominators simplify if necessary next week I'm going to show you a way to simplify before you multiply but we'll talk more about that next week so for now we are going to multiply the numerators multiply the denominators and simplify if necessary so down here we did 2 times 1 is 2 5 times 3 is 15 and then we check to see if we need to simplify and we don't 215 is in simplest form thank you", "ecslKbLQf88": "hey everyone this is sassy the turbo chef but today I'm making Louie gooey butter cake and I am going to make a cream cheese frosting to go on top of it as well some people use just powdered sugar the way can you see what I do all right so come back with me and we'll get started [Music] [Music] okay the beginning of this section of the video ID already existed all the ingredients in it how much you used but I'm showing you all the ingredients I'm gonna be using powder sugar butter short beans salt cream cheese softened butter and vanilla acts extract for both the dumplings gonna be for both and I'm gonna have total of four eggs cream cheese half a cup of melted butter and yellow cake mix which I prefer the duck tonight is perfectly moist and this part right here is gonna be the cake and that's gonna be the frosting all right so be right back and let's get started okay I've already put the two eggs there half a cup of melted butter and the cake mix will mix this up real quick I'm gonna probably mute the sound because this camera is really close to this mixer all right here we go okay now definitely you can see the consistency it it looks really silky smooth and fluffy at the same time so let's go put this in the arm p.m. be right back okay I sprayed the pan with the it's called PM baking see it has the flower in it it's going to keep sticking cuz you want this cake pull away from the sides it's gonna look like almost and also it's like taffy but you just see why it needs to be that way oh god that looks so good at two I could eat it off this there goes my sugar level spread it on there as evenly as possible once you have this type of cake you don't want to go back to the normal cake this is good alright that's about as good a good get yes I'm gonna link that here in a bit you okay now the next thing I'm going to do is reference to the GUI part is I am going to take that 1/8 ounce cream cheese that's been softened in two eggs and I'm going to beat them and cream them together before I add the confectioner sugar so here we go again okay there we go it looks a little bit smoother yes you're gonna have a few little lumps and that is okay because with my typing add the sugar and get that all beaded in just it will smooth out all right so here we go again add a little bit at a time you don't have a powdered sugar bump and start off slow scrape the other sides as you go that's the more tea has a full 16 ounces which is approximately 4 cups four to six cups you'll be able to chop eyes once you open up the 16 up I know what it's supposed to look like so if you'll see ok the consistency is very similar to what the cake looks the cake part looks like so let's go over to him put this one in the pan or is a glass dish whatever you want to call it be right back can you just pour it right on the top it spread it all over and you're thinking oh god this is never gonna bake to look like a cake not with all that trust me you're gonna love this okay guys most out there I can't but guess what I'm looking this spoon to be rad back okay this is where I get my cake my frostings better and I smooth that all over the top there we go put this in the oven at 350 degrees between 20 to 25 minutes go and check it you can either get a toothpick or a knife just remember this is a GUI GUI okay so there might be some gooeyness but you'll be able to tell the difference between GUI and raw all right here we go see you back to here about 30 minutes okay inside here I already have full cup of softened butter and a half cup of the shortening and then I get a little bit of salt that's muscular there and no let's blend these together first before we add the cream cheese and before we add the sugar so let's go well I hate to tell you this folks big blooper I thought I had the video I should say the camera recording well I was making this so here's what it looks like and I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do with it they blue per se ok so this will be my blue fur frosty and I'm gonna have a poop or everything alright here we go alright be back in a few okay let's check this again I'm still all wrong yes I'd say you okay here it is with the cream cheese frosting I only did a little dab because this is a very sweet cake it has all those gooeyness let me see if I could zoom in on it look at that look at that GUI now you're wondering where's that other piece hold on there it is you [Music]", "5oDG2i6rwjU": "I'm not gonna do that but I don't have a problem with this we're obviously working with the shotgun today specifically in 12-gauge the Remington Slugger 1 ounce Magnum rifled slug 3 inch shells there's a close-up of that and a close-up of the rifled foster slug so I'm gonna use that in a smoothbore let's get another look at that it's got your rifling on there and guess what it's hollow it is not a solid through and through piece a lid so we might have some interesting things happen with that I was using the Mossberg 590 a1 special purpose that is a 20 inch barrel and obviously I would not have shot through my own vehicle but it would be interesting to see what it would do to a couple of car doors although I don't think this particular slug would pass through both sides and here's the reason why on those jugs that was from 20 feet just water jugs 1 gallon jugs it only penetrated the first three that is it here's what happened this broke apart in two pieces in fact the smallest of those was lying on the ground just in front of the target and the widest point diameter is over an inch and a half this has a muzzle velocity of over 1,700 feet per second let's try it in something else we have a block of the sim test media calibrated to match ballistic gel specs it is 20 inches in length weighs approximately 50 pounds we're going to tag this from 20 feet I have some water jug back up and trees if necessary I don't think either of those are going to be needed based on what we saw in the water this offers much tougher resistance anticipating some fragmentation as we had earlier and I think worst-case scenario is possibly a fragment exiting the side of the block I'm also going to put a drop cloth on the ground just in case this goes vertical and jumps off the table all right oh wow most impressive oh good grief good grief what a mess looks like it hit low very low I was aiming right for the center how about that all right let's take it apart see what we can find due to the weak conditions I had to bring this into the garage I've already found a section of the slug this was underneath the target platform that weighs approximately one quarter of an ounce so we are on our way there's another perspective of that this is the entry point this section fell off during transit down here to the garage which was about 60 70 yards this is the entry point so technically I was in the block just very very low and by the way that was delivering roughly two thousand eight hundred foot-pounds of muzzle energy given that weight and velocity so there's a close-up of the damaged path and this is the first five to six inches to give you a perspective this is what caused that or contributed to it there is the hall from that shot to give you some perspective and let me give you another one okay several minutes have passed I figured out what's happened here this is the point of entry and I shouldn't have to remind you this at the bottom of the block here is the path moving this direction and thank goodness it curved upward at about this point eight to eight and a half inches it exploded into multiple fragments and I had to cut some bacon slices to find those this is the segment that I found on the ground I think it impacted right here and dropped out here's the next segment this traveled nine and a half inches and the largest segment traveled twelve and a half inches imagine that the heavier the segment deeper the penetration maximum diameter is nearly one point four inches combined weight of the fragments is 0.97 nine ounces I might find some additional fragments during the melting process what more can you say about these things they are freaking awesome I know some folks use them for target practice but many might use it for hunting so you're definitely gonna have some massive trauma blood loss bone crushing raw energy in these things and you're certainly aware of that for home defense I'm not a big proponent of these I would much rather use a large buckshot unless of course you have bears and other large critters roaming your yard and within your house that's not a good thing so hopefully this was educational maybe even a little bit fun thanks for watching", "0ERh-nj5jjw": "Hey everybody, it's Charlotte. Today on\nMaker's Moments, we will be teaching you how to find out how much candle wax you need. Calculating the amount of wax that you will need depends on how many candles you are planning to make, as well as the total ounce fill for each container. First, you'll want to find out the total ounce fill for the vessel or container you plan to use. Many candle container companies will give you the ounce fill. For example, you can find the ounce fill for all the vessels from The Wooden Wick Co. under the description on each product page. Next, you will want to subtract an\nounce from that container's fill to account for your candles fill line. For\nsafety purposes you never want to fill a candle container to its full capacity.\nAlways allow for a minimum of approximately a quarter inch around the\ndiameter of your candle to be free of wax. To do this, you can subtract one ounce of wax from your container fill. For example, if my container fill is 8 ounces, I'd only be using 7 ounces of wax to fill the container. Next, you'll want to add up the total amount of your ounce fill by the amount of candles that you would like to make. Here, I'm making six candles, so I would want to multiply 7 ounces by 6 candles - I'll need a total of 42 ounces of wax. Most waxes out there will be sold in pounds. You will want to calculate the ounce conversion for your chosen wax. For example, virgin coconut soy from The Woden Wick Co. is sold in five pound slabs. This is equal to roughly 80 ounces of\nliquid wax, so I would need only one slab of wax and have some leftover for the\nspecific candle project. Ready to put your newfound knowledge into practice? How do you calculate the amount of wax you will need? Let us know in the\ncomments below. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay in the know on all the latest maker's tips and tricks. See you next time on Maker's Moments.\nHappy making!", "KtA3gpvl3Cs": "hello this is a wise guys yes I shouldn't talk about dilution calculation pathway what is dilution that oh she means are more solvent is added and the solute remains the same as a result because solute to remain same and more cemente add it so the water of solution gets more so that's why the concentration of the solution becomes wrong right how do we say the concentration the concentration C you call the amount of solute divided amount of solution by a multi hundred percent right when this one you add most event the solute solution equals the solution you cause solute press so met when at the most event so root to stay sane so the solution the volume of solution gets more but salutis to stay sane so in this situation this is the fraction when numerator stays stay same and the denominator gets greater so the fraction gets smaller so that's why the concentration gets smaller so let's look at example and question one using a dilution procedure looking for how many milliliters of 15% master volume sodium chloride solution I needed to make 1,500 milliliter of 0.9% sodium chloride solution so when you do a question about the dilution you always make clear solute doesn't change so we're looking for how many solute so because the amount of solute in both solution 1 is concentrated solution the other is diluted solution stay safe so let's look at this one how many milliliter 50% of this well I needed to make 1,500 middle of 0.9% solution so from 15% to 0.9% the solution is diluted so 0.9% is 0.9% means there are zero point nine grams of solute in 100 milliliters of solution right that's percent because zero point nine over 100 zero point nine grams solute over 100 milliliter of source now we make 1,500 milliliters solution that's why we can set the ratio zero point nine grams over hundred milliliter equals we need fifteen hundred million so this is a how many how much salute so we can find X equals because both side we can zero cancel zero cancel so X multiplier one you called fifteen one five zero point nine we got fifteen times 0.9 the unit because we're looking for X when milliliter middle either cancel out the answer will be got their grams so 15 times this is the X cat is a one point five times nine is thirteen point five grams so we need the thirteen point five we have thirteen point five grams of salt and the 13.5 thirteen point five grams of solute it from concentrated so then we write the solution that's why we looking for the volume from fifteen percent we can say fifteen percent means 15 grams in each unit either this is a high concentration this is the low concentration so 15 grams in hundred milliliter now we have we needed 13 point 5 gram is how many milliliters solution right so in this situation first you need focus on how many how much solute after find the number of solute because solute stay say so then you go to the console how how many you need so in this situation we can calculate x equals you cross multiply she cross multiplication and then x times 15 and 15 on the bottom and 100 times thirteen point five which is 13.5 multiply hungry right then we got x equals the top is one three five zero divided the 15 then we can use calculate to find the answer so during the calculation every time you need the folks on the solute it doesn't change right so we have 1350 divided the 15 you call it 90 so this is a 90 minute even because this one is grams gram cancel out so actually call me really so X because ninety milliliters so we need 90 million liters of 15 percent and the sodium chloride the solution and to make a fifteen hundred milliliter of 0.9% solution this is the question one question to how much cement in milliliters should be added to five milliliters of a 50.0 milligram per milliliter antibiotic solution to decrease the concentration to one percent this question is looking for so vent because cement press the root because solution in dilution situation so rule to never change just add more cement so that's why we still for are looking for how much salute now the information they say how much cement in the region should be added to five milliliter of 50 milligrams per milliliter antibiotic solution let's make a picture this one because in for example in a graduated major and you have I say you have five milliliter this is a five million five milliliter solution which is 50 milligram per minute this is a 50 milligram per milliliter concentration right this way and now we need to decrease the concentration to one percent so that means you need to add them most select so at the most event becomes two less concentration right become a less concentration now this is still five this is still five maybe leader this is right and this way the final volume solution we don't know we're looking for and then the solute is stained saying so that's why we need a first using these two information to find the number of solute so the number of solute is we can say 55 milliliter multiplied 50 milligrams per milliliter so we have milliliter middle it'll cancel out with 250 milligrams absolute so this is inside is 250 meter 250 milligrams of solute and even after dilute I rotate still 250 milligrams but distribute in more select so now you can say the final concentration because you still have 250 milligrams but you have more so when you have more volume of solution and become the Constituent become one percent the one percent means one gram in 100 milliliter so now you can see how much this one we don't know so this is the X right it's an X leader todos Russia and the solute is tasting so it 250 milligrams so you can write X milliliter to 50 milligram but the milligrams and the grams is not matching unit so we need convert the same unit from grams to milligrams but I solid so one grams you can't win solvent milligrams so then you can see we're working with these two this part what sorry this one should be when gram to install the meter when the ball you stay 100 right 400 see 100 and this is a 250 we're looking for so then you can see these two zero zero kinds of out right then we look at the dis one obviously cross multiplication we can say the milligrams is x equals you cross my 3k Sheen you got 250 and what PI 1 you cause 100 we got the 25 made it easy so this is 25 this is X you call 25 milliliter the final solution is 25 minute ago so we're looking for servant obvious you can see before you have 5 milliliter now you need the 25 milliliter so the solution servant equals so so when T equals 25 minus 5 and this is a milliliter you call tiny milliliter this one is the milliliters of cement okay this is presented by y sky thank you", "3pyEwOfIhpg": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] how's it going everybody welcome back to teak and build my name is ty campbell and in this week's episode we are continuing with our team low sea racing 8x e electric four-wheel drive eighth scale buggy built last week we covered basically the entire buggy build up to almost rolling chassis status our chassis is pretty much assembled and ready to accept our electronics we just need to assemble our motor mount and get that in which we are gonna cover in our motor install once our motors installed we will go ahead and install our t 250 steering servo and then we're going to install our RX 8 gen 3 and do all of our soldering so let's get started on our electronics starting with our motor now this is our Gen 3 motor that we're gonna install in our 8th scale buggy kit let's go ahead and crack this box open so we've got the gen 3 this is a 1900 kV motor and then we've also got the shielded sensor wire now this is actually TLRs new motor mount setup and if you can picture how this sits in the car it's gonna sit about like this the motor actually slides through these clamps and then you tighten this screw down and that clamps down on this motor and holds it nice and secure now there are three different size odor rings for this clamp setup provided in the kit our motors are a 40 millimeter motor but because the clamps grab around the ribbing we're gonna actually this is actually a 42 millimeter motor with the ribbing so you're gonna have to figure out which one of these o-rings there's three different sizes so we've got this size this size and this size so I'm gonna go with the one that TLR recommends for forty two millimeter cans assembling this motor mount is pretty easy all you have to do is pop each one of these o-rings into the each slot there's four of them into this clamp motor mount now once you've got the o-rings inside the TL our motor clamp you just want to line these guys up a little bit so that we can slide these over our motor [Music] and you just want to get them closed because we're gonna throw it in the car then that'll set the spacing on them and before we mount our motor and the chassis we want to undo this screw right here holding the sensor wire clip this is what holds the sensor wire nice and tight to the back of the motor just gives us some added protection and a little bit more insurance that it doesn't pop out during a run so all you have to do is loosen up this screw take your sensor wire and pop that into this clip and then reinstall that clip on the back of the motor [Music] then we want to take the entire motor clamp assembly with the motor and set it in the chassis just get it close we're not going to clamp any this down yet because we're still gonna have to shift this in order to line our pinning up to our spur gear [Music] now that our motor is loosely mounted we're gonna want to mount up our pinion gear so we're just gonna put a little dab a lock tight on the pinion set screw threads slide this onto our motor shaft we need this loose so that we can line these up so you want to get both of these as in line as possible and we can go ahead and tighten down our set screw [Music] now for gear mesh you'll want to set these to where you've got just a little bit of rock in the spur gear so it's too tight you'll want to move the motor out away from the spur gear just slide it out this way so you don't want it to where it just barely rocks a little bit too loose it'll be noisy too tight it'll be noisy and Rob you have some power and might make your motor get a little hot [Music] once you tighten down the motor clamp screws just go ahead and check it again I like to rotate this about 90 degrees four times and make sure that you've got knock everywhere now for clocking our motor position you'll want to have these tabs pointed over here so that they're away from the outside of the car when this might change the mess just a little bit so after tightening this clamp down you probably just want to recheck the mesh now these are actually our motor clamp screws so same thing like we always do with any screws going into aluminum we are going to put some Loctite on it so it doesn't come loose once we snug those down our motor should be nice and tight shouldn't be able to twist that looks pretty good RTA sitting nicely in that motor mount let's move on to of getting our servo installed now the t 250 now some of you are probably wondering what the numbers mean for each servos designation and it's pretty simple basically that 250 on this T 250 means you can expect about 250 ounces of torque at 6 volts now we rated on a 74 and at 8 volts so the torque is obviously going to change as is the speed I'm gonna run this on our rx eights high voltage VDC so we should expect more around 300 ounces of torque and a 0.08 second transit speed versus the 0.09 at 6 volts so in our servo box we've got our t 250 servo we've got our crowbar clamping servo horn up here in the top we've got all your standard servo goodies there's actually a plastic servo arm in here that has an aluminum collar that goes around it it's actually a really good plastic servo arm if you ever need to run anything that's lightweight otherwise we're just gonna use the clamping crowbar design to mount our servo we'll just go ahead and feed it into the TL our servo mount you want to fish this wire through this is actually gonna go into our receiver box [Music] and then use the included m3 by 12 millimeter socket cap screws with a washer I don't have a receiver in yet but we'll go ahead and just fish this through into our receiver box pretty straightforward mounting the servo in the car it's just like any other standard servo you would see out there now let's get into our rx-8 wiring so we can power this thing up and actually send her our servo set our epa's and then we'll go into some esc programming [Music] this is everything that you'll get in the RX 8 gen 3 packaging obviously you'll get the RX a gen 3 itself the fan pack with the necessary hardware to mount the fan there are also four small screws to mount via this bolt pattern on the bottom of the ESC should you choose to do so there is the wire this also has the hot wire data cable in here for plugging into the data fan port and three pieces of 12-gauge wire we've got our ESC manual make sure you keep this handy because it's got all kinds of troubleshooting tips that QuickStart guide is in there and should you have any issues all the warranty information is in here these two are basically just if you have a hot wire and you want to plug into this ESC make sure you go get the latest hot wire off of our website or off of the Play Store so that it will connect to the RX a gen 3 now let's figure out where we're gonna mount this in our 8 se first we're gonna mount tlrs ESC plate into the car always lock tight into aluminum I already put double-sided tape on the bottom of my rx-8 gen3 we're just gonna mount it on the TLR electronics plate probably sit something about like this so the RX 8 Gen 3 is now mounted I went ahead and just used double-sided tape like I showed earlier and it's in there nice and solid it shouldn't move anywhere and I also routed at the receiver wire back under here actually went underneath the motor can and then the wire fits right in between the mudguard and the actual motor mount clamps and then just ran it right down the side of the car and into the receiver box and I did that just to keep it away from any moving parts because I don't want it to get chewed up in the spur gear now with the ESC is mounted we can go ahead and start wiring it up to our motor and get our battery plug on now let's find the solder our esc into our car there are a few little tools that will make things easier I love this jig this is called the jigs up you can get this online it's fairly inexpensive and it's got all kinds of positions and stuff it can hold plugs it just makes soldering a lot easier it's like having a second set of hands available we just need our 12 gauge wire this is what we're going to use for our motor and our battery connections so the first thing we want to do is strip the end of our wire and I normally like to take off you know about five six millimeters it's not a whole lot because you just need a little bit of wire showing that'll make tinting it easier so all we want to do is take our wire stripper use the 12 gauge and just strip a little bit off the end give those buyers a good twist and then we're gonna place this in our soldering jig nice clean iron tip we're gonna go ahead and blow some solder onto there and then we're going to tin the end of this wire now taining just prepares the wire for better adhesion to the solder post if you want to overdo it with your solder you just want to get some into the strands and we're gonna want to do that with five different pieces of wire so we're gonna do that same procedure each time to prepare our wire to solder onto our RIT posts we're gonna do the same thing on our ESC post we're going to tin them so clean iron a little bit of solder on the iron tip and then you're just gonna want to put it into this solder pocket on the rx-8 posts flow a little bit of solder don't go crazy with it because we don't want too much and we're gonna do that for each of our five solder posts now we're gonna take our pre tinned wire and so why aren't this VSC I'm actually going to stand my wires up coming out of the posts and then route them over and then attach them to the motor tabs now I'm gonna wrap the wires this way because that puts any tension or any weight pulling the tabs towards the front of the motor and there's a rivet holding the solder tab to this phenolic board in the back of the motor you can put the wires off the back I don't recommend it just because then you've got some tension pulling that and it's gonna want to pull that rivet out so now we're gonna take our tinned wire and our tinned ESC post and we're going to solder them together clean iron tip a little bit of solder float on there and we are going to heat up the wire just a little bit heat up the post we're gonna bring them together and apply heat to both of them this should only take two or three seconds at the most if you can't hold the wire this close to your solder joint it's too hot you're gonna get solder flowing up into the strands which is gonna make the wire really stiff and you're gonna risk it getting a cold solder joint so now that we've got this wire this is our a phase wire we're gonna route this how we want it to be routed we want to keep them somewhat short so I'll probably run mine about like this and then I'll just clip it at the length that we want I'm gonna strip this back just like we did on this side I'm gonna tin the wire I'm gonna tin the solder tab on the 1988 and then we're going to use the same process for soldering it up to the ESC [Music] all right so we got all of our wires soldered up we've got our three leads to the motor and then we've got our battery connector now we just need to plug the sensor wire in and you can get shorter versions of these this is a two hundred millimeter sensor wire we do do a 150 so four installs where the ESC is pretty close to the motor it's pretty handy to have a shorter version but this can tuck right down next to the ESC and just plug right into the sensor port now we're gonna make sure that we didn't hook our positive negative up backwards so we've got positive going down to the positive which is between the C and B phase on the rx-8 so moment of truth all right so everything looks good you can see that the rx-8 is flashing all right now that means no radio signal is detected and that's because I don't have the radio powered up and the receivers not in the car so I'll toss a receiver in and then we can dive into getting our servo set up and then we'll set up our rx-8 setting up our servo is really easy all you need to do is make sure that your transmitter is bound to your receiver and then go ahead and power on the car that will let the servo fly in center so servo is on just make sure now make sure that it is centered before you go any further we're gonna go ahead and hook up our steering linkage with our 20 millimeter crowbar arm you want to make sure that this comes off the servo about 90 degrees that way you get your left and right throws equal so we've got that on there [Music] looks like our steering throw is backwards right now so we're gonna reverse our steering once you reversed our steering just verify its turn the right way so that's left right then we're gonna set our end points or the epa's the end point adjustments in the transmitter this could be under a couple different things depending on your transmitter usually it's under something called travel or servo or something along those lines so once you're in the travel menu you just want to go ahead and turn all the way one direction and you can see that this is turning too far and tweaking our receiver box a little bit so we're gonna turn the left throw down just a big there we go now won't be the right side there we go so we got left and right a PA set once that's all set you'll just want to put the screw in the top of here tighten down these two clamping screws that'll actually clamp the servo horn on to the spline gear and then put that top screw in just to hold everything together [Music] [Music] now we just have to do some initial setup on our rx-8 the factory settings I highly recommend just starting with those and then you can dial it in wherever you want to but the first thing we need to do is make sure our transmitter is bound up to our receiver and then we're gonna do a radio calibrate on the esc so we turn this on and it should find neutral all right so our receiver is putting out an acceptable neutral signal so the esc accepted that armed and is now ready to drive make sure that your throttle trim is centered and then to perform a radio calibration all you do is press the mode button this starts the sequence finds neutrals first and it found it now it's flashing up here on this side increments I'd looking for full throttle so pull full throttle on your transmitter it accepted full throttle so now we want a full brake signal push full brake and we are calibrated and ready to go and it should flash over to this side and then back to Center that's your onboard eat indicator so right now it's at ambient temperature and it will climb the ladder up towards the right-hand side or the increment button side as the esc heats up so that's a good temperature indicator on there the last thing we want to do is set our voltage cutoff the rx-8 comes out of the box with a 2s lipo cutoff so if we're gonna be running 4 cell and our ibague we need to set it for 4 cell now it's super easy you can do it on board with the buttons all you want to do is push this mode button seven times up to VC hit increment that enters a setting there's two lights showing that's 2's so we hit it two more times or that's four cell let it rearm [Music] and now we're ready to go drive that's all the time we have for today we made some great progress on our 8x8 build we got our ESC installed and soldered up we got our motor installed and soldered up we hooked up our t250 steering servo and got that all ready to go next week we're gonna get into mounting up some tires and then just doing a final setup and screw check on this car just to make sure everything is tight and give it a shakedown run I really hope you're enjoying the build so far I'm having fun putting a new eighth scale buggy together and I can't wait to get out and actually do some racing make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out on any future videos like the video if you liked it go ahead and share with your friends so they can join in on the fun I'm Ty Campbell and I'll see you next week for another episode of taking builds [Music]", "zVqunZUuwSs": "today on the stay at home chef I'm showing you how to make the most amazing lasagna you guys should know by now that when I call it the most amazing it truly is this recipe for lasagna is full of authentic flavor and homemade goodness you're gonna love it we're gonna start on the stove with some ground beef and ground Italian sausage you'll want to add a pound of each so we have the Italian sausage and then a pound of ground beef into a large pot over medium heat then grab a spoon and start breaking up all of your meat and get it cooking once you've broken it up a little bit add in one large white onion that you've minced up as well as five crushed garlic cloves stir this in and let it all cook you'll want to make sure you cook the meat through completely before moving on to the next step we're creating a sauce and so it's all about layers and adding things in one at a time and creating a delicious homemade creation it does take some time but trust me it's worth it in the end I used a 93 7 ground beef so that it's nice and lean and doesn't create too much fat and you can see there's not a lot of fat in there some of that is liquid from the onion that has released but we don't want to add too much fat to this the fat that you're getting mostly comes from the sausage and we're not adding in any extra fat either so it all balances out and it works out in the end next we're gonna start developing even more flavors by adding in a secret ingredient one teaspoon of fennel seed this gives it that truly authentic feel sprinkle that in there follow it up with one teaspoon of ground oregano do 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/4 teaspoon of pepper 2 tablespoons of sugar 1/2 a cup of freshly chopped basil and a quarter cup of freshly chopped parsley stir this in real quick those fresh herbs adding a lot of flavor and give this pasta a fresh homemade feel follow that up with half a cup of chicken broth a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes 15 ounces of tomato sauce and then there's a nice secret weapon - 6 ounce cans of tomato paste tomato paste has such a concentrated flavor that we're able to add in a lot of tomato goodness in here with just a couple of ingredients we're really making that tomato flavor come out strong and bold when it comes to this sauce then we simply start stirring it and bring it to a simmer you can already see that this sauce is super Hardy and meaty and it smells absolutely amazing once it comes to a simmer it will reduce the heat to medium-low simmering is the time for your sauce to develop a lot of flavor the ingredients play off of each other and release a lot of different complex flavors as the heat is applied to it so you'll want to make sure that you simmer your sauce for a good period of time you'll want to simmer it for at least an hour and up to four hours for a really developed flavor now if you don't want to do this on the stove you can always put it into a slow cooker on high and let it develop flavor there you'll want to give it just an occasional stir and if it's in the crock-pot you don't need to stir it at all but this sauce is definitely made with a little bit of love and look at how delicious that looks while the sauce is over there bubbling and boiling I want to show you one of the coolest lasagna hacks ever you're gonna take your noodles and put them into the bottom of a dish and I'm just using a 9 by 13 pan you just want to make sure that the noodles don't come up over the sides and then you'll take some hot water just as hot as you can get it right out of the tap and we're going to pour this over our pasta you want to add in enough to cover all of the sheets of pasta looks like I need just a little bit more it took me about eight cups of water to cover my pasta completely now all I have to do is let this sit and soak for about thirty minutes after 30 minutes my pasta will be softened enough to layer in a lasagna dish no boiling required it'll finish cooking in the oven it's a perfect tack to save some time when it comes to making homemade lasagna well the noodles are soaking and the pasta is simmering we'll go ahead and put together our ricotta mixture start with 30 ounces of whole milk ricotta cheese and kind of break that up there you'll add in an egg 1/2 teaspoon of salt a pinch or an eighth of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then about 2 tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley then you just mix this all together all right now we'll keep this mixture in the fridge until our sauce is done simmering once the sauce is done we're ready to layer our lasagna in addition to what we've already made you'll also need some sliced mozzarella cheese and some freshly grated Parmesan cheese and make sure you use freshly grated because the stuff in the little can just doesn't melt nearly as well and isn't even always real cheese we're gonna start layering our lasagna by spreading about a cup of meat sauce into the bottom of a 9 by 13 pan and I'm using an extra deep 9 by 13 pan you just want enough to cover the bottom so that the noodles get some love down there don't get stuck then we're gonna start layering in our pasta I like to do it just a little bit off you overlap them just a tad and put four noodles four sheets as our base layer then we're going to spread on about a third of our ricotta mixture then layer on slices of mozzarella cheese and I got this cut in the deli section of my grocery store then you'll cover this with another layer of the meat sauce I use about a cup to a cup and a half not just enough to cover that cheese and then I'm going to finish the first layer by sprinkling on about a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese then we're going to repeat this process with more sheets of pasta and we'll keep on layering it and then we're gonna bake this in a 375-degree oven for about 15 minutes remove the aluminum foil halfway through the baking time to allow the cheese on top a chance to brown and then you're ready to eat now I know a lot of you will ask if you can make this ahead and the answer is absolutely you can compile everything and layer everything together in your pan and then just pop it in the fridge until you're ready to serve although I would recommend using and baking it within about 48 hours if you're gonna freeze it you'll want to add a ton of time to the cooking time in order to get it thawed in the center and cooked completely through [Music] thanks for watching you can find the full written recipe in the video

are welcome to part one of the CBS mathematics review is also mental going up a question is one through ten and for the CBS review document I'll push is one to fifteen deal with measurement statistics and estimation okay alright so let's take a look at question number one so it's during a semester a student receives scores of 76 80 83 seven one eighty and seventy eight on six test what is the average what is the student outrage score for the six test so the follow-up or average is basically the sum of the elements of the set sum of elements are divided by the total number of elements in the set okay divided by number of elements now the elements in this case are the test scores okay and then we have six elements so what we're going to do is we're going to compute the sum of all the six scores which are the elements 76 plus 80 plus 83 plus 71 plus 80 plus 78 and then we're going to divide the sum by the number of scores or the number of elements in the sets so since there are six test we're going to be dividing by six okay so this is basically how you you compute some averages all right so let's go ahead and compute a song first I'm going to do that in pairs this is a 76 plus a our first 76 plus 80 is 156 and then let's do the next pair 83 plus 71 and then if you sum that up to get 154 and then 80 plus 78 the last two is 158 now I can easily add these three together it's not too difficult 156 plus 150 4 plus 158 all right so 6 is 4 is 10 plus 8 18 have 8 carry 1 5 times 3 is 15 plus 1 is 16 six carry one four ones add up to four okay so this whole expression is going to be 468 divided by six okay in different ways you can divide this let's just use a long division so that no one gets confused 468 the top goes under the division symbol R divided by six six goes into forty six or seven times because 7 times 6 is 42 I'll subtract on that we have 48 bring down the 8 of course 6 goes into 48 8 times 8 times 6 is 48 so our answer the average of the six chords is clearly 78 to the option C is our correct answer all right let's move on to question number two it says use the table below to answer the following questions on the three sections of a math test the student correctly answered the number of questions shown in a table above what percent of the questions on the entire test did student answer correctly okay so to get the percentage is just a percentage is just another expression a fraction okay so if you can get a fractional expression that will convert a fraction into that's more than two percent okay so um to get the percent correct percent correct all you just simply do in fractional form first is um you're going to divide the number answered correctly or the number correct divided by the total number okay total number of questions number of questions okay number of questions all right so we're just going to compute the sum first thing that we're going to carry out the division part alright so how many questions are answered correctly so let's find out that by that out so number answered correctly that's going to be on the sum of this column right here 17 plus 11 is it two at a time that's 28 and they add 20 to that and your son is going to be 48 so 48 to our asset correctly and then um the number of questions in all slows down a little bit so a number of questions number of questions um compute another some number questions is going to be C the sum of this column right here that's a lot of questions which is 20 plus 15 add that up that's 35 and then you add 25 to that and then you get 60 as your total number of questions okay so percent correct first of all as a fraction we're going to have a percent correct as a fraction it's going to be a total number answer correctly which is 48 scratch that out divided by total number of questions to the number of questions is 60 okay so if want to convert this a percentage this fraction to a percent we have to multiply it by 100 okay so that changes it into into percent okay so number answered correctly / - the noble question this tells you the fractional expression for the numbers of questions that were asked it correctly and if I multiply by 100 that converts your fraction into a percent okay so let's go ahead and simplify this so zero is counsel out our 2 goes into 6 three times allow let's just divide 6 into 48 so don't waste time on 6 goes here one six goes into 48 eight times and then 8 times 10 is 80 so 80 percent of the questions were answered correctly all right all right so let's take a look at number three says use the diagram below - and to the question that follows so we have a ruler here and then a little bridge so says in the actual enthalpy is 4200 feet then what is the skill of the diagram of the bridge all right so only thing in the series you have to be really really careful in dealing with units and also measurements okay because if you make the slightest assumption you might you might get the question wrong so you have to be really careful so some people might just look at this question as okay this is six right here so I'm just going to divide 6 by 4200 and get 700 and that's a trap that's a wrong answer you have to be really careful when you're reading units never make any assumptions okay so we look at this our ruler and the bridge you notice that the bridge starts from this projectile bridge the length of the bridge onto this ruler this is a starting part of the bridge and it starts at 1 and then where does it stand it goes as far as see this point right here to 6 so it goes from 1 to 6 so how many how long is that is 1 2 3 4 5 5 units okay so 5 units is equal to 4200 feet so we have to be really careful about 6 units so 5 units is equal to the length of the bridge which is 4200 then what is 1 unit is going to be well to get one unit from five I have to divide 5 by 5 right so divide this by 5 and to preserve a quality we divide that by 5 also okay so if you divide that out you have one unit equals now let's divide for a to 100 by five and use long division and just do that the top goes into the division symbol pile on here five doesn't go into four five goes in 42 8 times 8 times 5 is 40 subtract to bring down a 0 5 goes into 20 four times and in the lastly we just move it up 840 so one unit is 840 feet okay so when you're taking your series please pay close attention to the measurements okay you don't don't make any assumptions whatsoever and also the skills and the units all right all right so they have let's move on to the next question all right so says I which of the following is most appropriate for expressing the weight of a pencil so if we examine what we have here which of these units are used for measuring weights and all of them are used for measuring weight thought if we're looking at a solid object which one is not applicable pounds might sound fair pounds and ounces look good comes down to the good parts points times now this is really really heavy so that's not good find smaller less liquid quartz is liquid to now our pounds and ounces if we thinking about just one pencil okay one cancel do you think that which of these measurements is the best representation for one pencil sounds a little bit too big you know we have information like a box of pencils you know should be a large box of pencils opening these pounds but if we're just looking at one pencil we have to scale it down a little bit so ounces is basically the best choice aisle four for this option we have here okay all right so let's take a look at that question five it says a musketeer is needs to order a rope for a gym class 32 students each student will receive a piece of rope that is 5 feet 8 inches long what is the total length of rope music eteri needs to order for her class so what we're doing is basically multiplying a rope that's 5 feet and 8 inches long by a 32 okay so are we have 5 feet 8 inches x 32 now this is one mistake most people make most people just multiply 5 by 32 and get let's see what do you get 100 and not see 160 and I'll say is 160 feet and 8 inches you see the problem with that it's not just the feet that's being multiplied by 32 years ignore the inches so when you're doing a multiplying you have to make sure that this 32 is distributed to both measures the five feet and the 32 inches okay so please be careful when not doing conversion calculations so we have five times 32 and then we're going to add that to 8 times 32 okay so that's how I'm going to do it so let's do our multiplication 32 times 5 times 2 10 zero part 1 5 3 15 plus 1 6 16 so 160 feet and then for the inches we have 32 times 8 8 times 2 6 2 & 6 carry 1 8 times 3 is 24 plus 1 now that's going to be 25 so as 160 feet 256 inches all right okay let's look at a question that doesn't match anything you have there so what's the problem well 256 inches can be converted to feet and inches so how many people can we get out of this 56 inches remember you have 12 inches in one foot so I'll just have to do is we're going to divide 256 by 12 256 divided by 12 to take out the feet the foot out of the inches and then whatever the remainder is we're going to express that as the inches okay all right so 12 goes into 25 2 times because 2 times 12 is 24 subtract that one 6 12 goes into 16 once 1012 is 12 you try that and you left with 4 okay all right so um let's see this tells you that you're 21 inches and 4 feet and 256 inches okay so this is feet and this what do you have left is inches so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add the 21 so this Plus this is the same thing as 160 feet plus twenty-one feet four inches all right if I add the feet together I'll have 181 feet and four inches all right so don't forget to distribute your way x into the two units of measure so our final answer is option D all right let's move on to number six okay number six it says use a diagram a little to answer the question that falls what is the total length of the Clear Lake oh Claire links shoreline so you have to be really careful here to pay close attention to the question because it's shaded some people might want to start computing the area real quickly but it's asking us for the length of the lake so how long is it is it oh the Claire likes shoreline so the length of the shoreline okay so um bays and how the question looks like you might be tempted to start looking for the area because it's shaded but you have to be really careful to ask for the length of the shoreline okay so let's go ahead and find the length of the shoreline so we're just going to count the number units of the boundary that encloses the lake all right so let's start from here bottom right corner we have one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 okay so I just basically went around there like all the way around alright so after counting you might be in a haste to conclude that your answer is 22 miles and that will be the wrong answer okay so you have to be really careful when you deal with are the measurement section of the scene is that it can be really tricky sometimes okay if you notice you have five boxes here one two three four five being equivalent to ten miles so the five boxes equals ten miles what does that tell you that each box is so divided by five divided by five each box represents the sine length of each box presents a 1-mile I'm sorry represent two miles okay so that represents two miles so every one box is a least two miles okay all right so we counted 22 lines all around so the length of the car link is going to be 22 times the adjustment factor which is 222 times 2 which equals 44 miles all right so you might know how to do the question and you pretty good at math but just not ignoring the details can cause you to fall into a trap okay so you can consider the answer is option B all right let's take a look at question 7 so use the diagram below to answer the question that follows our last table top is supported by a rectangular a pedestal to the tabletop is 8 inches wider than the petals tool on each side what is the perimeter of the glass tabletop so we're looking for this parameter right here around the glass tabletop okay so it goes eight inches longer in all directions in all directions is 18 inches longer okay all right so um what we're going to do is write on the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and then see what we can do here so the perimeter rectangle is basically two lengths plus to it all right so in this case what is the length cut dawg ah of the glass top the length of the glass top is the length of the pedestal which is 48 plus 1 plus the 8 units that's been uh added on both sides ok so what am I doing here let's say we want to call this this right here the link from here all the way to here okay unless you want to call that the length of the of the table top this is tell what is this what is this made up of is made up of the 48 from here to here is 48 right that's 48 but that's not all you need that 8 upstairs and a downstairs so 48 plus um the 8 on both and 16 okay so the length of my panel so I'm sorry my last tabletop is going to be 52 inches all right how about the width how wide is it well the width of my glass tabletop spans from the left to the right okay I know that it's going to be made up of multiple constituents um you have 36 on the center which is the length of the pedestal but you also have eight units here and another 18 it's there okay so the entire length of the the Android width this right here is a width okay we have L is already given by 52 so we need the width the width is going to be 36 the length of the Pettitte the width of the pedestal fuzzy 8 on both sides plus 16 also okay so that gives you 64 now to find the parameter now let's go back to our original formula we we were using provide a formula since we now have the length and the width of the glass tabletop is simply d double the length which is the left on the right sides this length Plus this length is 2w + u double the width which is the top and the bottom top and bottom um although something's wrong here oh let's see all right I interchange my results let me switch it around real quick so CG 48 plus 16 is 64 and then 36 plus 16 is 52 okay excellent all right so I'll just double the length and then double the width and then that will basically give us what the parameter is okay so you multiply this by 2 our this is superb because we can switch the order around it multiply this by 2 you get 104 that's W the width and if you double the length which is the left on the right side 2 times 64 that's 128 and then we add it together 104 plus 128 you get two hundred and thirty-two inches as your final answer okay so answer for question seven is e all right sorry about the mix-up there let's go on to question number eight all right says but our abuse is one box for every five days to feed his cats approximately how many boxes of cat food does he use from what all right so on this one is good to set up a lung cancer per hour proportion um but you want to be consistent with your units okay so let's say that you want to set it up as follows you have you want to call the numerator boxes okay and then you want to call it and denominator you know called the denominator things all right so you have one box for five days okay at the first fraction and then next it says approximately how many boxes so let's call that X so X is the number of boxes that we do not know / wait a minute per month per month how many days are there in a month between 30 and 31 right so we can put one month here because the unit has already been said today so we must convert one month in today's so one month is around the same 30 you know so let's just earn it alright so we have this ratio set up these are the bottom our boxes on the top now to get X by itself what do you do simply multiply both sides by 30 this is up proportionately half set up right here multiply both sides like 32 thirties council out and then you have um 30 over 5 equals x and if you divide 30 by 5 what do you get 30 over 5 is 6 okay so it's roughly 6 days I mean yeah six hour boxes so answer is option letter d okay let's move on to the next question question 9 all right so it says time can develop two rolls of film in about 18 minutes at work at this rate how long will it take her to do of egg rolls of film so this is similar to the kind of question we did before want to set up a proportion let's see number of rolls for the numerator and then time time in minutes you have to be careful the unit's okay as a denominator okay so have two rolls per 18 minutes okay and then last this is how long will it take you to develop eight rules or eight rolls in X minutes because I don't know what it is alright alright so to solve this sound we can cross multiply if we cross multiply to solve this expression well there two ways you can do this you can do this by inspection you notice that I multiply the numerator by 4 to get from 2 to 8 so you can do the same at the bottom multiply this by 4 which is 17 2 minutes which comes out to an hour and 12 minutes or I can do a lot of really okay suppose we deliberately assuming that we're not we don't want to use a shortcut so to do it algebraically I'll press multiply I have 2x equals 80 plus 64 144 and then I divide both sides by 2 and then I get x equals 72 minutes all right so let's convert that to hours and minutes because we do not have we have it Express two thousand minutes here and this is not an option so we we know that there's an hour an hour 60 minutes so if we subtract one full hour from that which is 60 minutes we're going to be left with 12 minutes all right so our solution is going to be one hour because we subtracted just one six set of 60 minutes from our solution and we're left with 12 minutes alright so there's going to be one hour and 12 minutes so your answer is option B okay so if you can solve it by inspection go ahead but it's a little bit more complicated like a decimal something like that and candid mentally is use the algebraic processes to help like here on problem solving process easier okay all right so let's take a look at approaching terraces statistics openal probability here says Lilliana has the value models the bag contains 18 black red eleven blue and eight white lily either anima takes a red marble from the bag and leaves the marble on the table so there's no placement here what is the probability that you'll next cigarette or a white marble from the bag so anytime you see or that's on tells you an operation in statistics and the operation for or is in this condition we see nd multiply okay so the question is what is probability of red + or probability of white okay alright so you know that the probability of an event basically is a desired outcomes besides versus the total all right that's a probability formula so I'm going to do this two independently and then we're going to add up our answers okay so probability of red we use the total number red divided by the total number of models that they are so how many words they are are there remember he took one out and there were fifteen before so we're left with 14 okay so what is the total number of marbles total models total marbles how do we do that well just add a number of moles we have okay so we have read this 14 ah why is 14 because she only took one out okay so 14 plus 11 that's 25 and then let's add an 825 Plus 8 that's um that's all these three carry 133 and let's not forget the 18 black marbles plus 18 1-3 151 models and also probability of red is 14 divided by 51 okay because that's a total because we did in fact that one has a really cool model hasn't taken out or how about probability of Y how many whites are there there are eight white marbles and how many total 51 okay so probability of probability of red or white here a red or a P of W this means that we sum this individual probabilities to is 14 over 51 plus 8 over 51 okay and then your final answer is going to be 22 over 51 answer is option letter B okay so there

day", "v9lCZsQdJ3o": "[Music] what's up guys Dayton you raised always give this book back to another video today in this video we're probably getting to the last and final application for our liquid section in the backyard without further ado well let's get into the video all right guys before we dive into this video I wanted to mention I am inside it is getting cold you know I want to be outside it's dark I got a full lighting setup going on here follow me on instagram if you want more updates on the lighting I'll include a clip right after this so you guys can check out the lighting but before we get into it I wanted to mention we've got plenty more videos coming this season do not think content is winding down I've got plenty more things coming trust me I'm not gonna give up on you guys winter content is fun content because it prepares us for the spring gets us ready for the spring and builds up momentum for the spring so without further ado we went ahead did the last application of liquid fertilizer to our liquid section that included 1801 green punch and RGS as you all know we are following Green County fertilizers the liquid fertility program for that back section I decided I wanted to do that because I wanted to show you if you guys have Green County fertilizers products you follow they're liquid regiments you're gonna do just fine we followed their 12 ounces per thousand square feet of green pop we followed there are three ounces per thousand of RGS and I'm going in there 12 ounces of per thousand of the 901 Green start and then 3 ounces per thousand of RGS for those of you guys who aren't new here I will leave some links in the description down below to the next products if you want to pick something up and for those of you guys who don't know what the next products are its liquid fertility so what that means is its liquid fertilizer basically you put it in an ortho dial and spray and you spray it on your lawn good stuff good products I've been using them for almost a year now some good stuff good quality back to that we went ahead and applied the 1801 green punch at 15 ounces per to close out the season on that section at 15 ounces per thousand that delivers point two to lbn and that's our nitrogen per thousand square feet we're getting out of that it's a low rate it's less than a quarter pound a quarter pound would be 0.25 some it's a perfect amount we also applied our GS root growth stimulant three ounces per thousand stimulate those roots wanted to give you guys an update I am NOT going to dive into green cast we'll do that maybe one or two more times for the end of the season but I wanted to give you an update on how the soil temperatures are holding currently I have not checked the soil temperatures when I'm holding this I will put the soil temperature current soil temperature on the screen here as well as what it should be for right now the weather we're peaking in the highs at about low 40s to high 50s anywhere between there and nights and we're getting to three Frost's a week so some mornings I do wake up and it is quite cold outside so there's really nothing I can do about that it's just cold windy it's getting one down I'm trimming up bushes getting ready for Christmas lights you know it's almost that time a season we'll be doing a video on that soon anyway back to the application [Music] it's cold today we applied 15 ounces per thousand square feet point two two as I already talked about on that section to deliver us more nitrogen to close out the season and to recap why you want to get the nitrogen down this time of year like that is because you want your nitrogen to be in the soil to bring out that early spring push so that you can bring out your lawn and it comes out early and maybe you don't have to fertilize as hard coming into the spring you know maybe you can back off to three weeks and you don't have to fertilize as hard you could come in slow yourself in push maybe biostimulants root growth you make all that kind of stuff we'll be talking about that in the spring as well as maybe some supplemental content this winter weed pushing all that that way we can get it going and it'll come out of that spring pop just like that super easy right guys I knew there was one more thing I wanted to recap and that was exact dates when all this was done so our seeding date here I'll show you I'm looking at the calendar of my phone was Sunday September 22nd so September 22nd to the 22nd of October was four weeks and then 22nd of October which was a Tuesday the 29th was five weeks and then six weeks was last week so this is week seven after seeding I'm probably could have gone earlier with the seeding I don't know why I didn't that's okay though I see did when I did by the way got a new phone investments into the business anyway i seeded when I did it was it wasn't terribly hot it had nice temperatures we were mid 70s then temperatures have really slowed down now we were watering then irrigation has been completely put away we've gotten frost we got a hard Frost's like last week we were down in like the mid 20s but anyway I put all that away we did knock in a snow that's really it we didn't get any snow put the water away it's just kind of rest in there it looks really good if you ask me I mean if you guys haven't seen a few clips they'll be in here somewhere if you have any questions about the applications we made on this one please leave them in the box down below but with that I made inform Azle on landscaping thank you for watching I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you on the next one pace [Music] you", "9IWsV-8jSmI": "all right guys today i'm going to bake some pizzas from dough made with a pre-ferment first i'm going to walk you through the steps on how i make this particular type of dough i'll fire up my unicode 16 i'll bake off those pizzas and we'll taste the results so there are two basic methods when mixing dough first the straight dough approach which is the simplest of the two essentially you dissolve your yeast in water mix everything together in one shot and let the final dough bulk ferment for a period of time the second method is using that pre-ferment now this is where you mix a portion of the flour water and yeast in a recipe ahead of time and this is going to allow the yeast to fully activate and ferment before you add the remainder of your ingredients some bakers believe that this method gives you better texture more rise in your dough and an improved flavor but i definitely encourage you to try both approaches and make your own decision on what you prefer now there are four types of pre-ferments made with commercial yeast but today we're going to focus on abiga which is the italian version of a proof ferment and it's going to make up half of the total weight of our final dough all right enough of my gavin let's get down to business all right to make this biga grab yourself a large mixing bowl and add 228 grams of warm water consequently that's one cup now for the yeast i'm using dry active yeast here you really don't need that much you actually only need about an eighth of a teaspoon and you're thinking that is not enough for dough but trust me it's gonna work now just give this yeast a second to dissolve then you're gonna add 352 grams of double zero flour that i start mixing with a fork just until the dough kind of gets shaggy and then i move on to my hands now you don't have to knead this dough all we're doing is combining it so just press it around kind of scrape the dough that's sticking to the sides of the bowl down and just press everything together just until the ingredients become kind of homogenous all right there you go this is what your beak is supposed to look like okay so cover the bowl up and let your biggest sit at room temp for about 12 hours okay so i do this at night right before i go to sleep i mix my biega only takes two seconds cover it let it sit out and the next morning it's ready to go check it out this is a bigger that's ready to go it's super dimply it looks like it wants to collapse the yeast is fully fermented this looks beautiful all right for this final dough i have 340 grams of double zero flour 222 grams of warm water and 18 grams of sea salt got my bigger here in this large bowl and i'm just gonna add everything directly into the bowl with the big up so here's my water okay i'm gonna go with salt next just kind of give it a little stir help dissolve that a little bit and then in with the flour and i'm just going to work diligently to mix this dough and make sure that the bigga is evenly incorporated throughout the entire dough so use the pinch method done this in some some other videos of mine and just press everything together move the dough around try to scrape anything that's sticking to the sides of the bowl and incorporate it into the dough this is going to take some time five minutes or so to make sure that the dough is completely homogeneous all right yeah this looks fantastic this looks perfect this dough is totally homogenous yeah i feel good about this so i'm going to slap a lid back on the bowl we're gonna let the dough rest for about 20 minutes to let the flour hydrate completely and then we'll take the dough out of the bowl and knead it so flour this board and then take the dough out of the out of the bowl just like that all right add a little flour at the top of the dough and then you're just gonna start kneading it and folding it like this it might feel a little wet but the more you work the dough the more the gluten structure begins to develop and the dough will start to get smooth and easier to handle and if you need to add a little bit more flour you can do that no problem you don't want to go overboard though then you're just going to change the hydration percentage of the dough too much so do this for i don't know a couple minutes until the dough starts to get smooth and you know it's ready to go this looks pretty good see how smooth that is so i'm just going to form it into a ball just by tucking the dough underneath of itself tighten up the dough a little bit here and then i'm going to go in and add the dough to a lightly greased bowl use olive oil to grease it yeah sticking to my fingers now okay here we go in the bowl going to cover it up nice and tight i'm going to let this dough rest at room temperature for about two hours until it's doubled in size then we'll portion it off and put it into smaller containers and we'll go from there so two hours room temp all right i've got one two three four containers they are they're lightly oiled and ready to go our dough has doubled in size it's been resting for about two two and a half hours you can see it's still nice and smooth and use a dough scraper here and just carefully take it out of the bowl and onto the cutting board there we go so this dough here this is a 65 hydration dough and it's large enough when you break it up into four pieces it's going to give you uh four 290 gram dough balls perfectly sized for like a pizza oven like this like the unicoda okay what am i doing next oh yeah let's go ahead and just flour the surface of the dough a little bit and then i'm just going to make two cuts here to generate four even pieces of dough you can always break out the scale if you want to get super exact okay here we go there we go all right now i'm just going to want to shape these guys into dough balls and you can do that with your hands like this just by tucking the dough underneath of itself sort of rotating the dough ball on your hand all right eventually it'll get nice and tight you can also uh run it around in a circular motion on the cutting board like so and just get a little dough ball like that then go in the containers notice how i'm not using the refrigerator at all here none of this dough is is being or i'm not cold fermenting any of it it's all at room temp what's really cool about that is it brings out different flavors in the dough as opposed to cold fermentation so cold fermentation you get some good bacteria that create acids that give you that sort of sour flavor with room temp fermentation you're going to get sort of more earthy flavors like weedy flavors it's a high there's a there's more of a yeast fermentation going on as opposed to a yeast and a bacteria fermentation going on in cold fermentation so flavors will be a little different with this dough i'm going to let it sit at room temp for maybe a couple of hours and my timeline for all of this is again i make my biga at night let's say around 11 o'clock or so i wake up the next morning i let the vega go for a little bit longer end up making dough around uh 11 maybe 12 o'clock the dough rests for two two and a half hours so you're looking at maybe two to three o'clock then i separate the dough into uh dough balls like this i'll let those rest for two to three hours and then i'm ready to eat dinner at five or six o'clock so it works out really well if you can follow that timeline uh you'll have dough ready for dinner and uh be awesome all right guys i've got the unicoda 16 fired up and ready to go i let it preheat for about 20 minutes then i check the stone temp with this infrared thermometer it's basically a point-and-shoot kind of thing once it hits 825 degrees fahrenheit or about 440 degrees celsius we're ready to rock and roll all right i've got a little flower on my work surface here and i'm gonna put one of my dough down i'm gonna be kinda there we go they kind of just plop right out there next a little bit of dough on top just so it's not so sticky now everybody's got their own way to stretch dough this is mine okay first i start with a crust and i form that flip it over push from the center out to form that crust and the dough seems kind of sticky what you're going to do is just add a little bit more flour just a little bit just so it doesn't stick so much next i'm going to stretch it with my knuckles a little bit but i'm going to let gravity do most of the work stretch and let gravity pull the dough down and that's pretty much it the dough is stretched very quickly this dough is pretty soft so okay now i'm going to build my pizza we're going to start off with a margarita first that's kind of my control pizza if i can make a good margarita then i know the rest of the night's going to be really good so i'm going to add some san marzano tomato sauce this is just raw crushed san marzano tomatoes there next a little bit of fresh mozzarella i'm going to go probably about three ounces but whatever works for you is good you be you now we're going to do some basil guys if you want to put basil on after the pizza comes out of the oven go for it i just prefer to do it this way again ubu do what you want to do whatever sounds good to you you're the one eating the pizza not me there that's good perfect nice to have basil in the garden you just grab it whenever you need to now i'm going to grab a bit of freshly grated parmigiano and just finish the pizza off with that okay there's my version of a margarita make sure the peel has a little bit of flour on it not too much just a little bit and then you're going to slowly pull the pizza up onto the peel and then kind of correct its shape so it's circular again boom good to go we're going to go in the oven stone temp is 8.25 i launch the pizza at full heat and then i turn it down or else you're just gonna scorch the crap out of your crust there and check it yeah give it a little bit of a turn and then back in the oven she goes you gotta watch really closely here and monitor the pizza it cooks very quickly and again you have to kind of mess with the heat of the oven i haven't found the perfect temp through the entire cook you always got to adjust it but more check the bottom looking pretty good all right this should be the last turn checking the bottom still looks good yeah just a little bit longer all right i'm pulling it what do you guys think about that a little burn here and there just these these air pockets these air bubbles but i'm cool with that man i like a little charm i crust here we go finish this thing off with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil and then we'll cut into it yeah that looks great let's take a look it was pretty nice huh but underneath pretty solid there you go beautiful here we go margarita all right let's fire another one i'll taste both of them together i'm gonna cook a different pizza now this is some heavy cream that i've reduced by half just heated up and reduced by half and seasoned it i don't need much here just a little bit if you reduce the cream too much when you when you when you bring it down on the stove it'll break in the in the oven when you bake the pizza so you only need to go down by half or so beautiful now we're going to add just some sauteed onions a little bit of caramelization here is going to give them some more sweetness nice little um kind of juxta position on flavors with uh the rest of the ingredients because everything else is really savory i'm gonna go in with some aged provolone this is a nice sharp flavor to it you'll see a lot in like new york style pizza cheese blends perfect and then a little bit of aged parmigiano well all parmesan's aged the undisputed king of cheese right here now we're going to add some some sliced cremini mushrooms perfect a little bit of fresh rosemary from the garden so do a little bit of a chop on it just to break it down and then we'll finish with some some garlic infused oil just a little bit here it's a fresh garlic it'll be really nice to finish this off too is a little bit of cracked black pepper but i don't have my mill out here so we're just going to skip that all right in the oven she goes [Music] and i'm going to turn this heat down so i don't burn the crust there all right guys there's that one looks pretty good it's a simpler looking pie it doesn't look like there's much on it but uh trust me it's really delicious all right yeah oh my god this looks fantastic i like this over the margarita oh man look at that crema holy crap yeah man all right what do you guys think of that crust all right i got a little dark underneath not burnt though just a little darker than normal still looks fantastic all right it's time to start taste testing let's uh let's start with the margarita shall we whoa great acidity from the tomatoes creaminess from the fresh mozzarella and then some fresh flavor from that basil the dough is fantastic it's soft it's tender it's got loads of flavor perfect here we go mushroom pizza damn that is super super good i love how creamy it is this this reduced cream fantastic nice earthiness from the mushrooms you get a sort of a savory nice savory herbaceous flavor from the rosemary and a sharpness from that provolone and grana padano or parmesan in this case dough again nice and tender it's got kind of a weedy nutty flavor to it almost it's delicious so good all right guys you've seen what i've done here today if you have any questions hit me in the comment section i'm happy to respond subscribe if you haven't already give me a thumbs up and i'll catch you next time", "p8hsHgF91gQ": "hey everybody what is up welcome to another cook with me you guys we got something really awesome and delicious for you guys tonight i think it's delicious we've never had it before it looks delicious sounds delicious which is why we're trying it out it is the chicken alfredo garlic bacon chicken roll-up wow actually the chicken bacon garlic alfredo roll-ups wow and if you need help just read the title yeah i was like i was gonna see if i could go off memory but i don't have a good memory so anyways i'm gonna go over everything that you guys need for this recipe a lot of this stuff i feel like you'll have in your fridge already so you're going to need uh monterey jack cheese parmesan cheese butter cream cheese heavy whipping cream garlic i'm using the stir in paste garlic because that's what we have you can use regular garlic uh lasagna noodles boom uh chicken i'm gonna use a rotisserie chicken salt pepper italian seasoning garlic powder and you guys we will make sure to put and we will make sure to put the ingredients the recipe in the description box below yes and as we go you guys i will tell you the measurements so that way you can just like get a pen and paper and write down the measurements too if you want so anyways i say let's jump right into this it is dinner time and the kids are [Music] hungry [Music] [Applause] so we're gonna get started on alfredo sauce you guys i am boiling water actually right here for the noodle the lasagna noodles so you might want to do that before or during whatever um but we are going to work on the alfredo sauce which basically what you're going to need is your butter so it's a half a cup of butter and we use the salted butter yes which is a full stick here so maybe not the healthiest recipe but you guys know it's gonna be good so half cup butter and then it says four ounces of cream cheese this cream cheese is eight ounces so we're just going to cut this in half and then plop it in yum so here we go four ounces of cream cheese going in bam plop a dot plop and drop pop and drop then you guys are gonna need one pint of heavy cream you guys know this is gonna be good it's got all the good stuff all the good stuff so you're gonna pour this in and then basically you're just going to melt it all together so is this kind of like making like an alfredo sauce this is the alfredo sauce so this is actually what i use for my alfredo sauce this is almost exactly what i do they copied you you copied me man me man me man e-man they copied me man you know what's funny is speaking of he-man i told ethan i said look up he-man and because i said you're totally he-man and he's all he looked up a picture of him because he didn't you guys know who he-man is you know okay he looked up a picture and he was like he almost has as big of muscles as i do i was laughing so hard he man shira remember shira yes yeah so by the power of grayskull okay i don't remember that part amen is that how it goes yeah so melting this all together you guys check this out oh wow so once this is all melted we start adding the seasoning to it and this is lip like i said this is pretty dang close to what i do the measurements are different like this one has way more cream cheese and butter than i normally use but this looks good what's the seasoning the seasoning is the italian seasoning which i don't normally put in mine um garlic powder pepper salt and then of course you have the parmesan cheese wow we've got this all melted down now so now we're gonna add the seasoning it's basically like a teaspoon of each thing so we're just going to kind of sprinkle this in boom italian seasoning garlic powder teaspoon of each i'm just kind of eyeing it and then you're going to do like a sprinkle of pepper and just a pinch of salt and remember tina loves salt she loves to even salt salt oh my gosh i try to be better now haven't been so bad wow look at that look you just mix that all together and then you guys if that's not creamy enough now you're gonna take your cheese parmesan cheese you could do grated it as well if you want but this is what i always use for alfredo this is the kicker right here um you're gonna do a cup of this so let's just pour pour that in baby and then extra i'm getting so excited oh my gosh okay so okay so okay so literally now this is all gonna just like melt down and be like nice and creamy and delish look at that guys yum all right so we just put the garlic in i just put like just a little squeeze of garlic paste in there you guys um it doesn't go over well with me too much danny is not yeah every time he has garlic it's an issue so i just put some in there and that should look at this guys check this out look how creamy that looks so good so delicious all right so we have the sauce here you guys look at that basically going to put a little bit of sauce in the bottom of your pan your baking pan oh is it almost like a casserole no okay but i mean i guess so you're going to just kind of spread that at the bottom then i'm going gonna show you the best part of this entire recipe okay so we got this just so we're gonna just set that aside for a minute and i'm gonna recall the best part of this recipe is eating it we'll see maybe it's gross who knows no so we've got our lasagna noodles we're gonna put those down first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna take the sauce and you are going to spread it on the lasagna noodles just like this okay just like this oh this sauce oh it smells so good okay then you're gonna take your chicken and you're just gonna kind of spread the chicken on there get your shredded chicken doesn't have to be rotisserie if you guys want to cook up some chicken or if you have chicken cooked up that works too and then after this you're going to do the bacon which we made our bacon extra crispy you guys because that's just literally the way to do it so let's break this up i just broke it up into little pieces and then we're going to roll this bad boy up roll it up up up roll it up up roll it up that's probably pretty filling yeah i bet one is probably enough yeah i mean you got chicken look at that wow see and then we're gonna put it right here bam and then we're gonna repeat that process this recipe it says it makes eight so you could double it or you know however you want to do it but we made enough just for the recipe so eight um so i'm gonna go through and just do the rest of these and put them in the pan and then i'll show you what's next all right you guys hello i totally forgot to put the cheese on the other one so after the bacon you gotta add the cheese you cannot forget the cheese tina what is wrong with you so you're just gonna sprinkle the mutts all over just like that and then roll it up i'm gonna unroll the other one and put some cheese on it but here we go [Music] wow that's literally like a little mini burrito it really is that's a pasta burrito that is a pasta bun oh look at that oh my gosh [Music] okay so it was totally enough for eight so here you go here's eight of them so now you're gonna basically take the rest of your sauce and pour it over the top and just kind of spread it around get it all up in there boom boom boom it's literally like a alfredo sauce enchilada i know chicken enchilada italian style yeah that's exactly it so i'm gonna just totally douse this and then we're gonna top it with cheese you guys okay now you just top it off with that mozzarella cheese or monterey jack sorry not mozzarella madre jack and then you are gonna put this in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes there you go that's easy peasy easy peasy you guys so we're gonna throw this in and then we'll take it out and try it see how it tastes wow guys check that out it's still boiling but that

[Music] so our head initially finished making the water pieces and I was really happy with how they turned out the problem that I have is I plan on giving these files away to my patrons and though I don't need them to interlock other people might so we went back to the drawing board and redid all of these water pieces and came up with something a little bit different I now have a pattern that is continuous across the entire thing so when you do lay it down it looks like one big water picture rather than the same image to trade six different times [Music] so I got all the glossy coats applied to all the tan tiles what I'm doing now is putting them all on magnet sheets because the plan is to put this on a magnet board so we can have it as an art piece on the wall the first one of these tiles that I did I put a tape barrier in the center mainly because I did not know if the surface tension technique of flooding these would work I was pretty confident that would stay on the sides I wasn't sure entirely how this is going to work but it seemed to work a lot easier to just flood them entirely rather than to do this because now what I have to do is go back and sand this and then just do a clear coat of resin on top of it to try to salvage this piece and not need to remake it entirely [Music] now let's try to fix this guy we're gonna be mounting the coton tiles to an actual board because we're going to hang it on the wall long term what I need to do right now is trace around the water to get the shape of the board we need and cut down this board so I can start gluing the metal sheet as well as the water pieces down [Music] so on the sheet I have marked off the entire grid itself but I also made these lines here to be where I'm going to be cutting the metal sheet so when we attach this to the board I'm only gonna have this inner hex that's going to get glued down so this is gonna be the magnet for all D pieces [Music] [Music] so I got all of these little magnets that I put inside of all of the pieces they are adhesive-backed magnets and I put a bead of superglue around them because all the pieces have little metal circles attached to them so this way one is hanging up on the wall it's not gonna fall out so let's assemble this and then I guess be done with it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "ks8jBaJXmMA": "thank you for joining me for less than 27 session three solving problems using data on a line plot our learning target for this lesson is I can display a data set of measurements in factions of a unit using a line plot to start use fraction title tiles to find the value of each expression so pause the video and find your solution and then press play again and we'll do it together hey so using fraction tiles I'm actually going to draw them on the screen here so we have two times one and one fourth so we have two of one and one fourths so we're going to draw these tiles here here's the 1 and 1/4 and we have 2 of them so there's another one we'll make another 1/4 and if I count how much that is I have 2 and 2/4 which is the same as 2 and 1/2 Hey so if I erase this part here then we can look at the second part because it starts with 2 and 1/2 and we're subtracting 1 and 3/4 well I can actually let's do this I get my readout so we're gonna subtract 1 and 3/4 so let's get rid of this one right here and then we're going to get rid of 3/4 so there's 1/4 we'll get rid of 2/4 and now this will have to cut up into fourths so we can get rid of this one as well so what we have left is 1 2 3 fourths so this is how we can solve those problems using fraction tiles hey try it is at the top of page 563 of your workbook please follow along the line plot shows the lengths of songs in minutes on Ron's playlist Ron adds two new songs to his playlist his new playlist is now 34 minutes in length what are two possible lengths for the new songs so what I would like you to do is pause the video and find what the problem is about information that you need to use what you're trying to figure out there make sure you're circling and underlining and use that information to try to solve this problem using whichever strategy you find best and when you press play again we're going to go over it together okay so for picture it we're actually going to be looking at this problem by labeling the tick marks on the line plot to show the lengths of the songs so this I think makes it a lot easier putting all of these tick marks in with their labels okay for model that we can use equations to help understand the problem write an equation to find M the lengths and minutes of Ron's original playlist so M is the unknowns that stands for minutes and if we add all of these together then we will find out the length of his original playlist so we have 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 is what we get when we add the whole numbers together and I'm gonna change this 1/2 to 2/4 so I have equivalent fractions when I'm adding I'm gonna change this 1/2 to 2/4 as well we can't add fractions if must they have the same denominator all right so here's 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 fourths and that is an improper fraction so we're gonna figure out 10 divided by 4 which goes in 2 times with 2 left over that would be 2/4 which would be the same as 1 have so let's get rid of this ten fourths here and we'll add the two and a half ten fourths is the same as two and 1/2 and so his original playlist is 27 and 1/2 minutes long okay write an equation that shows how to find the total number of minutes T that the new songs add to the length of Ron's playlist remember that when he adds the two songs then it's 34 minutes total so if we take 34 minus this minus 27 and 1/2 that will tell us how long the two songs are that he added so if we take 34 minus 27 and 1/2 I have a problem here we need something right here because if we're subtracting the fraction we can't subtract something from nothing so I'm gonna take this 34 and I'm going to take one away from that and make that 33 and the one that I took away I'm going to convert into a fraction which is going to be two halves and so when I subtract I get one half there and then I get six right here so the two songs add six and a half minutes to the playlist so the two new songs could be maybe three and three and a half minutes or they could be two and four and a half minutes those are two options connect it make connections and explain your think number one how many minutes em is Ron's original playlist explain how you know we found that Ron's original playlist is 27 and 1/2 minutes because we added the lengths of the songs to find the total time number two how many minutes T do the new songs add to Ron's playlist and explain the two new songs add six and a half minutes to Ron's playlist we subtract the length of Ron's playlist from 34 to find the total length of the two songs he added 34 minus 27 and 1/2 equals 6 and 1/2 number three what are two possible lengths for the new songs is more than one correct answer possible explained yes there is more than one correct answer possible the song lengths could be three minutes and three and a half minutes or they could be four minutes and two and a half minutes or we could have four and a half minutes and two minutes there are many different options that equals six and a half number four how did the line plot help you solve the problem the line plot gave the length of each of the songs on Ron's original playlist and we need that data to find the length of the two new songs number five how did you use operations with fractions to solve the problem we added the mixed numbers to find the length of the original playlist and we subtracted this total from 34 minutes then we added the two numbers to find a sum of 6 and 1/2 minutes number 6 reflect look back at your strategies which model our strategies do you like best for solving problems using data in a line plot and explain hey number 7 this is at the top of page 566 in your workbook Reynaldo collects 10 shells at the beach and ways each of them he uses the line pot below to display the data what is the difference between the weights of the lightest and heaviest shells Rinaldo collected show your work okay this is where I would like you to pause the video and find your solution and then press play again when you're done so you can check your work so we need to find the difference between the weights of the lightest and the heaviest shells so that's telling us to subtract so the lightest shell is this one right here and the heaviest is this one right here actually I can draw that line a little better let me redo that one right there okay this one does not have a tick mark on it and so we can try to figure out what that actual measurement is right there so I'm noticing that we have nine and then something and then nine and one-fourth and then something and then nine and one-half so let's see here's my nine and there's the ten I think the best thing to do here is to count how many there are between the whole numbers and that's going to tell us what fraction that's divided into so one two three four five six seven eight so it's divided into eighths that means that the first one is going to be nine and 1/8 so the lightest shell is nine and one eight ounces I'm actually I'm gonna write this over here and you'll see why in just a moment nine and one eight ounces okay and the heaviest one is 11 and 3/4 ounces I'm gonna write this above that because we're subtracting the smaller weight from the larger weight so I want to make sure the larger one is on top now we cannot subtract fractions unless they have the same denominator so I'm going to change my 3/4 to eighths and so I'm going to multiply both of those by 2 so 4 times 2 is 8 and 3 times 2 is 6 so 3/4 equals 6 eighths now I can subtract 6 eighths minus 1/8 is 5 eighths and 11 minus 9 is 2 so the difference is 2 and 5/8 ounces okay we are looking at the same line plot here for number 8 but the question is different what is the total weight of the shells Reynaldo collected that weigh less than 10 and a half ounces show your work okay again pause your video and find your solution and then come back to check your work so we're looking for all of the shells that weigh less than 10 and a half so I'm gonna draw a line right here at 10 and a half so we're looking at everything less than 10 and a half so I owe and we remember that this is 9 and 1/8 I remember that and that must mean that this is 1 2 3 4 5 8 9 and 5/8 there and everything else is marked okay so the first one that we have is 9 and 1/8 and then we want total weight that tells us to add the next one is nine and five-eighths okay and then we have two of them on 10 and 1/4 we want to make sure that we list both of those and I'm just going to save myself a little bit of time and I'm going to convert my fourths to eighths so that I don't have to write it twice so let's see 4 times 2 is 8 and 1 times 2 is 2 so 1/4 is two eighths so 10 and two eighths plus another 10 and two eighths we need to make sure both of those X's are represented and then we don't put down any of the others because they're on the other side of our dividing line so adding these together let's add the whole numbers here so 9 + 9 is 18 and then 10 + 10 is 20 so 10 20 30 8 is our whole number and when we add our fraction parts together we have 5 6 7 8 9 10 so 38 + 10 8 10 8 however is an improper fraction so we're going to change that we're going to make it let's see 8 goes into 10 one time with two eighths left over so we have 38 39 and two eighths we can reduce that back down to 1/4 so 39 and one-fourth ounces number nine says what is the total weight of the shells ronaldo collected most often so we don't need to find all of them we just need to find the ones he collected most often so pause find your answer and then come back to check the ones Reynaldo found most often are these right here and I can tell just because there's more X's and this is 11 so this would be 11 and 1/8 okay and we want the total weight of these three so that's 11 + 1 8 times 3 where we can add them together 11 + 1 8 11 and 1/8 and another 11 and 1/8 so 11 and 11 11 is 33 + 1 8 1 8 1 8 is 3/8 so the correct answer here is C 33 and 3/8 alright thank you for working through the lesson with me your assignment is pages 576 and 578 have a wonderful day", "t3S3VVzGshk": "hello everyone this is going to be a series of individual videos on testing of many do-it-yourself alcohol stoves that I built out of small clear lead clear lid containers cost anywhere from a dollar to two dollars each I built a couple stainless steels around seven dollars each this introduction part of the video will be included at the beginning of each stove video burn test so skip ahead a little bit if you have already watched this portion of the video and want to get right to the burn testing each stove and video will be numbered and tested go to video number one if you want a basic description of the many stoves I'll try to put all the specs in the description box of the video when I'm going to test is the warmup time boil time burnout time water temperature and surrounding air temperature I'll also include the alcohol capacity of each stove the size of the stove and the various materials used such as ten aluminum stainless steel there'll be a jet type a wick type using carbon felt right here and that'll be to compare the different designs and materials each test will be done with the same aluminum pot has a five inch diameter bottom I bought it at walmart for a couple bucks well i'll be using tap water it's around 60 degrees plus or minus five degrees two cups of water and there will be a couple tests that i'll use four and six cups of water surrounding air temperature is in my garage it's winter time in Iowa but my garage is around 40 degrees so little cool my water temperature thermometer is about five degrees low so keep that in mind and all the specs that i'm doing here is is not exact it'll be approximately i have some extra materials to build other stoves so if you have any suggestions or want me to try something different please let me know and I'll do it let's would get started with the testing okay do it yourself alcohol stove number nine these are called deco condiment containers they have a clear lid same as all the others you just punch out the plastic lid see if I can get up set a three they're stainless steel so we're going to do a stainless steel alcohol stove these will last forever I bought these on Amazon they were like 758 for three of them I think so they're a little more expensive than the others but they'll last forever you'll have to pay seven shipping to and I think that was seven so I really paid about fourteen dollars but if you have prime amazon prime you can get them for seven dollars pretty cheap it's the only place I've been able to find out these will hold about one here's the stove that I built this particular one has some larger holes there about an eighth inch and they're spaced an inch apart because I had a heck of a time drilling holes it's hard to drill through stainless steel I did find some other bits I'll show you on stove 10 but this was my first attempt and what I used for this was the same as stove 8 for the inside a piece of aluminum pipe eighth inch thick that will fit through the center of this lid here and also the moose can from the dollar store will fit through the center so you get a nice tight seal you might have to manipulate this lip a little bit to get it to fit but you might have to bend it in a little to get it to fit so let's get started with the stainless steel get started with the test also I did on this is cut some slots in the top of this to allow it to breathe please take a little longer to warm up because it's made out of stainless steel this weighs about three and a half ounces because of the thick aluminum okay let's light her up start the time see all on our tastes a warm up no like I said before that stainless steels pretty hard to drill this was my first attempt I used what's called a step bit they don't heat up and break as easily is the other bits that's what I use to drill through this particular one but i did buy some there cobalt bits that will drill through you just got to be patient i'll show you that on stove number 10 but we'll get this stove warmed up get the Jets going and we have two cups of water at about 60 degrees the temperature in the garage here's close to 40 like I said before this is stainless steel so it'll last forever with heavy-duty piece of aluminum down the middle now don't forget to drill some slots on the bottom of the aluminum so the alcohol can run in between the two walls aluminum and stainless steel this could take a little while I'm a little worried that three-quarters of an ounce denatured alcohol will get this water to boil I built these more for boiling more water especially this one with the larger holes and it might burn it up pretty quick like blow on it lightly I might be able to get the Jets going nope they're not even ready so we'll see what happens with this stove the stainless steel is a lot harder to work with I haven't been able to find a piece a real thin stainless steel that would fit through the center of this if somebody could find that I think that would work great then you could have all stainless steel but this thick aluminum will last forever too and this stole that won't rust for up to two minutes already and it still hasn't warmed up head start let's start to jet out right now we'll say at about two minutes 30 seconds barely jetting out of them holds two minutes 30 seconds but we got to get this good and warm before we even attempt to set that pot on top what you can do is kind of hold the pot over the top see the Jets coming now and those slots I put in the top of the aluminum will help it keep burning so we don't waste all that alcohol to get the water to boil we'll put that see if we can put it on yet so at about three minutes we got the pot on it's going to take it a while to get those Jets warmed up though to warm the bottom of that aluminum pot we're still at 60 degrees we'll turn it off let's see them jets are gonna keep going it's hard to see the flames too but we're already up to past four minutes will shut her off for a little bit here and turn it back on okay we're at five minutes I'm going to turn the light off you can barely see the flame I think it's burning a little more well it's hard to see see what that looks like yeah you can now you can see the flames a little better we're about an inch from the Jets till the bottom of that aluminum pot or water temperature 79 degrees at five almost coming to six minutes will shut er down here for a little bit hopefully we can get this to a boil we'll come back at about seven or eight minutes all right word eight minutes water temperatures 97 degrees it's burning pretty slow but it's burning pretty efficient not a very big flame stoke number ten that I'm gonna do next will be the same stainless steel but it'll have smaller holes and a thinner piece of aluminum in the center so we'll see how that compares to this one smaller holes in their spaced half inch apart like all the other stoves will come back and we're about 1060 will come back at ten minutes if it's still gonna sh all right we're at ten minutes temperatures only 120 degrees so this is more of a kind of a simmering type of an alcohol stove again off low flame you can barely see the flame unless I turn the light out we'll see how long if we can get this to a boil again I built these more for larger quantities the water this will hold up 1.5 ounces before it starts coming out the jet holes I'll put all the specs to all of these stoves down in the description so you'll give them more detailed specifications on the size quantity of whole size holes we're at 11 minutes and we're only at 135 degrees so I'm going to turn it off and come back in a little bit alright it's been 13 minutes I want to turn it back on as you can see the flames built up a little bit better it's heating up it's up to 170 water temperature so this is a good simmering type alcohol stove you just want to keep something warm it's made out of stainless steel so it's going to last forever let's start into hiss we need to get to 205 for boiling this thermometer is off about 5 to 8 degrees the water temperature thermometer testing pretty good now sounds like we're going to get to boiling before it runs out three quarters of an ounce denatured alcohol 14 minutes 192 190 90 degrees about 15 minutes and it looks like it's going out we're up to 200 it didn't quite reach boiling quit the water quit sizzling so it's still barely going we'll call it out at 15 minutes I'll at 15 minutes and no Boyle I think if we put an ounce in this stove you could get it to a boil but we'll go ahead and do the next test on stove number ten it's built a little differently hopefully we can get that to boil thanks for watching everyone", "Z6vxDThqmws": "if your outdoor equipment has a two-cycle engine it runs on a mixture of oil and gas so let's mix it up [Music] most mixing ratios are based on 1 gallon of unleaded gas your equipment may even come with a single serving of the right amount of motor oil per gallon like this one here if not just check to see what the right ratio for your engine is measure out the oil and pour it in your gas can along with 1 gallon of fresh regular unleaded fuel then swirl it up as you can see we're mixing in the gas can never in the fuel tank it's harder to mix them there and it's not good for the engine now pour that magical concoction into the tank hmm hmm that's good stuff after you mix fuel once for your

cash iron katie i'm casper katie i'm cast iron katie and then make a nice sound stove just a moment [Music] hi there i'm cast iron katie and in this video is another requested italian recipe i am going to make lemon ricotta tart so let's get started whisk together two cups flour six tablespoons sugar half teaspoon baking powder and zest from one lemon mix in a half cup of cold diced salted butter [Music] mix in two eggs and one tablespoon lemon juice until it has a gravelly consistency [Music] divide mix in half and form two discs wrap the discs in plastic and refrigerate overnight [Music] [Music] we're going to make the filling i have a 32 ounce container ever caught it that i drained overnight we'll beat that for 20 to 30 seconds we'll add our sugar it's a half cup of sugar and also add a tablespoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of limoncello it's a lemon liqueur we'll add the zest from one lemon and eight eggs we'll add them one at a time [Music] okay that looks incorporated really well now we will assemble our tarts i'm going to start by rolling out the crust i want it about an eighth of an inch thick and big enough to where it's going to hold our filling [Music] [Music] slapping it in [Music] i thought that was going to be the hard part and it was we will divide our filling into the two tart crusts [Music] we are ready to go to the hot coals we'll thank our lemon ricotta tarts at 350 until the center is firm to get a 358 quart 12-inch dutch oven 10 on the bottom and 20 on top if you'd like to see the equation [Music] description for the 5 or 10 inch dutch oven you put eight on the bottom and 14 on the top okay click on the video description if you want to see how i use briquette placement to control the temperature of the bake every 10 minutes we will rotate the ovens and the lids and that's to prevent hot spots from too much heat that is focused in one spot from a particular coal [Music] it's been on for 30 minutes let's give it a check it's looking pretty good nowhere near firm though very jiggly it's been on 55 minutes let's see how jiggly it is i can really smell it i hope that it's not burny looks good cracking on top i really think that's about done i'm gonna let it go five more minutes maybe a mistake but let it go five more minutes dessert first [Music] so the lemon ricotta tart turned out fantastic it is cheesy with the ricotta a little bit of sweetness with the lemon well the lemon shallow and it's super light and fluffy from all the eggs in it get in here let me show you can i show you let me show you oh look at that see how that up a bit how caramelized that is now this is the one dish so far out of all of my dishes that i wish can you see that see how pale that is on the bottom yeah i wish i had not used the spacer on the bottom in this one instance um maybe even not use the dutch oven liner but it would have been impossible to get out actually here's a tip i used tin snips and cut the dutch oven liner off of the tart so that i wouldn't break up the crust whenever getting it out so um yeah just cut that tin right off of it or i guess it's aluminum cut that aluminum right off of there it's it's refreshing how light and lemony this turned out it is very good i highly recommend that you give it a shot it's it's a good dessert recipe this is a must do so give it a shot if you need a refreshing lemon dessert to take with you to some event i don't know this is cast iron katie thanks so much for watching it's a lemon liqueur and joe says it tastes like pledge you", "tLa7TXbH6VI": "hi everyone

of fun making it go check it out something like this is affordable fun to make and if you love your pipes and you love your tobacco and storing them you'll love to make this so let's get started with this video alright guys well I've done here is I've laid out my shelves on this hard board and then this marked it out with a sharpie and I'm gonna be cutting on that line all the way and that will be the backing of that alright guys I just got a cut out right there and that's some excess of it I use a utility knife to do my pre markings and you have to keep really straight in and that you can go light and go over a couple times and I would suggest that first before going full blast because I went full blast into it and my line started to end up more like s's instead of straight lines and what I'd like to use on this would be like a table saw or a dremel tool with a cutter bit just to go over it and that would that would have worked great but from for what I have I ended up having you know almost perfect cuts all the way across I'm gonna have to sand it down of course and maybe you know trim it up a little bit but I'm just glad that everything lined up perfectly because I only have one piece and I didn't want to go back to the store so hey guys I got her old sand paper down and drilled in the back side anyways two bolts up there and two bolts down there and those are wider than these two and I'll tell you why I decided after I did these two to make them wide because I'm not putting bolts on the side I'm actually going to superglue the side because this is so thin that it this side will hold and there's not much give right now as it is so I think whether the super cool glue holds it or not it should be fine yeah that's how I decided to do it and that's what it looks like with the back now it's time to polish her up sandpaper down and make it look pretty alright guys what I decided to do in this clip is used a butane torch lighter to put in the wood and give it a nice rustic feel before I go ahead and stain it this choice is really up to you guys just keep it even if you decide to do it and don't know if we do it unless you want it to look like a can of motor oil right now as my shelf hanging and this wire is what's holding it up along with this drywall screws so this drywall screw is a screw that holds it in with drywall it's pretty self-explanatory I put a 5/16 drill bit through the wall came back with it nice and even hole straight in flat and then I put the drywall anchor in use a tool to prop it open and actually opened up like that and caught the drywall so it can't pull out this way and it's actually ready for like a hundred and thirty-five pounds okay so this is some wiring here and I'll put the gauge on screen right now and I've took 8 of those pieces and cut them evenly right and then I spindle them together you don't know what spin Ling is you're in the same boat as I was I looked up a YouTube video and I put that video in the description on explaining how to spindle your wire with a drill and some needle nose pliers or I think you might have used a vise or some some sort of holding method I know this might be a little overwhelming but stop staring at all the pipes and all the other crap on it and focus on the rest occation for a sec so this is what it looks like when I burned it I burnt it here here here you know basically all over the place and random places and even on most of this this shelf right here and even on the side right here so it gave it a really good feel I believe and I like how it turned out you don't have to burn it it's your shelf you do whatever you want I did that I put I stained it with expresso color color of stain that is called expresso you can use whatever color you want let it dry two hours put on the backing then I'll let it set for three days I believe before I got busy and with my other stuff and I let it set for like three or four days in my Grod remember in warmer climates is going to dry a lot easier and colder climates like I'm in Colorado right now and this took a while to stop stinking so that's what it looks like once it's fully Donna how this small shelf down here that just has enough space to hold let's see this is probably like a 1.75 out of 10 this is a couple 176 ounce 10 this actually this has to be bigger this is like a to understand this like the 1.7 610 I'm mister bra glider almost everytime it lights which is really nice if you are looking at pipe lighters for a soft flame that's a good lighter even has some some pipe tool built into it like that so you don't have to carry two separate pieces my butane lighter my rustic matches I got off of Amazon have a 10 I'm storm in here and then this Mississippi Seattle pipe club and this is actually the special reserve edition blah blah blah got my pipes up there that I like that fit perfectly on this and do not hang very nicely this one actually hangs really nicely and so does this one but if they sit better right there my battery pack which actually has a button to change lighting on it so that's a annoying so I'm just going to keep it like that this is a pipe that I'm storing in the box because I don't want it touching the water and now it's just a helper 10 with some setliffe in it I'm not even sure what flavor so I'm not going to get into it on thumb imported briar Italian small boy pipe a small boy pipe some prior works from corncob that's actually empty and just Foresta kated looks I put it up there probably won't keep it long and then this is my shelf and each hole I have nine holes up here 9 grooves right there so I could a total of 18 pipes if my math is correct and so yeah I have a shelf there I have a shelf there my line of pipes there you can actually put stuff up there like that outpoint can and some maybe a PI tool or whatever you want on the backing up here and then I have another little shelf that's the middle of it then I have another little shelf there not really by using as a shelf on that I mean - I get pipes and then all my pipes hang right there with those holes up there and I'll send it down neatly and then I have a backing right there on the top so that's what it looks like all finished so this is gonna be a video for the last date I'll explain what that is in the next video so stay tuned for that so I had a lot of fun making this shelf and I saved tons of money doing it instead of buying one it looked great and if you're asking is a little bowtie right there because that middle shelf I should have just ended it down like a half of inch and it would have been completely straight but just bowed out just a bit not that much I'd say about that but it gives an authentic vibe because I I built this myself I'm pretty happy with it and how it turned out and I'm going to cherish this for years to come I'm like always guys take it easy enjoy your guys's pipes and drive your guys's weekend your whiskey whatever you're doing and hit me up with the like and I subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next one for that video right there peace [Music]", "6_nBZf5tW9E": "what is up ladies and gentlemen we're back here for another episode and as you guys can tell by the title I'm going to be attempting the micro ChatterBait fishing challenge deal now I need to show you guys this this ChatterBait because it is it's probably one of the smallest smallest lures that I've used in quite some time look at that guy's this right here is a normal Saturday with a normal trailer on there just like what we use at some farm ponds and stuff this right here is the micro ChatterBait like look at that difference right here like it is in sane at how small that is compared to a normal sized ChatterBait but also I'm going to be doing a giveaway at the very end of this video I'm actually going to be giving away one of those Chad rates that one the Micro chatter baits I've actually already been fishing and let me tell you guys it's it's pretty good caught up a lot caught them up absolutely on that micro ChatterBait so make sure to stay tuned tuned to the very end of the video to learn on how you can win I'm going to send you guys a brand new pack of the Kai Tech swim baits for that and I'm gonna send you guys the a brand new micro chatter bait and that's what you guys are gonna get it's a great combo you pair those things up it's a great combo for doing some little creek fishing doing some little pond fishing especially if you guys have some submerged grass you can throw this out on like a grass flight or something real back in because it's only one eighth of an ounce and only like I believe is like maybe two or three inches long I won't sink down a whole lot into all that grass and you can't you can kind of reel it above the grass so it's an awesome lure it's very versatile too and that's kind of what I was doing a little bit today so other than that let's get to fishing and again stay tuned for the very end the of the video for to learn how to win one of those chatter beats and I've got my micro micro ChatterBait hope sirs was that was a total Wow looks like a lobster almost and there's a little bit right there too but yeah my micro a micro ChatterBait right here and oh my god I just caught one first cast I saw that vest right here after that turtle splashed I saw him and I was like well let's try to catch him look at that guy's oh my gosh I can't believe I just did that that was insane I haven't even been filming for over a minute we're at 40 something seconds right now and I already caught one Wow that was all right and get back to what you were doing right there on the bank that was insane let me tell you I've never done that there was literally a fish right here guys and I cast right here I was bringing it just like this and he did and I saw him too right after you guys saw that turtle did a big splash it looked like a lobster almost and then that bass came from over here so I'm swimming a cast right there and I caught him Oh guys I got one I got another one oh yes on the ChatterBait I literally casted him probably like three feet of no not even that probably a foot of water and look at that we have herself another little bass it was right on the bank - just like that last fish I almost set the set the bait in the water this is like the fish was in the exact same spot there we go right there look at that guy's micro micro chatter rate a little fish there we go that's awesome I love this it's not actually turning to be like one of my new favorite baits or something a micro chatter bait Wow got one guys oh dang this is a good fish there's a good fish guys oh yes look at that guy's that is a pretty good fish would you guys look at that that's probably solid pound right there kind of skinny but let Kelly got that ChatterBait guys oh he's a feisty guy so and they get on there and jump look at that on the micro micro ChatterBait right there guys alright guys so get this beauty air tossed back in the water and there she goes Wow guys that was uh that was pretty awesome I casted right up you guys can see that kind of like mini pond deal it's normally a fountain but right now the water so low that it's like a a pond I catch right up under there I was bringing it out and that guy he didn't really have a big bite it was more of like he I saw my line moving and normally that's not normal Oh got one guys oh man that might be a good one oh no not a good one but well he's growing on me here he's growing on me Wow look at that guys the route top of the mouth look at that this it's been every fish it's been in the roof of the mouth Wow look at that still going on the black and blue micro ChatterBait right there this thing is tiny but it gets bites look at that catches fish that's all we need look at that guy's and these things are awesome you guys better stay tuned and I'm gonna be giving away one of these actually the chatter bait and this swim bait right here the context one bait I'm gonna be giving away this whole package so you guys stay tuned till the end and see how you all can win that oh my gosh that might be a good one oh you got another one cast to cast look at that guy's that one looks like it might be a little bit nicer would you look at this Wow beautiful colors on this fish you guys guys see that look at that beautiful colors look at that that's a nice healthy that's at least a pound fish this this thing is awesome I just I felt them almost saw him swirl - and he's bleeding just a tad not even too much right there but look at that awesome fish again on the micro ChatterBait this thing is tiny but it catches fish alright guys so I hope you all enjoyed today's video I did I caught five fish and that one that I caught at the very very beginning that was honestly like super cool because I saw that turtle go away and I thought it was a lobster actually which was hilarious and then I saw that tiny little bass come by I thought well let's try to catch them you know this mate is small and that fish is small and they kind of go like that and so let's try to catch them and that's what I did they but catch that one in four more but you guys are here to learn on how to win some ChatterBait stuff so what you guys are gonna win is one of the black and blue little micro chatter baits want the one

thing so why is there such a huge range in prices when it comes to track crank sets and is spending more even more thing let's find out for the most fun I've had on a bike check out lobbies lightweight sprightly riding bikes linked at the top of the description what's up I'm Zack Ilana life is short but don't make a tortoise around your bike every day to be reasonably dangerous and subscribe for more fixed gear videos just like this one every Thursday and Saturday at 6 p.m. Pacific also feel free to check out the crank sets that we'll be talking about in this video linked in the description at any point during this video let's take a look at the pros and cons of crank sets at $30.00 $300 and even beyond first with the cheap $38.00 crank sets you're looking to get something like a Lascaux cranks at the origin 8 pro wheel or anything that comes on those entry-level fixed gear bikes firstly with the obvious pro these crank sets are affordable you're not spending the equivalent of an entry-level bike on one component although they're very affordable they are also very functional they're reliable and will get you from point A to point B just fine and most if not all these crank sets will be square taper and square tapered bottom brackets are the tried-and-true bottom bracket system they're very reliable they're the most popular and if you ever need a replacement bottom bracket you should be able to find one pretty easily for a reasonable price with that said though you do have a very limited selection all of these crank sets are going to be square taper and they're all going to have very similar not offensive but plane styling the finish on these cranks tend to fade and damaged pretty easily as well black budget crank sets tend to turn a brownish tint after enough exposure to the Sun whereas silver crank sets tend to scratch pretty easily at this price and if you get color anodization it can be really uneven you can immediately spot the difference between a high-quality one and a low-quality one another con is the chain ring in terms of durability roundness and options these chain rings won't be as well machined as more pensive ones meaning they won't be as rounds and the teeth won't be as even meaning your dry train won't run as smoothly you can have uneven chain tension throughout your pedal stroke and the chain line might not be straight and the vast majority of these affordable crane tests are going to be 130 BCD that's bolt Center diameter which determines what size chain rings you can use and at 130 BCD there just aren't as many options as the track standard which is 144 BCD a lot of these cranks will also come with loose ball bearing bottom brackets which means more maintenance and they can start to click and creak if you don't stay on top of keeping your bottom bracket packed these cranks also aren't going to be the stiffest and the best performing in the world and because of that you will be a little bit slower on cheaper cranks please do note though it's not going to be a huge difference sometimes I go out on group rides with a $400 bike and I can still stay in the front of the pack where people have crank sets that cost as much as my entire bike the rider of the bike is always a way bigger factor when it comes to speed than the bike itself with that said though these cranks do have a subjectively worse ride quality if you know what you like about your bike parts it's not going to feel nearly as good to ride on as more expensive cranks with these cheap cranks it can feel like the bike is resisting the pedal stroke and that you have to work a lot harder to keep up at the same speed and like with anything else at a lower price point the quality control is going to be more varied some crank sets are the same model are going to be better than others in terms of chain line durability and finishes and you don't have a say in which one you get although it sounds like there's a lot more cons for those affordable crank sets they are right for the right people but what exactly do you get when you spend 10 times as much on a $300 crank set and when I say $300 this includes the crank arms the bottom brackets and the chain ring at this price are cranks like the sukhino 75 s dura-ace 7600 SRAM omniums with an upgraded bonnet bracket or they make a advanced and pissed nerd crank sense first with the pros obviously these cranks are going to perform better they'll be stiffer they'll give you better power transfer and you'll be able to go faster with these cranes compared to something more affordable personally for me crank sets are more enjoyable to ride and a stiff crank set can make the difference in ride quality between a bike that feels like pedaling a pile of mashed potatoes or pedaling a bike that feels like a rocket ship and of course when you spend more you're going to have more choice you can choose between any style that you want the little best to suit your build anything from the classic looking Sugino semi fine so be more modern-looking from omnium at this price there's also different bottom bracket systems that you can choose from this arguably affects the performance of the crank set a little bit but if you're just riding your fixed gear on the street you're not going to notice the difference between your square taper and jus bottom bracket or a direct outboard bearing bottom bracket like on these shrimp omniums these cranks are also 144 BCD which means you can use track standard chain rings there's more choice for chain rings in terms of style and price to performance ratio and since a lot of fixed gear enthusiasts use 144 BCD there's a lot more options on the used market making it easier to snag yourself a pretty good deal on chain rings these chains are also machined out of more durable aluminum they have better machining meaning the teeth profiles or more consistent and they're rounder so you can have an even chain tension throughout your pedal stroke so you can perform at your best and these crank sets will be more durable the finishes won't damage or fade as easily and all the parts the bottom bracket chain link and crank arms won't have to be replaced as often and of course a big reason for getting a more expensive crank set is the pedigree which means fixie points these cranks are going to have a really tight quality control meaning they're much more consistent across the board when you spend more you know that you're getting a good product they're going to be well designed from companies that have a history of making good components because of that they'll retain their value better which means you can sell them more easily and get some of your money back in the event that you don't need it anymore and then the cons obviously the price ouch if you do need to replace anything immediately you're probably gonna have to get something new which means everything is more expensive across the board the price also extends to the cog and the chain because the drivetrain is a system and will only run as smoothly as its weakest link these cranks cost 10 times as much but there'll be two to three times as good and for a lot of people that's just not worth it high quality track crank sets can cost as much as an entry-level fixed gear which begs the question what am I doing with my money but then there's even crank sets that cost beyond $300 these are the top shelf cranks that cost $600 and more cranks like those Sugino 75 direct drives rotor 3ds and dura-ace 77 tenths these are going to have all the benefits of $300 crank sets with the added benefit that you know that you are getting the absolute best performance if you're trying to win a gold medal you're going to need as much advantage as you can get and these crank says provide that yes they're stiff and durable and will perform way more than well enough for just daily knocking about town it will only be a marginal difference between a $300 crank set at twice the price but if you're not a high level track racer and you still want one these crank set stay let you flex on all of your fixie friends while also telegraphing how irresponsible you are with money so which price range of crank sets is the best that really depends on who you are and what you're looking for from your bike those cheap thirty to sixty ish dollar crank sets are for people who are really price sensitive if you're on a tight budget and you just need or you want a bike these crank sets will do the job just fine $300 high quality track crank sets are for people who are competitive or semi competitive because these crates are stiffer and will give a slight performance advantage those are for fixed gear enthusiasts who appreciate the finer finishes on the components the history behind the cranks and the nicer ride quality for when we spend all that time in the saddle and then the insanely expensive $600 track crank sets are for top-level racers unless you have the potential to win thousands of dollars from an upcoming race and every single advantage counts these cranks will be way overkill so where's the sweet spot for price to performance then it's actually between one hundred and fifty dollars and two hundred dollars Andals crank sets in my eyes give the best price to performance ratio you can check out my full review of the and old standard track crank set by clicking to carbon and I firmly believe that this is the best bang for your buck when it comes to crank sets and ELLs cranks performed just as well and are just as durable as crank sets that cost 100 to $200 more I'm currently writing the Andal RS e1 cranks on my lobby and I honestly can't tell the difference between its and my more expensive C key new 75s without looking at them spending more than what the Andals are priced will get you more fixie points and really not much else but sometimes those pixie points are worth it at this point though I can't justify spending more on a crank set that performs just the same as the Craigslist I already have so I'm sticking with my no-nonsense budget and else for the time being so if you're on a budget look to spend between 150 to 200 dollars on it and they'll track crank sets otherwise you probably already know what you want from your cranks question of the day what other fixed gear components and accessories do you want me to compare in this versa series let me know in the comments and I'll make those videos so we can see what you get when you spend more and if spending more is even worth it speaking of if spending a little more is worth it our channel sponsor lobby's cycles are definitely worth it you get custom levels of ride quality all at a reasonable price lobbies are the most fun that I've ever had on a bike which makes it pretty easy for me to ride my wall be special as my daily bike I finally chose a name his name is Wallace lobbies respect with no nonsense but high-performing components like the affirmation and old crank set and even a bi snob like myself can't justify the extra 200 dollars to replace them with Sugino semi fives although I do like my Sugino sign device so if you're looking for your ends all be all fixed gear for Street riding check out wahby cycles links at the top of the description and if you haven't ring your bike yet today don't watch this upcoming video where we compare $400 vs. $1200 bikes instead ride your bike everyday to be reasonably dangerous even if it is just on the rollers [Music]", "gzC-YYdNgwc": "[Music] welcome to Rhonda here with foods 101 today I'm going to show you how to cook fresh sea bass in 15 minutes this is an 8 ounce wild call Chilean sea bass from Argentina very fresh if you smell your fish with your nose it's not a fresh catch so make sure you use your nose to indicate how fresh your fish is I'm going to use olive oil fresh cracked pepper a little kosher salt and a half of the lemon first we're going to add a little olive oil here to the fillet you just want to make sure you coat your play very well with olive oil oK you've got all the sides you've got the bottom the top this is one beautiful fillet a sea bass y'all now we're going to salt pepper it you're going to use a 12-inch skillet and I'm going to put this over medium-high heat so we can get this skillet really hot we're going to add a little kosher salt just add it to all sides here of your fillet okay just a little bit of flavor and then I've got some fresh cracked pepper I'm going to add to this just like that and you can rub it in so you can get it evenly distributed through the sides and the top and bottom of your fillet now this goes off to that smoking hot skillet sear for five minutes do not touch it move it or turn it let it sear for five minutes use your timer five minutes are up it's time to turn this beauty and I can't wait to see how it looks look what a beautiful sear that is oh yeah that's a gorgeous beautiful sear on there time it for five minutes on this side use your timer second five minutes are up now this goes off to a 450 degree preheated oven for the next five minutes you should try I just took that fillet out of the oven and I'm going to put it right here on a serving dish oh my goodness and I'm immediately going to squeeze that fresh lemon here on the top so it can just absorb down into that sea bass oh goodness yummy does it smell fantastic I've let my filet rest for about three minutes and I'm going to show you how lovely and flaky it is on the inside just look at that absolutely oh my goodness and it smells so heavenly and so fresh mmm got to give it a bite mmm oh my gosh that is one of the best catch of the day absolutely out of this world and liquor mmm so flaky the perfect amount of seasoning doesn't need to be much you really don't want to lose that fabulous see best flavor by overloading it with different seasonings mmm Wow y'all you're absolutely going to love this if you are a sea bass lover this is the recipe for you hey leave me a comment give me thumbs up here on YouTube or Instagram leave me a comment y'all shares video thanks a million for watching and I'll get you next time you [Music] you [Music]", "Yey3DPCI7zo": "here's the parts I have laid out for my PVC and foam core 3d printer cover basically I'm using PVC pipe this is just 1/2 ounce regular PVC pipe foam core like you would get it a dollar store it's a dollar per sheet these PVC fittings I'll have all the parts listed on the description have 8 of these 90 degree and then two tea pieces a piece of 11 by 14 Plexiglas clear it's still got the film on it a couple of washers handle of some sort cutters is you need to cut the PVC some velcro I got these ceramic magnets I don't think I'm gonna need the rare-earth magnets I think these will hold just fine I won't the two of them on top and bottom of the door and I don't have them shown here I bet I'm gonna have two hinges for the top and bottom of the door and then you can use paint sticks going to need at least two of them maybe three depending on how long the building works out and I'm not gonna be gluing the PVC on because I do want to be able to take this down and store it if I'm not using if I'm using PLA to print I don't need this cover on there this is just for PVC filament so anyway that's the basic ingredients right now and I'll and I'll show you the steps I'm gonna go through to build it you'll need also a ruler straightedge a long straight edge to cut the phone core mat cutter and hopefully a mat to cut it off self-healing mat those are really nice and you need the dimensions of your own 3d printer because everybody's 3d printer is different and so I'm gonna just go through those steps and we'll see how it comes out this is my GTECH i three 3d printer and I'm getting ready to measure it up make sure I build this thing to the correct size okay I've measured my printer and the dimensions are the length is eight and a quarter inches the width is 19 inches and the height is 17.5 inches and I did not include I actually added this little pulley here to the top to help the filament guide over the printer I may or may not have that in this design because I think the filament will feed directly over the display into the box because I'm planning on setting a platform that here allow me to remove this piece so I'm going to add an inch to each side so that will give me a little adjustment room make it so that I have enough room to move The Box around although I might actually bring this down because I really would like for the display to stick out at the top but I will make that determination as I build it but first I'm gonna build the sides and then we'll we'll see how that comes out I have a lot of half-inch PVC so even if I cut the height wrong I can redo it it's something you want to give really strong consideration before you start cutting PVC because even though the PVC is pretty cheap it's about two bucks per Tim foot length it still can add up so just something to think about you might want to get extra just in case you make a mistake I have to remove two and 1/8 for this thickness because it slides in there a certain way so I got times two it's one in 1/16 times two which comes out to be two and 1/8 it's really confusing but just remember that you have to compensate for the actual height of the fitting so these I round it to 13 inches and I'm just using this one as my reference and what I'm doing is I'm just marking them all all forward this is for the height of all of them the same height as close as I can get them doesn't have to be perfect but you want to get as close as possible and then get your pipe cutters put it on your mark these are pretty close so I should have a pretty consistent height and so you do that for all four corners and then we'll do the side pieces next okay so I have finished I have to do the overall the frame is basically 22 wait said it wrong actually can go either way 21 22 15 and what I'm going to do here on the top is I'm going to put these tea pieces in like right here because when I set my spool holder here I want to give it some support and that foam core just doesn't have quite enough support to support the weight of the sail sag down a little bit so I'm going to give it a little extra structure underneath yeah so that's the next thing I've got to do is figure out exactly where I need to put this and go ahead and cut those pieces out and reassemble it so you should see all that together in the next shot okay so I've cut these pieces and put in this back piece and that completes the frame the next part is just cutting out the side panels and putting the velcro on and sticking the panels on so let's see how that comes out I'll show you how to do one of the panels I'll cut it to size and I'll put the velcro on and then we'll just do all the sides just like that", "dLfIrzGyrZE": "when we solved systems by graphing we found that there were some limitations so the next step is to solve algebraically one way to do that is by elimination to eliminate means to get rid of something when two variables have the same coefficient they can be eliminated by subtraction elimination can be one of the easiest methods to solve because you can get rid of one variable or you can get rid of a variable that has the larger coefficients all right let's look at this example randy has some $1 bills and $5 bills in his wallet he has 15 bills and all the counts the money in thighs that he has 47 dollars how many of each type does he have okay I know that we don't have to write this but let's just look at what we know for practice so we know one of our equations has to deal with how many or the amount he has he has 15 bills and all so that's gonna be our first equation and then the second how much money that's the 47 dollars and it's one dollar bill and five dollar bills so that's our second equation X plus 5y equals 47 so add the equations by adding the like terms describe the result can you solve the resulting equation why or why not alright I'm gonna line these up just like I would any kind of problem I'm going to put the X's under the X's the Y's under the Y's and the constants under the constants okay I've got everything lined up now it says to add the equations by adding like terms alright so I'm gonna put my 1 in front of my X here so I'm going to add this whole thing when X plus 1 X is 2x 1 y plus 5 y is 6 y + 15 plus 47 is 62 did that help us solve anything no because we still have to Able's so no we cannot we need to Eva Lymon ate one of the variables alright so this time we're gonna do the same thing but we're going to subtract remember over here this was all addition we added added added but now we're going to subtract so I'm gonna write the equation again I'm gonna write my ones in there but you don't have to and then I'm going to minus 1x plus 5y equals 47 okay so when I do this I need to distribute my negative here so this is a key step to distribute a negative sign all right so that becomes negative 1x negative 5y and negative 47 so when I do that now I have one X minus one X those are eliminated then one Y minus five Y is negative 4y + 15 minus 47 is negative 32 so now I can solve for y divided by 4 so y equals 8 can I solve the equation yes I solved for 8 now if I wanted to find out where what X was I could just plug it in so going on to the next page what are the steps in solving a linear system by multiplying first first make sure each equation is written in standard form which is ax plus B y equals C this is a good time to note that if you are given a system that is written in standard form then elimination is a good strategy to solve it but if you're given a system that's written in slope-intercept form y equals MX plus B then graphing might be a better way to solve it all right moving on to step two you need to multiply or divide one or both equations so that one variable has identical coefficients and I'm gonna say that this is sometimes not necessary if the system already starts with opposite coefficients once you have multiplied so that you have the same coefficient you're going to subtract the equations remembering to distribute the subtraction symbol to all terms I'm emphasizing that last part because this is the most common mistake students will distribute to just the coefficient that they're trying to eliminate and not every term step 4 is to substitute the value of the variable you solve for back into the original equation to solve for the other variable when you substitute you can choose which of the two equations you want to solve for so just pick whichever one is easier in step 5 of course is to check your answer and when you check you can substitute it into both equations and if it is correct then it'll work for both and just one last note remember that a solution to a system of equations is written in an ordered pair X Y ok so those are the steps let's practice referring to these steps along the way I'm going to zoom in on example number one step one make sure each equation is written in standard form ax plus B y equals C they both aren't so step two multiply one or both equations so they have the same coefficient so what I'm looking at here is that I can see already that I have a positive 3y and then negative 3y so the coefficient is 3 in both cases now they're not identical they're opposite that's actually really good because that means step 3 subtracting they're already opposite so we don't need to distribute a negative we can just take these two since they're opposites and they cancel out so we're gonna move on from there now remember that we are adding as we go down so we have 4x + 2 X - 6 equals 16 plus 8 which is 24 to solve for X I'm going to divide by 6 and I get x equals 4 that's half my solution so now I'm gonna plug that back in to either equation it doesn't really matter both are about equal and difficulty so I'm just gonna plug it into this one 2 times 4 minus 3y equals 8 so 2 times 4 is 8 minus 3y equals 8 subtract 8 from both sides and watch your sign here I've got a negative 3y equals 0 divided by negative 3 and y equals 0 so my ordered pair is 4 0 now I'm gonna plug that back into both equations to make sure that it works so the first one was 4 times 4 plus 3 times y is 0 it's supposed to be a parenthesis equals 16 so I've got 16 plus 0 equals 16 so that checks the second equation was 2 times 4 plus oops - can it read my own handwriting there minus 3 times 0 equals 8 so that's 8 minus 0 equals 8 and that also checks out so our solution is 4 0 it's worth noting that the solution I used to just eliminate these right off the bat is just one possible way of doing it you might have chosen to multiply the bottom here by 2 and eliminate your excess if you did that you would still get the same answer as I did because you're still following all the proper rules of solving equations so there's more than one right way do these alright moving on to the next system negative X plus 2y equals negative 8x plus 6y equals negative 16 this is a good example of when you notice right away that you have two coefficients that are opposite from each other that this is perfect for elimination so I'm just gonna line these up remember at negative x and positive x eliminate or cancel out so I have positive 2y and positive 6y equals 8y and negative 8 and negative 16 is negative 24 divide both sides by 8 to solve for y so y equals negative 3 now I can plug that in to either equation it does not matter I'm gonna pick the second one down here just because there's fewer negative signs and I prefer fewer negative signs so X plus 6 times y which is negative 3 equals negative 16 you scroll here so X minus 18 equals negative 16 and 18 to both sides and I get x equals 2 so I'm going to write my answer as an ordered pair and it is 2 negative 3 I'm going to check my answers by plugging this into both equations so the first one is negative x and our x is 2 plus 2 times y which is negative 3 equals negative 8 so negative 2 minus 6 equals negative 8 that checks out the second one is X just two plus six Y which is negative 3 equals negative 16 so I have 2 minus 8 equals negative 16 and that checks out moving along to the next problem in this example 3x plus 5y equals 6 negative 4x plus 2y equals 5 I don't have any coefficients that can automatically eliminate so I'm just gonna have to make a decision I'm gonna eliminate my X's here so I'm going to multiply the first equation by positive 4 and the second equation by positive 3 this kind of reminds me of when you're trying to find a common denominator it's the same kind of principle where you're multiplying both in common denominator terms both fractions by opposite numbers and in this case both terms by opposite numbers so when I distribute this 4 remember it's going to go to each term so my new equation is going to be 12x plus 20y equals 24 and in my second equation again I'm multiplying by all terms 3 times negative 4x that gives me negative 12x 3 x 2 y plus 6y + 3 times 5 is 15 so what happens here is you see how we have our opposite coefficients here so these are eliminated 12x minus 12x that's eliminated so now we can move on to 20 y + 6 y which is 26 y equals 24 plus 15 which is 39 now I can tell here I'm not going to have a whole number so this is another reason that we wouldn't really want to graph this because our answer would not be precise so 39 divided by 26 is one point five and I prefer decimals in this case but you can use fractions if you're more comfortable with that so now I'm gonna plug that 1 point I've been back to one of the original equation so when I say original I mean one of these not one that you've multiplied by because if you made a mistake going from the step one to step two you might not catch it if you substitute into the second set of system so go back to the original equation and I'm just gonna pick the first one so 3 times X plus 5 times y which is one point five equals 6 so 3 times X plus and five times 1.5 is 7.5 equals 6 so to solve for X I'm going to subtract 7.5 so 3x equals negative 1 point 5 divided by 3 and X is negative 0.5 or 1/2 a few perfer so my solution is negative zero point five one point five and again when you substitute those back in go back to the original problems these right here so I'm gonna do 3 times X which is negative 0.5 plus 5 times y which is one point five equals six and ordinarily I would just do these in my head but I am going to use a calculator and I see that it checks out 6 equals six and then the next one negative 4 times negative 0.5 plus 2 times 1.5 equals five so that's two plus three equals five and it checks out continuing on just a few more practice problems in the next example seemed a little too much there they're both written in student form and everything's lined up correctly I don't have any identical coefficients but I do see here that my negative 4y and my positive 8y this is gonna be the best to work with the reason I say that is if I multiply just the first equation by two when I distribute this to each term I'm going to get 10x minus 8y equals 6 so see i only have to multiply the first equation so now my positive 8y and my negative 8y eliminate I didn't have to multiply the second equation by anything to get there then just add vertically 2x plus 10x is 12x equals negative 2 plus 6 is a 4 now i'm gonna divide both sides by 12 so i get x equals 1/3 and now I said I prefer decimals but this is a repeating decimal so we're just gonna leave it as a fraction then I'm gonna substitute that back in and there's not really a better one here if I had a coefficient of X that was compatible with 3 I'd pick that one but neither one is really better than the other they're kind of both just awkward since we're multiplying fractions here all right so 2 times X which is 1/3 plus 8y equals negative 2 so I've got 2/3 plus 8y equals negative 2 so I'm gonna subtract 2/3 both sides so I get 8y equals negative 2 and 2/3 I'm gonna bring this up here rewrite it as 8y and I'm gonna write this as an improper fraction since I'm about to have to divide by 8 so that's gonna be negative 8/3 then if I multiply by the reciprocal times 1/8 times 1/8 that was eliminate right there y equals and then I can see these are gonna cancel out here y equals negative 1/3 so my solution is 1/3 and negative 1/3 right next problem 3x plus 2y equals 8 2y equals 12 minus 5x this is not written in standard form so that's the first thing I have to do I'm going to move this 5x to the other side so I can have it 5x plus 2y equals 12 so then if I see this one and my first equation I'm going to line it up vertically 3x plus 2y equals 8 this one's a good candidate for elimination because I've got identical coefficients here so I'm just gonna subtract my second equation so remember when you multiply that negative it's distributed to each term so that becomes negative 3x negative 2y and negative 8 which gives us our goal of eliminating 2y a negative 2y so I have 5x minus 3x is 2x and 12 minus 8 is 4 divided by 2 and x equals 2 at this point if you chose to multiply the first equation by a negative then you should see that you still got the same answer as me but your work is going to look a little different now I'm going to plug this 2 into one of these equations I'm going to pick the first equation just because I think it looks a little nice so three times X which is 2 plus 2 y equals 8 6 plus 2y equals 8 subtract 6 2y equals 2 divided by 2 and y equals 1 so our solution written as an ordered pair is 2 one last example on these three x equals negative 6y plus 12 that's not written in standard form so i'm going to add 6y on both sides and i get 3x plus 6y equals 12 and the second equation negative x plus 3y equals 6 is already in standard form so I don't have anything that I can obviously eliminate here I do notice that my negative x + 3 X those are kind of potential for opposites here so I'm gonna choose to multiply my first equation by 3 so distribute that 3 to each term so 3 times negative x is negative 3x 3 x 3 y is 9y + 3 times 6 is 18 and again you did not have to do it the same way that I do in fact I encourage you to find a different way and see if you get the same answers me in the end so our 3x and negative 3x are eliminated so 6 y + 9 y is 15 y equals 30 divided by 15 to solve for y and y equals 2 now when I plug that in I'm gonna go back to one of my original equations before I did anything so that if I did make an error I will find it so I'm gonna use the bottom equation negative x + 3 times 2 equals 6 and I just chose that because the coefficients are a little bit smaller but again if you do all the steps correctly we should get the same either way negative X plus 6 equals 6 subtract 6 from both sides just go up a little bit here negative x equals 0 divided by negative 1 if you want we can see that x equals 0 so our ordered pair is 0 2 and if you get an answer like that you think I'm not really sure if that's right this is a really good one that you should definitely check if you feel unsure so 3 times X which is 0 whenever I get 0 for any answer it makes me a little bit hesitant did I do something wrong or is that just really the answer negative 6 times 2 plus 12 so 0 equals negative 12 plus 12 well that works out notice I went back to the original equation that was given before we wrote it in standard form and then I have negative x so negative 0 which negative 1 times 0 0 plus 3 times y which is 2 equals 6 so I've got 0 plus 6 equals 6 and it checks out alright let's look at some word problems we did the graphing problems there were a couple that were such big numbers that doing them algebraically might have been preferred so now that you know how to do algebra it will probably prefer this way when you are working with large numbers a landscape designer uses two types of gravel for walkways the larger gravel weighs an average of 48 pounds per cubic foot in the smaller weighs 40 pounds per cubic foot in this track the designer has a 12 cubic foot load of gravel that weighs 520 pounds how many cubic feet of each type of gravel are in the chart when we discussed writing equations we said there's often two different types the amount which is 12 cubic foot load and then how much in this case is how many pounds not the price per pound like the last one it weighs 520 pounds 48 pounds per cubic foot for the small or the larger and 48 pounds per cubic foot for the smaller I'm gonna start by defining my variables I like X&Y so I'll call X the larger and y the smaller all right so our first equation is the amount so the designer has 12 cubic feet so X plus y large plus small totals 12 cubic feet and then the second is about the weights 48 pounds for the larger 40 pounds for the smaller and the total there it is 520 pounds so 48 X plus 40 y equals 5 2000 I can't eliminate unless I do some multiplying so I'm going to choose to multiply the first equation by whatever is going to be easiest so my coefficient for X is 48 my coefficient for y is 40 I'm going to choose to use the smaller number so I'm going to multiply by negative 40 so that I'll be able to eliminate those so remember to distribute to each term so now I have negative 40 X minus 40 y equals negative 480 I'm going to line up my second 48 X plus 40 y equals 5 20 as a pitiful equal sign there equals okay so my negative 40 y and my positive for you I are going to eliminate so now I could just combine like terms negative 40 X and 48 X 8 X and negative 4 80 and positive 5 20 kids me 40 so x equals 5 now when you're going back to plug that in I think there is a clear winner here we're going to use the first equation 5 plus y equals 12 so y equals 7 so how many cubic feet of each type of gravel are in the truck so we've got five cubic feet of the larger type and seven cubic feet of the smaller title next question the Toymaker produces wooden trains and wooden airplanes each train requires three ounces of paint in each airplane requires five ounces of paint the Toymaker has a gallon can of paint which is 64 ounces glad they did that so I don't have to do the math on that if he wants to use it to paint 14 toys how many of each contain paint let's highlight the important information first so we know we have wooden trains and airplanes so the trains require three ounces and the airplanes require five ounces he's got 64 ounces I'm gonna ignore that gallon because we know it's an ass's and that's what we need to know and he's got 14 toys total how many of each Kenny paints so let's start with our amount well let's first start with defining our variables so I'm gonna call X the trains and why the planes okay now I'm gonna do my amount he's got enough paint to do 14 points or he wants to paint 14 twice so X plus y in other words trains plus planes equals 14 and then the next is the amount or ounces of paint so a train is three ounces and a plane is five ounces and 64 is our total now when I'm looking at elimination I whenever I have a coefficient right here that is 1 it's pretty easy to just multiply this so if I want to eliminate my X's I need to multiply the top by negative 3 and that will give me negative 3x minus 3 y equals negative 42 and then I'm gonna line up my second one 3x plus 5y equals 64 and combine like terms so as I hope my negative 3x and my positive 3x eliminate so then I have negative 3y and positive 5y which is 2 y + 64 negative 42 which is 22 so Y is 11 when I go back here I've got my X plus y which is 11 equals 14 which means X is 3 so how many of each can he paint three trains 11 planes last comprehension question when solving a system by elimination and multiplying first how do you determine the numbers used to multiply in each equation well that's the important part that students get stuck on you want your two variables to have the same coefficient so pick whichever numbers that you need that will result in the desired product", "NWwL-vzuyOY": "here we are sweetheart it's the day

Mossberg 590 a one special purpose 20 inch barrel as a typical cylinder bore choke and I was using the number 4 shot not to be confused with number 4 buckshot but the 2 and 3/4 inch shell you can see the velocity it's 1 and 1/4 ounce as a payload and here is the payload approximately 125 to 130 pellets and you could convert that number 4 over to a caliber it's coming in just over 13 so get that in the reflection 13 caliber and if you move up to number 4 buckshot you're looking at approximately 27 pellets and roughly 24 calibers so smaller payload as far as number of pellets but a lot bigger and that's probably used more for home defense than this would be this is typically a field load used for small game birds and so forth I've had to use this in the backyard unfortunately for rabies a rabid animals we have a run of rabid raccoons and skunks and they will come out in the bowl today they are obviously sick they'll try to get into the house and the garage and there's somewhat aggressive so I've had to use this to humanely put them down from a distance and I found it to be quite effective now we're looking at this today because some folks might want to consider something smaller or not as powerful as buckshot for home defense because of fear of over penetrating walls and so forth so this is what it does set roughly ten feet on a one gallon water jug to be expected you have a lot of energy going out there this is from three to five feet so it opened that up now if you're being attacked by a highly caffeinated mr. coffee maker then I think you're gonna be in good shape you pretty much split this in half let's move over to the steel and see what kind of pattern we had at distance this plate is 12 inches in diameter a r500 steel 3/8 of an inch thick and it weighs about 12 pounds that shot was from 30 feet really good coverage at that distance miss my foot a couple of IPSC targets hits on the side this is 24 inches by 18 inches you can see the coverage there and on the second one more center mass on that and I backed up on these by the way this was at approximately 15 yards 45 feet and pretty good coverage on this sized target at that distance and this is what you wanted to see a block of the sim test calibrated to match the specs of 10% ordinates gel weighs 50 pounds 22 inches in length I have not been using denim for shotgun tests so it is absent again today I'll be shooting this from a distance of 10 feet and I'm hoping to get at least 10 to 12 inches of penetration out of a majority of the payload as a point of reference I was holding on the center of the block where that florescent meets to black on the front post let's back up and take a quick look at the front because it did go a little bit low there might be a few pellets that try to exit out of the bottom of the block but that is a very nasty point of entry from 10 feet for now I've just split this into two halves you can see on this half the plastic wad penetrated about four inches I don't know how realistic that's going to be in real life and to what extent that plastic wad caused this inch and a half diameter opening we have here and even more so over here I do think that the pellets obviously caused a lot of lot of damage to this speaking of pellets I'm seeing most of these from this perspective in the six two eight and eight and a quarter inch range I can see several through here in this area I can feel them underneath and see them underneath the top layer of the block but generally six up to about eight and a quarter inches from this perspective what I'm going to do now is just make a cut right down the middle of this and see if I can get some more pellets in this area and if we can pick up some deeper penetration and then we'll wrap it up working along the core of the shot path I made some additional cuts including some cross sections and confirmed that the maximum penetration on this is going to be around eight to eight and a quarter inches with the majority of the shot stopping between five and a half and eight inches I think that's a good thing as far as the pattern itself now this is all cut to pieces of course but the frontal area of the block was originally around 48 square inches and at 10 feet I think we captured a high percentage of the payload in that area that will be confirmed once I break this block down into smaller pieces melt it and then pour the hot liquid through the strainer where it will be recast in this case for retirement this is the last time you're going to see this particular block I've been using it since February 2011 have a fresh batch of sim test in the house it's gonna be lighter in color as we get started but it's calibrated so don't panic now with regard to this particular test if you can go with buckshot if you can handle the recoil and if your living situation permits that I would gravitate toward the buckshot however if you were extremely concerned about over penetration I do think this is a better option than birdshot and therefore it could be a good choice for you not the best but it could be effective thanks for watching you", "VzYK2dLAxeE": "hey everybody what's up looking

Lake Portland math tutor today we are tackling the SAT practice test version eight we're taking taking a look at sections 3 & 4 the math sections all right let's go so we're gonna start with section 3 which is the no calculator section and here are your here's your formula sheet you can always come back and take a look at that throughout the test ok so number 1 3 X plus X plus X plus X minus 3 minus 2 equals 7 plus X plus X okay what's the value of x well we're just going to combine like terms on the Left we see that we have got 1 2 3 4 5 6 X's okay so that's gonna be 6 X and then we can see that we have negative negative 3 and negative 2 that's going to be negative 5 and on the right it's a little bit simpler we have we have 1 X 2 X 2 X and then we just have that 7 yeah yeah that's 7 so it's just plus 7 okay so I'm gonna combine like terms minus 2x minus 2x and I'm gonna get 4x minus 5 equals 7 add 5 to both sides get 4x equals 12 and then of course we're in divide by 4 we get x equals 3 x equals 3 is our answer number 2 the graph above shows the distance traveled D in feet by a product on a conveyor belt in minutes after the products product is placed on the belt which of the following equations correctly relates D and M well this is another just comes up a lot on the SAT these are equations in slope intercept form so we just need to figure out the slope and the y-intercept well we can see that the y-intercept pretty clear that the y-intercept is 0 okay so off the bat we can eliminate X C and D because they both have an intercept of 2 and now we just need to figure out the slope to determine if it's a or B well the slope is rise over run rise over run and it appears that the the slope for this craft is goes up 2 feet every one minute so you would say that the slope is 2 and that would correspond to a solution 3 the formula below is often used to by project managers to compute e the estimated time to complete a job where o is the shortest completion time P is the largest completion time and M is the most likely completion time which of the following correctly gives P in terms of e o and M you're gonna almost guaranteed you're gonna get a problem like this on your on your actual SAT you are solving you're just solving the equation for for a given variable in this case P so we're just gonna take the original equation o plus 4 M plus P over 6 and I multiply both sides by 6 I mean 6 e equals o plus 4 M plus P ok well I need to subtract oh it's not zero that's oh and I need to subtract 4 M from both sides so those will cancel off on the right side and I subtract it from that the left side as well and minus 4 okay so I'm gonna get 6 e - o minus 4 M equals P and it looks like that corresponds to a for our solution number 4 in the figure above our T equals T you what is the value of x we'll just start off with our T and T you are equal okay so that's that's an isosceles triangle that means that the base angles are going to be the base angles are going to be congruent and I'm gonna call that angle a right so therefore 2a + 114 must equal 180 can sum of the interior angles of a degrees of a triangle add up to 180 subtract one 14 from both sides to a equals it's going to be sixty six divided by two so angle angle u and angle R are both going to be 33 degrees all right well likewise I know that I can use that this angle this angle and this angle right here I'll call that B we're gonna add up to 180 as well so I know that 31 plus a which is 33 plus B equal 180 so that's 64 plus B equals 180 okay so then I see that angle B equals 180 minus 64 is going to be 117 oh did I get that and I didn't get that right C not 117 116 okay well I know that X and B sum to 180 therefore I know that I know that X has to be 64 so see it's my solution five the width of a rectangular dance floor and w feet is W feet the length of the floor is six feet longer than its width okay so I'm just gonna like to get a small sketch going as soon as possible we know that the width is with this w and the length is W plus six which of the following expressions expresses the Primmer perimeter in feet of the dance floor in terms of W okay so I know that I've got W on that side none of this is gonna be W plus six so we can just add these sides here I'm gonna have two w + 2 W that's 4 W and then I'm have 6 + 6 which is 12 so my answer is gonna be 4 w 4w + 12 number 6 y is greater than 2x minus 1 and 2x is greater than 5 which of the following consists of the Y coordinates of all the points that satisfy the system of inequalities above okay all right well let's see we've got we've got these are almost the same sorry these expressions on the on the this and this they're almost the same the Y is greater than 2x minus 1 and 2x is greater than 5 well if we just subtract one from the left side and one from the right side we would see that y is greater than 5 minus 1 which is 4 so Y y is greater than 4 V the solution to this number 7 what is the solution set of the equation above okay so if we want to solve a radical function we need to isolate the radical so let's see it's gonna be 2x plus 6 plus 4 equals x plus 3 I'm gonna subtract 4 from both sides we will get square root of 2x plus 6 equals X minus 1 all right now I'm gonna square both sides on the Left I'm just gonna have 2x plus 6 and on the right I'm gonna expand that so it's gonna be the x squared minus 2x plus 1 and this is a quadratic so to solve a quadratic we set it equal to 0 I'm just gonna subtract 2x and subtract 6 from both sides I get 0 equals x squared minus 4x minus 5 all right well our a value is 1 so we're looking for two numbers that multiply to C and add to B okay well that looks like it's gonna be it's gonna be negative 5 and positive 1 so 0 equals X minus 5 X plus 1 all right so these are going to be this first factor corresponds to a solution at x equals 5 the second factor corresponds to a solution of x equals negative 1 all right so now we need to since it's we solved a radical with the court using Radek we're going to need to check our solutions here so let's put five into the equation and see what we get so we're gonna have if we put in a five we'd have 2 times 5 is 10 2 times 5 is 10 plus 6 square root plus 4 equals well 5 5 plus 3 is 8 okay the square root of little 10 plus 6 that's 16 square root of 16 is 4 plus 4 equals 8 yes 5 works 5/5 works let's check negative 1 if we put negative 1 in we're gonna have 2 times negative 1 is negative 2 plus 6 plus 4 equals well negative 1 plus 3 that's gonna be 2 all right so then inside the square root we have square root of square root of 4 plus 4 equals 2 no it's gonna be 2 plus 4 is 6 6 does not equal 2 so negative 1 is not a solution so the only solution that works for this is going to be 5 our answer is B number 8 okay we'll get a cubic and a quadratic which of the following expressions is equivalent to f of X over G of X for X greater than 3 so f of X over G of X so that is going to be now let's just divide okay so actually we might be able to factor I mean I'm just going to write this out here I'm gonna see that the the first the top expression f of X we can has a common factor of X a lot x squared minus 9 perfect now I recognize that it's a difference of squares and the denominator well the denominator we want two numbers that multiply two numbers that multiply to negative three and add to negative two well those are going to be negative three and positive one yeah and I can see that I'm gonna simplify the top one more step this difference of squares this difference of squares right here can factor as such so difference of squares into the square root of the first minus square root of the second times that square the first plus squared it sucked all over X minus 3 times X plus 1 so the X minus 3s cancel out and we're just left with x times X plus 3 over X plus 1 and that looks like d is our solution f plus oops number 9 we have an equation of a circle here in the XY plane the graph of the equation above is a is a circle Point P is on the circle and has coordinates 10 negative 5 if PQ is a diameter of the circle what are the coordinates of Q well let's think about this we know that we know that the circle has a center at at 6 negative 5 so say so right there that's 6 negative 5 because the equation for a circle you should definitely know this it's gonna come up on the test y minus K squared equals R squared okay and we know that 10 negative 5 10 negative 5 let's write here 10 negative 5 is on the circumference well that's clearly that's on the that's on the same it's a horizontal with the center well we know that 16 equals the radius squared so 4 equals the radius and that makes sense 6 plus 4 is 10 well then 6 minus 4 minus 4 should be the other point the point on the opposite side of the circle should be a 10 or sorry 2 negative 5 and that is our first solution 10 a group of 220 people went on an overnight camping trip taking 60 tents with them some of the tents held two people each and the rest held four people each okay so that's gonna be significantly good there's some of them the two two-person and then we have some four-person tents assuming all tents were filled to capacity and every person got to sleep in a tent exactly how many of the tents were two-person tents okay so let's let's get some variables out here I'm gonna use T for the two-person tents and for the foreperson tents okay we know that the total tents the total number of tents that they brought was 60 okay so you can say that number of tents T plus the number of tents F equals 60 and we know that the total number of people that came on the trip was 102 well that's gonna be made of people that slept in a two-person tent and people that slept in a four person tent so each two-person tent held two people plus each four person tent held four people okay so we have a system of equations here I am going to we want to know how many how many people were in the the two-person tents so we need to figure out the number of two-person tents that means that I want to eliminate the four-person tents so that's just gonna save me a little bit of time that way when I solve when I get my answer to the system I don't have to plug anything back in to find the other variable alright so if I'm eliminating the F the foreperson tents I see that this first equation if I subtract T from both sides I'll get 60 minus T 60 minus T equals F okay well I can substitute that into the second equation here alright so I've got two hundred two equals 2t plus 4 times 16 minus T so of two hundred I'm just gonna distribute ya plus 240 minus 40 let's subtract 240 from both sides and I'm gonna combine like terms so two 22:02 minus 240 well I know it's gonna be negative so I'm just finding the difference and that's gonna be 38 it's gonna be negative 38 and I'll combine like terms on the right that's just gonna be negative two T divided by negative two I see that that's gonna be was that 19 equals teeth well 19 how many of the tents were two-person tent 19 yes that's our answer perfect see 11 which of the following could be the equation of the graph above all right well just right off the bat we can look at this as we can at least figure out the degree we've got a 1 2 3 4 looks like a 4th degree polynomial and we've got intercepts at negative 3 0 & 2 ok so that's going to be we've got X plus 3 that's this that's the that's accounts for the negative 3 then I've got I'm gonna put the X in front just X X X minus 0 which is just X and then this intercept 2 is going to be X minus 2 I know that this is I know that this intercept at the origin is a bounce so it's gonna be 2nd degree and this all adds up to a fourth degree polynomial and it looks like the answer be it fits the bill excellent twelve to a on B equals one-half what is the value of B over a okay so let's get B into a isolated let's see what how to do that so we got to a over B equals 1/2 all right well it looks like I need to divide both sides by by two so if I divide both sides by two I'll get these twos will cancel on all a on B equals well half of 1/2 is 1/4 I don't want a on B I want B on a okay so I can one property is that I can of a proportion is that I can take the reciprocal of both sides so if I take the reciprocal of the left kind of like raising it to the negative power of negative one I get B over a on on the left and on the right I just get that's just four so my answer is d thirteen oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from four million barrels in 2002 1.9 million barrels in 2013 assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate that's key right there constant rate that means we're talking about the linear relationship which of the following linear functions F best models the production in millions of barrels two years after 2000 okay so we need two things if we're going to write a linear equation we'll need the slope as well as the y-intercept or the starting value okay so the slope or the rate of change is just the change in the output which is barrels divided by the change in the input which is years okay so we're changing from we're going from four million million barrels to 1.9 million barrels and we're going from two thousand which is zero years to thirteen years of course you can flip this around this would be the same as one point nine barrels minus four over 15 minus zero okay so what we're gonna get here is four minus 1.9 is 2 point 1 over negative 13 so I'm just gonna stick the negative on top so our slope is negative two point one on 13 now it looks like none of the slopes here I'll have a decimal so I multiply the top and the bottom by 10 I'll get negative 21 on 130 okay so we've got our rate of change in fact we already have our y-intercept because the y-intercept is just the number of barrels in the year 2000 which was 4 ok so if I write the equation it's gonna be f of T the barrels produced is going to equal negative 21 on 130 times years past 2,000 plus 4 starting value and that is answering them answer C 14 y equals x squared plus 3x minus 7 y minus 5 X plus 8 equals 0 how many solutions are there to the system of equations above okay so we're going to be using the discriminant discriminate comes out of the quadratic formula there's per minute let's get a pen here discriminant is the piece underneath the radical B squared minus 4c we know that if that is if that is greater than zero then there are two solutions if that is equal to zero there is one solution and if that is less than zero there are no real solutions okay so we're gonna take our system here and we need to need to so I'm gonna substitute in it looks like looks like I know what y equals here and I can just substitute that into my equation down here so what I'm gonna get is x squared plus 3x minus 7 and then minus 5x plus 8 equals 0 and if I combine like terms I'm gonna get x squared and then 3x minus 5 XS I mean negative 2x and then negative 7 plus 8 plus 1 okay now let's see well I can see right away I don't even need to use the discriminant I know I can factor this is X minus 1 X minus 1 equals 0 and if that's the case then there's really only gonna be one solution so C would be our answer however if you if we decide to go through if we couldn't factor quite this easily we could go through and figure out what the determinant was our discriminant so let's take B B is B is negative 2a equals 1 and C equals also 1 so the discriminant equals B squared so that's gonna be 4 minus 4 times 4 times 1 times 1 is just 1 that's gonna be 0 so ya we are going to be having just one solution 15 G of x equals 2x minus 1 H of x equals 1 minus G of X the function is G and H are defined above what is the value of H of 0 ok H of 0 ok so this is just a little function notation H of 0 equals 1 minus well G of X G of X is just 2x minus 1 so that's gonna be 2 times 0 cuz I have to put 0 in for my X minus 1 ok so it's gonna be 1 - well this is this is gonna cancel out and I just have negative 1 minus negative 1 is plus 1 so 2 D is our answer 16 to it are sorry x squared plus X minus 12 equals 0 if a is a solution to the equation above and a is greater than 0 what is the value of a ok so we need to solve this quadratic it's already it's already in standard form and a a equals 1 that's great that means that we can factor this by just looking for two numbers that multiply to C and add to B all right well C is negative 12 C is negative 12 and we have won 12 of to 6 and 3 4 those are the factors given that one of them has to be negative because the product is negative which pair can add up to positive 1 let's see that's it's got to be this one 4 and negative 3 they add up to they all add up to positive 1 so in factored form it's going to be X minus 3 X plus 4 equals 0 well the solution that corresponds to the first factor here is going to be 3 because that would make that factor equals 0 and the product would be 0 and then the solution the corresponds to the second factor would be negative 4 because that would make that factor equals 0 resulting in the product of 0 so we know a is greater than 0 x equals 3 or a equals 3 would be our solution ok number 17 the sum of negative 2x squared plus X plus 31 and 3x squared plus 7x minus 8 can be written in the form ax squared plus BX plus C where a B and C are constants what's the value of a B and C okay so if we add these two equations together we're just adding the the squared terms that's just gonna be x squared adding the linear terms that's gonna be 8x and then adding the constants that's going to be 31 minus 8 that's going to be positive 23 all right so we've got our a in front that's a 1 we've got our B on the on the linear term that's an 8 and we have our C on the as a constant okay so 1 8 and 23 if we add those all together you're going to get 9 1 plus 8 is 9 9 plus 23 is 32 18 all right looks like we have a system if XY z-- the system of equations above what is the value of y all right so if we are if we are solving for y it would be nice to eliminate the X's and it looks like if I just add these two equations together I just add the two equations together because we have additive inverse coefficients on the X terms I think that will that'll suffice that will eliminate our X's which we're not really concerned with we're concerned with the Y's so if I add these two equations together my X terms are going to cancel out and then I've got 4y and then this is going to be 6 okay so divide both sides by 4 y equals and I guess I'll reduce that that would be 3 3 halves so y equals 19 a start-up company opened with 8 employees the company's growth plan assumes that 2 new employees will be hired each quarter every three months for the first five years if an equation is written in the form y equals a X plus B to represent the number of employees Y employed by the company x quarters after the company opened what's the value of B all right so this is in the form of y equals MX plus B and that constant that constant is the starting value constant is the starting value the y-intercept well we already know the y-intercept they told us in the first sentence here startup company open with eight employees okay so it doesn't really matter anything else our solution here is 8:20 note figure not drawn to scale okay in the circle above point a is the centre and the length of arc BC is two--this of the circumference of the circle what is the value of x so we have a arc here and BC and that's two-fifths of the circle well the arc and the central angle are proportional okay so if we had if we had if the arc was equal to the circumference so in which case it would be it'd be one over one of the circumference then the arc would be 360 since we have two fists it's going to be the central angle there will be there we go will be two-fifths of iran degrees yeah I assume we're into yep it would be two-fifths of 360 okay so I'm just gonna reduce here divide the top and bottom by 5 let me get a seven seventy two so two times 72 144 144 is the value of X 144 degrees okay section 4 the calculator section here is the reference chart your formulas for volume in area come back to that if needed number one one pound of grapes cost two dollars at this rate how many dollars will see pounds of grapes cost ok well it's just one pound of grapes cost two dollars so every pound of grapes it's gonna cost an extra two dollars so it's gonna be two two times the number of pounds of grapes number two Traci clicks collect cells and trades figurines and she tracks the number of figurines in her collection on the graph below on what interval did the number of figurines decrease the fastest okay so if we're talking about decrease then we're looking where did the where did the where did the value of the function go down and decreasing the fastest would be where the slope is the most negative or the steepest negative slope and just eyeballing it it looks like it looks like this portion is the steepest slope that's from three to four so let's look at our answers between one and two no two and three yes between three and four so C is the answer three in a random sample of 200 cars of a particular model three have a many manufacturing defect at this rate how many of 10,000 cars of the same model will have a manufacturing defect okay so that's three out of 200 have a defect so we want to know how many have a defect out of 10,000 okay so to solve this when you just need to multiply both sides by 10,000 you down the left I'll get 10 I'll get 30,000 over 200 equals X cancel out some of these zeros 300 divided by 2 is 150 so 150 is the expected number of models with the defect or cars with the defect for dimensions of iris petals the scatter plot above shows data collected on the lengths and widths of iris setosa petals line of best fit for the data is also shown based on the line of best fit if the width of an iris setosa petal is 19 millimeters what is the predicted length and millimeters for the petal so we it's saying that the width the width is 19 millimeters okay so that's gonna be over here somewhere yeah it's gonna be somewhere up here and we want to know the the length well we've got an equation for the line of best fit so all we need to do is just plug in our input which is 19 so y equals one point six seven times 19 plus two one point one okay so since this is the calculator section I'm just gonna pull up my calculator real quick on this one point six seven times 19 and that's 31.73 + 21 + 1 + k equals the output well that's going to be 5050 2.83 that is our answer C would be our answer number 5 in the figure above lines L and M are parallel y equals 20 Z equals 60 or the value of X all right well parallel lines we should be thinking about our properties of transversals thinking back to geometry and I can see that I've got this angle Y and this angle here in the top triangle are corresponding so I know that this angle equals y okay and I also know that that X plus y plus Z is equal 180 all right well we got X we don't know X but we know Y is 20 and Z is 60 equals 180 so that looks like 80 on the Left I'm gonna subtract 80 from both sides I'll get x equals 100 so B is our answer six two types of tickets were sold for a concert held at an amphitheater tickets to sit on a bench during the concert cost $75 lucky sit on a bench okay so the bench was $75 and tickets to sit on the lawn during the concert were for $40 okay I so long was $40 okay organizers of the concert announced that that 350 350 tickets had been sold though 300 tickets have been sold and [Music] 19,000 $250 had been raised through ticket sales alone which of the following systems of equations could be used to find the number of tickets for bench seats and a number of lawn seats okay so let's start out with oh my no 350 so 350 is the sum of the two and it looks like they're using B and L so B plus L should equal 350 okay I'm gonna eliminate that one that doesn't fit the bill and we know that the total revenue is the sum of the revenue for bench tickets and lawn tickets so bench tickets were 75 dollars times the number of bench tickets plus the lawn tickets for $40 times the number of long tickets and we know that that equals 19,000 250 okay so there's our system of equations and we just need to figure out which ones work well the first one is they're not adding the two the two sales of sorry the money they got from bench in the money they got from the lawn tickets they're multiplying that's an the second one $40 for the bench you know it was $40 for the lawn that's not yet in the last 175 or bench 44 long that looks like our solution D number seven and the XY plane the graph of which of the following equations is a line with a slope of three okay so you I keep saying this but it's really true if you feel comfortable with this slope-intercept form you're gonna gonna do much better on this test all right so we know that the slope is M and we want to equip one of these equations with a slope of 2 I'm sorry slope of 3 it's kind of just a freebie give it to you right there c8 all right X plus 1 equals 2 on X plus 1 in the equation above which of the following is a possible value of x plus 1 ok so to solve this I am going to 2x plus 1 I'm going to multiply both sides by X plus 1 if I do that on X plus 1 times X plus 1 equals 2 I'll expand the right I'll get x squared plus 2x plus 1 equals 2 and this is a quadratic to solve a quadratic I need to set it equal to 0 so x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals 0 I see that there are a is 1 but there are not any two numbers that multiply to negative 1 and add to 2 so I'm gonna have to use the quadratic formula quadratic formula oops quadratic formula is x equals negative B plus minus square root of B squared minus 4 ay C all over 2a so in this case a equals 1 B equals 2 and C equals negative 1 ok so then I'm gonna have x equals well negative 2 all right negative B is negative 2 plus minus the square root of B squared that's 4 minus 4 times a times C well a times C is negative 1 so negative 4 times negative 1 is gonna be positive 4 all over 2a which is gonna be 2 okay I'm gonna go this direction I don't get x equals negative 2 and that's going to be square root of 8 to simplify that I would I would write it as a square root of 4 times the square root of 2 that would be the square root of 8 over 2 okay and we have well square root of 4 is just 2 this will be negative 2 plus minus 2 for 2 over 2 ok so I am going to actually copy that situation bring it up here okay and cordon this off a little bit alright so I can divide each term in the numerator by 2 and the denominator by 2 so I'm gonna get x equals negative 2 plus minus square root of 2 all right so if we have X plus 1 all right we would be adding 1 to this let's see so we've got oh I made a mistake that'll be negative 1 plus or minus square root of 2 okay so that's our solution and if we think about the positive it'd be negative 1 plus the square root of 2 all right and if we add 1 to that it would just be the square root of 2 and if we think about the negative would be score negative 1 minus the square root of 2 well plus 1 would just be negative square root of 2 so B is our solution what we have here at the glass picture the glass pictured above can hold a maximum volume of 473 cubic centimeters which is approximately 16 fluid ounces what is the value of K and centimeters so we know the volume we know the volume formula and we know the volume in and centimeters so our cubic centimeters 430 or 473 equals 7 PI K cubed on 48 all right so I'm gonna multiply by the reciprocal of 7 pi on 48 it's gonna be 48 on seven pi times 473 equals K cubed okay well I'm gonna use my calculator for this I get 48 times 473 and then I'm going to that's a two two seven zero four divided by seven pi equals K T cubed okay so then I divide by seven seven pi got to use parentheses okay and I get that 1030 2.42 equals K cubed all right well I just need to take the cube root of both sides you're not maybe your calculator doesn't do arbitrary roots so one thing you can do is raise both sides to the 1/3 power so I'm just going to do 1,000 32.4 2 raised to the 1/3 equals K okay raised to the one 1/3 okay and I get I get that K approximately equals 10.10 sick 10.10 6 approximately equals K all right and it looks like D do be our solution number 10 it's the same setup is 9 okay water pours into the glass slowly and at a constant rate which of the following graphs best illustrates the height of the water level in the glass as it fills so just awful not just looking at this right away I would be tempted to pick a because this has a constant this is this would be the the cup being filled at a constant rate and the elevation is increasing at a constant constant rate however the grip of the cup is tapered at the bottom so this this would be this graph would be true if the glass were just would had straight sides okay however that's not the case the second one says that shows us that the love water level is increasing slowly at first and it's and then speeds up later on well there's less but there's less volume on each level boat at the bottom well you know as it goes up the volume of each layer gets gets more greater and greater so it's gonna take more time to fill up as it as the water level increases so the would not be accurate see see looks like it's probably gonna be our answer here the water level increases rapidly at first because the cup is small at the bottom and then as it starts to fill the width of the cup gets larger and it takes more time to fill the cup as the water level rises on the bottom this is saying that the water level does not change at all that's not true number 11 same same situation jenny has a picture that contains one gallon of water how many times could Jenny completely fill the glass with one gallon of water well there's there's 16 it says that there are 16 this is approximately 16 ounces all right so we just take it's 1 gallon is 128 ounces divided by 16 so I'm just gonna since C divided by 2 we get 64 over 8 okay that's 8 8 glasses roberto is an insurance agent who sells two types of policies a $50,000 policy and a $100,000 policy last month his goal was to sell at least 57 insurance policies while he did not meet this goal his goal the total value of his policies of the policies he sold was over 3 million dollars which of the following systems of inequalities describes X the possible number of $50,000 policies highlight that so X is $50,000 policies and y is $100,000 policies ok all right so we know that he sold at least his goal is to sell at least 57 now he did not meet his goal so if he did not get 57 we know that that is going to be greater than the number of $50,000 policies and the number of $100,000 policies ok so right off the bat I'm going to eliminate B and I'm going to eliminate D those don't satisfy the first inequality alright the second inequality is going to be the sum of the $50,000 policy is gonna be 50,000 times X plus the sum of the $100,000 policies which is 100,000 Y we know that that the total value of the policies was over three million so that's greater than three one two three four five six three million okay and it looks like C C is our solution because in a it's less than okay C 13 a to the negative one half equals X where a is greater than zero what is a in terms of X all right so if we want to get rid of that exponent we need to raise raise it to something that would make make it equal one well we need to raise it to well that would be negative two negative two over one right and then I gotta do the same to the other side so negative 2 over 1 is just negative 2 okay and we know that negative exponent you bring across the fraction bar so that's going to be x over or 1 over x squared let's see 14 which of the following is a value of x for which the expression negative 3 over x squared plus 3x minus 10 is undefined well undefined that's the key undefined means that the denominator equals zero so what value of x makes the denominator equal zero okay so it's factored well a is a is one this and this came up several times a is one so we're looking for a number that multiply two numbers that multiply to C and add to V okay so that's gonna be negative 10 is see all the factors of 10 are 110 2 & 5 given that one of them needs to be negative because they multiply to a negative it looks like 2 & 5 with a negative 2 so we're gonna have X minus 2x + 5 0 okay so this factor is gonna correspond to x equals 2 as a solution and then this factor is going to correspond to x equals negative 5 as a solution okay and where do we see a solution in our list here we see it at D - number 15 a granite block in the shape of a right rectangular prism has dimensions 30 centimeters by 40 centimeters by 50 centimeters the block has a density of two point eight grams per cubic centimeter what is the mass of the block in grams okay so it we also get a little bit of information here was given that the density is mass per unit volume so density equals mass per volume okay so let's do some calculations here we got there we have a rectangular prism and we know that it is it is 30 by 50 by 40 so the the volume is going to be the area of one of the faces times the depth so we're gonna have 30 times 40 times 50 okay well 30 times 40 that's gonna be 12 twelve hundred and then 1,200 times fifty twelve times twelve times five is is 16 and then we're gonna have 1200 s two zeros and fifty has one so one two three more zeros so the volume for this prism is 60,000 cubic centimeters okay and we know the density is two point eight grams per cubic centimeter so we know that the mass is going to be the density times the volume so we have two point eight times times 60,000 images that on my calculator here so we have sixty sixty thousand times two point eight two point eight that is going to be 168 168,000 thousand grams sixty-eight thousand grams and that would be d all right sixteen number of adults contracting colds the table shows the results of a research study that investigated the therapeutic value of vitamin C in preventing colds a random sample of three hundred adults received either a vitamin C pill or sugar pill each during a two-week period and the adults reported whether they contracted a cold during during that time period what proportion of adults who received a sugar pill reported contracting a cold all right so we're only looking at a subsection of the sample we're only looking at adults those who received adults who received a sugar pill okay so then we're only looking in this this row of the table and of that who reported who reported contracting cold well 33 reported contracting a cold so it's gonna be 33 out of the total that received the sugar pill or 150 out of the 150 okay well I know I can divide both of those by 3 so 33 divided by 3 is 11 150 divided by 3 is 50 so 11 50th BB 17 ages of 20 students enrolled in a college class the table above shows the distribution of ages of the 20 students enrolled in a college class which of the following gives the correct order of the mean median and mode of the ages okay so the ages are already listed out in in order from least to greatest so I'm going to I think I want to calculate the median first so let's see we've got 20 students and we need to count in or going to be the middle of that is going to be the medians or it's gonna be 20 plus 1 divided by divided by 2 I find the average and that's gonna be 21 divided by 2 is 11 25 okay so the median is going to fall in between the 11th and the 12th data point okay so let's count in that that many let's find the 11th and the 12th so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then we have 7 8 9 10 11 okay so the 11.5 is gonna fall in between this mark the 19 and 20 age range so the median for this is going to be median is going to be nineteen point five the mode well the mode is pretty easy that we it's all in the book and look at the frequency table we see that 18 is the mode that happens the most often and the mean is going to be the average well the average is the sum divided by how many there are and there are 20 okay so let's pull up a calculator here so we're gonna have 18 times 6 there there are 6 and that in that that category so 18 times 6 plus 19 times 5 19 times 5 plus 20 times 4 Plus 21 times 2 times 2 plus 22 plus 23 plus 30 okay that's a total of 400 400 and we know there are 20 individuals or 20 students so we see that the mean is going to be 400 divided by 20 well that's just 20 so we see that the the the greatest is or the smallest is going to be the mode followed by the median and then followed by the mean that's gonna be a mon mode median mean 18 figure below shows the relationship between the percent of leaf litter mass remaining after decomp decomposing for three years and the mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius in a teen force in Canada a line of best fit is also shown okay so as the temperature goes up the mass the leaf litter mass remaining goes down all right a particular forest in Canada whose data is not included in the figure had a mean annual temperature of negative two Celsius degrees Celsius based on the line of best fit which of the following is closest to the predicted percent of leaf litter mass remaining in this particular forest after decomposing for three years okay so we want to find on the x-axis we want to find negative two degrees Celsius and it's gonna be approximately right about there and we go straight up to our graph and we'll see that oh it's gonna be about 70 percent approximately 70 percent will be remaining 19 the range of the polynomial function f is the set of real numbers less than or equal to 4 if the zeros are F of F our negative 3 & 1 which of the following could be the graph of f of y equals f of X okay so we have two zeros okay two zeros okay I can write right away I can I can rule out D because there are three zeros in that one and we know that y the output the value of the function has to be less than less than or equal to four so we're going to rule out C because this is this is greater than four going up yeah all right so take a look at a and B and the x intercept out at four so they both have a maximum value of four and so when you look at the x-intercepts the x-intercepts are negative three and one well that would work for a but it would not work for B B we have an intercept we have an intercept at negative one and three so B is not our solution a for 1920 the average annual energy cost for a certain home is four thousand three hundred thirty four dollars the homeowner plans to spend twenty five thousand dollars to install a geothermal heating system the homeowner estimates that the average annual energy cost will then be two thousand seven hundred twelve dollars which of the following qualities can be solved to find T the number of years after installation at which the total amount of energy cost savings will exceed the initial cost okay so the the initial cost is the initial cost is twenty-five thousand and we want to exceed that so we're going to be greater than twenty five thousand and [Music] the homeowner estimates that we have an annual so our annual energy consumption is four thousand three hundred thirty-four and after the installation it will be 2714 so the amount saved would be the difference in those two so we'd have the difference and those would be four thousand three hundred thirty four minus the new cost the new expense 2712 and that's how much you save per year right and then we want multiply that times the number of years to figure out when will that savings exceed twenty five thousand all right well it looks like a is is the has inequality backwards and but B B is what we were what we were looking for excellent number 21 between 1985 and 2003 data were collected every three years on the amount of plastic produced annually in the United States and billions of pounds the graph below shows the data and the line of best fit the equation of the line of best fit is y equals three point three nine X plus forty six point eight nine where X is the number of years since 1985 and Y is the amount of plastic produced annually in billions of pounds okay so that means that every year so for instance in 1985 the United States must have produced this much this many billion pounds of plastic which since we have our equation in slope-intercept form we can see that in 1985 we produce 46 point eight nine billion pounds of plastic we can keep going along this graph and we see that in three years after 1985 we produced a little under 60 billion 60 billion pounds of plastic all right so let's see which of the following best is the best interpretation of three point nine in the context of the problem okay so 3.9 y equals MX plus B three point nine is the rate of change and since this is billion this is billions of pounds of plastic produced per year what this is telling us is that every year we increase the number the amount of plastic we produce we increase the amount of PLAs will be produced by three point three nine billion pounds alright let's look at these answers a the amount of plastic and billions of pounds produced in the United States during the year eighteen or nineteen eighty-five no clearly not we produced you produced that much which actually happens to be happens to be forty six point eight nine billion pounds in one year all right be the number of years it took the United States to produce 1 billion pounds of plastic again no that doesn't fit with that doesn't fit with the graph alright see the average annual plastic production in billions of pounds in the United States from two from 1985 to 2003 well clearly that's not the case because the plastic production in 1985 in 1985 was was forty six point eight nine billion and the app the plastic production increased every M that continued to increase to over in eighteen years after 1985 the production is over over 100 billion pounds of plastic per year so three point nine is is not the average production of plastic D the average annual increase in billions of pounds of plastic produced per year in the United States from 85 to 2003 yes right that's the average increase this that's the slope of the graph rise over run all right and since we're talking this graph is showing us the annual average production of plastic D and B our solution number 22 okay it's the same setup is 21 question is which of the following is closest to the percent increase in billions of pounds of plastic produced in the United States from 2000 to 2003 well mm that was that's 15 years after 1985 and then 2003 must be 18 years after 1985 so let's look at the graph let's just get an idea of what we're dealing with here 15 and B right here so found be right there 18 right there right straight up from from the 18 okay so this looks like it maybe it's just slightly under that looks like it's 99 in 2000 on them in 2000 I'm sorry 2003 it looks like maybe it's 108 108 okay so that would be an increase of 9 that would be an increase of 9 billion pounds of plastic well we're saying relative to 2000 well 2000 was approximately 99 billion okay so then 9 divided by 99 that's going to be well 1 that's 1 xi 1 xi okay as a percent that's gonna be pretty darn close to 1/10 and since there's such a big gap in between these values 10 and 40% they clearly did not increase by 40% 40% increase would be you know go from a hundred to 140 yeah that'd be up here somewhere that did not did not increase that fast so 10% is ours 23 M equals 18 hundred times one point zero two to the T the equation above models the number of numbers M of a gym t years after the gym opens of the following which equation models the number of members of the gym q quarters after the gym opens quarters there are four quarters in the year you know so if you wanted if you wanted to convert from quarters to years you would have to divide the quarters by four so if you wanted if you wanted t t2 equal save one well you would have to end it was this would be one year but one year is four quarters four quarters divided by four that would give you the one well this is quarters divided by 4 will give you the number of years if it's two quarters two quarters divided by four that's point five point five years okay so we want to divide the number of quarters by four and it looks like the only equation does that is a 24 for the finale of a TV show viewers could use either social media or a text message to vote for their favorite two contestants the contestants receiving more than 50% of the vote won the estimated 10% of viewers voted and 30 percent of the voters votes were cast in social media contestant contestant 2 contestant 2 and 70% of the votes cast on social media and 40% of the votes cast using a text message based on this information which of the following is an accurate conclusion all right well let's think about this it doesn't matter how many voted right because the person who wins is the person that won't got the most votes of those who voted so this 10% I don't think that's really gonna matter much what we see that 30% of votes were cast in social media and contestant 2 got 70% of those so they got 30% or cast in social medias this is contestant number number 2 and of of those of that 30% the contestant 2 got 70% okay so that would be be point 2 1 or 21% so they got 21% of the of the vote in social from the vote in social media that they won was 20% 21% of the total who voted all right and if you can only vote in one of two ways if three percent voted on social media then while 70% must have voted on text message and they says that they won they got 40% of the votes on text message that's going to be point two eight percent or twenty one twenty one percent and twenty eight percent of the votes total so they won eight or they earned total of 49% of the vote so they did not they did not get the the did not win so contestant one must have won this this vote so let's look at the answers a if all viewers had voted the contestant two would have would have won no no we just said that it doesn't matter how many voted for one and four - they got 49 percent of the votes of the people who had voted B viewers voting by social media or likely to be younger than viewers voting by text message can't really tell that at all there's not that information was not given see if all viewers who voted by who had voted by social media instead of by text message if all viewers who voted had voted by social media instead of by text message contestant 2 would have won ah no just because he won that or he or she won more of the social media vote doesn't necessarily mean that if more people had voted on social media they would have that if that percentage would have kept so he say C is not the answer and D viewers voting by social media were more likely to prefer contestants to than where viewers voting by text message yeah it said that the they got 70% of the vote on social media but only 40% of the vote on text message so D is our answer 25 population of Greenleaf Idaho the table above shows the population of Greenleaf Idaho from years 2000 and 2010 if the relationship between the population and year is linear this comes up a lot if it's linear which of the following functions P models the population of green leaf tea years after 2000 okay so let's think okay so we got y equals MX plus B this comes up a lot rate changes M starting value is B all right now the starting value is since we're going from 2000-2010 starting value is 862 and 862 shows up as a constant in all of our answers so that's not gonna help us now we need to think about the rate of change the rate of change is just change in the output that's the population divided by change in the year our input okay well change in the output is 846 - 862 and change in the year is 2010 - mm okay so I'm going to plug that into calculator just just because I second-guess myself alright so we've got negative 16 over well it's gonna be 10 okay so that's gonna be negative 1.6 looks like the population is decreasing okay buy 1.6 / 1.6 per year okay so we've got our starting value we've got our rate of change so let's see which one works well the first one first one has the correct starting value and the correct rate of change the second equation has a rate of change much greater negative 16 so that's not gonna work and then the following two well this one looks like it could because it has to has that negative 1.6 in it but when you distribute that it this this negative 2000 is gonna mess with our starting value so D is not correct a is our answer 26 to determine the mean number of children per household in a community Tabitha surveyed 20 families at a playground for the 20 families surveyed the mean number of children per household was 2.4 ok which of the following statements must must be true ok so that's that's gonna be a significant significant word here okay the mean number of children per household and the community is 2.4 know this this the only surveyed families at the playground so the sample is biased that's gonna it's gonna skew towards more children there are many households that don't have any children that would bring the the mean number down be a determination about the mean number of children per household in the community should not be made because the sample size is too small well yeah that's one reason it's a small sample size but there are other reasons as well so that might be our best answer so far but we're going to continue and see what these other ones are the sampling method is flawed and may produce a biased estimate in the mean number of children per household in the community yes that is true ok d the sampling method is not flawed ok I'm not gonna stop right there definitely flawed all right C is our answer 27 the XY plane in the XY plane the point P R lies on the line with equation y equals x plus B where B is a constant the point with coordinates to p5 are lies on the same line with equation lies on the line with equation 2x plus y equals 2x plus B if P does not equal 0 what is the value of R divided by P okay so we know that if if this if this point lies on this line then we can substitute the Y and the X with R and P so we have R equals P plus B ok and if this point lies on this line then we know we can substitute those about x and y values in this case we have five our for Y and X is 2 P plus B alright so we want to figure out what the R on P equals ok now I'm going to simplify my second equation and I'm gonna get five R equals 4p plus B I really think that we should be eliminating our be ok because I suspect that we're gonna need to isolate the R and P and then the other side of the equation will equal will equal some some value ok so to isolate the B I'm gonna subtract P from both sides so B equals R minus P all right well I can substitute that into my second equation here and I will get five R equals 4p plus R minus P ok give myself some room up here so I'm gonna I'm going to combine like terms I'm gonna get five are equals that's gonna be three P plus R okay if I can get R and P so I'm gonna subtract R from both sides I will get four R equals three P and I know I want to have P in the denominator so I'm going to divide both sides by P get four R divided by P equals three and divide both sides by four let's get a little bit more space here our over P divide both sides by 4 we get 3/4 so our answer is B three-fourths number 28 the 22 students in a health class conducted an experiment in which they each recorded their pulse rates in beats per minute before and after completing a light exercise routine the dot plots below display the results before we have before after let s sub 1 and R sub 1 be the standard deviation and range respectively of the data before exercise and S sub 2 and R sub to be the standard deviation and range respectively of the data after exercise which of the following is true so let's compare the standard deviation well the standard deviation of the first data set is clearly it's clearly less a smaller than the standard deviation of the the second set the data is very has a very tight grouping whereas it's very much spaced out in the the second data set so I can just say right off the bat the standard deviations are not equal are not equal and in fact what else could I say well yeah okay so I could definitely say that s is less than the standard deviation in the first is less than the standard deviation in a second let's keep going the standard deviation the first is greater no standard deviation the first is not equal to yeah we can say that okay so we have two possible answers so far all right well now let's look at the range the range of the first data set is going to be 88 minus 56 so that's going to be 32 the range of the second data set is going to be 112 minus 80 okay well that's oh that's also 32 so we know the range is equal on both so our answer must be t29 a photocopy machine is initially loaded with 50 with 5000 sheets of paper the machine starts a large job and copies at a constant rate after 20 minutes it has used 30 percent of the paper which of the following equations models the number of sheets of paper P remaining in the machine in minutes after the Machine started printing okay so key here is keyword constant rate constant rate we are not dealing with an exponential equation and not dealing with either of these so we want to think about our friendly equation y equals MX plus B okay well we got our we got our be our starting value both of our equations have that so we're just trying to find the rate of change so after 20 minutes it has used 30% of the paper well would it what is 30% of 5,000 5,000 times 0.3 or or better yet 5,000 times 3/10 okay well that's going to be I can divide top and bottom by 10 we'll get 3 over 10 or 3 over 1 and then 3 times 500 is 1500 so if it uses 1,500 sheets in 20 minutes what is the rate of change well that's an in use 1,500 sheets and 20 minutes well that's gonna be 75 so it uses 75 sheets per minute okay so our answer is B 30 the complete graph of the function f and table of values of the function G are shown above the maximum value of f is K what is the value of G of K maximum value of F maximum value of F is K okay well that's three what is G of three well G of three is you have an input of three into G and you get out a six 31 there are two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen in one molecule of water how many atoms of hydrogen are there in 51 molecules of water well there are there are how many atoms of hydrogen so there are two atoms of hydrogen in one molecule of water there are there are two per one molecule of water and we know we have 51 molecules of water therefore we're going to have a hundred and two atoms of atoms of hydrogen 32 if x equals 1 in the equation above what is the value of ay all right so we just have direct substitution we're just gonna put in 1 for X 1/2 a equals 0 I'm going to add 1/2 a to both sides okay well to undo this 1/2 I just need to multiply by the reciprocal which is 2 on both sides so I get 2 equals a 33 if the XY in the XY plane in the equation X plus 2y equals 10 and 3x plus 6y equals C represent the same line for some constant C what is the value of C okay represent the same line okay there's some value C okay so we we just need to get these in the same form so if the left side of both equations was the same right now the left sides are not the same so the constants are not the same but 3x plus 6y you'll see I can see that if I multiply this first equation by 3 well then I would get I would get 3x plus 6y equals 30 okay well 30 30 so the left sides are now the same therefore C must be 30 34 on April 18 1775 Paul Revere's set off on his midnight ride from Charlestown to Lexington if he had ridden straight to Lexington without stopping he would have traveled 11 miles in 26 minutes in such a ride what would the average speed of his horse have been to the nearest tenth of a mile per per hour they underlined that because they they set this up where it's in miles per minutes and then we need to convert that into hours so we have 11 miles in 26 minutes so let's see and we want to know how many miles sorry 11 miles in 26 minutes 1 how many miles in 60 minutes okay so proportion to solve here we cross multiply and we'll get 66 666 666 X divided by 26 by 26 so I'm gonna see him do that on a calculator so I've 660 divided by 26 I get to five point three eight four but we're rounding this to the tense and that would be twenty five point four miles per hour thirty five the graph of the function f defined by f of x equals negative 1/2 quantity X minus four squared plus ten is shown in the XY plane above if the graph if the function G not shown is defined by G of x equals negative x plus ten what is one possible value of ay such that F of a equals f of G okay so we just want to know C we want to know where the functions are equal so that's gonna be just gonna be negative 1/2 X minus 4 squared plus 10 equals negative x plus 10 okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to subtract 10 from both sides it's gonna cancel those out and then I will multiply both sides by negative 2 and I'll get X minus 4 squared equals 2x all right so I'll expand the left and get x squared - it's gonna be minus 8x plus 16 equals 2x and then subtract 2x from both sides I get x squared minus 10x plus 16 equals 0 okay so from this point it's pretty easy to factor this my is my a is 1 so I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to C and add to add to B okay well that's going to be in this case it looks like it's going to be negative 8 and negative negative 8 and negative 2 all right 2 negatives multiplied to a positive to a negative all right so we have an X solution of positive 8 and we have a solution of positive to either one of those values will work number 36 and the triangle rst above point W not shown lies on Rt what is the value of cosine angle RSW minus sine angle wst okay so let's set this up got a point somewhere here on our t and we have an r SW r SW is gonna be our s W that's gonna be that angle and we have another angle WS t what's gonna be that angle well we can see that these two angles add up to our W plus angle WS T equal 90 degrees so they're complementary and if we can see that if we do a little sketch here this is a B and C a bit lower a lower B and lower C sine of B is gonna be opposite over hypotenuse which is going to be B over C and cosine of a it's gonna be adjacent over hypotenuse which is B over C and we know that a and B are complement complementary therefore the sine and cosine of complementary angles are going to be equal so what we're doing here is we're taking these this is going to equal let's say X well sign of its complement is also going to equal x so if you subtract X from X the answer is 0 all right 37 and 38 we have a table and we have a graph when a patient receives a penicillin injection the kidneys begin removing the penicillin from the body the table and graph above show the penicillin concentration in a patient's bloodstream at five-minute intervals for the 20 minute 20 minutes immediately following a one time penicillin injection all right so on the next slides will I'll bring these up back up okay 37 according to the table how many more micrograms the penicillin are present in 10 milliliters of blood drawn from the patient five minutes after injection then than are present in eight milliliters of blood drawn ten minutes after injection well five minutes after injection there are good pen five minutes after injection there are 500 there are 152 micrograms per milliliter and if you have 10 milliliters well then there will be there will be at that we'll call it a the first the first case there will be 10 milliliters times 152 mm micrograms per milliliter it's gonna be a total of 1,500 20 micrograms now at 10 minutes at 10 minutes we have this be 10 minutes we have eight milliliters about the concentration at ten minutes is 118 118 okay so that's gonna be eight times 118 for six it's gonna be 14 nine four okay and we want to know how much more there are at the at the five-minute 5-minute interval and ten milliliters well that's gonna be 1520 - my four four okay so we have it's gonna be 14 it's gonna be 11 and that's gonna be 10 6 7 and 5 so we have 576 more micrograms it's 38 of the penicillin concentration in micrograms per milliliter and the participant a patient's bloodstream T minutes after the penicillin injection is modeled by the function P divided by P of T equals 200 B raised to the T on 5 if P approximates the value the values in the table - within 10 micrograms per milliliter what is the value of B rounded to the nearest tenth okay so all right so let's see let's take some input and outputs here so if we I'm gonna first I'm gonna take the first I'm gonna take this guy right here it's a five this point this is a data point 5 comma 125 or 150 - and I know that the output then is 152 when the input is 5 or that would be 5 over 5 which is 1 okay well then B which is B - B to the 1 is just be some divide both sides by 200 and I will get that B equals 152 divided by 200 0.76 equals equals B okay now if we're rounding to the nearest tenth alright that's actually going to be want to bump that up to 0.8 or 8/10", "yB0zLPwDO9k": "what's up everybody welcome back to the good view Woodworks channel my name is Nathan and today in this video we're gonna go over the number one epoxy hack to show you how to estimate all the epoxy that you need for your next project check it out [Music] alright guys so from almost the beginning of this channel you guys have been asking me Nathan how do i guesstimate how much epoxy I need Nathan how much epoxy does it take to fill up this mold how do you do that well today I'm gonna show you check this out so I have a piece of pecan here that I've already ripped down on my bandsaw as you can see here so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna show you step-by-step how to guesstimate how much epoxy you need to fill a river step 1 you need to set the outside dimensions of your table or clock or art project or whatever you're using to fill the void using casting epoxy or whatever project you're making [Music] okay now that you have your pieces set up the way that you want them what we're going to do is we are going to measure the width across which is 17 inches and we're gonna measure the length of our table let's see see the longest part here let's go 26 and 1/4 okay let's write that down [Music] okay so now that we have our table set up or your project set up we want to know how much epoxy will it take to fill the void in your project to measure the widest point of your River or void or whatever you're gonna fill with epoxy okay okay so out of this whole piece we're gonna stop right here and we're gonna measure this part right here which is the widest point of the river and that is about four inches okay so we're gonna write that down four inches is the widest part of that River [Music] since our project has a really weird shape to the void we're going to break it up in two sections we're going to measure to this point right here and then we will calculate this space right here all right so let's get the measurement here it's about 20 and a half inches so we're gonna do 20 point 5 times 4 times the thickness of our board one in three-quarter inches go ahead and multiply those three numbers together and you will get a cubic inch value after you have that value go ahead and mark it down and we'll move on to the next step okay after multiplying those three numbers together we got one forty three point five inches so the next step measure that weird shape on the end and what I like to do is just make everything into a rectangle because if even if you have just a little bit more epoxy left over it's better to have too much than too little so we already have the 17 inches from before and we already have the thickness which is an inch and 3/4 so what we're gonna do for the third number is we're going to measure from here to the end of our board from here to here so what you can do is grab a straight edge whatever you'd like to use in my case I'm gonna grab an old coca-cola box we're gonna set it right there up to it let's measure so it looks like we are just about at six inches so let's write down our three numbers six inches long by 17 inches tall by one and three-quarter inches thick so we'll multiply those together 178 point six five it's cubic inches okay now we're going to take our two numbers we're going to add those together one forty three point five plus one seventy eight point five gives us three hundred and twenty-two cubic inches okay now that we have the cubic inch number that we need what we have to do is convert cubic inches into gallons and this will work with whatever system you're using whether it's metric or US standard or imperial people like to call it but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use Google will to take my cubic inch number and turn it into gallons so we're gonna see how many gallons it's gonna take to fill this river are you ready okay I'm not sure if you guys can see this but we're gonna take our volume and we're gonna type in 322 cubic inches and that is gonna give us one point three nine gallons all right guys it is as simple as that I know it may take a little bit for you guys to understand that but just watch this video over and over so you can get the hang of it the cool thing is is that this piece right here is only gonna take one of stone Koch countertops super cast kit because in the kit it is a one and a half gallon kit 1.5 gallons and this came out to just a hair under that so to do a project this size it will take only one kit guys I hope you really enjoyed this video I hope that you learned a lot do me a favor if you like this video

"SMd8YUkEw1k": "[Music] [Music] straight hull design tapered hull design Eurotrash federal American your PIN what's it all mean guys this isn't rocket science if you want to load shells it's easier than you think don't let the media don't let the gum boards and the so-called gurus intimidate you into not loading but you know what we can't really discuss that out here I'm gonna take you guys back to the bunkhouse and we're gonna go over with some diagrams like a Reading Rainbow of reloading come on what you see in front of you is a thora of watts but guess what you really don't need all these wads basically holes come in two basic shapes you've got what's known as your straight wide hole and you can see we took this federal promo and we cut it in half so you can see see the case right in here has all that extra room that's called straight wide and a lot of the Federals are made like that and a lot of the Eurotrash are made like that if not all the next wads aren't known as the taper wads and you can see here why taper hole do you see the difference in the thickness here and that kind of comes down and compresses right in here and this is a gun club compare it to the federal up there yeah you're getting the point now what you need to do is find a wad which fits these holes as close as you can now one thing about these is you can use a wad that belongs here and put it in here and you probably would have no problem but if you use a wand that belongs in a taper hole in a straight hole you're gonna lose a lot of that energy from the powder burning and efficiency so what is there to do oh this is a good chance for you guys take a look as you can see a one-piece Hall you see it's all plastic one piece of plastic extruded with just a base on it see that compared to how they make these is just a cheap shell and they put the look at that's the paper compressed paper so when you guys are talking about shooting your wads out no they're not being dirty they're telling you the truth these come loose and they shoot out creating a bore obstruction but I've yet to experience that and hopefully never will the easiest way to determine which wads fit into what hole right is to grab your hole that you're using and cut the base right off see this alright this is an STS hole this is a double a hole hard to believe but yeah it's doubly hole cut close to the bottom you can see right there alright you see this is the base this is the top cut it right up and you can see inside whoa there's the taper do you see that is the one we did a bunch of firing I think 11 or 12 firings on it's smaller here to fit into here you see that how that fits nice yes right and you'll see taper see how that fits down in there very nice you know gaps for powder and gas to escape from you cut the hole that you're gonna be using right and then you take your wad he's gonna weigh you your wad and you insert it in the hull and you see just how much of a gap if any you'll see around here see that very very nice tight no issues with this whatsoever when you shoot them now if you take and you put this same wad and say a Fiocchi Fiocchi we've been over this already and you put it in do the same test look at the looseness oh man look at the sloppy fit we've got you see that so take the hole as you're loading look at once you just slide right out not good for accuracy no note now check these guys out these are a clone for a straight walk very nice by the way now whoa look at that that's a tight fit do you see that no space so when the gas is act upon this powder cup there's gonna be nowhere for the gases to escape and you'll get full velocity the way was designed let's check out a Eurotrash Eurotrash same thing this is whoa that's beautiful look at that oh if you can call them beautiful put them in there and look now this hull is a federal see that now you see how you've got a little bit of space right there that's not good so that's why the rule is not hard and fast now oh look we've got a figure eight but these figure eights are made for straight wall put this guy in and look at that holy count you've get you got a nice tight fit huh funny innit so best advice I could give you guys is cut a hole in half grab a couple of them look at that nice tight fit now let's try the figure eight clones for the taper hull in a straight straight hole and look at that you can see do you see how much loose space there is right there how jiggles around like that that's not good one more hole okay here's the grand alright and we'll try it with a taper hole design stick this guy in and you can kind of see look at that holy calendar all the slop in that look at that there's too much slop too much slop that isn't good that's not good for accuracy that isn't good for anybody you see that what nope that's like we said before people look at that nice tight fit man it's a thing of beauty so do not be scared there's a ton of holes I know it looks overwhelming but basically for the imports Eurotrash use the federal or the federal clones you see that this is federal this is the federal clone holy cow they almost look identical don't they except this is one in one quarter this is one ounce well you can see the cup on the shot couple it is lower over here but still performance is excellent nice deep gas cup let's see that so straight wad go with this design tapered go with this design this is the double-a design this is a clone for your double-a oh here's where the rules get muddy this one is a clone but it's a clone for the straight ball and actually this was designed specifically with the federal gold medals in mind now this is tall nothing to worry about is the height see how tall that is and look how short that is compared to look how short that is so bulk your powder in here won't do which is why I load these with 800 X bulk your powder in here excellent bulk your powder in here excellent bulk your powder in here figure-eight excellent and you can see why leaves a lot more room see when I tell you simple straightforward it's easy you can do this you know you can do this don't let people tell you you can do it don't be intimidating and not wanting to do it just because you don't think you have the information I just broke it down we just broke it down for you get out there do your shooting questions comments concerns you guys

maybe you are missing one or two problems you want to check your work you want to see what you need to work on maybe you forgot a certain strategy so this is the perfect time for that so some of the problems are already done and I just want to show you my work and work some with you so let's look at the first part of this problem this problem is about having a glass picture and it's filled with water running of the water is poured equally in two glasses - two glasses so here's my model to just show my thinking I drew a tape diagram to show the eight and then I divided that into two to represent the two glasses and my answer was one sixth of the water 1/6 of the water is in each glass okay moving on so if each has three fluid ounces of the water inning how many fluid ounces of water were in the full picture so I underlined the three fluid ounces of the water and also the total amount of the picture so I had to go back to the previous problem I knew there was 16 so I had to multiply three fluid ounces times 16 which gave me 48 ounces the full picture had 48 ounces okay so now here's the next problem and this one was the most difficult out of the three okay if one fourth of the remaining water is poured out of the picture to water a plant how many cups of water are left in the picture so the first thing you had to do boys and girls make sure that you drew your 8 parts to represent the picture then I highlighted this year just to let me know oh wait I can't count this as the remaining on water because this was already used and I said right so in this used we use two sixteenths right - 16 equals 1/8 so I knew that in each one 16 there was three ounces so I said three plus three because there's two sixteenths is gonna give me a six so I was able to label each part of my tape diagram as six ounces okay next I knew here 48 ounces this was the remaining so I knew that was 6 6 plus 42 is gonna give me my 48 ounces so there's 6 ounces that were used 42 remaining so then I now look at this remaining part here and I said if one-fourth of the remaining so what is one-fourth of the remaining which was 48 and I put it over 8 because there are 8 ounces in one cup do you see this so I know there's 1 cup 1 cup has 8 ounces and then I divided how many Ounces are in I didn't find out how many cups were equal to 48 so I divide it 48 by 8 and gave me 6 so I know that from this point to here there are 6 cups okay so now I need to put 48 over 8 cuz this is showing me how many cups there are in the houses so 1/4 x 42 over 8 is going to give me 42 over 32 that was the part that was used okay so I really know that this is the part that they used so if I already know what was used and the total amount of this is the remaining which will give me I'm gonna write 42 over 8 May because this is what is remaining and this was what was used this is the 1/4 I have to subtract but now I notice sorry but now I noticed that my denominators are not the same and I need to make equivalent fractions so I'm just gonna multiply this fraction by 4 over 4 right so that I can have equivalent fractions so I'm going to rewrite it here this becomes 1/4 times 42 is going to give me 168 over 4 times 8 is going give me 32 - 42 over 30 - okay that's the same thing now now I can subtract right because I have the same denominators so when I subtract 168 and 42 I get 126 over 32 okay and quickly I notice that this fraction is greater than one okay we had to divide and then I got three thirty two goes into a hundred and twenty-six three times with that becomes a remainder of 3 that's 94 so his dream and my denominator dirty sorry I'm remainder of 30 over 32 I quickly noticed that both 30 and 32 are multiples of 2 so I can divide both numerator and denominator by 2 which will give me an M right here 3 and 15/16 okay so now dirty I'm sorry 350 1516 cups are left in picture a real picture okay so this like I said this one was the most trickiest it had a lot of steps you had to convert ounces to cups you had to look at what was used what was remaining from that remaining you had to look at what was one-fourth of that total in order to subtract from the whole that was remaining to get your answer okay we had to rename fractions we had to look for common denominators there was a lot of steps in this problem boys and girls so if you didn't get a chance to do it just pause it for a minute and make sure that you have this work okay let's continue what situation could the expression 1/4 / 3 represent so this is just like elimination nation when we were eliminating multiple-choice questions when we were getting ready for the state test we have to kind of go through all of them all right so let's start with a 1/4 from the packet of pencils shared equally among three friends that sounds about right this this equation could definitely be supported by this multiple choice so I just kind of put a little star for now so let me know that this is a possible answer the number of 1/4 cup serving in 3 cups of popcorn the number of 1/4 cup servings no one for this is not it because it's kind of saying there's three cups and one for from that 1/4 of the stadium split into four equal parts I know that's definitely not it because in this problem there is no 4 so that says wrong and a 4 foot long rope cut its a 1/3 because again we're looking at this fraction of 1/4 and not 1/3 okay so now I go back to this number 8 so I'm thinking 1/4 of a packet so I'm thinking of just 1/4 of this packet and then shared by three friends right because this is all that's left and they're sharing it together so yeah if you got a you're right okay awesome okay let's go to the next problem here mrs. silver bought three mini cakes for her birthday she cuts each cake into quarters and plans to serve each guests one quarter of the cake how many guests can she serve with all her cakes okay so now again let me draw this model so here's one mini cake and I'm just gonna put empty [Music] here's the second mini cake the third many cake okay so now so I did this part she cuts each cake into quarters and plans to serve one quarter of cake Bert yes okay and then I need to find out how many guests that she this is the question I need to answer how many guests can she serve so here's my first cake I use another pen and this is the quarter so I know the quarters are four because it takes four quarters to make a whole right a whole dollar so here's one two three four one two three one two three four and you see how I make my partitions that I count them because I just want to make sure that I have the parts that people that are represented in this problem right so now here my my three mini cakes I cut them in quarters and fours now I need to find out how many guests can she serve with all her cakes so here's one piece to piece 3/4 so I know if this is for a night ee it's gonna give me 8 if I double it again well not double but I add another 4 that's gonna be 12 so she can serve how many she can serve 12 yes with cakes okay if you got that one right check it off all right now we gave you two of these problems hopefully you got these right let's check them okay so 1/6 divided by 5 so the first thing I do is I rewrite this one 6 divided by 5 over 1 I like to see my fractions right I make this 5 this whole 5 a fraction by adding a fraction bar and a 1 1 6 now I change my operation so multiplication and I flip my second fraction and I got one over third ok make sure you got this right and then the second fraction here is 7 over 1 again this is a whole number and order for you to make this a whole number you just add a fraction bar and add a 1 as your denominator to find it by 1/4 so I know right away that I have to change my operation from division to multiplication I flip this second fraction and now I multiply across 7 times 4 is 28 over 101 times 1 is 1 this numerator is greater so that means I have to say how many times does one go into 28 goals in 28 times and that's my final answer all right boys and girls this is it for today tomorrow we'll have another lesson you should be logging into I ready and finishing some lessons have a good day and see", "9QI6Qn9uZss": "hey there welcome back and thanks for joining me all my supplies and equipment are down in the description box below and they have links so check that out if you'd like this video hit that subscribe button and if you want to be notified when new videos come out hit that notification bell and remember to give me a thumbs up that lets me know that you're enjoying the videos and questions and comments are welcomed all right these are the colors i think i'm using there these are the ones i've i might grab some more but you know if they do i'll i'll try to remember rhyme down so let's go um i've had a lot of questions here lately about what's in my little bottle alcohol it's either 91 or 99 depending on what i got um isopropyl alcohol so that is what's in this and i do fail to say that so what i'm want to do i'm back and forth on do i want a background or do i just want white i think the background will help me a little bit so i'm going to do this now what i'm going to do is blue and green i want it very very very very light so i'm going to try to do that so i'm going to put quite a bit of alcohol here and i'm going to put only i think a couple of drops one and two now what would be a lot easier in this case is to go ahead and have this mixed up in one of these bottles and to load it down with alcohol um i have a lot of these i just don't know what colors they are so i need to redo all my stuff like that so i'm gonna swirl this around and try to keep it somewhat in a framed but you know every time i say that i don't so maybe quit saying that [Applause] god all right so there's that um now where's my moss we'll do the same thing with that i'm only going to do one drop because that two was just too much so okay so the top's gonna have some movement in it that's fine i'm gonna go ahead and put it on the bottom two then oh i do not like the fingers i usually get those when i don't have enough alcohol down and i'm just trying to make do that's usually when they show up okay i need to move on i've spent enough time on that background and i didn't get what i originally went for so that's just the way it is sometimes but this is fine i think it'll be fine i just i didn't want the background to be a huge part of it okay um think think think think okay i was going to do and i've got this smaller shot glass i think that'll be okay or do i want to use one of these no i'm going to use this because i'm only going to put a few maybe maybe five you know me in numbers um so what i'm gonna do is put down a little bit of alcohol and i'm going to do maybe a little bit of it one color and put another drop of another color and just see what they do i'm not going to mix them unless i see that it's not doing great and then i'll i'll do something okay flamingo and some bright yellow and some alcohol shot glass i'll do one here um put that down have your blow dryer ready because you're gonna need it yeah i didn't plan on doing that but it seemed like a fun thing to do let's see how that mixes [Applause] because remember when you dry the alcohol that's run out from underneath the glass the inside's still wet you can still blow it around a little bit and you've got enough of a barrier that oh no no no no don't do that um you can blow it around i didn't want it getting outside i wanted really really nice rounds so you know i'm i had wondered before if i could put some more pieces of paper towel underneath and make it to where i could push it down harder and it would kind of seal up a little bit better okay pull that off yeah so we're gonna have to doctor this up a little bit i'm still okay with it i just not kind of what i was wanting because i didn't want that but let's try it let's try what we had said about putting the extra down and see what that does it may or may not okay if it works it's fabulous if it doesn't we're no better we're no worse off all right i think probably the small ones would have been really cute but i've already started and i want all them the same so we'll just do this right there this time i think i'm going to do some purple these are bubbles but we're going to do leaf like things to maybe indicate that they might be flowers but they're still bubbles and just have fun with it no it's not doing it oh it's coming out good gum so either one i used too much alcohol which i didn't think i did i mean it is running to the outside like nobody's business all right i'm gonna do this i'm losing i'm losing my battle okay at this point i really do want to toss it but i'm not gonna because you just never know but i am disappointed okay keep going um i'm doing here a little bit quit running there we go all right let's see what this does i did put less alcohol and it's still running out geez so maybe the paper towels aren't a great idea in my head it worked out perfect [Applause] okay yeah all right now i'm gonna kind of let's just take that out do one here what colors do i want to do pink and yellow again of course i splatted of course why not i tell you this painting thing is ups and downs one minute you do something fabulous and you're like yep i have arrived and the next time that painting humbles you down to i need to take some beginner courses it's just amazing the uh the the difference in what these paintings do but that's all right we we know enough skills and that is where i'm like learn skills learn techniques we know enough to pull us out of this and that's what we're going to do we're going to pull out this but definitely learn your techniques because had i done this two months after i started out it'd little bit in the floor thrown away but now i'm like i've got so many things under my belt that i can usually pull it out or at least play enough to play and learn [Music] and that's that's what we want to do this i i don't know if i want to bother that or not but um okay and we'll do another one over here um i'm gonna do purple and pink should i yes i should do purple pink it's a little bit there a little bit there yeah this is this is getting messy [Applause] so [Applause] i want to fill up this white so when i put my own white in it it won't [Applause] it won't mess with it it won't make it look odd [Applause] and see how just having the shot glass arounds created a perimeter it will run over it but you stand a better of a chance not to okay so let's let's go to the next thing um and we'll leave those alone for a minute i'm a little mad at them um okay so on the acrylic part i'm going to do these two the sap green which matches the moss really well so we'll do some of that and we'll do some blue because those two go together really well i'm going to do i'm going to go back and forth here so i'm going to take my card do a couple i'm going to do some like a straight for the stem a little bit more than that okay i really want them touching but i'm not going to because you know that's neat um okay that's all i'm doing right now what i'm going to do is take a flat brush i so had it just right there what in the world oh there it is okay i'm going to do maybe some grass things i'm not going to worry about doing leaves but i want to do some little grass things and i'm going to do it where i'm holding my brush straight like this and then turn and then come back like that and instead of trying to paint like this do your whole arm it just it's for me it's easier to do something like that um these are now i'm gonna get these dry first okay now we'll get some of that we'll start over here i need some more of this so that was pretty easy and we'll do one this way i don't know this one i can see what i'm doing coming toward me it's a little harder but it may be just an angle i think they're about the same and we'll try one side by side well yeah i do i do want to try one side by side let's do this i'm gonna start out thick that's really bright really bright wow okay i didn't want that right there i like the little bigger blades all right that's all i'm doing okay back to the card um i want to do some just messy like that do yeah i like making it go up into that okay so let's tackle those things so i'm going to have to use some more colors um white no let me think what i'm gonna do yeah white ink where's my white acrylic now if i want them to be white which while we're doing this craziness might as well um i need to spray it let me think if i'm gonna do anything else no okay i'll be back i'm gonna go spray with kmart varnish now hold this if you if i sprayed really close it's going to activate this somehow it will splotch it up and it's no good stay 15 18 inches away you know i just kind of stand there and missed it so try that if you're having trouble with it and i'll be right back okay i am back so i've got it dried and okay let me just i'm gonna do black and i'm gonna do white so i've got my white here uh this is my black bombay i don't know that i want to use bombay we've got that black cinelier cinelyer i never knew how to pronounce that okay so i got that so here's the two all right all right so i'm going to stamp on them with my shot glass um we'll clean it off real quick and then i wanna i think i want to um shadow it with black okay that's clean i need a bigger piece of paper all right there we go it doesn't have other colors on it okay all right let's do it i don't want it gigantic and stop be wet but i do need something there yeah so we'll do let's see this one i'm gonna put over it now don't be too alarmed when you see it it drawn up it's it's sitting on something that's not accepting it now so now it's going to be a little um beady it's going to beat up a little bit now if you don't mind it being like the color that you're putting it on it kind of pulling some of the purple or yellow then by all means don't spray it and then just put the white over it because it will influence it a little bit and that's a cool look too i just you know made a choice and went with it i kind of want these a little after i said i don't want them dark i do want them dark i definitely want them visible now i'm just going to do the white highlights um like here and that's what i'm talking about it beaten up it's but you know this that's where you make a call and kind of go with it yeah it's easier when you just do it and not try to fix it like i was doing there okay so there's that i didn't want the white to take in all the colors so i sprayed it but now you know it acts differently so i like it i'm fine with it i just want you to be aware that those are the options on it now i'm not sure what to do um i want them to look like bubbles really do so i want this highlight to be a little now once this acrylic has started drying it actually is taking on more acrylic a little bit easier so that seems like a good way to kind of correct that if that's not something you're wanting yeah i'm getting okay with that all right ah you know i just don't know what else i want to do um i could double wipe those but i think i'm going to leave them i really do i think i'm going to leave them and just make them look like they kind of did their thing i do want to splatter of course what i kind of do is want to take some of this yellow and pinks and purples and maybe splatter here not here or at least not right now so i'm going to take that and we'll do something i don't want to do half but i want to do about a little bit cover up a little bit more than half that means what kind of yellow do i have okay i need to add things to my list so no black and then it comes off yellow [Music] pink and purple so we're pulling some of these colors here but very lightly okay so here i don't have this purple i don't know why i thought i ordered it i thought i thought but apparently i do not so i'm going to mix mine some will take the blue that i've been using and believe it or not that hue of blue will pull in that purple so i'm technically still using some of my original colors there's that and i'm going to put this magenta beside it and then i'm going to put magenta over here and then i'm going to do my yellow here we'll mix these two and that blue took over and we'll scoot some over here i'm not going to color all that okay close yeah okay so that's the purple ish so i probably won't use a lot of it yeah it's not showing up much at all so i've got a little bit of it down there okay we'll screw it up just a little and put a little bit but not much like it's fading up into it i just don't want a sharp line that's kind of cute do i want even more um more than having more i would like bigger yeah i like that so i like the bigger ones not a lot of them just bigger okay that makes that makes it fun um in return i kind of want to do blue up here leave leave kind of a space yeah i don't think i like that as much so i'm glad i didn't do much um i do want some of the blue up toward here not much at all in fact i want it real blotchy so i'm going to pat off i had to have one going through a flower okay i like that i'm learning to stop i'm so excited i do but i do but i do want and i'm going to have to get a bigger brush if i want some more um bigger splats so i'm going to use a mop brush love these um yeah they're they're absolutely incredible i'll try to remember if i don't already have them in my i don't think i do um gosh love them not i need more water it was pretty thick that's all i want that is all i want okay i'm gonna look at it to my camera and see it's kind of cute all right yep i think i'm gonna stop i think i'm gonna stop all right y'all go have fun", "ZqGuTrZl05g": "the life of a fisherman it never gets old so welcome to the show come on yo go away like hey everybody Mike Iaconelli I want to talk about the baits and techniques that I used in the recent going I kept Assad called the woody home and it was an awesome show it's a special little secret place on the Delaware River and we were in early fall when the fish were really starting to move into that spot that place the woody hole is a big winner in area on the Delaware River and we were on the front end of that thing really being loaded you know we caught fish on two or three different baits we caught a few on a jig we caught a few on a blade bait but our number one bait in this episode was the good old shaky head and I want to talk to you today about the shaky heads that I fish how I rigged them and then I'm going to talk to you a little bit about how we fish them in current and the rod and reel let's start with the baits uh you know I love this bait and it's my favorite style bait to fish on a shaky head and that's a straight tail worm and the bait that we used in this show was a Berkley have it it's a bait called the bottom hopper it's six and a quarter inches and when I open up this thing and you look at it it's a very traditional straight tail worm six and a quarter inches straight flat bottom bulbous tail this is the style worm that I love with a shaky head the next thing is the jig head and there are so many different shaky heads out there in the market but this one is really special and this is the one that I love to fish and it's a jig head by VMC called a rugby head and I'm going to open one up and when you take a look at it it's a really unique style shaky head because it's got an offset hook on it and you're going to see that right there it's got an offset hook really special design head they call it a rugby head because it's a cross between a ball head and a football head and what that does is it lets it come through cover excellent especially rock and gravelly stuff like we were fishing around in the woody hole the last thing I want to talk about this jacket is it's got a recessed line tie the line tie is built down into the head that's going to let it come through clean we used eight and three sixteenth ounce shaky heads in this show now I'm going to show you how I ring it and the first thing I'm going to do with that bottom hopper is I'm going to bite about quarter inch off the top of that word so I'm going to bite it down to about a six-inch Bay I bite it down and when I've done that it does two main things the first thing it does is creates a very flat spot a flat seat to where I could set it on that head and make a streamlined package the next thing it does is it shortens up the bait a little bit it makes smaller which is what you want when it's tough out I'm going to thread that bait on I'm going to pop it on about an eighth of an inch pop it out and I'm going to go all the way around the bend of that hook and then when I rigged it I'm going to do a normal Texas style some shaky heads have a screw in or a pin but because it's an offset hook I'm going to rig this shaky head Texas style and make sure the baits nice and flat the one thing I want to stress this that you have to do is when you rig it on that jig head make sure the flat sides facing down a lot of your bites are going to come on the fall and with that flat side facing down it's going to glide the really unique thing about a shaky head is it's what I call a 50/50 babe and on every cast you make with this you're going to present the bait to fish two different ways and the first one is the fall and as this bait falls on a semi slack line it actually glides down look at the hunk in the head and that flat side on the bottom it looks like a keel on a boat and as that falls on the semi slack line it glides down to the bottom very unique action different than a Texas rig different than a jig and a lot of your bites are going to come on the initial fall and you're going to see that Nick going like video the other half of your bites are going to come after it hits the bottom and once that Schanke head hits the bottom I get my rod tip and I put it about two o'clock and I'll just shake my tip and when that bait sits on the bottom this is exactly how it lays look at it nose down tail up on an angle and when you shake your rod tip that tail Quivers very very unique to a shaky head especially in a place with a very silty bottom like the Delaware River having a bait stand nose down tail up is going to get a lot more bites than say a traditional Texas rig so the shaky head was one of the main baits that we used again let me stress the keys let it fall on a semi slack line Hathi your bites will come as it falls after it hits the bottom get your rod shake it shake your rod tip that tail is going to quiver as it sits nose down on the bottom let me talk a little bit about the rod and the reel I'm going to mention the areas we fished it on the rod reel I use the naboo Garcia Ike series rod and I used it in the 6 X medium heavy side that's a killer rod for a shaky head the shorter rod lets you slow your presentation down and at the end of the day you need to set the hook it's a single hook you need to set it so that medium heavy action is a better action on the real we used a 20 size Abu Garcia SX and the premiere real during the course of the day but the common denominator 8 pound Berkeley 100% traveling fluorocarbon the fluorocarbon is going to let that bait have maximum action so remember that and then the last thing I want to touch on is how we fish debate where we fished it and the woody hole is a tidal current generated place and we made sure that on every cast retargeted current breaks and seams and a current break is where the current hits an object and bounces off the seam of that carrot break is where the fast-moving water meets the calm water and you actually see a seam bass in tidal water like on a dull River always feed in those seams and current breaks so you're going to see in this going like episode called the woody hole you're going to see us fish behind the bridge pilings behind the culvert you're going to see us targeting rocks and stumps that create current brakes and that's where the fish feed I want to throw my shaky head up Curt let it come down in that seam on that current break and that's where you're going to get bit listen to me if you fish tidal places current areas if the fish are in transition and it's tough try that shaky head rig it like I said fishing on that six six medium heavy combo and target those brakes and you're going to catch a lot of fish just like we did when a fish like him you know I'm fishing hard you might wanna say that on", "sNmrYr4E4nU": "many people ask what DK what problems but they Scott cut the head exercise 4.2 Kashi number third find two numbers whose sum is 27 let the numbers X and what two numbers X and by whose sum is 27 by the problem sum is 27 and the product is 182 what that means now these are the two equations we want to make it in a single variable just like quadratic ax squared plus BX plus C equal to zero substitute the value of y from second to first what you are getting X plus what is y Y means 182 divided by x equals 227 what is fine 182 by X or somebody wants take buy from first one subsumed in the second one you are getting money do is your choice you may start with this portion or you may start from this portion my trash is this one so I start from here 27 X minus x-square 182 so X square minus 27 X plus 182 equal to 0 now you have to apply either the method like or spring the middleman we're in time so this 27 and we want to divide in two parts such that the products quality so here we start with the 182 prime factors 291 730 P 127 and you know 13 is 1 and 14 is 139 14 27 so here the factorization 14 X 13 X and 182 now simply taking common what we are getting X minus 14 and X minus 30 product of two factors zero that means either X is pudding or excess 13 what is our supposition let the numbers X and y their total is given 27 now tell me if X is 14 what about by study and if X is 30 would it it means it is clear that the numbers 13 and 14 now the next some same exercise some number fourth find two consecutive positive integers sum of whose squares 365 let the consecutive numbers X and X plus one positive their sum of their squares is given as 365 positive numbers comes UPD numbers negative number X or X plus one now if we exploit it what we are getting in the form of quadratic 2x squared plus 2x minus 3 64 equals to zero and at this point if it is divisible by same number cut it shut up navasana so divided by 2x squared + X - 2 1 - 8 - to get the same number 13 and 14 so here we have to write X square 14 13 182 X comma X plus 40 trevean comma next plus 14 so X plus 14 and X minus 13 are the two factors now tell me what are the answers 13 and - footed if X is 13 numbers are 13 and 14 and if X minus 14 we'll get negative numbers but what is given in the

X 60 0 now the factors prime factors of 60 to 30 to 15 5 3 pick arrangement such that we'll have minus 7 and the minus 16 is the product 5 to 10 3 to 6 no 2 2 4 4 5 20 & 3 no 5 3 15 to 2 for no 3 to 6 6 to 12 and fun correct so X is square to annex 5 X 60 hello you thickest one right - 2 + 5 - m and minus 20 into 5 minus 60 now X comma X - 12 5 comma X - 12 that means X minus 12 and X plus 5 equal to 0 that is x equals to 12 and minus 5 if you put minus 5 the base length equals 2 - impossible kinetic x equals to 12 so base is 12 put X 12 here fine and you know if I to rescue playing 529 continue correct good like some not some of this exercise sixth a cottage industry produces certain number of poetry articles in a day it was observed on a particular day that the cost of production of each article in rupees was three more than twice the number of article produced let the article produced on that day suppose X and the cost of each article three more than twice the number of articles produced three more than twice the number of article produced is the cost of each article question is the total cost of production on that day 90 degrees and you know total cost equals to cost of each article into number of articles produced is given as 19 pieces so the quadratic equation in terms of now we want quantity as this product and sum we need only three factors to ninety two forty five five nine three three now and just so that we have three as plus some greater number of plus and negative number so here we have five three fifteen three to six to twelve two x's square 15 X 12 X 90 factors X common to X plus 15 minus 6 2 X plus 15 hence X minus 6 + 2 X + 15 are there two factors so answer x equals to 6 or x equals to minus 15 by 2 minus the cost of your pen this pen cost - rupees impossible so reject is - answer x equals to 6 it means the number of articles produced six and each article cost 15 rupees now see now we'll take some more problems from 4.3 remember one woody but I think in the new syllabus of CBSE 4.3 some number one by using the perfect square method that is in the quadratic equation method of completing the square is not in the force so question number one cut it now some number for the sum of the reciprocals of remnants age in years three years ago and five years from now is one third you know from the linear equations first always start with the percentage let that Emma's present age Axios then three years ago past X minus three and five years from now X plus five very simple present past and future now the question is saying the reciprocals ages are reciprocals cause some one-third the sum of the reciprocals X minus three is eight reciprocal x plus five is the age reciprocal noise nothing simply you had to take the LCM and found the quality and so here it is 1 time 2 plus 2x into 3x squared plus 2x minus 15 open the bracket 6 6 X X square 2 X 15 so already is x squared minus 4 X 21 and you know very well the product 21 someone has for what a simple question 3 so X common X - 7 3 comma X minus 7 X minus 7 X plus 3 answer - 3 + 7 - 3 up to intersecting no and rejected so present it over a month seven years three years back four years and five years from now 12 years so present age is important so easy no fifth fifth sixth I think is for you for your boom back no down fifth some system for your homework someone some for your homework not it a train travels 360 kilometer with a uniform speed let that speed be X so Y stein time taken in first case distance upon speed that is 360 by X second portion if

hope you're doing well hope you keep in safe and this week we're gonna actually be making an assortment of cannolis well technically only two and cannolis are italian pastries which are tube shaped shells of fried dough and then they're filled with delightful deliciousness and when i first heard of cannolis i kind of thought of something else and me being me you know cannoli right and i know what you're thinking just just run the clip already [Music] [Music] so we're going to be actually doing two types of cannolis today so we're gonna do a lemon curd and ricotta cannoli maybe mixed in with a little touch of mascarpone and then in addition we're actually gonna be making ourselves a coffee and chocolate cannoli as well so obviously making that pastry in the dough and then we're going to fry it off i'm going to show you how to do that as well so very straightforward right now straightforward maybe but we're going to enjoy this i hope you guys and gals will so if i've convinced you feel free to hit the subscribe and the bell button for notifications when videos are uploaded but always appreciated so i think it's time to crack on sit back relax and i hope you enjoyed the video so we're going to need to start making that cannoli mix first as it needs time to rest so we're going to need 250 grams of plain or all-purpose flour which is about 2 cups and sifted in addition we want 2 tablespoons of fine granulated sugar or caster sugar 1 pinch of salt in addition we want 40 grams of unsalted butter which is 1 8 of a cup and then you want to get your hands in there and breaking down that butter incorporating it into the flour and the sugar using your thumb and index finger so after that's incorporated we're going to need one egg and also four tablespoons of masala wine which is gonna be about 60 mil [Music] without stumbling and drinking all the masala mix the dough together until it binds and if it doesn't quite bind together you can always add a little touch more masala right no i think we better go with water this time so add a little splash of water until the dough binds together but be very careful it doesn't go too sloppy and once bound together we're going to give it a need using our heels of our hands for about five minutes until smooth so once that dough is nice and smooth we're gonna clean it put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes to rest so next we're going to make the lemon curd and we're going to juice two large lemons these ones are smaller ones so i've gone for three lemons so we're gonna zest them through a microplane first also don't forget to take the stickers off always super important and also just bearing in mind when you're zesting make sure you zest and turn zest and turn do not go into the white that's the bitterness and then you want to juice them and you could use a sieve to catch the pips i'm using the back of my microplane next you want about 100 grams of caster sugar or fine granulated sugar which is half a cup next you want to add five and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted butter and then in a separate bowl you want two eggs and one egg yolk whisking them together so grab the lemon mixture and take it over to the stove to a pan of simmering water and we're just going to lightly whisk that together just until the butter is melted so once melted add the egg mixture into the lemon mix and then continuously whisk that gently just until the mix has thickened and cooked out the eggs so once the lemon curd is thickened up we're just going to take that off the stove and then we're going to carefully pour it straight through a sieve into another bowl ah watching your fingers because it's very hot so once that's finally passed through pop a little bit of parchment over the top just to stop it forming a skin did i say parchment i i meant to say cling film but you could use either i guess but once this cools down we're gonna pop this in the fridge and let it set even further so next we're gonna do the mascarpone and ricotta and we're gonna need 227 grams or eight ounces of mascarpone and then we want 227 grams or eight ounces of ricotta as well then we want three tablespoons of icing sugar or powdered sugar and then just carefully whip that together using a whisk and you could use a kitchenaid if you want to i'm not going to use it today and you was expecting me to use the kitchenaid so once that's stiffened up you can pop that in a piping bag you don't necessarily need a nozzle so you might be thinking that seems quite a lot for all these cannolis considering we're doing two i'm glad you asked because we're actually going to split this in half and then add some coffee powder so we got the coffee cream for the coffee and chocolate cream technically ricotta and mascarpone you know what i mean and then we're going to go for about a teaspoon of espresso powder i suppose you could go for more right um maybe a little bit more and if you're feeling a little bit wild just a touch more don't add as much coffee as i did one teaspoon is sufficient enough and also half a teaspoon of cocoa powder because it is coffee and chocolate right so once all your fillings are into piping bags pop them in the fridge so it's now time to roll and cut those beautiful cannolis but before we do that because i'm always forgetting something oil your rings or well well technically oil your tubes okay i don't think i'm making this better for myself am i so the only thing i can say to that is i can only apologize and also if you've got some cones hanging around maybe we can do some cannoli cones so now it's time to roll out that beautiful dough so we're going to dust the work surface lightly with some flour grab your rolling pin and give it a good roll out until you've got a nice thin pastry so once the dough is almost transparent but not quite we're going to start cutting them with a 9 centimeter ring which is 3.5 inches and we're just gonna cut them out now i know i said nine centimeter i'm going to go a little bit of an upgrade and go a little bit bigger with the ring so about 10 or 11 centimeters i'm going to try these ones instead so we're going gonna have some small ones and also some medium-sized ones as well and keep the leftovers you can re-roll this and make some more after that so grab yourself a little bit of egg wash as this will be for sealing the tops so carefully wrap the pastry around the ring and then just put the smallest amount of egg wash on the top just so it can seal and stick together so when these fry they won't unravel and all you're doing is just making sure you pinch it as well making sure that seals up a treat so once they're ready to roll well technically they're already rolled you want to heat yourself up a thousand five hundred mil of peanut oil or six cups if you haven't got peanut oil you can always use vegetable oil that's fine and you wanna heat it up to about 350 fahrenheit or 180 celsius so once the oil is nice and hot we're going to carefully drop down those beautiful cannolis and we're going to cook these for about two to three minutes until nice golden and crispy so if you haven't sealed them correctly this is what happens but the ones that you have sealed correctly they'll turn out nice and crispy perfect so once you've finished cooking turn the heat off set the oil aside and let this cool down for a good few hours until it's nice and cool and if you want to reuse it again pour it back in the bottle once it's nice and cold so without losing too many you should get quite a few out of this mixture and i also found maybe put one in at a time and using that spider to hold it in place for the first few seconds and you're probably cooking time is not really one or two minutes i would probably say about 30 seconds until they're golden and crunchy so now these are finally cooled down let's start filling them so starting off with the lemon curd and ricotta just pop a little bit of that lemon curd in the middle there without it drizzling out too much and then just carefully pipe the ricotta just on top and then you want to fill the coffee and chocolate and i guess you could put some chocolate droplets in there but we're going to do something else so going back to the lemon curd and the ricotta mascarpone we've got ourselves some very finely chopped walnuts and we're just going to dip the ends straight into there and then as for the coffee and chocolate garnish we've actually got ourselves some dark chocolate here which is about 100 grams or two thirds of a cup and we've also got ourselves 100 grams of white chocolate or two-thirds of a cup what we want to do is just dip the ends into the chocolate and then just drizzled with white chocolate very finely over the top without making too much mess so there is our two lots of cannolis which turned out an absolute little delight i think it's time to try these little bad boys so the chocolate and coffee and also the ricotta mascarpone with the lemon curd so here we go chat oh my goodness me the lemon curd and the ricotta and the mascarpone mixing together that crunchy cannoli and then finishing nicely with those walnuts oh my goodness me also i may have um made a mess but it's okay it's fine maybe we could change these two mesoli's now for the coffee and chocolate one this time be careful of the ends coming out it's like a chocolate mocha delight goodness me the creaminess the ricotta the crispy cannoli the chocolate the coffee oh my goodness me it is an absolute little treat and you've got to give this a go you can't miss out on this so there we have it for this week our delightful cannolis with the ricotta mascarpone the lemon curd and then you've got the ricotta mascarpone mixed in with the cocoa powder the espresso powder and then drizzled off with white chocolate and dipped in dark chocolate oh my goodness me you gotta give this a go you won't be disappointed feel free to check out

dimensional analysis and also using a proportion if you would like to jump ahead to the dimensional analysis you're welcome to click right on the dimensional analysis here that should take you to that point or if you'd like to see it solved with a proportion click right here on the word proportion and that would take you to when I solved it using that what I'm going to do first is list some things that we need to know and then I'm going to start with a quick graphic representation of how we can solve this problem one thing that we absolutely need no matter which particular procedure we're using is the conversion factor from ounces to milliliters this is on your formulas and and measurements and conversions to memorize if you have lost that worksheet I'm sure it's available in the learning resources or you can contact one of the math instructors here at PA College and we would be able to email that to you if you look on that what you're going to find is you're going to see ounces a few different times one is in terms of volume and the other is in terms of weight how do I know which one I'm using am I using ounces to a certain weight or ounces to a certain volume that is easily answered by looking at what we are converting it to we are asked to solve for ounces find its equivalent equivalents in milliliters liters is a measure of volume this is a measure of volume we are looking for I immediately know and we do see that here that this could be written fluid ounces this could be FL oszi but because we are asked in milliliters we don't even need that FL it's just a Z for ounces so now on to the explanation I know regardless of which procedure I use or you which method I use dimensional analysis or proportion I know because of that formula sheet and that conversion sheet that one ounce is going to be equivalent to 30 MLS so even before I get into any of these methods here I just want to quickly kind of visualize this if I had a container in this container had and again what we're looking for is four ounces so if I could split this container its volume so I know it's volume but if I could split this container here here's one two three four each one of these represents one fluid ounce so I have a total of four fluid ounces every one of these is worth thirty milliliters so here's thirty here's 30 here's 30 and here's thirty I know if I were to add all these up I would get 120 therefore immediately I know that four ounces is equivalent to 120 milliliters I know that's very quick we didn't do any sort of multiplying or use a proportion but it's just visualizing what we know about this each ounce contains or is equivalent to 30 milliliters now what I'm going to do is I'm going to erase this and I'm going to solve this problem using dimensional analysis dimensional analysis uses conversion factors so I guess I'm going to just delete this part here we still need this one ounce equivalent to 30 MLS we still need that remember with dimensional analysis you always start with what you know what you are given we are given four ounces to convert so I'm going to start with my four ounces over one we're not working with a rate so we don't have any units here in the denominator with dimensional analysis we are using these conversion factors we're going to be multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a conversion factor if I wanted to cancel out bounces I need to be dividing by ounces and if I want to go from and cancel out ances and I want to go into milliliters then milliliters needs to go in the numerator I recommend that students first write in the unit's that they are cancelling out and then the unit's they are going into some students will rush into this and write the numbers and the unit's all in one here but first just realize I want to cancel out ances and I want to go into milliliters once I have these units listed I can now write them in I know one ounce is equivalent to 30 MLS since we are using dimensional analysis I am multiplying by 30 over 1 therefore I will multiply the numerators 4 times 30 this is a hundred and 20 the unit left in the numerator is MLS and the denominator I'll have 1 times 1 and there is no unit left so I have one and no unit this is equivalent to we're taking 120 and dividing it by 1 120 MLS so just to recap we started with what we are converting for ounces we realized that that's going to be written over one dimensional analysis uses multiplication factors here to cancel out units so we're cancelling out the ounces going into MLS I realize that that's all I need is just a one step problem multiply the numerators multiply the denominators the last thing that we're going to do is solve this problem using a proportion if you want to go back and look at the dimensional analysis again you're welcome to click on dimensional analysis at any time solving this problem with a proportion you still need this one ounce equivalent to 30 MLS this is a conversion factor regardless of what method we use it's necessary what this tells us if we want to use a proportion is that regardless of however many ounces we have if we were to reduce any sort of ratio it needs to reduce so that it's equivalent to one ounce over 30 ml s so this conversion factor can be written as a ratio of one ounce over 30 MLS now it doesn't matter however ounces how many ounces we start with or however many milliliters we start with when you divide another two another set of numbers over here this needs to be equivalent to 1 over 30 now we know the ounces is going to have to be in the numerator and we know the milliliters are going to have to be in the denominator that's because that's how proportions that's how we solve proportions we need the units to line up so we're going to have the units in the numerator or some of the units of ounces in the numerator and milliliters in the denominator so oh I know whatever numbers I put over here I can't actually choose I can't just put three and twelve or 17 and 20 I know I'm looking for one of these things I'm looking for a certain amount of milliliters don't know this and I want to know how many milliliters is contained in four ounces because we know we are dealing with equal ratios here I know whatever number that goes under MLS this ratio needs to be equivalent to 1 over 31 ounce over 30 MLS that's what a proportion tells us to solve a proportion I'm going to replace this question mark with an X to solve a proportion we cross multiply we do not multiply the numerators we do not multiply the denominators similar that we with this confusion that is usually set in from dimensional analysis we are multiplying one ounce times X so 1 times X 30 times 4 we get X equal to 120 if you leave your answer as X equal to 120 technically that's not correct keep in mind we want to go back up here our answer would be 120 MLS just to recap a proportion what we do with the proportion is we use the conversion factor we set that up as a ratio we are going to have an equivalent ratio where we know either the number of ounces are the number of MLS in this case we knew the number of ounces so we wrote 4 ounces because we were four up top because that's where the unit of ounces was I didn't know the number of ml so I put X there and I cross multiply to solve for x", "9Az3X8prhJs": "for anyone interested in using a shotgun as part of their home defense plan I typically recommend loading that shotgun with buckshot a lot of people have asked about using slugs instead or maybe even a couple of slugs handy on a sidesaddle to complement the buckshot so today I'm going to take a look at the shotgun slug and whether it might have a place in the context of home defense there are a number of different types of slugs but generally speaking a shotgun slug is a shell that fires one big projectile instead of a bunch of smaller ones like birdshot or buckshot slugs are really useful if we need to extend the range of the shotgun or in situations where penetration is really important double ought buck shot is the most common type of defensive shotgun ammo and it's very effective up to about 25 yards with a tight pattern you can maybe stretch it out to 40 or 50 beyond that there are much better options a slug will extend the shotguns range to at least 75 or 100 yards in situations where a rifle would be the ideal tool but for whatever reason a shotgun is what you have instead slugs can essentially turn that shotgun into a limited range rifle so if you think of your shotgun as a self-defense tool that you might use both inside and outside your home like if you have a large property to take care of having the option to use slugs might make some sense if we need to punch through a barrier a 12-gauge slug is one of the best tools we have available this is really useful for law enforcement because they often have to fight in and around cars and a slug will penetrate right through a car body or windshield far more consistently than buckshot or a handgun or a carbine so let's bring it back to the context of personal protection for the average arm civilian the shotgun is most commonly stored in the home and its intended use is limited to essentially hallway distances unless you live in a very large house I don't think a slug offers really any advantage over buckshot in that context buckshot is made specifically for short-range encounters like these when you just stop somebody right now at very close range buckshot lets you shoot them eight or nine times with one press of the trigger we don't need that range or penetration that we get from a slug when we're inside a home and in fact that can work against us whether or not a slug hits the intended target it can travel really far and go through a lot of stuff before it stops it's a huge liability because of its potential to sail right through exterior walls and still have plenty of energy left over to kill somebody there are no magic bullets any projectile you can fire through a shotgun or rifle or pistol that can physically disabled an attacker will also penetrate through a couple of pieces of drywall or plywood there's no getting around that interior wall penetration in particular is something we have to consider with any firearm or ammunition and that's a topic for another day but the penetration of a slug is on a whole different level we're not only concerned about somebody who might be in another bedroom in the house but we could also be putting people in the whole neighborhood at risk of course buckshot also carries the risk of hitting unintended targets not as much because of over penetration but more because of the spread of the shot now I wouldn't worry too much about having to take that tactical fantasy camp type hostage shot where the bad guy is ducking behind your family member and you can only see their eyeball but it's not unheard of for an armed citizen to be faced with a threat who is already in some kind of physical altercation with a family member it might be a shot that you're confident you can make but not if you're worried about a stray pellet hitting the wrong person this is just one reason it's really important to pattern the shotgun with our intended home defense load ahead of time and all that means is that we go out to the range and we shoot at a target to see what the spread looks like at various distances that match the distances inside our home this is something you really have to do yourself because each individual shotgun barrel is a little different and no two guns are guaranteed to pattern the same way with a particular load you can probably find several loads that won't spread much at all within typical home defense distances but if you want to minimize the spread there is a little shortcut federal flight control and hornady critical defense double-aught buckshot are both made with a special wad that holds the pellets together after they exit the barrel so that was almost any gun you're getting like a single two or three inch wide hole in the target at any distance up to about ten yards now that's thirty feet if you think about the inside of your home there probably aren't many places where you'd have to take a shot that's longer than that so even without a slug that could possibly exit our house at lethal velocities the shotgun can still be used to make a precision shot at close range if necessary choosing the right buckshot load gives us the ability to quickly stop a threat in the home without endangering anybody else [Music] oops", "ERAyGfCuZD8": "want to find the solution to dry muscles leaky pie crusts and flavorless breads then it's time for baking measures 101 let me introduce you to my first secret ingredient the kitchen scale I have two types here a regular scale and the tea scale if you are new to weighing your ingredients start with a regular scale it works for all measurements that are not completely tiny basically it's a replacement for measuring cups and the tea scale is a replacement for measuring spoons there is no math involved with scales they all have a tear or zero button so you can set any Bowl on top zero it out and add your ingredients most scales let you choose the measurement unit so if your recipes and grams set it to grams and if it announces set it to answers the reason small quantities like salt are usually given in grams is to avoid hard to read fractions 1 gram is easier to read and write then 0.035 of an ounce of course you can weigh all your ingredients but the one that needs when the most is flour in the u.s. most people use dry measuring cups for flour let's see how well that works here is one cup of flour it weighs 164 grams and here is another cup of flour and it weighs 138 grams flour is a powder so it's compressible here is how the first cup was measured don't laugh I used to measure that way at some point that's the wrong way kids and here is how the second cup was measured I moved the flour into the container fluffed it up scooped it gently and leveled that's the right way let's do it again the right way to see how well that works 149 grams last time I got 138 grams so even the right way is not that a cure how much flour you get when measuring with cups can vary by as much as 20% depending on the container the cup how much you stir and the humidity conditions but what if your grandma didn't write you her chocolate chip cookie recipe in ounces or what if your favorite magazine is stuck in the dark ages using cups in cases like that assume that one cup of all-purpose flour equals 5 ounces 142 grams and those chocolate chip cookies will come out perfect every time now let's talk about flavor problems when the big goods are lacking in flavor people usually blame it on the quality of butter flour or eggs but the real culprit is usually the wrong amount of salt if your baking recipe does not specify the salt type they mean table salt the difference between salt types can be huge for example 1/2 teaspoon of table salt equals one teaspoon of diamond crystal kosher salt the difference between the measuring spoons can also be huge this is always 1 teaspoon in the US and this is also sold as one teaspoon let's see how similar they are I know I spelled a bit but we're not even close here so make sure to buy deep round teaspoons or get yourself a tea scale one teaspoon of table salt weighs 5.7 grams liquids can be weighed but can also be measured by volume since they are not compressible set a liquid measuring cup on a level surface and make sure the bottom of the meniscus is at the line to which you are measuring also make sure your eyes are level with that line oh it will be hard to judge the amount for more accurately measured advice don't forget to subscribe to Helens kitchen channel and if you're ever in the Boston area maybe I'll see you in one of my classes", "JUx6FR_5Ct0": "hello and welcome to another video tutorial on unit conversion now in this example we will be using a very familiar weight and that is of course the weight of the newly born Royal baby and in the name of Prince George now Prince George was born weighing 8 pounds and 6 ounces so for this video we will try to convert 8 pounds and 6 ounces into the another common unit of mass which is the kilograms okay so we always start with our conversion factors all right so we I now have written the equivalent statements that we need and later on that will be transformed into conversion factors for us to answer this video so we have here 1 kilogram that's kg is equal to 2 point 2 0 that's 2.20 pounds lbs here is the abbreviation of your pounds then another equivalent statement that we are using here is one pound that's lb is equal to 16 ounces and that is Z as its abbreviation okay so we'll be using this token equivalent statements and transform them into conversion factors for us to solve the problem so let's do that alright we start first with 8 pounds to 8 pounds then we need a 1 conversion factor here for us to convert pounds and kilograms so obviously we will be needing this one here so we need to put the proper units in the proper places for them to be cancelled out I remember we are given the unit in pounds so in our conversion factor the denominator should be the unit pounds as well so we will write it down right so and I have written our equivalent statement into the conversion factor form for us to be able to see the consolation of your units alright so we have the pants here so that cancels out so only now left for the unit kilogram so the answer for this part is alright so the answer is 3 point 6 3 kilograms so that is eight pounds divided by 2.20 that's three point six three kilograms so we need now to convert six ounces into kilograms by using this conversion factor first one pound is equal to sixteen ounces so we'll be placing that here then from pounds to kilograms again using this conversion factor here so let's do that alright so I now have transform this conversion factors into their proper places and remember the unit's should be properly placed for you to see the cancellation of this unit so I have written here alpha since we are starting with ounces then from pound we have here pounds for at the consulate as well and for us to see the cancellation let's do that cancels out then we have the pounds cancels out all the unit left is in kilograms so let's do the calculation and the answer for this park here in 0.17 kilograms so that's six ounces bided by 16 and again further divided by two point two zero all right and our answer is zero point seven kilograms so we now have three point six three from the first part then 0.17 telegrams for the second part all I need to do is to sum it all up to get our final answer and the final answer is three point eight zero kilograms all right so that's three point sixty three kilograms from this plus zero point 17 kilograms for the second part the sum of that is three point eight zero grams now remember for your final answer you have to determine the correct number of significant figures but since you're only given eight pounds and 6 ounces now remember usually for it to be a more accurate measurement it should have decimal places so that's why we are using here at least two decimal place for this purpose but remember the equivalent statements here will not be used in determining the correct number of significant figures but only based it on the given now we are just simply adding two more here decimal pieces for it to be a little bit more accurate all right so that's all for this video thank you for listening and continue learning", "aBqd6iwksEo": "hello my good looking gamer my game up with this up today I have a special video today so some people have been wondering how do you make a Bukkit server so this is a premade buckets over which I which you can get I have to go down in my history I til I clear my history I'm pretty sure I'd in it so i will have the link down to the preemie thing and I'm gonna be right back on after I find my pre-meeting baby I can take you on the way and I can rally you to Mexico ok guys i am back and how do you like my beautiful singing my beautiful swing it so if i skip this link 0 on one but ok i am back and so this link will be down in the description this got updated 17 hours ago which i think ok so like I updated 17 hours ago which is good with you guys um but yeah oh yeah um okay so we're gonna I already have that downloaded mmm yeah I've done that downward it came so you guys can't pull forward or you guys don't want to use hamachi because hamachi gets gives virus how much he just goes out it it my fine so after you download that it's gonna be in a unique will be needing a win while you can get a free version just drag it out and I have in my physical game 5 if you guys want to know how to make your folders invisible so nobody can get into them just go ahead and go to properties click on hidden and click apply and we'll ask you do you want to do it just to this for all these things and after that you're gonna click on this oh oopsies oopsies poopies okay I'm gonna be right back and I mean it there do one ok I'm back I had to just one with my IP so you guys don't know that I gave up a fake IP so so you can be looking for a point not this point you're going to be looking another point which should be just above this one summer point you can change it by fabio not don't 2565 to 55 65 so what you're going to be needing which will also be down in the description is you joint you're probably you're not going to use you try cuz i know you torrent does give viruses you but you're not going to use it so if i got it back to my games folder i think i just opened two games will be my bed no i don't know i just want to go ahead and open my games full though i know that's this mess up so you can go down to you try open that up okay in if you go to options go to preference preference you go to connection or heal and you put in the point of that in it and then you click apply click okay and then just miss them out that boom you are taught to port forward now to get your IP you look up CM d I'm gonna put I pecan sick click enter and then you look for your IP foy thing in oh wait oh my god oh man well your eye before I have that covered your IP voy and I could might it be four changed that's kind of making me mad at your ipv4 address that's what you use for your address and he's test it out before if it doesn't work this doesn't work for you um sometimes will sometimes it won't would you do if it doesn't work oh me oh wait it didn't change a lot of difference over i'm on i have like two wifis i'm on my belkin one um but instead of change so you put a nice if that doesn't work when you put in your IP you're gonna go ahead and go to IP chicken I chicken oh my gosh oh my gosh what's that oh my gosh I have a lot of people on here IP chicken you go look up IP chicken with my IP address just copy that in the place of that Dale place it into this thing like here where my mouse is in and lower so I'm not but yeah so I p chicken you want link in the butt preemie bucket sofa you guys can't have a better version to me i'll show you that the silver looks and i will do then a second give me one second and i'll be right back I'm not put my IP back in and stuff like that I'm gonna close this so yeah I'll be right back okay guys i'm back i'm gonna launching it do it what's up wait wait what's going on um there's a bug bug how do when you can click on one batch file um oh wait on that point what do you mean um we load it we load Milo just do i'm just gonna um that's really weird it's really weird i've never seen that but well i'm just going to go ahead into a 1.8 so let's lucky enough m yeah um I think this is glitched if it glitches out like that um go ahead and use your IP chicken then just go ahead i'm going to go ahead and use my AP chicken them because my thing is just bugged out I'm gonna fix that in a far future oh I think I might know what it is if this doesn't walk just doesn't work I'm gonna be so mad because I really like this world and in it and it just kind of hot makes me mad now I have to say goodbye if I had to say goodbye to this world I'll just go ahead and take the old out no one I'll just take out the world plugins blah nothing will be chance what about my update you on the road when we travel and the best bit loud just go ahead and click on one batch and when do we are back I'll just be right back okay everyone I am back I'm sorry about the difficulties so let me refresh this so this is my silver it you can change the icon which you're gonna have to do make a photo ain't you it has to have silver dash icon and then recipe yeah and there it is it's really cool and now if we want it it's gonna ask you that blah blah blah just click um just uncheck the mark and then click run it don't worry so horrible please waiting the IP dead change I just had a I how do we change the IP but whatever like how when you go like this it kind of just goes we look at that that's how you screw up minecraft that's how you make out your family you like yes grab a cab yeah that's funny but when it's AC you're gonna refresh click join my not only foot people is loud me and some other people so i'm going to fullscreen this mode this thing and i can show you what i've done so far so so this is what I've done and I'm gonna I'm gonna have to add some servers I get adds a little bit more plugins and if used how it with it oh whoops Jesus game wool game or um chooooo um something's going on here my command blocks are not working um hey oh wait that was up true and believe click done that is super weird I just said oh oh i just like oh oh I forget I have to UM just if that happens you how you fixed up from bal happening you're gonna go to he'll go back to your pre-made server thing good your server properties you're gonna go ahead and do command blocks drew true click safe also i would recommend um no um no pad + + just recommending that um that will also be down to the description if you guys want that way Morgan I so profess I'm game I let's gamble now got gamble gamble gamble hey you know what people are protected if you gamble with your mouth this actually gives you good luck sure you put ice in your mama go boom around your mouth both don't do that just take little chicer able solid whatever go Hugo to fish just and once you log in once you login I'm how I need to set the Wolves spawn here since it's kind of like which happens is you go right he'll win of crap action good pure shop the wounds and information the chanter that's where the enchantment tables and this will all the Maas an admin and if you want to be a mod or admin I'm only am allowing allowing three help us on my server the first two people who join you know get a pic the last person is gonna be a think of mom I could somebody tell me down a description um which one's work awfully mod or admin this is like my first time ever doing so though I don't know and I need help I um I have the thing come permissions X and I want to know how to add it something popped up out this stupid them the victim know whatever it em I want to know how to make it so when I put like high or something it'll actually say oh no I do have permission + + in it this is a faction server because you go f there is the f commands that stands for faction so yeah this is a faction serve them and if anybody wants to join me um you've got to go to my Twitter go to my twitter if you if you don't know how to it's at my homepage to go to where you get to see all my videos it should have a Twitter sign on it you should click on that go to my Twitter and there should be a video saying with the hashtag new server and if you put if you apply to that saying hashtag add me i will ask you what your skype you must have skype to do that if you do not have skype think it's skype it's easier i'm waiting forever I've been checking that each day if you probably sent it and I can't find it then I must be a lost cause well yeah so I guess that's all now so I'm gonna go ahead and continue on this yeah um yeah i mean i'm making it so just hoppas you know what that might be a bet you know what I'm just gonna give a little hoppers this seems like a bad idea to go ahead and get rid of these like I feel like people can actually yeah people who can get into these I need to figure out how to make it so people can't destroy miss bond I don't know how to do that because I'm time I'm not used to servers I played them I know I know I know that i know a lot of things like like how to bypass password if you forget it or something um but I just just don't know how to do service so if you guys have any help I might not working on a website for it I'm walking on my website bone my thing so you guys can like I don't know apply the motto 80 because when i start my server um this is a secret between you and me don't tell anybody else but i'm telling my home oh um just don't tell anybody else that um um that um there's gonna be a free apply on my website because what if I server goes out so will my um so will my website in the best part is talking like riots but the best part is um there's gonna be a free implies asian and I'm only accepting a hundred people once my service starts so once my silver such I'm only accepting 100 people and don't worry this is not how big the shop is gonna be it's gonna be a lot bigger I have a secret staircase going down and I haven't covered because I'm only having this area right now filled up I hit that name it gotta put the item in here I got put items again but once I put a sign on them and stuff like that you can sell in by I'm see if I go bow I have like oh not bow mind me about bowel doesn't work i removed um it just doesn't work I have forty-seven dollars now if i gave you just give money game i'm good game game game blows tab walk for little boy got thousand bucks and it's catch okay that's nothing like it's walking i'm gonna go ahead and do cut mains jump got some help command oh look who I'm ooh I IC o---- in oh and why is that all / money so so I can't do like a command that says / give me okay well that sucks no but yeah so how do i how do I do that um just tell me a few things down in the description and I have big news I want to announce I have um some of these news gonna be going to all my so my day they're gonna be in some of my videos and it's gonna be like a team thing it's just it's just something I wanted an ounce um I'm like announcing this is like a qurl whatever I don't know what I'm just gonna name this flipping my I'm how to make a minecraft server buckets over whatever I believers on yahoo but I want this to be a three-team so if you have skype this will cause you to have skype you can ask me and i will pick one win people to just do maybe one video with me all have you all do a video with me and i will post it on YouTube but who of those the best um yeah that's how I'm gonna do it who is the best will actually whoville me in my summer pic we're gonna do the street vvv I got to talk to him about this whoever we pick um we both have to pick the same people will actually be allowed to be in the thing and in the best part is about this if you go to my if you're gonna my oh my much well I have known it okay my my internet spory on my this Wi-Fi but what other wait what oh okay maybe it is on me whatever um you know my a finite open if you go to my youtube and you know my him you know my channel aren't the thing as me and like Kira buying something that you will get added to do and I'm no lie ah some sweet sweet copy copy no I'm not drinking i'm actually just drinking water oh man i bet you guys are like what you drink a goblet what the hell oh yeah go to him forget her come on no what is wrong oh I'm clicking I'm trying to change my see you go right now that's my other years old you'll never be able to find that just never ever even try all

"5fYj8aHjBuk": "hi my name is Maria and I'm a mathematician and today I'm going to show you an easy way to remember how many pints are in a gallon so I'm going to draw a big G to represent a gallon and if you can remember this picture then you can always remember your conversions so I'm going to draw 4 Q's in this big G of mine my G stood 4 gallon and my Q's are going to stand four quarts so that means there's 4 quarts in every gallon now when every Q I want you to draw two peas and each P is going to stand for a pint so there's two pints in every court now your question was how many pints are in a gallon so what I have to do is count up how many peas I drew in this huge G and there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 that means there are 8 pints in every one gallon and you can use this big G to find different conversions between quarts and gallons also right there's 4 Q's in 1 gallon so there's 4 quarts in 1 gallon and there's 2 pints in 1 Q so there's 2 peas and 1q means that there's 2 pints in 1 quart so if you can remember that big G you can remember that there are 8 pints in every one gallon", "rfQRZlabRBs": "right lesson 1-8 optimizations with linear programming graph is system of inequality of inequalities named the coordinates of the vertices of the feasible region and then you find the maximum and the minimum values of the given function this is the function that we need to graph okay let's grab this one first y greater or equal to 1 and Y smaller or equal to 4 we have one of this line right here and 4 is right here let me draw this line alright now when you drop inequality you need to shade it so I'm gonna I will give you the financial later once I'm done with all of this graphing so what is when keep in mind the the region of solution is in between this line so in in between these two lines now that's kind of you to grab this line right here now to grab this line let's try to simplify this one first so we have for y greater than or equal to 6x minus 32 let's simplify this by 4 and y greater than or equal to 6 divided by 4 left 6 before or we have 3 over 2x and then my necessary to divide by 4 you have 832 divided 4 is at 8 now after that let's do the graphing now when you grab this line let me transform it into simpler term first while greater than or equal to 3 over 2x minus 8 all right this line let's get a table value for this one Alex and why table value not when X 0 Y is negative way but I didn't want to use all the wasted negative H you know a bit I didn't draw the graph here for that small number negative value so I'll let me try to find something else that make X if X equal to 2 3 now you look fine now let make X equal to 4 ok so when my egg is 4 4 times 2 I'm sorry 4 times 3 12 12 divided by 2 there's 6 6 minus 8 you got minus 2 so if my X is 8 you have to actually let me do the division first 8 divided by 2 year for format 5 by 3 you got 12 12 minus 8 you get 4 so now you have 2 points to graph the line so 0 or throw wine for X negative 2 so Y where Y for X for y negative 2 so we have X 4 y 92 somewhere here that's one point and then when the egg is eight your Y is 4 somewhere here so when you have that let's roll the line okay now where did you grab what did you do the shading okay so look at this IRA here why greater than so when it is greater than you shed above the line greater than above the line so this is the region of solution we shed above the line okay now let's go to our last line let me try to convert this into simpler terms first we have y greater than or equal to you divide this one by two you have a negative one over two x and you also have a plus two so you have this line you need to graph y then or equal to negative one over two x and then plus two a fine table values of this equation okay x and y now I get a 0 0 Y is 2 now when you act this to say f is 2 2 times 1/2 negative 2 divided by 2 D of 1 negative 1 plus 2 you get 1 0 Y 2 when your egg is to your Y is one okay when you have that last graph what should be on the the point why it's not like that - Oh make mistake on that that's why should be here - 2 1 now make it the wrong point is negative 1 no 2 1 here that's why they're wise something wrong with this okay okay now the region sharing region this is greater than or equal to looking at the original equation this is greater than or equal to so you said above the line now it seems like right now we have a common shedding region to me where this one and give you a proper shading of the answer so you have another point here as a vertices so this is the shading region laughter I'm on this one now we have four vertices actually yep one two three and four this all the intersection of the solution vision after that let's answer the question named recall the night of each vertices okay that's well you can represent letter or you don't want to represent letter that's up to you I'll just name it right away that's it problem from here I'll just put ABC easier it'll be C and B okay now at Point a what do we have here since this you have starting from here you have negative 4 and then you have 1 2 3 4 90 4 and 4 and then for point B 1 B you have this one 8 and then 1 2 3 4 8 and 4 for Point C Point C you have this one as 6 and then 1 and the last one for body the last vertex vertex is D which is 2 & 1 ok now after that need to find the maximum and the minimum values of the given function not to do so you need to start to this each of these vertices into this equation down here let's start with a first doubleday so job is one ounce negative six and your time oxygen negative four and then you plus three times y which is four let me do this one so yeah negative six times negative negative six times negative four 24 24 and then you plus with 12 that give you 36 that's perform nearly 36 after that let's go on to point B point B up negative six x is 1 8 then last with three times for the up negative 6 times 8 and and you plus 12 they give you negative 36 so that poem see negative 6 times 6 and then G Plus with 3 times 4 so 6 times 6 is negative 6 negative 36 over negative 36 your minus 12 give energy plus whether or not - you plus further to give you negative 24 and then the last point which is last for this which is it is 6 and you times by average is 2 and then 3 plus 3 I'm sorry this is not this times 1 mistake so you have stirred negative 36 + 1 negative 33 first one select last week this one here negative 12 plus 3 equal to negative so among this four vertices we can stress find the maximum and minimum value of this inequality system of inequality so from here so therefore this is the maximum there is the biggest number 36 and the negative number is the minimum number so the maximum and right this one for you maximum value equal to 36 and the minimum minimum equal to negative 36 let's move on number two do the same thing graphing let me start by graphing this function or this inequality X in between 8 2 & 6 so you have to rewrite here then you draw one line first and six somewhere here okay so that let's move on to this one let me start biased simplify this one so this will never check Mary ground grabbing it me let me wrap this one for y I'm did then awake forward to negative x plus 2 when you device went by for you why it has been equal to negative 1 over 4x and then plus 2 divided by 4 you're gonna have 1 over to have the point okay all right now it's done so this one X's and Y's so when your egg is 0 uy yes zero point I have when your X is 4 3 4 so 4 4 times 1 is 4 4140 won't have negative ones you have negative 1 plus half R ab-negative have to let graph this line ok X 0 y have middle and then when your egg is for the Y's negative 1/2 so negative let's draw okay oh by the way the shelling vision this is in between and it's Lance all above the line like this it seems like there are somewhere in between here okay how about our last line right here in the middle here let me transform this into simpler form first so I have people on baseline for why smaller than or equal to negative 2x plus 24 okay so I try to divide both sides by four wise one dynamic 4 to negative 2 over 4 negative 1 over 2x plus 24 divided by 4 you got 6 let's work on this so when you add a little X 0 X & Y when you x is 0 X 0 here's your y 6 when your X is 2 2 times 1 - 2 divided by 2 1 2 negative 1 plus 6 you got 5 okay now let's graph this line 0 + 6 X 0 y 6 is 2 your Y is 5 when you have that last graph roll the line and since this line here is smaller than a quote it's smaller so we shade below the line okay now since like the intersection of the shading of the region of an says it's fall under I mean inside this for this section so let me try to share it properly okay that is the region of answer now where poverty is as well one two three and four let me name is one ask W X Y Z a pussy-ass w x y and z okay now let's name the various but it says of this region so starting from the W first W then W yep two and five then X for X you have six and three why why you have six and negative 1 and Z the last one you have 2 and 0 ok after that now let's write a calculate for the minimum and the maximum value of this system starting from W first ok working on this one just 6x starting with W first you have 6 times X which is 2 plus 7 times y which is 5 ok 12 + 35 + 35 that have 47 that's 47 and then number X so actually have 6 time equity 6 plus 7 times y which is 3 so you have 36 the three six plus with 21 that give you 57 point y 6 times 6 which is the X plus 7 times negative 1 which is 2 y so you have 36 of 36 minus 7 they give you twenty nine and then last one you have 6 times 2 which is X plus 7 times 0 is y so this will have 12 all right now from this value you have the maximum is for maximum 57 and the minimum which is 12 so maximum value maximum equal to 57 and minimum equal to 12 okay now let's continue to number three or the instruction you need make a birthday cake yellow or we have yellow cake that sell for $25 and strawberry cake ok that's there for 35 dollars now that's the same side decorating okay now for yellow cake need two hours for jello cake so which mean two hours you have one you locate in which you can earn $25 and from strawberry cake it will require three hours to makes public heads so within three hours to earn $35 because you make one strawberry now that represent first okay I will represent xed as the yellow cake let's say yellow cake and then why I will represent this as strawberry cake strawberry cake okay so now jello cake for yellow cake you will earn $25 within two hours but why would you make one and then for strawberry cake you will earn $35 yeah within three hours how many of each type how many of each type of cake should be made to maximize revenue so we see let me look at for Less required to make both of them or just either one of them or could be both of them or not just one either one of them you see first okay so it's it seems like the instruction not required to to make both but it could be possible that I will be you can make both to reduce the the maximum profit or just reduce one of the two to maximize the profit okay this is the let's get the revenue let's see first you have 450 hours so with 150 hours let's see how many of this scale you can make okay so we will do that you just get 200 so we're in for wonder this is within this time rate 450 hours if you want to produce this if you want to reuse previous cake using this hour we use yellow cake alone you will have [Music] 450 you divide by 2 hours that give you 200 and 220 five jello cake and which mean that in this case your strawberry crepe is 0 but if you want if you don't worry if we use or spend all this time to be use only the yellowcake it will give you a thing 450 hours did you divide by 3 they'll give you 150 k 250 cakes now assuming that you using this hour produce either either one of the cake you know either producing this probably cake or gel okay now let's try to find this profit by producing this cake first let's say well so let make some shoe of our points in this case not if for example if your yellow cake is 350 cakes at 225 case then your Sabri cake is 0 let's see how much you will earn from producing only the yellow cake so 20 and 25 you multiplied by 1 of yellow cake it cost $25 so 225 multiplied by $25 that will give you 5,000 like this they said this is the profit 5,000 to $625 let's say if you've reduced if you produce only the strawberry cake so which mean you have zero yellow cake well strawberry takes 150 cakes let me see how much you earned by producing only the strawberry cake so 150 you multiplies by $35 the cost of one strawberry cake 35 that will give you five thousand five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars all right now it seems like in this case now it seems like we producing 225 yellow cakes and zero strawberry cake to maximize the profit as you can see using this strategy you produce more you produce more revenue let's see what if fall in between this I want to know if you produce the yellow cake and strawberry cake together will it give you the number was higher than death okay so let's bring this one up a little bit let's say this time right here you will produce let me try the fun because two hours with three I say miss Kay let's say you for you six yell okay maybe you're sick sell yell okay you're gonna take you're gonna spend six hours on the yellow cake with and we were twelve to our sorry you'll produce six yell okay you will spend four hours on the strawberry cake so in other word to find the time of you strawberry cake you using four hundred forty and fifty you - the time spending on the yellow clip this K which is a six cake with 12 hours after that you divide it by 3 then you will have 146 46 for the strawberry cake now let's see what this is will producing how much will it produce so you work on this was six multiplied by 25 and then 146 x 35 and you + together so 6 times by 25 plus with 146 x 35 it gives you a five thousand two hundred and sixty dollars right now it seems like our growth and go up like this okay so it seems like the more you try to grow I'll try to increase the number of the yellow cake is supplies the profits going up so if you produce more I believe that this problem you're gonna go up also until the time that you return 250 25k and she's going down to become 0 so these are we going down to become 0 so which mean that are in this case to maximize the revenue as you can see the growth of it as you increase the number of jell-o cake you increase also the revenue as you continue to increase it will increase the revenue until you reach this five thousand six hundred and twenty five dollar is the maximum revenue you can produce within a given time period four hundred and fifty hours so in this situation where we're trying to do this work without graphing so as you analyze the given together we can see that to produce to make the maximal revenue we will produce two hundred and twenty-five jello cake and zero strawberry cake let me write the answer for you so simply in this case in order for us to produce as how many of each type of the cake should be made to max whatever in revenue so you're producing for the yellow cake reproduce it 225 and was probably cake strawberry we produced none to maximize the revenue right number four number four we do the same thing we're trying to do this without graphing but an alive by analyzing the given okay now looking at the given together we have the Midway freight train how fun that 4,200 pounds cargo has capacity of four and that and 80 cubic feet clean up small package okay let me represent X a small package first to that easy to see so let's say X equally small package and a small package weigh 25 pounds is a 25 pounds with three five pounds then we can assume three cubic feet and that and the charge five dollars okay you earn five dollars under the arrowhead five dollars so X for small package 25 pound with that word weight from the five pound and take up space of three cubic feet and charge $5 for each of this small package and I said that for y lips represent as big this system because more they use large is everything large and polite large package by package they'd be weigh 250 pounds each and and take up space of five she'll be feet and that then charges for $1 $1 all right now let's try to looking at this together all right the the maximum way that the free train can howl is 4,200 pounds is the maximum way when with the given maximum space we just fall on that and 80 should be equipped this is the maximum that it can reach now we all have be given a read the question first before we analyze this situation together okay question find the number of each type of package that should be placed on a train car to max my revenue all right so the question what were you what will you work on this will you how many how many will you put on the train car is it should we put all small should we put all large or should we put all combined and small together so that we can maximize the revenue so we need to analyze the situation together to find the maximum and the minimum and what for in between it so that we will know what is the biggest the muck to what should we do to maximize our revenue in this case okay and I try to think before you start again we try to do this problem without graphing so let's try to let's say that we will put on put all the small package on the train car without using the large package and after that we will use all the large package on the train car without using a small package I try to work on that and after that let's see what for in between if you see it increasing or decreasing and we can really find the maximum and the minimum well revenue of this situation now let's say if you want to put all the small on the country and how many of this small package can be put on this car train again okay now to do this to do this part let's see car train are small for small package weigh 25 pounds so this is 4200 so you have 4,000 to let you divide by 25 you can see that based on weight you will have based on weight X is equal to 1168 package but if it is based on the capacity this way to take up four hundred eighty divided by three we do 160 package of small package I'm sorry so now which one should we choose if we choose this one 68 it will be too big for this space to to be occupied even though it fit with this way but it's too large but for this place to hold so therefore 160 can accommodate both I was only one state 160 can accommodate both the space and the way so we will so X 160 is for the number the maximum number that we can put on the country now for the Y okay Y one packet weigh 50 pounds so we have 402 a 4200 divided by 50 they give you an 80 y equal to 84 package packages based on the way and four based on the space it occupies 480 divided by five that will give you 96 okay now what should we do with this if we getting if we get this this number it can accommodate both of this one but if you get this 96 well it will fit with this space but it too large is too heavy for this so therefore to a number they can accommodate both the weight and the space its occupy is 84 in other word if X is 160 then your Y is 0 in this space if Y is 84 which means your X is 0 when we have this idea that try to find the maximum minimum value at this point at the point 160 and 0 what is the value what is the picture the profit also it is the revenue that we can make from producible from putting all these small packages on the country so one small package is cost for charge $5 so 160 times by 5 so this you'll find the last time I find I will give you 800 so if I have this as $800 at this point about the other point of 0 of this and 80 for small packages of large packages so yep 84 times by $1 for each of this light pipe packages so you have this us-only $672 alright so now we can see that we seems like we we we put all the small packages on the country and not with the 84 not with not the large sorry let me repeat so in this K to maximize as you can see the value to maximize the revenue we reproduce we will put only this small package on the country because if you put only the large one you are not going to remark smile your revenue but let's try to test if we try to put combine the lodgings more together on the country will we maximize it will be good at an 80-pound bed or will be it fall in between these tools then we can know the flow go up or go down another thing that if we're going to produce five fine now 1125 a I say five this is it be just five of the [Music] small packages if you have to justify of this we'll see how much we will take on this in space and also in weight so I think if you do a few calculations like with it before you buy if it you can just five a Phi of this one is three cubic feet if I'm gonna be 15 so 480 you minus 15 you have only 465 and then you divide by 8 divided by 5 that will give you 93 right it basing on the way this is going to be 93 but 93 is too big for this number because the smallest one is 84 so this reason we're not going to take this as the value for the large package so we go on the pound on the way so Phi of this Y so you have 2 or 25 times by they give you 125 and then 4200 - sorry let me repeat so this number of working with with the capacity so it not gonna fit with this expressive need to occupy too large or 84 so we work on the pound the weight of this large package up still we produce we put on five of a small package on the car train so 4200 - 125 and then we divide by this 50 so we will use on the 80 1.5 which is a sound with an above with this the more we produced this the less you'll be produced this one so let's see how much we got in this case with a bigger than this or in-between this number so after that trying to represent inside so one of these charge $5 so you fight a fight $25 plus 1 of this charge $1 so plus eighty one point five times by $8 so it seems like you producing 606 $27 alright so this value is in between these two value a hundred and 672 so I simply you have this is the minimum value and this is the maximum value in this case revenue so as you can see the flow the more you increase this the more you increase the revenue so as you continue to increase the number of small packages on the country every time you increase it with every time you will increase the revenue as well so as you continue to in visit the revenue we are continue to increase until it reached the 800 and that when you have zero of the large package and the country and has only the small package so in this situation to maximize the revenue you will produce only you Selena projects you will put only the small packages on the train car so question how many of is your package you should be placed on twin town so for you real place 160 small packages and 0 and 0 large large package and what is the maximal what is the maximum revenue per Patrick train car as you can see a while ago the maximum value and the maximum revenue is $800 for each of the Train town okay so our last number in this lesson which is number 5 okay number 5 read the instruction together situation to see whether we need to produce one of these or both of this together using plastic through the plan processes up to 1,200 tons of plastic with at least three times three a 300 tons my fresh process for food drink there's a food to an X for food drink see Jim container drink on Tina's and it is at least they should be bigger than or equal to three and they're in this case as in ton and you earn it one per the profit the profit of producing food this is a great word for let me read in there for food containers all right never food containers for food per ton for breathing food container is $1,750 live a full container and then for why why is the wild represent us drink containers okay drink containers now what ring container one in this case it at least bigger than or equal to 450 tons and you will earn $20 per time $20 per time okay underneath the situation must be to use all of this or just one of this to maximize the profit let me represent a list must be processed for container Wow and this must be processed all right so register must be right I think maybe that the keyword must be must be here so which mean that we have to produce both of this together by the question how many of these should we produce to maximize the profit in this case okay so we must release blow of this because and this must be free process for food container and 451 must be produced for dreaming tender so we have to produce all of these together the question again how many should we produce each of this right now let's start first let me is beginning with this this is the smallest value of food for less number of time that will be produced for drink container of food drink container food drink sorry food food container not drink mistake if a food container okay so this is the smallest number which will be used for food container and his smallest number we reproduce for green container all right let's say let me try to represent this as the food container and drink and dinner together if we're going to produce 300 let's say we put the value and this is a 117 point 50x that for the price each time the be used for food in container plus with $20 time with Y which is the prize that we produce or week or the profit that we earn from producing each tons of green container so one got this equation they're trying to find the lowest one for X so let's say in this case if we produce only a smallest number of day so we have seven 10.50 to multiply by the smallest number of obvious three hundred plus twenty x now in this case we have one thousand two and hundred tons so if we produce three hundred of the food container then the rest we broke belongs to dream container so drink so 300 ton you still have one more 900 times of this so let's see how much you earn from purchasing using only the smallest number of ton on food container because it is the smallest one the borderline so you have 17 you have seventeen point five x three under plus plus with 20 times by 900 and that will give you twenty three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars if we reuse this much of this one now let's say you we try to increase this a little bit more now we will try to test more a bit on this let's say and now I've got to increase the number of tons I'm producing the food container so in other word let me put another one I will use 17 150 I've been pleased by 10 tons or less a wife of 500 sir for this one's 400 ton producing on this number on this because food container $20 last not if we using 400 tons on food container than the rest of the way which is 800 will belongs to the ring container let's see how much we earn by producing this 400 tons of food container and 900 tons of drink container so 17.5 multiplied by 400 plus with 20 x 800 you have only $23,000 okay now as you can see the moment you increase the number of the number of tons of food container the lower you will get your profit in this case so the more you increase the number of food container the more you decrease the profit you earn so therefore as you can see if you continue to increase this you will decrease this continually as well so the more you increase this module decrease the profit so therefore this is the maximum value of this so how much should you question the middle question what is the profit if the plan marks in my processing all right they don't ask for we need food container harmony dream container they ask for what is the profit so therefore the profit is in this case twenty three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars", "r6YdI6f7Ias": "hey class welcome back we left off with rates and so today we're going to use those rates too and those ratios to help us solve with something called proportions so today's goal is to solve proportions and then using a multiplier divisor finding that that's needed to solve the proportion so first a proportion is formed by two equal ratios perfor proportions have the same unit rate and proportions must also be written in the same units so we'll look at a few examples first let's just practice finding equivalent ratios so equivalent ratios are like equivalent fractions so you can find equivalent ratios by using a multiplier or a divisor and so for example 1 8 if you multiply both the top and bottom by 2 you would get 2 over 16. that is an equivalent fraction also known as an equivalent ratio now if you did um 1 8 and then multiplied them both by 3 that would create another equivalent rate so 1 times 3 is 3 8 times 3 is 24 so 1 8 is also equivalent to 3 over 24. so those are some examples of equivalent ratios you could also use a divisor so 4 6 if you divided both by 2 4 divided by 2 is 2 6 divided by 2 is 3 so 2 3 is also an equivalent ratio to 4 6. they're equivalent fractions one-half equivalent to a one-half might be you know four a's because four is half of eight 5 10 6 12 etc now you could make all of these by multiplying so one half times 4 is 4 8 one half times five is five tenths and one half times six over six is six twelfths okay seven tenths let's multiply both those by 2 to make an equivalent ratio so 7 times 2 is 14 20 or 10 times 2 is 20. so 14 over 20 would be an equivalent ratio you could take 7 over 10 and multiply them both by 4 too so 7 times 4 is 28 so 10 times 4 is 40. that would also be an equivalent ratio so that's how we can make equivalent ratios now let's look at if we can identify if two ratios form a proportion if two ratios form a proportion means that they are equal so if one-third and 5 15 are proportion that means that one-third would equal 5 15. i can check this by saying okay 1 times 5 is 5 so is three times five equal to fifteen since that is true that yes these two form a proportion one third is equal to five fifteenths how about 4 6 does that equal 16 over 18. since 4 times 4 is 16 what is 6 times 4 is not equal to 18. 6 times 4 is actually 24. so these are not equal so these two do not um form a proportion these are not proportional as what you would say not a proportion because they are not equal so we can use what we call the horizontal or vertical strategy to solve proportions so here's some proportions that need solving and why they need solving is because like one of the pieces is missing so one half equals x over 18. so here's what we're looking for is our x so the horizontal strategy means you go left to right so you look for what so from 1 to 2 and from 1 to x i'm going that way so i say 2 times what is 18 well it's 2 times 9 is 18 so then do the same thing on the top 1 times 9 is 9 which means that x equals nine we've just solved that proportion using the horizontal strategy if you go from in b g over 15 equals three over five now since you're going from a bigger number to a smaller number you are dividing so 15 divided by 3 equals 5. so g divided by 3 equals 3. so to solve this we need to figure out g divided by three equals three what could g be um you could also think of inverse operations so the opposite of dividing by 3 would be 2 oops multiply by 3 on both sides so that means that g would equal 9. so to check the answer 9 over 15 equals 3 over 5. so 15 divided by three is five and nine divided by three is three so it does work so g equals nine is our answer for that one how many of this one yeah i'm recording a video eighteen plus four eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two okay two and a two make twenty two sorry about that my five almost five year olds doing some math huh okay so in c two thirds equals eight over m so two to eight you need to multiply by four so two times four is eight so you can find the answer for m by taking 3 times 4 it will equal m and that means that m will equal 12 because 3 times 4 is 12. so that's a horizontal strategy working from left to right now the horizontal strategy sometimes doesn't work so we need the vertical strategy and so that would be like these problems because i don't know an a here two tens equals x over 15 nothing times 10 equals 15. so i can't solve it horizontally but you can solve it vertically because i know that if i go from top to bottom 2 times 5 is 10. so that means that x times 5 is 15. so now i have a an equation to solve so what number times 5 is 15 either use mental math or remember we can divide both sides by 5 and you would get x equals 3 because 3 times 5 is 15. so our answer to that proportion is 15. in b we'll do 3 times what is 6 since 3 times 2 is 6 do the same thing over here eight times two would be sixteen so m equals sixteen here we go from uh sixteen to four since you are starting with a larger number and getting smaller that's division 16 divided by 4 is 4. so then do the same thing here 12 divided by 4 is 3 which means that m equals three so we can use the this method and these proportions to solve problems like this then the zeta family wants to paint the inside of their house a light green the mixture requires two ounces of blue paint to three ounces of yellow the amount of paint the zetas need require 20 ounces 21 ounces of yellow paint how much blue paint is needed so it is requiring blue paint to yellow paint so i'm going to set up my proportion it's going to be blue to yellow so it's 2 ounces of blue to three ounces of yellow equals the amount of paint requires 21 ounces of yellow so yellow is on the bottom so 21 ounces goes here and then how many blue how much blue paint so x goes there so that's how we set it up so it's blue to yellow so two blue to three yellow then x number of blue to 21 yellow so remember when we first said um the proportions have to have the same rate and they must be written in the same unit so we're right blue on top yellow on bottom that's all in ounces we can solve this using the horizontal strategy since i know that 3 times 7 is 21 and i can go this way 2 times 7 gives me the answer for x and 2 times 7 is 14. so that means that i will have 14 ounces of blue paint is needed the ratio of cups of sugar to cups of flour and a cookie recipe is one to four so cups of sugar to flour so i'm gonna say sugar to flour and it's one to four set up a proportion set that equal to how many cups of sugar are needed when you have 20 cups of flour flour is on bottom 20 cups of flour so the 20 goes here i'm trying to solve for how many cups of sugar so that's your variable you could use s if you wanted as well but x works this one can be solved horizontally as well since i know that 4 times 5 is 20 one times five is five so that means that x equals five or i need five cups of sugar so these ones are both part to part examples because i was comparing blue to yellow and sugar to flower so part to part versus part to whole so read these ones very carefully these are part to whole examples there are only green and blue marbles in a bag of 70 marbles the ratio of green to blue marbles is three to four how many green marbles are in the bag so there are how many total green marbles so i know that this is part to whole because i'm looking for a total so i know that the green to blue marbles is three to four but i want to know how many are in the total bag so i'm gonna set it up as green to total which means that there are three green and if i count this up three plus four here green to blue three plus four is seven so there are a three to seven ratio and that means that if there are how many green if there are 70 total marbles so 70 is the total in all of the bag since green to blue is three to four i get that seven by adding the three plus the four so green to total is three to seven then i can solve by multiplying by tens and seven times ten is seventy three times ten is thirty that means that there will be thirty green marbles in that bag so we required a little bit more thinking there we had to find out the whole relationship so let's try another one jenny's math teacher uses bag of chips to teach concepts like probability the bag has two red chips for every six black chips if there are 20 red chips in the bag how many chips are there and all so i'm asking for the total and i'm given red chips so this time we're comparing the red chips to the total it says that there are two red chips for every six black chips well that means that there's two red chips out of eight total chips because two plus six is a total of eight two plus six is eight then if there are twenty red chips in the bag so twenty red is twenty on top how many total are there so we're looking for this spot right here now it happens that we're multiplying by 10 horizontally but this one can also be solved vertically because i know that 2 times 4 if i go from top to bottom is 8. so 20 times 4 gives me this answer and 20 40 60 80 would be my answer so there are 80 chips total okay try a few on your own make sure that you set it up i have a first one set up for you so make sure you set it up where you have the same variable on top and the bottom in both proportions set them equal to each other and then use either the horizontal or the vertical strategy to solve", "-wKStXQaik4": "hi I'm Steve Jones so I'm going to tell you how to change liters into milliliters well the first thing to understand is the basic system where we get that 1 liter is in fact 1,000 milliliters and we need to get the correct our abbreviations 1 liter liter is just an L and a milliliter is little M little L this is in fact the easiest process or the easier process because for every liter if we have five point six liters we simply have to multiply it by a thousand so it's going to be five point six times 1,000 milliliters now five point six times a thousand is best done by simply moving the decimal place if I write five point six there and look at this decimal place here I know that if I multiply a number by 10 I simply move the decimal point one place to the right if I want to move it if I want to multiply by a hundred I move it two decimal places to the right and if I want to multiply by a thousand I'll move it three decimal places and so on this goes on forever so I have to put notes here because there are no zeros there and my decimal point now is going to come there and this now becomes of course my comma for my thousands so five point six liters is actually five thousand six hundred milliliters so that is how we change liters into milliliters", "Ta-B-xqrBiM": "what's happening everybody today I'm super stoked to do this video for you all this is a video that I've wanted to do for a really really long time and I just haven't had the time to do it but now with like the current a virus pandemic quarantine all that I had enough time to do everything this is all of our saltwater fishing lures and this is gonna be a full breakdown on the inshore saltwater fishing lures everything from soft plastics hard plastics bucktails your metal baits big game stuff everything okay so when it comes to soft plastics at Berkley Gulp and Zeeman are the two main brands Berkley Gulp is a little bit more expensive but it has like a proprietary scent it actually sits in Berkley Gulp juice so swimming mullet and shrimp are two of the top Berkley Gulp soft plastics so they also have others like the jerk shad right here but for me and my tackle box I pretty much have the swimming mullet I use these primarily for flounder fishing but with Berkley Gulp they're a little bit more expensive the scent is amazing but they're not as durable so in the summer time I don't use as much Berkley Gulp because you just get what we call it tail biters and those are like bait fish they just nip at it and Berkley Gulp is it's very expensive and it just doesn't last that long so in the summertime I get a lot of questions about how can you eliminate tail biters with Berkley Gulp you can all you do is you use z-man okay so like Berkley Gulp when I use Berkley Gulp mainly is gonna be like when the bites slower like in the winter time or the spring time when the fish their metabolism is a little bit slower and they're not feeding as actively and they need a little bit more motivation to eat your lure then that's what I'll probably tend to use Berkley Gulp a little bit more is going to be during those times not too much in the summer time except for if I'm just targeting flounder then I'll probably use this so that will be in the summer time so that's kind of the exception is when I'm specifically targeting flounder is when I'll use Berkeley gold but Zeeman I will use in all applications all year round as you can see it's a lot more durable so this shrimp pattern works really well so for z-man this right here is the minnows and this is a great all year round of Bloor this lure works great in the summer time you can swim it across a flat you can bounce it on the bottom and then z-man also has their shrimp right here this is amazing you can fish underneath of a popping cork which a popping cork we're not talking too much about rigs today so if y'all don't know about popping corks we have tons of videos on how to fish a popping cork how to choose the right popping cork so ya'll definitely check those out we're gonna leave a link in the description below but this is a popping cork and it suspends your bait about two feet below the water surface and you're gonna fish that with a quarter ounce jig head and below a popping cork I like to fish the shrimp this shrimp right here this is the root beer color z-man and this is a great color I want to show you all so this is a great color for darker stained water like Louisiana Outer Banks Low Country Charleston Savannah this is great because especially so the rule of thumb for lures whether it's freshwater or saltwater the darker the water typically the darker the bait but this is a great color this is the root beer color it's got a chartreuse tail so it's got some gold flakes to it this is an amazing soft plastic that I'm gonna use underneath of a popping cork and I'm gonna pair that up with some procure of course and you're gonna catch pretty much every inshore species on this and then another favorite of mine is the z-man minnows II and my favorite colors are this is sexy mullet right here this works great in all water clarity's Creole croaker is my number one favorite color for z-man and this is my favorite pattern so this is a great winter time soft plastic in the winter in the early spring like right now and this is pretty much going to be the main soft plastic lure that I use under a quarter ounce jig head or a 1/8 ounce jig head so the weight of your jig head that you're fishing it on is going to dictate how slow or fast your lure is going to fall in the water column so in the winter I'll use a lighter jighead either a quarter ounce or a 1/8 ounce jig head fishing with this z-man minnows ii a lighter jig heads gonna give you a slower fall rate this fish they're moving slower in the winter time so they want a slower moving bait so that's why I'm gonna fish like a 1/8 ounce jig head something much much lighter to keep the bait in the strike zone a little bit longer so those right there these I use all year round but they're great in the winter in the spring because so in the winter time we don't have as much shrimp in our inshore waters our in short game fish they're keying in on just smaller bait fish all winter and spring long so these are great again you can swim them you can jig them you can just fish them a lot of different ways ok so going back to Berkley Gulp this is their jerk shad and this is another one of my favorite soft plastics you can fish this all year round again just watch out for those tail biters if you keep getting you know your bait destroyed then switched to z-man z-man also has a jerk shed as well and this just has a great darting action in the water so you can jig it on the bottom you can also kind of twitch your rod and give it like a darting action through the water column but this jerk shad is great can fish all species all year round for the jerk shad as well I really like this pink color striped bass and trout I feel like they absolutely love pink so I tend to use this mainly for those species ok so just some final things with soft plastics some other lures that I like are the swimming trout trick by z-man a little bit more slender profile this right here kind of imitates like a shrimp pattern but it also has like a paddle tail and this color right here electric chicken is great so I use this for soft plastics and hard plastics this is a great soft plastic that you can use all year round under a popping cork or straight to a jig head again you can swim it jig it everything so that's really the main benefit with soft plastics is the versatility that they allow again you can apply the specific action and technique to that bait so you can also swim it across a flat whether your search casting for a redfish or speckled trout so you know just soft plastics very versatile so the DOA bait Buster is great to use for snook tarpon and it's a great bait to use Florida Texas y'all love these down south so the DOA bait Buster is another soft plastic that I have in my tackle box and then we're gonna start talking about near lure but this is a this is the Paul Brown so what's up all y'all in Texas y'all love the Paul Browns fishing these on the flats in Texas we use these a lot in the fall when our trout come up shallow on the flats and they're feeding on some of the larger bait fish so these Paul Browns are very very effective it's got a slow slow it's a very slow sinking suspending kind of twitch bait action so it's got some great create action this is the Paul Brown by miral lure so for hard plastics all you got to know is pretty much amira lure these are my hard plastics right here we have top water and then we're gonna have our suspending and slow sinking near lures right here so I use pretty much these Nero Dean's everything from this is the double XL I tend to use this mainly in the fall this is a great fall bait because it's a larger profile in the fall your speckle trout redfish and your in short game fish they're gonna be feeding on larger size mullet and just larger size bait fish so electric chicken and Mardi Gras are my favorite colors for mira lure as well as this one I believe it's 808 but this is a highly highly effective but this is a great color for mirrolure so in the fall I like to use the double XLS and the excels just a little bit larger profile this is what our inshore fish are gonna be keying in on this is the Mardi Gras color another great great color and then if you're trolling from a kayak then this right here is the 52 in marsose low sinking head down just a little bit and this is a great action when you're trolling behind the kayak so this is a great mirror lure that you want to have in your tackle box as well then you've got some of your smaller profile this is the 17 and 18 mr right here this is just a smaller mirror Dean it's actually the 18 mr because it's the heavy Dean and it's got a little bit of a faster sink rate to the just regular 17 mr so this is the heavy Dean you can get longer casts on it and it's gonna sink a little bit faster and it's just got all these just have great action in the water so what its gonna do is it's gonna suspend or slow sink right there in the strike zone and then you just twitch your rod and it's just got some great great action right here so these are the mirror Dean's my favorite colors again Mardi Gras right here and electric chicken so these are great some other hard plastics that you want is gotta have top water if you don't like catching fish on top water then you're not living right this is a mirror lure this is the top dog jr. I believe and this right here just has a great walk the dogs side-to-side motion another topwater lure this is the chug bug and the chug bug is great for whether you're fishing up north for striped bass or down south for snook but as it doesn't have as much of a side-to-side walk the dog mission has more of just it pushes water it's got that concave kind of front to it so it's gonna push water and this is great for striped bass really really fun lure that you want to have in your tackle box right here some other hard plastics that I have is the Rapala skitter v10 I really like this color this is another top water and it's got that great kind of side-to-side walk the dog motion to it so that right there is pretty much it for my hard plastics now we're gonna move over and we're gonna talk about buck tails and just some of the other inshore saltwater fishing baits so when you're a cobia fishing this right here is all you need to know right here is a buck tail this is a 2 ounce bucktail this is what I like to use this is a bowed up two ounce buck tailbone up but made by boat up lures and I'll actually show you all this is my cobia fishing setup and I like to fish a two ounce bucktail I use a loop not just to give that natural action to it the colors that I like to use you know this is just from talking to some old-timers and some of my guide friends is that they tell me that orange kind of mimics more of like a crab that's what like the cobia sees is like a crab and you know the natural colors like this mimics more of like a bait fish either way you want to have a buck tail whether you're fishing on the boat or on the pier because the last thing you want to see if you're fishing on the pier is a school of cobia swim by and you've got nothing to throw at them so a two-ounce bucktail definitely want to have you know you're gonna be using forty to fifty pound leader line and you guys definitely have to have a buck tail in your inshore saltwater fishing tackle box buck tails are just a staple inshore saltwater fishing lure these are some smaller buck tails I don't this is like a half ounce bucktail this is I believe like a 1 ounce bucktail these you can use for everything trout flounder redfish everything but these are very popular for flounder fishing so if your flounder fishing and say like Chesapeake Bay bridge-tunnel in my backyard or you're fishing some offshore wrecks or artificial reefs off the coast of North Carolina Florida wherever then bucktails these ones are going to be great right here so you want to have some buck tails you can also tip these with some Berkley Gulp and just to give it a little bit more scent a little bit more action or you can even put procure on the bucktail itself that's something that we do as well so then some other inshore saltwater fishing lures that you're gonna want to have is this right here is a clark spoon these are our metal baits and this is what you use to troll for Spanish mackerel bluefish and you've got these sea strikers right here and these we have a full tutorial on how to use these but this is my trolling setup right here so you use this on a boat if you don't have a boat then you're gonna want to use a gotcha plug and I don't have one with me because right now we're quarantine and you know everything's pretty much closed right now so I'll have some footage here showing y'all what a chip plug looks like we'll have a link in the description below gotcha plugs are amazing if you're just land-based your fishing off appears you have to have to have a gotcha plug for sure it's one of the most fun ways to catch your inshore saltwater fish Spanish mackerel bluefish we've even caught cobia on a gotcha plug Christy my wife has that was awesome some of the other trolling setups is you have like these usery crystal minnows and these are great for trolling Spanish mackerel even king mackerel just everything hits this use area right here so a great near shore inch or trolling lure right here you can also cast it as well so you Azzurri this is a great insure saltwater fishing lure and then you've got these man's this is you've got like the stretch 20 stretch 25 these are what you use for striped bass fishing primarily like in the Chesapeake Bay thing is we've got some of our flies that I wanted to show you all for inshore saltwater fly fishing we've got some of these little like sand flea imitations these are great for pompano we've got clauser x' which are great for really everything you know just imitates like a bait fish as you can see it looks very similar to this electric chicken like mirror lure color so these are great for speckled trout redfish false albacore and this is a great Spanish mackerel fly right here it's like it Mehmet AIT's a glass minnow but my favorite for inshore saltwater fly-fishing is gonna be this shrimp pattern right here so this shrimp pattern you got the tube breastfeeds up here in the front that you know give it a little bit more weight and then on the back check that out it's got like actually like the eyes in the back and that looks really cool very realistic so this right here is what we've been catching all of our redfish on the fly and this is our actually right here so this this is our fly fishing setup and we'll be doing a lot more saltwater fly fishing and this is our Orvis Helios 3 actually yeah so our eight weight so anyways the shrimp pattern deadly gets it done all all over so anyways also that right there is a fundamental breakdown on just inshore saltwater fishing lures what I have in my tackle box when I use it and why I use it hopefully that helps y'all out and that's all I got free all today you guys get up off your butt go get yourself some fish peace out", "4IErqIMLwtQ": "\u266a

Auntie em, uncle henry... You won't let her,\nwill you? Of course we won't.\nWill we, em?", "4uQtJDf7drU": "How many cups are in\n3 and 1/2 gallons? So before even addressing this\nquestion, let's just think about how large a cup is. Actually, I'll give you a little\nbit of overview of how many cups there are in a pint,\nhow many pints in a quart, and how many quarts in a gallon. Let me just draw a cube here,\nand let's imagine that this is a gallon. The most common time we see\na gallon is when you see a gallon of milk. So let's say that that whole\nthing is a gallon. You can imagine if it had a\nhandle, it would be kind of a big gallon of milk. Now, there are 4 quarts\nper gallon. Let me write this over here. There are 4 quarts per gallon. So if I were to draw the quarts\nhere, I could divide this gallon into 4 quarts, and\nthen each of these sections would be a quart. So you would have 4 quarts. So this right here that I've\njust drawn in blue would be exactly 1 quart. And obviously, there's 4 of them\nin this entire gallon. Now, you can divide the\nquarts into pints. You have 2 pints per quart. So this quart that I drew here,\nI can divide it into 2, like that, and this little\nsection that I'm highlighting in magenta is a pint. That is a pint right\nover there. And then finally, there\nare 2 cups per pint. So this pint right here, I can\ndivide it into 2, and each of these will be a cup. So this section right\nhere will be a cup. Now, we can go straight and\nfigure out exactly how many cups there are per gallon. Actually, that might be\nan interesting way to think about it. If you have 4 quarts-- let's\nmultiply it right here. So you have 4 quarts per gallon times 2 pints per quart. What does this give you? This gives you 4 times\n2 is equal to 8. And then the quarts cancel\nout, and you have 8 pints per gallon. And that makes complete sense\nbecause we had 4 quarts in this gallon, and then\neach of those quarts have 2 pints in them. So 4 times 2. So 8 pints per gallon. And then we can multiply that\ntimes 2 cups per pint. So I could just copy and\npaste this right here. Actually, I should've\ncut and paste. Let me select it again. I want to do that so I get\nthat real estate back. So edit, cut, edit, paste. There you go. So now you multiply this\ntimes 2 cups per pint. And the reason why this will\nwork is because you have pints in the numerator. It cancels out with the pints\nin the denominator. And you will be left with-- I'll\ngo back to the yellow-- 8 times 2 is 16. In the numerator, we have\ncups per gallon. Now, we just figured how many\ncups there are per gallon. That makes sense. This section right here is\nexactly 1/16 of this entire cube, this entire gallon. But we haven't even answered\nour question. We want to figure out how\nmany cups there are in 3 and 1/2 gallons. So let's write it over here. So we're concerned with\n3 and 1/2 gallons. I don't like working\nwith mixed numbers. I like to turn them into\nimproper fractions. 3 and 1/2 is the same thing as\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. This is the same thing as 7/2. If you divided 7 by 2, you would\nget 3 with a remainder of 1, or this would be\n3 and 1/2, so this is the exact same thing. So we want to know how many\ncups are in 7/2 gallons. So what we want to do is end up\nwith cups, and we want the gallons to cancel out. So we have gallons in the\nnumerator right here. It's definitely not in\nthe denominator. And so we want to divide\nby gallons. And then we're going to\nhave a numerator. We have cups in the numerator. And how many cups are\nthere per gallon? Well, we just figured\nthat out. There are 16 cups per gallon. When you multiply these two\nquantities, the gallons will cancel out, and you'll just be\nleft with cups, and that's what we wanted. So it's going to be\n7/2 times 16. So this is going to be\n7 times 16/2 cups. You could divide 16\nby 2 to get 8. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So it just becomes 7 times 8\ndivided by 1, or just 7 times 8, which is 56. So this is equal to 56 cups. And this should make sense. This should be a much larger\nnumber because cups are a much smaller unit. So if you have 3 and 1/2\ngallons, you will have many, many, many more cups in that\n3 and 1/2 gallons, so this makes sense.", "NP9zugJf-e0": "[Music] hey guys today it's a nice pretty day so we go go to a private pond that's a few miles from me probably six or eight or ten miles from me I reckon and we're gonna see if we can catch some crappy wanna chatter baby how about this small chatter baby the other day just see if I could kiss them crackling let's go find out all right guys the first cast with a small ChatterBait I caught a fish let's see what except because I'm using a medium light rod a six pound line oh that's a crappy - all right come on up here paper mouth look at that hey guys I brought this little chat about with me I went down to the stores a little base shop beside of me yesterday just looking around and I've seen this little chatter baby let him go I've seen this little ChatterBait okay I think it's quarter ounce and I thought you know what that I would be good for crappie or small bass I'll be good in a farm pond had made plans won't come in here today that's why I bought it first cast out there that caught a crappie on it man what do you think of that alright guys I got one this time is taking drag I don't have my drive wheel tight because I'm using six pound of line but it feels a little nicer I'm walking around the pond just casting toward the banker without the wind this is a windy side he's coming to my right here I've even had a couple guys to jump on the fight no he's little it's a crappy look here he fought better than he fought harder than them a little basket heavier - and he's wider so you know when he turns in the water like this he moves a lot more water my name is a little nicer fish and Ikes like I've got my drag set pretty light I can I can pull it out with my hands here easily keep pulling a couple times believe it or not when using six pound test you don't set you drag too tight guys because yeah that's how you get that's how they break you off your light line fishes you set to drag pretty light so I've got a set to her oops I'm gonna find a pond you know and I can adjust it right here in this rear guys I got a fish while I was talking to he get that thing gonna hit the water hey turtleman you know y'all know turtleman has a channel you put most y'all probably know that I didn't know what I seen any other day it's called - I think it's called the original turtleman channel okay I haven't watched I just like to watch him he's on TV I wonder what happened to him let's see you that's another crappy guys now he hit that thing as it was falling to the bottom for ever had to bottom he had it that was fun I don't think it's the pennybaker go this is the next cast guy after the one I just showed you so it's back to back cast like say having fun for this time of year I mean look here know the crappie now my tweeting cause he's big recipes well he's probably he's probably hi he's probably 10 and 1/16 okay look at this crap and come on Big Boy oh gosh that's a nice crappie guys what y'all think that's a decent crappie yeah let's what got you in trouble buddy a little Thai ChatterBait look at that we all think that's a nice crappie enjoy captain crafty like gathers put him back damn and you know what I'm gonna do guys I want y'all know what I guess another one right here it's a little monster go head go away short trees white blue white two and a little white trailer came with it I cut about a half inch off the skirt slow it down to it title on this rod 6-pound test medium light rod got a good tip on it I throw it good little seer wheel drag reel reel has a rear drag I can say that Wow as well Roy is six foot nine it's a TP one loose nice little off mic rock is the bass fish semester but it worked great I knew I needed I needed a little bit more rod for this little ChatterBait and at least one at six pound test so I took this with me they use it for that guys like I said I've seen that China bait in the stored on the crappie and I never heard of anybody fishing for crappie with the but I have now cuz it's me I enjoyed it guys I hope you enjoyed it hey there's something else you can try a ChatterBait for crappie guys please saw so hit that subscribe button don't cost your thing helps me grow guys I need this channel I hear a lot of people's make the comments they have always want you to sub you know we can't sell t-shirts and stuff till we get to a certain number we got to have like a thousand subscribers or something I don't know exact numbers but sin that area we've got to have a certain amount of numbers before we can sell merchandise so YouTube grades us-based if you want to say that by the subscribers so that's why we actually you subscribe because we're going to grow we gotta grow to get anymore so please please subscribe if you're watching this I'm trying to do stuff on bass and crappie just like this ChatterBait thing I've never seen the best through that I'm trying to come up the things that are different I've told you this on another video I've got some new stuff I bought that I'm going to be throwing in don't videos about in the next month or so some things that I've never seen before and some things some come from mystic taco box and mr. Tata box buying it but what guys from Christmas guys they don't give it to me but some things came in and I've never seen before that I think that's neat and I'm gonna try those and I'll share that with you and I bought some stuff at Bass Pro Shop the other day that I've never seen before we're something new and I've never seen on YouTube I've been looking around and kicking around hit the crappy stuff lately and I haven't seen it I'm gonna share that with you the fish has just taken off here in Virginia and so we're gonna make some videos using the new products so you're learning for me a new project that you want to bomb and I so I'm helping you guys learn about new products new techniques and I'm spending the money buy the stuff save you some money there's a tip for you right there watch me catch fish if I don't catch fish on they will be on this video that's for sure right they're not any good I want to tell you we'll see you next time right here on fishing Lake Country [Music]", "d20y3ehwvxE": "hello everyone this is going to be a series of individual videos on testing of many do-it-yourself alcohol stoves that I built out of small clear lead clear lid containers cost anywhere from a dollar to two dollars each I built a couple stainless steels around seven dollars each this introduction part of the video will be included at the beginning of each stove video burn test so skip ahead a little bit if you have already watched this portion of the video and want to get right to the burn testing each stove and video will be numbered and tested go to video number one if you want a basic description of the many stoves I'll try to put all the specs in the description box of the video when I'm going to test is the warmup time boil time burnout time water temperature and surrounding air temperature I'll also include the alcohol capacity of each stove the size of the stove and the various materials used such as ten aluminum stainless steel there'll be a jet type a wick type using carbon felt right here and that'll be to compare the different designs and materials each test will be done with the same aluminum pot has a five inch diameter bottom I bought it at walmart for a couple bucks well i'll be using tap water it's around 60 degrees plus or minus five degrees two cups of water and there will be a couple tests that i'll use four and six cups of water surrounding air temperature is in my garage it's winter time in Iowa but my garage is around 40 degrees so little cool my water temperature thermometer is about five degrees low so keep that in mind and all the specs that i'm doing here is is not exact it'll be approximately i have some extra materials to build other stoves so if you have any suggestions or want me to try something different please let me know and I'll do it let's would get started with the testing all right let's start do it yourselves alcohol stove number eight similar to alcohol stove number seven the holes are a little bigger about 3 30 second size holes half inch apart down about an inch from the top of the stove it's a cam and Stein the only thing different with this is I used for the centerpiece i use the eighth inch thick piece of aluminum pipe i think i bought four foot of it for a dollar or four dollar so then i cut it up into shorter pieces you want to do the same thing make it so it seals cut it the right height so it seals to the top on this one I put some high temperature silicone sealant around the top and a few dabs in the bottom of course you have to have slits in the bottom so the alcohol can run through the bottom and in between the walls this one all has a capacity of about two to two and a half ounces so this one's a lot heavier the aluminum's thicker so this one weighs about four ounces 3.9 stove number seven ways about 1.6 ounces so you can tell the difference with the thinner aluminum this one's a little more heavy duty but let's start the test stove number eight okay let's light her up let water temperatures 64 degrees plus or minus it's just tap water around 60 degrees air temperatures little below 40 degrees oh I forgot to start it we got her start see how long it takes to warm up this is the same as stole number seven same container but the inside is a eighth inch thick aluminum it's a little heavier duty here I built these stones mostly for boiling more water but i'm using three-quarter ounce just so you can compare them to all the other stoves of denatured alcohol three quarters of an ounce if you want to see it boil six cups of water go to stove number 7.5 it'll boil six cups excuse me again these are the cam and Stein spice containers they're made out of ten and they work better with the aluminum inserts inside walls if you can find a thin piece of alumina 'that would fit right inside of this and get a nice tight seal around this Ed's I'd be nice I haven't been able to find one yet we'll see how this one goes we're up to one minute 14 seconds it hasn't the jets are still haven't started these jet holes are a little larger than the stove number seven so we'll see what that happens with that think seven was more of a five 64th inch sized hole and these are three thirty second side sighs holes the Jets started at 1 minute 42 seconds we'll let him warm up before we put the pot on again if you put that pot on with this cold weather and the Jets die down you can lift up one side of the pot until it warms up real well that pot kind of seals the top of that stove doesn't allow much air to get in so the Jets could go out but this one seems to be working fine so far we're at two minutes the judge bloomed at a minute 42 seconds see what it takes to get this to a boil stove number eight capacities probably two to two and a half ounces well shut it down till we get to about five minutes where water temperatures at 88 degrees okay we're at five minutes water temperature 144 degrees you can see the flame to run it up the side a little bit so this one is burning pretty quick I think with the larger-size jet holes you can experiment a little bit with the size hole but I found that anywhere from 5 64 to 3 30 seconds works pretty well for what I'm doing this the cam and Stein spice containers has a magnet I stick them to my toolbox the magnets nice it also holds it down to the metal pan if that's what you're cooking on for up to six minutes 171 degrees based on previous tests that should start to boil at 205 degrees that's hissing up 180 the water's starting to make noises there's a little bit of steam coming out the top 185 it's coming up to boil pretty quick here 190 sounds like boiling but nope yeah 7 minutes 19 201 should be boiling yep it's just barely boiling seven minutes 20 seconds seven minutes 20 seconds we'll see how long it takes for it to go out stove Do It Yourself still alcohol stove number eight looks like it's going out just barely got to a boil before it went out with them larger holes the alcohol burns out quick so we'll call it seven minutes 45 seconds out no it's still going we'll call it seven minutes 50 seconds seven minutes 50 seconds stove number eight thanks for watching everyone", "WZjLp14_Yrg": "we go goodnight oh okay everyone up and back so I've been your teacher for additional English in n6 I hope you would have a nice weekend today we're gonna continue with the study sit comfortably just listen if you have any questions of course just fight again and I'll try to answer those questions as we go along okay they say today you're gonna have a recap about critical thinking what is critical thinking so really it's looking at a balanced picture and we will review the facts evidence to make their decision with touch me so take a muscle so it enables you to understand logical connections between ideas right what is that well this is the kind of graph where you were learning process you can see very basic there's nothing to more difficult I have two skills so at the bottom we have remembering some things there's something like the memory capital a country that's remembering it then the next stage the next step is understanding why it's city so it could be that there are many people there there could be better infrastructure whether it's transport so as you look at different cities around the budget what city is and then you can see let me go to the next level working from great basic sorry you know what kind of real life skills does that include it uses for higher water spirits could be something like evaluating so let's have a look at the example where an engineer needs to sort solve a problem with building a bridge so he applies his knowledge physics to the problem of building a bridge many might analyze different ways doing them with shape size materials then you need to ask questions such as which which what will rule the last anarchist what will be the strongest will be the cheapest so the other ones are thinking about materials then you evaluate soar up there look at this picture you're just applying our knowledge you analyze the problem now we're evaluating so let's say that the bridge needs to be made fast and at least to last about 10 years so here we can think about the materials of anything you say most likely we can use wood and not Spain and not the metal so we prepare you a tip and what's left now we put the bridge so you can see we're using these more advanced higher motor skills to think about problems so this is the kind of thing you'll be doing in your essay which is coming up so the important things in the x-ray would be analyzing doing some research on the Internet communicating with people so maybe you can get people your friends to comment and communicate ideas to use whether they agree or disagree something like that and then coming up with maybe a creative idea which is writable so that's that's right in the writing you have to connect ideas about connecting to different ideas similar they could be very opposite ideas so we're going to look at the transition words okay it's all about the connection we'll see when we get a better reader all right these categories you would use most likely in the assignment the essay that has been assigned so the first one I want the categories is more information second one is an illustration this is like an example third he is cause and effect I'm sure you all know cause effect the previous modules unit last year the fourth is emphasis emphasis is stressing accentuated fifth is contrast Paris Lee suit Janina generalities talking about general ideas and then the seventh is time and then finally electives to sum up to finalize a statement which is a summary alright let's get started so what is more information well and linked to ideas using these words ones in bold you can see we have a bold writing this one on this one the ones that are most often used so it was an example for this well there are two ideas the first idea is online learning is effective and the second idea is students can learn at their own pace so then you can see these are similar ideas they fit together and it's a case of more information so we can use in addition not will say to connect these ideas okay so the connection is online learning is effective in addition the students can learn at their own pace see that's more information next one an illustration so these are some examples of given its a little list so we have again the ones in bold or most opportune years of talking that's spoken language but also be written as well these are the most useful out of a Spanish obviously there are more for this so let's have a look at another example we might want to talk about animals come out at night so you have nocturnal and if you want to keep in example what comes how I liked hunting using an illustration this is Aquabats okay cause enough it wasn't a favorite so I'm just reading something that do we take notes and there's no need to take notes this is what on noodles if you want to watch a pre-recorded video you can see one of this new school website so moving on the cool because of an effect you can see as a result may use this one this one Yuba gives a lot of time and this one you would look so causal effect let's have another look some ideas so the idea number one dots are friendlier than cats so looking at are these similar ideas are these contrasting ideas and how can we join them together alright so this is giving us reason dogs are friendlier than cats because they are more loyal ok central no need to take notes okay moving on next one is emphasis this is stressing something so we use words like especially obviously you may know those ones already so we look at a couple of examples so we're talking about the first light beer of lottery my second idea is the probability and no chance of winning are you doing that in the example sentence I like to buy lottery tickets every week obviously but I can't help myself emphasizing okay comparing and contrasting and see here other transition rates by either compare similarly contrasting otherwise on the other hand so we have another example it's a kpop has many fans his idea number one idea number two I don't write it like it so how can you join layers well they're contrasting ideas so we've using contrasting audiences any one of these words blue keep up as many fans all right moving on this is generalities are talking in general usually come across already the ideas students at my work okay in general students prefer not to do it's not right not to happen so did not students okay you know sequence or a time you must know these first second third finally during so this of examples we have you have my dinner the one evolution and then number two years alone so currently because of the lockdown you know air pollution is currently because there isn't much traffic or evidence okay and then finally this is the eighth category which you might use fever essay we have a summary so we use words like summing up to summer in short in conclusion to conclude ideas so again we've got the curve in nineteen and hardships hardship just means our times so having to say I'm not allowed to go out the thing with the family 24 hours per day whoever but then we can see it anyway that says to sum up babe it 19 has caused many hardships but staying at home but it is better to be safe all right there so any questions so far the questions can you remember the categories you can give me an example of one of the categories we talked about by the way there are no sub types subtitles you can listen again then let me spot you are the first Magma's more information in the other categories you can remember type away that's right sequences one anymore maybe all right so that's summer so these are the eight categories in news all right time for a quiz this illustrate yes thank you illustrations thank you for its right any others generality cause and effect okay sorry about my handwriting all right so there's the big categories again all right I'm time for a quiz are you ready for quiz that's a is the first one so do you use read listening let's do you use their form do you use for Fiat Lampert first of all you have to find the two ideas and decide whether they are similar they are contrasting what category we need to use with this one so there hasn't been much rain the risk of forest fires is high what do you think the best transition to connect ideas wait for an answer somebody's have comparing contrast which do you like not really okay somebody said therefore so that is like that seems to be the best answer because we not a lot of rain and so forest fires yes that is correct and what category is that well okay let's have a look at another example yes therefore is correct so let's have a look at another example something I don't cry but the film the notebook had me in tears what do you think about this one and the chat delay case especially is one answer so think about this this is overtime so you might be looking through word that means the same as usually usually I don't cry but I did cry yeah okay so got some right answers there generally speaking is correct well this of course is a G and morality but done everyone has generally the next one there you've got the two larger birds and then we have examples of birds that are March to EMU and ostrich so which is the best option it finally mainly something wait for notes here right here it will be frantically typing yes it's like me getting namely as the main one so yeah this is keeping an example same name of the words if it is to be including for example all right so this is illustration next one you've got a favorite person famous favorite so we have a description working description of working things that do new ideas here yes in case of this one is 20 similar ideas and she live got to you something like this in addition to which most of you have stored up and of course this is supplying giving more information right more information okay thing this is the last example so how must be handed in on time blah blah blah they will not be gradient so you have to do something or something else give you some time to write down it's a bit of a lag delay yeah a couple of ounces otherwise so it's contrasting they did again wait so they the next one nobody knew where the new student was problem but love LeBlanc Lucy asked him he was from a spring for some someone's having trouble typing Kenny yeah so it's going to be later right this is about time and sequence of time so after later she passed him yeah to fight the information competing in it's about sequence at a time and that brings us to the end transition limits so does anybody have any questions about that don't forget you can access recording on Moodle okay so you can read watch the video and do the quiz maybe any more questions is everything clear remember you can use these to relate ideas in your assignment this would be a writing assignment at the end my questions I mean all right that's cool so if you doing the video subscribe and smash that like button okay see you next time alright bye bye for now", "2-RkyE66k2A": "hi everybody this is gonna be a recipe for bacon cheeseburger meatloaf as you see we have bacon ground beef breadcrumbs tomato ketchup sorry French onions Toby Jack and washed your sire sauce so that's all going to be mixed in I have the oven preheated at 375 I do have a known confection bake but you can also do the bake at 375 so let's get this all mixed up so chopped up right you can see everything okay okay alright so I have three pounds of meat guess I should have had it open this is for three pounds because I have a fake army two feet so and a lot of them like the leftovers of this so this will mixed everything in here I've got a pound of bacon to put in so and I of course hook that up and then chopped it up before I mix it in with the meat there's the meat go ahead and like since it was in that cheap stuff so what I like to do first is add the way I did catch up and I bought this I'm sorry I do not have measurements really I think I found the recipe so if I find the recipe that I found I'll put it in the bottom or a link to it in the bottom but I just kind of eyeball it you don't need a whole lot of ketchup but I got two eggs there's three pounds of meat I got two eggs now why not go ahead and shut them down and we're gonna do breadcrumbs I got plain breadcrumbs sometimes I have Italian breadcrumbs and I'll throw that in too if I don't have the plain breadcrumbs you just kind of eyeball it because you're gonna put your putting French onions in there to it which are dry so you kind of got to balance the wet with the dry I guess so okay we're gonna do wash your cider just a little bit you don't want too much but just I got three pounds of meat so I'll just gonna eyeball it a little bit I don't know that I got so these uh keys in the cheese or bacon cheese or meatless I just like Toby Jack trying to get it all shredded in the bag a little bit more but that's the rest of that bag yeah this is Aldi cheese all these cheese was good so that's a good thing she's in there and then when do this is a pound of bacon no that's already cooked and shut up and then I got some French onion so you can use any kind of French onion it's just regular of course I just bought it so I got it okay this is a little tiny container this is only two point eight ounces so and I bought two of them so I like I like French onions for some odd reason so I put a good fit in here yeah the whole container yeah pretty good two point eight ounces and then what you do is you mix it up so put your hands mix it all together and if you mix them fall off a little bit and your counter it's kind of halfway clean just pick it up put it back in there keep going yes I washed my hands sure you wash your hands clean and tidy really go you got to get it all mixed up in there so really I put it in a meat loaf pan but you can kind of shape it out on the pan and put it in there don't really matter okay I got a meat pan to put it in and I don't I don't spray it with great starter things of course me this meats gonna make race for the cry oh that's good this one makes it get all the stuff in the bottom I don't even add salt and pepper just cuz it's got all the flavor in it so and then but even good mixed up let me get my loaf pan I'll show it to you huh [Music] okay here's my lip pan you see it okay yeah there's my lips and this is what I do take the whole thing you see that no pull it over a little bit okay there the whole thing that's mission in there can't make sure there ain't no air you know in it this is it in there but then again like I said if you got a flat sheet or whatever or a little one-inch you can kind of shape it into a loop this is what I did and then I pop it in the oven here I'll show you I guess I don't know if I can take you in the camera but we'll see let me wash my hands okay so when I'm pop this in the oven at 375 I'm gonna do it for like 15 minutes here we go trying to take you with me to do this oh no I got open the oven first hold on pop it in the oven I'm gonna do it on the top rack and again it's it convection bake 375 don't put the timer 50 minutes okay don't let go we'll come back when that 50 minutes is done okay everyone has been the 50 minutes I'm gonna take this meatloaf out of the oven and then um uh sprinkle some of the French onions on top and then we're gonna add another 15 minutes to it so okay hold on I've gotta drink some of this grease off the teeth that's why there's like a little Bowl sitting there if you don't see it further drain this off trying to get as much off as I can I'll like resist was ridiculous that's what it looks like right now my head some of the French onions to top like I said I got these I got little packets because that's all they had at Dollar General so and I didn't know I have had enough at home so I'm just using either one double this one open I'm gonna sprinkle some on top Oh I like French onions like I said so I like sprinkle log on top and you kind of you know you got a very like I said I have a big army to feed I have eight people to feed at night and this might give them a few leftovers maybe so let's do it like that I want to sleep it like that I'm gonna pop it back in the oven or like yeah pop it in the oven for about 20 or 15 more minutes I know I don't like these too dark so but some of them fail but it's all okay we're gonna set it for another 15 minutes and then I've got potato as I usually do with the meatloaf so okay we'll be back in about 15 minutes all right it's been the 15 minutes let's see what it looks like and there it is that's still a little dark for me for the French onions I kinda wish I would have went in but the meat needed to cook a little bit longer so but there's the end and then I'll slice them up and then I'll have a picture at the end of my whole plate thanks for watching guys make sure you like share and subscribe have a good one bye", "14ZSNwzTWVk": "hi this is Julie here to bring you a wholefoods fast tip and today's tip is learning how to measure without measuring spoons and I originally write about this in the splendid tables how to eat supper book and it's something I had kind of been doing for a while but I was never quite sure how accurate I was being when I wasn't measuring and so this kind of provided me with a concrete way to test myself and really get accustomed to how much I was putting in why would you want to learn to measure without measuring spoons well when you're doing cooking something like a soup or you know a casserole you don't really need to be as exact when you're baking is it when you're baking something like a cake so if you're off just a little bit it's not going to matter and it also speeds up your cooking time considerably because you don't have to stop get a measuring spoon you know let's say you need one teaspoon of this one teaspoon of that you don't have to stop and wash between to you know make sure you're not mixing up the flavors in the container so that's why you do it so I'm just going to start and show you her tip and that is to learn how to do it you measure into your hand for probably I would guess like a couple weeks to a month so here's my fourth of a teaspoon so I measure it in my hand and they say okay that's what a fourth of a teaspoon looks like in my hand and then and you do this every time you're cooking before you throw your half a teaspoon of salt into your dish you want to throw it in your hand just to get an idea okay so that's a half of a teaspoon and then you remember that okay that's what a half a teaspoon looks like in my hand and then the teaspoon it's okay so that's what it 1 teaspoon looks like just get used to trying it with the different things you're doing it so if yours calls for half a teaspoon of oregano you know throw it in there four calls for one teaspoon of chili powder throw it in the throw it in here and then in your hand", "R0KlzkzHCb4": "hi there today we're going to discuss soft portion relationships independent practice one through eight page 59 here's example number one remember the cross products of any proportion are equal so i can multiply 1.5 times p and that's going to equal 6 times 10 and so i'm left with 1.5 p equals 60 and now this is a multiplication equation so if i want to find out what P is i'm going to divide by 1.5 on both sides and i'm going to get p equals 40 because 60 / 1.5 is 40 okay here's our next example 11 times p is going to equal the same thing as 44 times 5 so 11 times p will just equal 11 p + 44 times 5 is 220 now i'm going to divide by 11 on both sides because i want to undo the multiplication so p is going to equal 20 okay here's my next example 2 over w equals zero point four over 0.7 so i'm going to set up my cross products so 0.4 times w is going to equal to x 0.7 0.4 times w is 0.4 w + 2 x 0.7 is 1.4 now i want to undo my multiplication so i'm going to divide on both sides 0.4 / 0.41 so i'm going to W and then 1.4 / 0.4 is 3.5 all right next one ever auto paid dollar 12 or doesn't matter this local grocery store determine the cost of three eggs so you have to set up your proportion which is two ratios so we're going to compare money over eggs so I'm going to say cost over X so when you set up a portion make sure that it's equal on both sides so the cost here was a dollar 12 and a dozen is 12 they want to know how many for 3x so you don't know the cost what you want to know for three so we can just set up our cross products 12 times X and then 112 times 3 and then we should get 12x on the left and on the right we should get 3.36 now we have to undo our multiplication here so it's divided by 12 12 / 12 is 1 so i can just leave an X and the answer here is going to be 28 cents all right number 5 Sheila makes three ounces of blue paint with two ounces of yellow pee she decided to create 20 ounces of the same mixture how many ounces of yellow paint does sheila need for the new mixture this one was a little tricky because of the way that you have to set it up they actually want how much yellow paint that she has compared to the total amount of pain because they said 20 ounces total of the same mixture so we just have to make sure that we're setting this problem of correctly so here the original was two ounces of yellow paint the total amount is two plus three so that's why it was really tricky they don't they want to know how much yellow they are going to need but you know that the total is 20 so you can go ahead and set up your cross products 5 times x equals 2 times 20 so on the left 5 times x equals 5x 2 times 20 is 40 so to solve this problem we want to undo our multiplication so we're going to divide by five on both sides because it's an equal sign 5/5 is one so i can just leave it as X 4505 is 8 so we would say eight ounces alright and let's not forget our unit all right now we're going to get into some problems where they want you to use an equation rather than a proportion you can use a proportion if you want i'm going to show you the equation way so a car can travel 476 miles on 14 gallons of gas write an equation relating the distance D to the number of gallons gee how many gallons of gas is a car need to travel 570 miles so here we have the distance which is d equals some number we don't know yet times a number of gallons which they said was G ok so we want to know how many is just one of the relationship between miles and gallons so we've got four hundred and seventy six miles over 14 gallons ok and we can just divide this out so we have 476 / 14 that equals 34 that means the number we multiply their distance x or gallons is 34 so our equation is going to be d equals 34 times G now we want to find out for 578 miles so that goes under D so we have 578 equals 34 times G now we want to make sure that we solve for G because we want to know how many gallons so we're going to undo our multiplication by dividing ok and it really doesn't matter if there are variables on the left of the right doesn't matter all right so 34 / 30 for was one so G is going to equal 17 gallons again don't forget your units alright here's our next one number seven mrs. Baker p250 45 pounds of bananas write an equation relating the cost of number of pounds of bananas how much would mrs. Baker pay for eight pounds of bananas so we want to write our equation so we know that our cost which is C equals some number times the number of pounds and the variable they chose for that was p okay so to find that out we would set up our cost / our pounds so 250 / 5 equals fifty cents a pound so this would be our number in our equation so our equation is going to be C equals 0.5 0 times P now what did they give us they gave us 8 pounds so let's substitute 8 into our equation so you don't know the cost so that equals C and fifty cents times e this one is easy because we can just multiply straight across this equals four dollars all right here is our last problem a woman who is 64 inches tall has a shoulder width of 16 inches write an equation relating the height to the width find the height of the woman who has a shoulder of 18.5 inches okay so we have our height which they want us to call h and that equals some number times the width w okay so let's first find out what that number is so we have 64 inches tall over 16 inches and that actually equals 4 so this is the number that's being multiplied times width so we have our equation H equals four times you now we have to substitute what we know we know that our width is 18.5 inches so this one's another easy one for x 18.5 and so that equals h equals oops oops h equals seven to four inches and that's your final answer hope that video is helpful thank you bye", "SUOIKocsNOk": "[Music] hey guys welcome to hot box it's a little straight my boy will today we got another dope video for you guys we're gonna be smoking a

please for god's sake let it be over soon we smoked probably a quarter a quarter of it yeah that's a lot of weed i don't know how many times we're gonna have to cheat this until it's done how many

data sheets and they see a mix this product at one part product to three parts water and they say well how much is a part well we're going to talk a little about that today and show that it doesn't matter what size container you're working with or how much material you're working with as long as each part is equivalent to the others my first things first always make sure you get your proper PPE on when mixing product if we're mixing this product say at a one-part cleaner to three part water dilution ratio I'm gonna take one part of cleaner and I'm gonna take three parts of water always add the water to the bucket first and then add the cleaner so in this case I would take three of these buckets pour those in and then add my equal one part of cleaner to the bucket after that it doesn't matter if we're talking individual gallons if we're talking fives if we're talking pints even a cap full I've got one part to four parts dilution ratio and I just want to make a little tiny bit up I can take one part of the cleaner and mix it with four equal parts of water and I've got my proper ratio so again a part is a part is a part it doesn't matter if it's a gallon a cap full of five a drum

(upbeat music) Hey, everybody. It's Natasha of NatashasKitchen.com, and today I'm gonna show you\nhow to make red velvet cake. This is moist, and you're gonna love how we make the ultimate\ncream cheese frosting. And I'm craving cake so let's get started. (drums) You'll need to preheat your\noven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, then grease two nine-inch\ncake pans with butter. Also, to keep the cakes\nfrom sticking to the pans, I also like to dust with\na little bit of flour, and make sure to tap out the excess. Once you have your cake\npans buttered and floured, set those aside until\nyou're ready to use them. This quick prep will ensure\nthat the cakes release easily. Now we'll make the cake batter. Combine two and a half\ncups of all purpose flour, two tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa, a teaspoon of baking soda,\nand half a teaspoon of salt. Quickly whisk those together\njust until they're combined. Now, we're gonna sift the dry ingredients to make sure everything\nis really well blended. Sifting also ensures that your cake crumb is soft and fluffy, and I will link to the\nsifter in the notes. Set aside the dry ingredients. Now in a large mixing\nbowl, combine one half cup or one stick of softened unsalted butter, and one and a half cups of sugar. Cream those together\nwith an electric mixer. It takes a minute or two for the butter and sugar to come together,\nand you just wanna keep mixing until the sugar is\nmoistened with the butter, and it has a powdery snowy consistency. You'll need two room temperature eggs. Add those one at a time,\nbeating well with each addition. Once the eggs are well incorporated, add two teaspoons of vanilla extract, and we're using our homemade extract. I will leave a link to\nthe two-ingredient recipe in the notes. Quickly blend in that vanilla. Now with the mixer on, add three fourths cup of vegetable oil, or you can use a light olive oil. I have one cup of room\ntemperature low-fat buttermilk. And into that, I'm gonna stir in one teaspoon of white vinegar. The buttermilk and vinegar mixture adds great moisture to the cake and activates the baking soda so you end up with a very fluffy cake. Add the buttermilk mixture, and blend until smooth\nand well-incorporated. Now add your dry ingredients all at once, and with the mixer on low\nspeed, stir until well blended. Stop mixing once it's evenly moist and you no longer see\nany dry streaks of flour. Also make sure to scrape down\nthe bowl while you're mixing to catch any pockets of flour. Now last but not least, we're gonna turn this into\na red velvet cake batter. To make it that classic red color, I highly recommend using\na gel food coloring. This is the one that I'm using, and I will link to this\nin the recipe notes. All you need is half a teaspoon, and a little bit goes a long way. You could even use less food\ncoloring if you wanted to, just add it to your preference using the mixer on low speed, mix until the color is well\nincorporated into the batter, scraping down the bowl as needed. Once the batter is uniform in color, you're gonna transfer it, and divide it evenly between\nyour prepared cake pans. My best tip for getting even cake layers is to use a digital kitchen scale. Zero out your cake pan, then you can see exactly how much batter you've\npoured into each cake pan. And make sure to get every last drop of that yummy red velvet cake batter. Now use your spatula to spread the batter evenly into the pans, and\nwe're gonna transfer that and bake in a preheated oven\nat 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes. What I love about this recipe\nis the cake layers rise evenly and have a level top, so\nthere's no need to trim. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into\nthe center of the cake, and it should come out clean. Once the layers are out of the oven, let them rest in their\npans for about 20 minutes. Run a thin spatula or knife\naround the edges of the cake to loosen them from the pans. Now carefully invert the\ncake onto a wire rack. Sometimes you need to\ngive the pan a little tap for it to slide out, but\nnormally, they slide out easily. Once your layers are on your\nrack, you wanna set those aside and let them cool completely\nto room temperature before adding the frosting\nand assembling your cake. To make our favorite\ncream cheese frosting, you'll need one and a half cups or three-fourths pound of\nunsalted softened butter. Make sure you do not\nover-soften your ingredients. This has been at room temperature for about an hour and a half, and you can see that you can indent it slightly with your finger, but it should still be a\nlittle bit cool to the touch. Add that butter in pieces\nto a large mixing bowl, and use an electric mixer\nto beat that on high speed for about a minute, or until it's smooth\nand lightened in color. And it's important to scrape\ndown the bowl periodically to make sure you don't\nhave any chunks of butter that aren't blended. (mixer buzzing) Now add your softened cream cheese. And again, you wanna use\na block style cream cheese and make sure it's not overly softened. The key to having a thick and spreadable cream cheese frosting is to make sure that your ingredients are at the right temperature. (mixer buzzing) Now beat those together\non medium-high speed until the cream cheese and\nbutter are well incorporated, scraping down the bowl as needed. Now add one tablespoon of vanilla extract and an eighth of a teaspoon\nor a generous pinch of salt. Beat those in until well combined. I like to add four cups or a total of one pound of powdered sugar, because I think it has the\nbest balance of sweetness. We're gonna add the powdered\nsugar one cup at a time, and mix on low speed\nuntil it's incorporated. (mixer buzzing) Once all of the powdered sugar is in, kick the mixer up to high speed and continue beating for\nanother two to three minutes or until the frosting is\nwhipped, thick, and spreadable. All right, our frosting is ready, and our cake is now at room temperature so it's time to assemble. Place that first cake layer\nonto a serving platter, and we're gonna add a\ngenerous amount of frosting over the top. I love a thick layer of\nfrosting between my cake layer, so I'm using about a third of the frosting Spread that evenly to\nthe edges of the cake. Now top that with your second cake layer. And I like to place it upside down so that you have the\nsmoothest, most even surface for the top. Now we're gonna crumb coat the cake, which means that you're gonna\napply a thin layer of frosting all the way around the cake. Crumb coating glues the crumbs down and seals in the moisture of the cake. Once you've finished\nwith an even crumb coat, add a little bit more\nfrosting to the top and sides until it's evenly coated. I love using my offset spatula for this, it makes frosting your\ncake so much easier, and I will link to this tool and all of our favorite\ntools in the notes. Once you're satisfied\nwith your frosted cake, wipe the base of the cake\nplatter with a paper towel. Now transfer the remaining\nfrosting into a piping bag, fitted with a large open star tip. We're gonna use the rest of\nthis cream cheese frosting to pipe puffs over the top of the cake. And because the frosting has\nbeen out for a little bit, and I'd like it to firm up, I'm gonna pop this into the refrigerator while we add sprinkles to the cake. This is how I like to\ndecorate my red velvet cake. I'm using two different\nkinds of red sprinkles. Start by adding the larger sprinkles around the top border of the cake. Also apply some sprinkles to\nthe bottom edge of the cake. And I'm just gently tossing\nthe sprinkles onto the side, I don't have any secret tricks for this. And because I have the base\nof my cake platter clean, I'm able to reuse some of the sprinkles that fall off the edge. I'm also using some red sanding sugar, and following the same pattern. And the sanding sugar just\nfills in the sprinkles. This way of decorating\nmakes it look really pretty for a birthday, or Valentine's\nDay, or even Christmas. Once you've cleaned off\nyour extra sprinkles from your cake platter, we're gonna pipe that chilled\nfrosting over the top. Add little rosettes or puffs\nover the edges of the cake. Before cutting into this, I like to refrigerate\nit for about an hour. This will firm up the frosting slightly and just make it much easier to slice. Who's excited? (laughs) I am, (laughs) 'cause I\nget to have some cake. And it's just firm enough now\nwhere I can slice it easily. That's the only reason to refrigerate, just to make it easier to serve, the cake layers stay\ntogether a little bit better. So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do the taste\ntest 'cause I want some cake. All right, here we go. And I do like to wipe the\nknife in between slices, so that way you'll get a really clean cut, just like we do with cheesecake. Okay, here we go. Oh my goodness, look at that. (laughs) Oh, okay, yum yum, yum. Okay, and we're just gonna go for it because I want my cake. (laughs) I wanna have my cake, and I'm\ngonna eat it too. (laughs) Okay, here we go. Oh, and it is so soft. The cream and the cake, super\nmoist, just the perfect crumb. That is exquisite! (laughs) We're bringing out the big words. (laughs) Seriously, it tastes like\na bakery quality cake, like a fancy bakery. It is moist, and you can taste that little bit of cocoa in the cake. The cake itself has so much rich flavor. It's just so decadent and delicious. Seriously, it's like I can't stop it, just one bite because it's really good. It's like melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I also love that it's not overly sweet, both the cake and the\nfrosting, it is just right. And maybe that's why I can\nalways eat a really big piece. (laughs) You can freeze the cake and\nyou can freeze the frosting, which is awesome because I\nlove make-ahead desserts, perfect for parties.

(laughs)", "ZEmy_6xigxE": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to my channel if you're new here my name is Casey or the Real Housewife of Nebraska now to be honest with you I haven't been much of a housewife most of my life I focused a lot of my career the past few years as a TV news anchor and reporter but I recently quit that job and now I'm a stay-at-home mom but over the past 15 years every single time I went to a friend's giving I would find the best recipes and ask my friends for those recipes so here are three of the easiest most delicious recipes I have found before we get started though I would really appreciate if you would go down below and hit the subscribe button and join this YouTube family also I will be posting all of the recipes down below in the description box so this first recipe is for a great green bean casserole who doesn't love green bean casserole right for this you'll need 18 ounces of frozen green beans they need to be thawed and drained 3/4 cup milk 1 10 and 3/4 ounce can of condensed cream of mushroom soup 1/8 teaspoon of seasoned pepper and then two point eight ounces of french fried onions so I told you this recipe is easy right you simply take all of the ingredients and mix them into a 1 and a half to 2 quart casserole dish [Music] next you'll put in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees after you bake the green bean casserole for 30 minutes you do want to top it with a few more of the fried onions and then cook it again until it's golden brown so when we're cooking we also like it to smell good in here right the food smells good but it's also nice to light a fall candle today we're lighting autumn day from Bath & Body Works it's one of my favorites I actually have a big one in it and then a small one what are you eating toast ooh you made that didn't you peanut butter and butter sauce all by yourself what a little chef is mommy's food gonna taste good how does good as yours you also do a recipe on that so let's get started on the second video right or the second recipe next up is an amazing potato dish called potatoes Elizabeth and for that you need one large package of frozen hash browns which is around 2 pounds and it needs to be southern style then a can of either cream of chicken or a cream of mushroom soup I like cream of mushroom soup 2 cups of grated cheddar cheese 1 cup chopped onion 1/2 cup of melted butter 1 tablespoon of salt and then on top he'll crush 2 cups of corn flakes then you want to combine all of the ingredients aside from the corn flakes and a little bit of the melted butter in a large bowl [Music] I have some cute helpers now and the next step is do now to spray it yeah don't spray it in your eyes I mean mommy should help you yeah you need to spray a 12 by 19 piano or grease it right your mommy to help okay yeah we might need to make sure you don't spray it in your eyes when you spray it all right so yeah what we're gonna do now is we're gonna move all of that into this bowl this pan and then we're gonna top it with those corn flakes so we've stirred in melted butter with okay [Music] then you'll bake it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes our third and final recipe is for candied yams now here's a look at the ingredients that you need for that first you need five medium yams or sweet potatoes 1/2 cup of salt and melted butter 3/4 cup of light brown sugar 1/2 cup of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons of honey 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon of ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract the first step is you want to peel and slice all of your yams into 1/2 inch rounds make sure you cut them evenly so they'll bake evenly [Music] next you want to take all of the ingredients aside from the yams and mix them together in a bowl once you have all of those ingredients mixed together it's time to mix in the yams make sure you evenly coat them next you want to transfer everything into a 9 by 13 inch dish cover it with aluminum foil and then bake it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees after 30 minutes you do want to remove the yams from the oven stir them and then bake them for an additional 20 minutes or until they're nice and tender [Music] I hope you enjoyed this video and will help any of you who are looking for Thanksgiving recipes if you did like it I would really appreciate it if you gave it a big thumbs up

landscaper uses and the area of lawn covered have a proportional relationship complete the table so what we see here is that there is a proportional relationship between the values in the table which include the area covered in square feet and the ounces of seed in that area so in the first ratio we are given in the table we use two ounces of seed to cover 50 square feet so the ratio is area 50 to seed 2 or a simplified ratio of 25 to 1. in the second column of the table we have 3 ounces of seed for 75 square feet so the 75 is the square feet on top and the 3 is the ounces of seed that goes on the bottom and when we simplify this we simplify it by dividing both portions of that ratio by 3 to get the unit rate and that unit rate again is 25 to 1. the last ratio from the table is 4 ounces for 100 square feet so our ratio is 100 to 4 which provides for us a unit rate when we divide both parts by 4 we get a unit rate of 25 to 1. so we can tell that this does indeed form that proportional relationship because all three ratios are equivalent to the unit rate 25 to 1. now let's take a look at question number eight is the relationship between the number of slices of salami in a sandwich and the number of calories proportional explain so they've given us a table and we have to determine if there is a proportional relationship here within the amounts based on slices of salami and calories so we're going to be making a ratio to show the show these uh relationships from the table and we're going to show this by using calories to slices as our ratio so the first ratio is 66 calories in one slice that already is a unit rate now let's take a look at the second ratio from the table which is 96 calories for two slices of salami how many calories would that be in just one slice well divide 96 and 2 both by 2 and what do you get if you said 48 you're correct so this ratio is equal to 48 calories for one slice the third ratio in the table tells us that three slices of salami is 126 calories in the sandwich again i need to make a unit rate here out of that amount so i'm going to divide 126 and 3 both by 3 and i get a ratio of 42 to 1. and then last but not least we have 156 calories in the sandwich with four slices of salami so the amount of calories in just one slice is what happens when we do 156 and four and we divide both of them by 4 and in this case we get 39 calories for one slice of salami on the sandwich when you look at these ratios are they equivalent to each other i don't think they are if i look at these ratios here each one of them produces a different unit rate so this is not a proportional relationship now you might be asking how is this not proportional if we're just increasing the number of slices of salami well remember this is the calories in the sandwich and what else goes on a sandwich besides just salami well you probably have bread you might have other meat you might have some veggies or cheese veggies like lettuce or tomatoes and all of these things add additional calories okay and because those add calories to the sandwich then the slices of salami is not going to be proportional to the calories in the entire sandwich now take a look at number nine a wholesale club sells eggs by the dozen does the table show a proportional relationship between the number of dozens of eggs and the cost so we're going to make ratios here that compare cost to dozens so make those ratios and compare the unit cost for just one dozen of eggs do that now on your paper pause the video while you do that and then come back and let's check your answer in this problem it is proportional because we have the same unit rate for each of those ratios in the table and what this unit rate tells me is that it costs three dollars and fifty cents for one dozen of eggs and last on this page let's look at number 10. does the table show a proportional relationship if so what is the value of y when x is 11 well we first have to make the determination if this is indeed a proportional relationship and that proportion says that we want to put the y number on top of the x number in that ratio we're always going to put the y number on the top so in this table we have the ratio of 64 to 4 we have the ratio of 125 to 5. we have a ratio of 216 to 6 and we have the ratio 1000 to 10. so change each of these into those unit rates and then let's make a determination if this is indeed a proportional relationship pause the video while you answer that and then come back and check your work in this problem when you look at the unit rates you'll notice that they are different for each of the ratios in the table therefore this relationship is not proportional so we can cross out the second part of the question because this only applies if it was a relationship and this time it is not so we do not need to find the value of y when x is 11 since this is not a proportional relationship our last three questions are on page 102 we're going to complete numbers 12 13 and 15 on this page number 12 the height of a building is proportional to the number of floors the figure shows the height of a building with nine floors and you can see those floors here one two three four five six seven 8 9 floors and the height of that building is 135 feet write the ratio of the height of the building to the number of floors then find the unit rate and explain what it means in this situation well first of all we're going to write a ratio of the height to the number of floors so the height is 135 feet and that is for nine floors on the building it then asks us to find the unit rate so find the unit rate and then we're going to explain what that means in this situation pause the video and try that and then come back and check your answer when finding the unit rate you should have divided both parts of the ratio by nine and in doing that you get 15 feet as the top number of your ratio and one foot or one floor sorry for the bottom of your ratio which tells us that each floor of this building is 15 feet tall so part b question asks how tall would the building be if it had 15 floors well in this case i know that if i have 15 feet for one floor if i can spell there i want to know how many feet is that for 15 floors so essentially what i'm doing is solving the equation for y and this is a division problem right here so i'm going to multiply both parts by 15. and when i do that i get 15 times 15 or y equals 225 feet number 13 do the two tables show the same proportional relationship between x and y explain how you know well the first thing that we need to do is determine what the proportional relationship is in the first table and then do the same thing for the second table then we can compare our results to see if we have the same thing so let's take a look at table number one the three ratios in that table are 360 to 160 1125 to 500 and 2700 to 1200 so let's see if we can find the unit rate for each of these situations do that now on your paper and then come back and check your answer pause the video while you're working for the first table the unit rate is 2 and 25 hundredths to 1. now let's do the same thing with the second table again we're going to set up each of those ratios in a y over x format and then we're going to find the unit rate for each of those ratios do this now on your paper and then come back and check your answers pause the video while you work for table number two you also get the unit rate of two and twenty-five hundredths to one so yes both tables show the same proportional relationship and that proportional relationship is two and twenty-five hundredths to one the last question is number 15 at the bottom of page 102 which of the following statements about the table is true select all that apply so you see over here that we have a table and we are going to figure out which of these statements is true about this particular table now remember we are looking for ratios in the form y over x let's look at our four choices the table shows a proportional relationship well if that's the case then each one of these ratios would have to be equal so do these have equal unit rates let's find out so let's make a table of the y to x ratios and determine if these indeed are equivalent ratios so as i do the division here i'm looking to see what is that unit rate so i'm taking each of these and dividing by that denominator number and i do have to check all of these oops i made a mistake hold on let me get my eraser out that should not have been 125 thousandths to 1 that should have been or to 12 that should have been 125 thousands to 1 on that first one okay so i fixed it now i've got two ratios that are equal but remember all of the ratios in this table must be equivalent so i have to still check every one of the ratios in this table and so far three of them are equal to each other now let's make sure the fourth one is because if the fourth one is not it is not a proportional relationship but what i find out is that when i do that division it is indeed a proportional relationship so we're going to put we're going to fill in that first box because that is true now let's look at the second statement the second statement says when x is 20 y is 2 and fifty-five hundreds well how could i determine that let's take a look at that unit rate so i'm gonna come down here for this one let's take a look at that unit rate that unit rate is 125 thousands to 1 and remember that's the y number on top and the x number on bottom so what i'm trying to do is make an equivalent ratio of what is the y number that's this number right here what is this number on the top when x is 20. so in order to solve that i need to do this times 20. and i need to do the other ratio this one right here also times 20. so do that on your calculator and see what y would be equal to and in this case i get an answer of two and five tenths is that the same and the answer is no so that is false we're going to leave that box empty let's look at the third statement all the ratios y to x for related pairs of x and y are equivalent to eight well is that what we got when we did our unit rates nope we didn't get eight we got 125 thousandths so that is also false and the last one says the unit rate of y to x for related pairs of x and y is 1 8 well 1 8 is the fraction form and we have a decimal form so can we change 1 8 into a decimal and the answer is yes of course we can we can use division so do 1 divided by 8 and tell me what you get on your calculator changing that fraction into a decimal remember involves division and when we do that we get 125 thousandths so yes do you see how each of these is equal to that same decimal then that means the unit rate is equivalent to that fraction 1 8. excellent job okay so now you're ready to have some discussions in class be prepared to answer additional questions or to propose questions if there's something that you still need help with and don't understand once we finished our class discussion or you've had time to work through any questions that you might have then you'll be ready to try your assignment", "CQNGNoP7B98": "good morning folks hey it's February of the 12th 2018 and I believe it's time to talk about jig heads and jigs very important when it comes to fishing and I'll just stay with me and let me go over a few of these things right here now remember okay this is only one fisherman's opinion and that makes fishing in my opinion a sports second to none topics like this well they're opinionated okay these are just things that I do on the water that allows me to catch a lot of crappie ok let's start right here let's get a shot of this jig right here and you can see it has a unique feature right here that holds baits on I'm talking about saves you a lot of money and baits it's called the ultimate jig head made by 4 by 4 ok bass jigs now I use this one a lot in these videos this is by the way this is the one sixteenth ounce size okay and there's a lot of different sizes down to two legal beating ones okay let's put her that way and here let me lay this down if y'all like to use Berkley Gulp you know this stuff is quite expensive but if you like to use it I have one pre rig right here with a one sixteenth ounce ultimate gin head you talking about Holton okay and it this jig right here has a size four Mustad hook in it okay so it's perfect for this size in my opinion ji-hae now this jig right here has a unique screw lock system okay and in past videos I've showed how to judge your distance and screw the Jinyan now that's a good jig right there and I use it a whole lot okay folks here is a traditional jig head you compiled many we're okay and I love using these jigs because they're inexpensive fishing under docks or our areas that has a lot of cover if you lose one of these jigs well you can just tie you another one on but I don't like this part right here okay it bolts out of jig big-time on some of some jigs that's made bolts out the actual jig more than others so this is something that I come up with years ago a solution to this problem I just take dental floss okay and I will use it on these jigs and what I'll do is I'll cut this collar off completely off to the bottom of the jig head okay then I'll take this dental floss and wrap around the hook shank okay just like that now let's rig a jig up on it now what I do is I just take superglue I like to superglue jail that way it don't run everywhere you know it stays in place I'll put a little bit of superglue it don't take much on this dental floss and then I'll push the the jig head back in place now I'm gonna tell you something that right there will prevent slipping another thing you to do it to keep the jig streamlined and in its regular form that you that it was when you pulled it out of the pack and the words and that it calls that jig to come through the water real clean because it's not bulked up right here in this area okay let's get into another jig style okay folks this I'm going back to the ultimate jig head made by four by four bass dudes now here's another unique feature about this G it has a very short eyelid in other words the eyelid is laying right on top of the ball of the jig okay head okay the hook is going above the eyelid so when you set to hook which you don't have to do it very hard just the gentle hootsuite but get the job done or just simply keep reeling this hook will immediately penetrate a crappies mouth but like I said I use all different types of jig heads traditional jig heads like these two right here okay this one right here has a sickle hook in it now and this one has a regular hook in it okay I don't know who made the hook that's why I said that now these hooks this hook point is just about even with the eyelid and on this sickle it's the same way so what I do to remedy remedy that problem is take your pair of pliers and I'll bend the hook up slightly just like I mean it don't have to be much slightly that when you set the hook that will give you instant penetration on these style of hooks jig heads excuse me okay and oh by the way I love a sickle hook especially for vertical jiggin okay though that hook there will hold them crappie I guarantee you ok let's talk a little bit about jigs and there's a lot of different colors as y'all well know that words in Clearwater which is this is my Clearwater side and dirty dingy water so I just picked four of my top choices but now this is only by opinion as we all know crappie have a keen eyesight in fact if you look at the fish you can see that crappie have oversized eyes and they basically feed for the most part by eyesight so but this is still just opinion one fisherman's opinion right over here on the left side you can see chartreuse yellow and white solid centered pink and a pink and white combination this is my preferred for for the most part in stained to muddy water conditions now right here on my right side for clear water situations this is blue ice it's a blue color here's another shade of blue ice a monkey milk color see these are these three colors right here to me represent shad threadfin shad and right here is a bluegill color okay real real natural looking color and these colors right here are very important because not only are they natural colors they're what the fish feed on period these colors right here are unnatural colors for I tell you what but when water is stained because of rainy conditions like today these colors will definitely shine in my opinion versus these normal water conditions for your lake okay let's get into jig tacks that I like to use on the water okay hey let's talk about jig styles now here's some right here and they're made from mr. Perry he makes them he's from Texas he hand ties jigs that watches this channel for a lot of folks and they these are great jigs now I'm talking about let me pull one out so you can see it right here okay this particular jig right here is called the Elmo now these jigs is tied up perfectly I love these hand tied custom baits right here at mr. Perry mates and I tell you what he does a great job perfect job tying them up I love that jig style I like it because I can put power bait soak them in pyro bait and fish them under a float or cast them both ways I catch fish okay this is a lip Ripper jig right here it's also made in Texas by a gal out in Dallas Texas now I've caught fish on this one very good bait I like that style and here's a Bobby garland which are good baits and this is one of my favorite like I said clear water color blue eyes I just can't see anything that Abby did in clear water but lip Ripper makes the blue eyes too and I like these baits every one that you pull out of the pack the tails are straight that's what I like about it okay now here these jigs right here or brush pile jigs now I've caught a couple videos I've been using these jigs these right here are good jigs and they make them in a lot of different styles this one right here I consider I'm an old-timer so let me open the screen back up to make sure that everything is in view I'm an old-timer so I consider this a beaver tail type jig right here and it has a unique action and when you rig it you rig it where the tail is flat on this particular jig here's one right here that has a look at the action on the tail of that each and every one of these jigs have a different action and they'll believe it or not I love this these little baits right here this one's probably about an inch long at times crappie feed on small stuff and this right here we're shine above say a 2-inch grub or a two inch jig just in general little bitty stuff like that talking about little stuff here's some more that I use right here let me get them in vision right here these are bobby darlings or inch and a quarter long different colors I used these I don't know where I got this and I've got a lot of them it's a shad and I might look to action on that tail I've caught a lot of crappie on that through the years I have bags and bags of stuff this is just a few well folks that's basically the basics what I mean by that there's a lot of different jigs out here on the market and I didn't break out but just a few I don't have a lot of jigs like I said and I use them in different ways jig head weights you know you just have to get out here in my opinion and you have to get really study the conditions and try different jigs and jig Styles okay I mean

moment to breathe 365 devotions and we are currently on day 206 so our verse today is in Joshua 1:8 and it says this book of instruction must not depart from your mouth you are to meditate on it day and night so that you may carefully observe everything written in it but then you will prosper and succeed in whatever you do so let's go ahead and read our story today has by Donna Jones I woke up in a funk maybe it was a gloomy weather or the fitful night's sleep in a human room have you ever been in a funk for no apparent reason when I get in a funk I am unproductive my brain feels thick I wander aimlessly from task to task never quite landing on what it is I need to do I'm emotionally vague not bad not good just directionless I unload the dishwasher checked email and threw in a load of laundry finally I paused I knew something had to change and it needed to be me I needed to get rid of the junk so I pulled out my Bible ask God to talk to me read one verse and wrote it down word for word as I continued this routine I've practiced countless times in the past I felt my heart shift I felt my burden lighten my Spurs perspective change hearing God speak to me through his word in the Bible feels like a giant hug from God and all it took was 10 minutes tops God's Word does that this isn't just true for me it's true for all of us God promises that we'll find him when we seek Him with all of our heart here's what I found effective for me that can work for you too 1 open your Bible to ask God to speak to your heart as he read his word 3 read a passage of scripture for pick a verse or two that resonates with you and write it down word-for-word 5 ask what does this verse teach me about God about myself about my circumstances 6 ask is there anything God wants me to know to feel or to do reading the Bible and allowing it to transform your life is this simple and here's the best part you don't have to wait until you think you're in a funk to do it that sounds pretty good so our moment to breathe today says open your bible and read a psalms or start in genesis or if you're new to the bible read john when you're in the word spending time with god it's like the best hug ever I promise well that sounds pretty good I'm kind of like in that I'm definitely have days when I'm in a funk so maybe that'll help out I should try it out alright so let's turn to our first and I put my little poster here so I wouldn't lose it and then we are going to need a book because it's in the very front so I'm just gonna go ahead and prop from this side up you'll need to so let me grab another one just so that it doesn't squish down because we're gonna be over here and look it's a whole blank page I love that I'm gonna grab a piece of paper yeah I'm gonna put that under here so on this side of the page I have this giant sticker right here are a piece of chipboard on there so today what I'm going to do and so since our verse today is about writing things down I went in search of a cute little image and this one is from sassy Cheryl stamps and it's called always on my mind and isn't she cute there she's writing she's making a little heart so I thought that'd be perfect to go with our verse or with our story of writing things down and then I'm going to use this little title I made up on my computer it says a hug from God since our first today our story was also about getting a great big hug from God I thought that would be perfect and so my fonts today are dan kita number 48 which is a hug in the god one and then I use just Arial number 24 for the two smaller ones so that they would be not as cute and I wanted to hug in the god part to stand out so I made them a little bit of a swirly kind of cutie spot and I did print this on some clear sticker paper I will put a link to all this stuff down in the description box in case you would like to pick it up but since I have those little cardstock things behind my um or chip or pieces on the back what I'm gonna do today is I've got a piece of carbon paper here and I'm going to put it let me check it it's got to be shiny side down so I'm going to put it on my paper I'm gonna get a piece of faith and I'm just gonna stick the piece of tape on my pants a couple times so it's not quite so sticky and then I'm gonna hold it up here I'm gonna hold my carbon paper on the back of my picture I want to make sure it covers the whole thing up because she's kind of crooked and then I'm just going to stick it on here like that and then I think I may be a better for another piece down here and I've used this carbon paper a lots of times see how many little spots I have on the back of this so hopefully it will draw all the way through if not I guess I'll be pausing for a minute to go find another one and then I want this to be on here so let me grab another piece of tape man let me remove the sticky part again I'm gonna put on my pants a couple of times so that it doesn't stick quite so good I'm gonna do is I'm gonna lift it up here at the bottom and let me take this page off because that's messing with me then I want to make sure it's on my page yes okay so let's tape it down and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my pencil and I'm just going to trace around on the line so let's go like this [Music] we'll do a bow first and see how that goes you could also use a stylus on here so then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna lift it up and see if it's on there and there it is just a little bit I'm thinking that maybe mm I don't know if that's gonna be enough so I'm gonna take a little quick I'm gonna go grab a new piece of carbon paper real quick all right so I've got a new piece see that's what's always a good idea to check it before I'm gonna leave this right here and remove from this side because I've already started marking on the Bible page so I want to make sure that it's in the same exact spot take our tape off so always good to check if you're going to be I'm doing some stuff like that so let's see here let's go I'm making a big mess aren't I okay now let's try it again crazy Heather [Music] first you want to make sure that your paper is going in the right direction okay so it's on there okay so now we're gonna draw these lines let's try a few more you definitely don't want to do the whole thing and then come back and be like oh nothing was on there so always make sure to check they'll save you a lot of problems in the long run because I have done this before and drawn it on there and then got clear to the end and there's nothing there so imma do our hair [Music] okay I flip it up and I'm a check and there it is okay so far so good this way I don't have to worry about that chipboard I have on the other side we'll just color right over onto the page and then it will definitely be there [Music] and if you don't have a light box this is an excellent way to get your images on your page - oops I didn't get right on the line there oh well does not have to be perfect [Music] now I'm going to forego these stripes on the bottom of her pants and I think I'll actually go without socks so something you can do when you're tracing your image on is you can leave things off if they're gonna be a little too mini too much stuff okay my check it again yeah it's still there okay and then let's do a paper [Music] we'll do this even though our verse today is about writing words from the Bible I really like that little heart so I'm gonna leave that on and then Cheryl always does these adorable little butterfly are these little on ladybugs on her images right here's his little ladybug on there but that's really dinky so I'm not going to put that on there all right so we got it on there so let's peel this up be careful not to rip the page okay like so and it's under then you see it a little bit on up here let me lift it up maybe a little better see it's there a little bit so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my micron pin and this is a point zero one black and I always keep my image close by so I can kind of see so I'm going to set it over here on the side and then I'm going to trace these lines and there's that little piece of chipboard right there underneath that made me go off the line I'm not gonna let that stress me out either be careful remember that it's there [Music] [Music] and skip over here and do this [Music] okay then we got our sleeve right here give it a couple of wrinkles [Music] hey I think I'll continue on with her with her but here so that we can go in a straight line [Music] [Music] [Music] Mushu [Music] yeah we got up here with a soul door she [Music] [Music] [Music] and what we got up here oh we got a couple of little Airlines right here [Music] here [Music] this works out pretty good [Music] hey and this little hair goes up here this is looking like a girl still right okay and then we're gonna go we got a bow so let's do our little knot [Music] this side a little thing right here that I can't really see okay so far so good okay now let me put my paper back here again okay all right so now what we're gonna do is we are going to just sew it because I want a water color today so we're just gonna grab that and this is um clear gesso and I'm using this mini ink blending tool and we just put a couple of coats on that and that Michael and pin that I use to trace on there is water proof so this will not affect it at all and I like to do COO two coats I'm gonna do this coat first and then blast it with my heat tool and I didn't care today that she was a little bit bigger I didn't really I didn't shrink her down today what the size she was when I printed her out was exact size that I copied and pasted her on my page different now so there was no reducing but I thought that she would be fine bigger and I really wanted her page to show down here so I didn't want to make her fit in this little little spot right here so I was okay with her going crossed and into my words over here on the side and I like to just so - not only does it read stop the bleed through to the other side most of the time unless you're using something crazy sometimes markers will still go through there but I like it to keep my page flat when your water color gets awfully wrinkly and I don't like that so for me it's mostly so that the page won't wrinkle up and dry this real quick usually when I'm drying it I just give it a little bit of a tug so I'm kind of pulling on it a little bit can pull out too too much when it's wet because it is fragile and you don't want to rip it okay and they'll set her a little sponge dauber off here on the side and what I do with my feet brush let me see I don't lose my title either okay so I think I'm gonna do her complexion today with this Prima marketing complexion set and I'm gonna use this number for silver black velvet brush to give her some paint so I got a little piece of paper they're gonna have a paper towel course not okay let me grab a paper towel you know roll I have a little cart that sits beside my desk so that I can keep all my Bible journaling stuff in it next in my video room so it's always here so we got a piece of paper towel and let's see here go ahead and get my paint brush wet and let's see I think I'm gonna do number 31 they don't have any colors on there they're just numbered so I'm just gonna get that wet and I'm thinking I might do our hair too so how about 105 maybe maybe 98 it's kind of pretty let's try I'm not sure which one on use yet so let's go ahead and get ninety one wet too [Music] and plus since I got this 98 wet I can maybe use that as shadows for her skin so let's start with this first I remember I chose not to give her any socks so I'm just going to paint right onto her leg I too could have probably waited and done the drawing or the pin afterwards because I would have had the little markings there but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to see it as well the lines really like today's story about being in a funk that was pretty good cuz I don't know about you but I have days when I'm in a funk it doesn't seem like much hopes of getting me out of that so I'm gonna definitely think I'll try the full step process and see how that goes kinda like that idea I'm gonna try this got some on our page and then let's try adding a little bit of this 98 as a shadow you totally don't have to do this it's all personal preference you could just leave her with her face paint it how it is [Music] a little much and too much water the too much water you can dab it with your paper towels [Music] [Applause] okay let's see here what can we we're gonna do for here let's start with this number 98 make it a little bit lighter on this side I think because it's pointed up I don't want my son to come from over my light to come from this direction [Music] [Music] just looking like a mustard seed I like to about this gesso see I can come back and I can have a little line right here so I'm just going to smooth that out my paintbrush okay let's go ahead and try number 91 now and I'm trying to keep my lines going in the direction ur hair is going so you wouldn't want to make your lines go this way because that would look weird let's see our bangs come down and they tend to fall this way again so make sure that your lines go in the direction of the hair and then I'm gonna grab number 105 after I rinse my brush I dab my paintbrush onto my paper towel because otherwise it's really wet I find at least over the top of the gesso it works best if you get your brush wet and then you dab it off a little bit it's not dripping it's not loaded with water I think that's what they call it in water coloring [Music] [Music] okay let's go ahead and do her shoes over here too so I'm going to grab number 12 which is the black color I forgot to get that one wet let me grab some water and get it wet and I'm driving me brush off and I'm gonna just grab some of that [Music] need someone to hold hey what else we got I think I'll do this number 31 on the end of my pencil right here - because the wood is always a little bit different color and then maybe 41 for the eraser [Music] let them do much okay all right so I'm gonna put this one away I'm gonna grab a different one but I love that one for doing some collections almost pretty awesome so what's in here this one this one is decadent pies that's not very exciting either let me see what else I got this one has excellent colors so if you haven't picked up one of these definitely grout it because this is an awesome paint set okay so let's do our jeans in blue so let's go ahead and about match and I'm thinking that her shirt will be I just like this pink we're gonna yell up this paintbrush let's get that much and read for this charge I'm gonna color it in just because I can okay so let's go ahead and draw your paintbrush and then I grab some of this blue [Music] ya wanna find something [Music] yeah [Music] thinking I'm gonna do the blue for her hair bow too [Music] just be you you're gonna like this weird blue [Music] darken this up a little bit you're in the center and then you can also come back and add a little bit down here at the bottom to give it a little bit of shadow down here if you want maybe shouldn't zoom down a little bit I gotta move my girl woman [Music] Susan she looking cute she's looking adorable okay so now let's see what did we decide oh we decided we're gonna do her shirt pink you know cuz I love this pink in this illustrative faith kit and she could also have pink shoes why not I'd have pink shoes oops I painted her like [Music] you [Music] [Music] oh there's a little piece of here I forgot we grab my complexion strap set real quick here and I think I will just do 105 right here we'll just make a dark brown a reddish brown okay then let's try this be careful use this heat tool because it does get hot okay so I'm not I didn't dry it all the way so am I gonna Gus go ahead and do this yellow first I just try not to do parts that are touching each other I could have done this pencil before I did after a bitter sure because it's not touching it okay then I'm darken up this pink on the shirt a little bit mark [Music] [Music] and then we'll give a little shadow down here you [Music] think into that my pencil should maybe have a couple of little black lines up here and the top stone pencils have like a little realist look well they have like a little silver thing at the top [Music] give a little area up here that looks I just look very pretty bit now that kind of makes it look like it has a little cap thing on it okay and then let's do this red for our heart it doesn't look very round they didn't get enough on their blocks more that's a little better [Music] and then I went a little bit out of the lines right here just gonna grab my paintbrush it went and then wipe it off whoops I just made it worse [Music] sometimes fixing thing it's not a very good idea hey let's try that yeah I gotta figure out what coming I'm gonna do the paper guess I could just leave it the color of no that's not gonna work let's do it a little bit this white if that didn't show up very well so now I'm gonna add a little bit of this gold and the paper still wet so if I stick it on here should kind of smear it around maybe not to cover it all the way but just kind of give it a little bit of color [Music] let's try that then she's gonna need something to lay on okay and let's see thinking that maybe I was over here cuz she could be laying outside they'll stir the screen besides it looks very pretty she is writing out a love note or some verses - to God and cheer he is cheering her up [Music] and make the page go out here I have some green on this side of Gaza [Music] trying to be careful not to touch that book or the paper or her arm see me painting her arm green I know you guys would never do that oh there goes Lexi we heard her screaming at the dog that was what she was doing her idea of being quiet while I'm trying to do stuff is not my idea okay let's zoom back up okay so you know me I have to splatter the page so let's do that I'm going to use this black and I'm thinking I'm going to use this pink [Music] and then if I just set my napkin like this on the girl and maybe I won't hit any on her and we'll set this paint dish right here on the side maybe I won't get any on that either I found that if you take your paintbrush and you kind of wham it on another paintbrush it makes a lot better splatters [Music] pink [Music] okay let's try drawing that no maybe need something else maybe some hello [Music] okay title let's put that on there [Music] make sure when you put your stickers down that you have them where you want them because once you put it down you are not going to get it up [Music] [Music] I'm done painting so let's go ahead and put all this stuff over here that should do some journaling on here when I did my journaling I like to kind of go back and kind of look at my bursts of my um whoops I forgot to I should have done my verse on here because we are doing I forgot to underline underline it number eight which it is right here turn it this way like this ruler cuz it's got like a flat end on one side are like curves down [Music] [Music] and then I said I'd like to kind of look at my own my what story and kind of glanced over my verse again to see what I want to write down sometimes I'll put a prayer or usually I'm just think writing something that's thankful so let's go with that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] lord thank you for the gift of a hug today thank you for reminding me you are always there for me and then I always finish it off with my verse so that I

you next time bye bye [Music]", "xaTfSaUYY9g": "all right welcome to today's video on today's video we're going to take venison trimmings and turn them into a traditional summertime favorite and that's hot dogs again much like the summer sausage there are some advanced techniques here but we're going to give you the knowledge along with the tools that we have here from meet your maker you're going to turn out a delicious tasty hot dog now in this case we're using venison along with pork fat we know fat is flavor and we're going to tell you and teach you how to marry these two together so you get that nice juicy bite hot dog with hot dogs one of the things that really makes them so special and really even makes them a hot dog is that they're very finely ground or the meat particles are reduced to really you can't even feel them when you bite into them very hard to do without the use of a bowl chopper ie bolt cutter where you actually emulsify the meat however by using the grinder a technique that includes using ice we're going to grind these through until we get a nice smooth texture then we're going to put them in our mixer we're going to mix them to get that protein extraction and then we're going to stuff them um we're going to be using a cellulose casing this is a 28 millimeter cellulose casing basically just means it's plastic that casing will be peeled off at the end after this product is cooked so stick with us as we tell you everything you need to know about how to process and turn out a tasty traditional hot dog using wild game i know you guys have some meat in your freezer from last season this is a great thing to make especially if you have little kids everybody knows little kids are super picky eaters and a hot dog is usually one thing that most kids will eat so if you're looking for something to make the whole family can enjoy follow along and make some hot dogs i'm going to point something out else out here too so what we've done is we've taken and we've kind of made a habit out of um thinking for the future and we want you to do this too we've taken and we've separated our lean trimmings and we've already vacuum sealed them using our meat vacuum sealer we have the chamber back we've we've sealed these up and we've put them in convenient bags now we've got two and a half pounds pork fat written on the back of these so we have these nice lean cubes still partially frozen that's really how we want to begin our processing process cubed up nice and you know uniform and something that we've been asked about in some of our recent videos and we want to address is if you have deer or or gay meat that's already been ground up it's already been processed to the point where um that that initial step has been completed where it's ground you can use that product um to go ahead and and and do this process it's the the really the tough part about that is you don't know exactly where your fat content is in this case you know this is very lean almost zero less than five percent and we know we're just going to add the five pounds or 20 percent of pork fat to it so that's that's the one variable you don't know when you already have it ground up if it has pork fat no fat whatever obviously you can look at it but you certainly can start with product that was previously ground and frozen to get to this point right here but in this case we've we always prepare for the future not knowing you know maybe we make a batch of hot dogs when we initially process but we don't know how quickly we'll go through the hot dog so we hold some of this product over in the freezer with the intention of down the road further processing it and that really makes it convenient on processing day too because you know rather than put the pressure on yourself to get everything processed right at the time of harvest you can preserve for the future in the uh in the vacuum sealed bags you can go into the freezer the stuff's going to remain perfect just like the day that you harvested it and it certainly is safe and acceptable to freeze it defrost it rework it and freeze it a second time certainly no concern there now that i've got my meat all blended up in this tub i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to add my seasonings once again what we like to do is point out that you can take any shaker of our bearded butcher blend seasoning and the ratio that you mix it to is 6 ounces to 12 pounds of meat so in this case having 25 pounds of meat i can go ahead and take this and dump it right into my lug the form of two six ounce shakers dump it right into my mixture in fact i'll mix that around a little bit start to fold that in we like to mix our spices into our trimmings and then grind we get a really nice blend that way so two shakers for 12 total ounces in this case we're using original beer to butcher blend seasoning these are hot dogs that we make for our store here and they're delicious and we can't get enough of them now one of the things to point out about the cellulose casing it's non-permeable it won't accept any flavor from the oven smoker cooker whatever you're doing you certainly can use a collagen casing even a sheep casing good luck with those if you decided to use those but we want to get all the flavor into the product because when we cook it it's not going to accept any flavor we're just cooking it because of the cellulose casing in addition to our 12 ounces of beer to butcher blend original we have got four mount four ounces of fresh minced garlic we love garlic in our hot dogs and we've got four ounces of our natural hickory smoked powder that's what really gives us our nice flavor yet still on the counter we have the one ounce of sure cure we're not going to add that in until our final mixing so as the smell starts to hit me my mouth starts to water and i start to think about how delicious this product is going to be now that we've thoroughly hand mixed it's time to go ahead and start dropping this through our number 32 meat grinder all right quickly before i um start grinding while this is nice and clean i just want to go over real quick um how easy this thing is to assemble disassemble i know we've talked about the different components a little bit with changing knives but i just wanted to point out just because one of the things about the the meat equipment is super easy to clean and super friendly i do want to point out this bushing right here you see how we have this all nicely oiled this bushing right here make sure that when you assemble and reassemble that you have this bushing this plastic bushing goes inside your worm here then of course you've got your extra storage on this plate we didn't talk about much but this would come into play it's called a kidney plate because it looks like a kidney and traditionally in the in the commercial meat industry we use these uh grind out like things like pork fat so we can make lard maybe we'll get into that someday but you get the kidney plate it's really nice to keep everything but yeah this goes back in very easily it's just got a nice it's all hand all hand tightened so yeah bushing goes inside your grinder head and that worm's just gonna go in there and you might have to you might have to turn it just a little bit to line up the shaft looks like i'm lined up really nice of course your plate and of course we're starting with the course head for our first grind that's going to line up right here on the bottom it's recessed once you get to that point you're just going to thread this on like i said all by hand no tools required that sets on there we're ready to start grinding all right friend friendly reminder we like to start with a little bit in there these these grinders they don't like to sit there and run dry so once we have that started then i can just reach around flip it on and away she goes and by a way she goes i mean i gotta stick with it or else i i even set my plunger aside because like i've mentioned with this stuff um being as cold as it is and then in um what we would call sort of golf ball size pieces is just gonna chew right this number 32 grinder is going to chew right through here especially with uh with the 10 millimeter of the 32 or excuse me the 10 millimeter 3 8 inch plate you can see it this is where the plunger would actually go if i need to but i'm just as quickly as i can get two handfuls set up here and dropped in it takes it which is really nice because if you've ever worked with a grinder that doesn't have this capability it can get frustrating in a hurry seth wanted to just stand and watch but i said hey i need another set of hands here because like i said literally as fast as i can feed it this grinder eats i think i can handle this portion only problem is he's going to start micromanaging now older brothers i tell ya i was just gonna mention how nice the the fat consistency was in that meat and that's gonna blend in even more and more as we go there we have it grind uh grind number one complete through the 3 8 inch plate now we're going to change plates go for grind number two through our 4.5 millimeter or 1 8 inch plate okay grind number two hit me up [Music] this is where you're gonna employ like i mentioned before a little bit of that cat fall method where you want to kind of just get it get it moved into that if you're at all worried about my fingers i mean this guard is here for a purpose if you look i mean my fingers are still at least four or five inches away from the and obviously if i'm gonna push it any further i'm gonna use uh i'm gonna use the plunger just because never ever wanna remove guards from your pieces of equipment they're there for your safety all right so grind number three you know as this blade is in here cutting against this uh grinder plate it's reducing our our meat and fat particles again and again and that's what a bowl chop or a bowl cutter will do it will continue to reduce the particles and really what those have is they have a blade that spins at a terrific rpm like it depends on the model but up to 6000 rpms per minute or revolutions per minute but in this case we're replicating that process by using the grinder the grinder knife um and really that's just to get that real fine texture to our hot dog as you can see it's being reduced and the in the mixture is becoming more and more uniform now this being grind three we're going to use a trick and we're gonna because a lot of these recipes will tell you that you want to grind once through the 3 8 and twice through the 1 8 but we're going to go for at least one more grind after this and we're going to use a trick to get it through there if it if it needs a little help because as you work this meat down it a couple things will happen um one that you'll get friction obviously with all the the grinding and the meat will warm up and you just simply can't have that it's still cold now so the trick we'll use will take care of that and the other one would be that it just doesn't want to find its way um through that plate so we've got a trick on the next grind that's going to help you get that fine consistency that we're looking for all right this is doing so well that we're not gonna use our secret trick which is ice until um until we get to we're gonna go for uh grind number five so that was the end of grind number three want to beam me up no go ahead you're gonna find you're gonna find yourself at this point you're gonna be doing all sorts of uh you know you might even find yourself singing a little work tune like here we go a grinding for the fourth time because this is when things only stick to butchering not singing things slow down you can do the the drop you can make little bomb sounds like but you're you're definitely going to uh get slower and slower in fact we might be slower on the fourth grind than the fifth grind just because we haven't brought the ice in yet you can see the consistency of the product now we're getting real starting to get protein extraction really reducing those particles you do not want your hot dog to look like a sausage um in the sense where you have that real you really don't want the definition of the the particles to be seen in the hot dog all right that's it for grind number four now and this is where i'm going to change my gloves even just to shut this thing off because your protein extraction starts get going and anything you touch the stuff sticks to time uh it's a good time to point out that you don't have to use a binder like um a lot of times you you'll find a commercial operation so use like a non-fat dry milk powder to get the stuff to bind together but in this case because the way that we're grinding we're getting proteins that are binding together so now in fact i'll just show you right here what we're going to do is we're going to take we're going to just we're going to literally just dump in two and a half pounds which is 10 of you know just your store-bought ice or whatever and we'll mix that in handmax that in and when we grind it in it's actually going to help us this stuff's still nice and it's cool it's not quite as cold as when we first started still nice and cool but that's going to do two things it's going to bring the temperature back down if the friction's got it warmed up and then it's also going to help punch this through here for the last and final fifth grind so let's mix it up and get started look at you johnny on the spot with my gloves you mean you've had gloves this whole time and haven't told me duh we're in the rockies yeah so we can just fold those ice cubes in and then the grinder will grab it pull them through as we go big big thing is is just to have faith at this point because things are going to slow down that you want to just stick with it it's well worth it to get that product in the end because like we mentioned traditional style ballpark juicy soft kids will eat them people will say those can't be deer and you'll be like yeah you made them yourself yeah this is the point where you have to put in that you know a little extra effort just stick with it and we shouldn't on this final grind having this meat equipment is a huge benefit to this process because without this type of equipment does not happen without nope all right round in uh third well-rounding third we're at home plate pretty much this is grind five as you can see we really don't have any uh particle definition or not much at all just know from experience we would not get this through another time and frankly why would we want to try commercial product is going to get to uh almost toothpaste consistency it really will look like cake batter so this puppy right here amazing that went fantastic it it's not it's not hot it's not tripping any fuses it's not doing anything like that we ran it um for the better part of uh 40 minutes or so cycling through these grinds obviously they slow down as you go along so now what we're going to do is we're going to put it in the mixer and we're going to mix for eight minutes that's the point we're gonna add our cure we're gonna add a little bit more water that's going to pretty much finalize our protein extraction and then we're going to the stuffer i'm going to show you a convenient way for you to link these hot dogs you just have to stick with it and you'll see that in a minute but mixer next let's get going meat matrimony that's what we have we married our mixer to our grinder it was super simple we just took the mixing head off put it in a lug put the mixer on now we're going to load up our 25 pounds hot dog mix like mentioned we're starting to get some protein extraction but we're going to work it a little bit more and that's why we have to have the mixer we're going to be adding our cure in this step and working it for about eight minutes and we want to reverse every minute we want to reverse the direction that we're mixing one ounce of pink cure going into our mixture with what with wild game we always used to look we like to use sodium nitrate versus the celery juice powder just because you know you have a little bit higher risk of bacteria with wild game versus commercial there we go i'm just putting one bottle of water because we have the ice in there i'll take a look at it and after we mix it maybe halfway and see if we need any more water so one minute one direction one minute in the opposite direction we'll do that about eight minutes four times each way so got the next generation great part about this is scott has his son brady and i've got my son luke oldest boys and we're teaching them how to do this as well so next generation that's one of the great things about working with this stuff is the family fellowship that you get while you're working with it i did decide to add my second bottle of water just because the texture was getting pretty firm so that just just means that it absorbed the more lean meat that you have in it the more water it can actually absorb um and with venison it can it can take quite a bit that's how commercial processors really uh they use like lean bowl meat and that's how they can get it to really take in a bunch of water so with uh wild game you can typically get uh you know quite a bit of water in there you don't want to overdo it but in this case it definitely needed it all right we're done all right all right all right that's going to be the word for this video all right so i can just pull this out this stuff it's got that nice tackiness and we unplug this son of a gun because last thing you want is to have your hand up in here messing around and have the unit power on safety first get this dug out see how we got that protein extraction get it loaded into our 15 pound mixer stuffer and then comes the fun part stuffer stuffer 15 pound stuffer see i do serve a purpose here now is when things get real quiet because the power tools are no longer in play obviously a 15 pound stuffer stuffer we can fit um you know a little over 50 into this so we'll fill it up in the first round try to get that air pushed out of there as best we can manually and then seth will show you how it works on that end of the now what we do is we put the stuffer inside here we start cranking down and as mentioned in the summer sausage video there's an air release right here so as this pops up you can see it pop up you push down with your finger and it'll you can actually hear it it'll release that air so you can see the products coming through this horn it's nice that these horns are clear that way you can see where it starts and then we're starting to come out of the extrude out the end so you want to hold your thumb and your forefinger up against that casing making sure that you don't allow any air into it as you stuff watch your casing real close down here towards the end you don't want to squirt too much product out of the stuffing horn and not have enough casing so when it gets down here to the end you'll just reverse crank your stuff for a little bit and it'll stop did i hear you say you're going to invite me over tomorrow night for a hot dog gross you heard right you said something about uh when i said shooting challenge i said there's nothing better than uh hot dogs over campfire i meant it so i want you to come over tomorrow night and i want to challenge you to a shoot off an archery shoot-off so you're going to hold your bottle of seasoning on your head and i'm going to shoot it at it now you're going to go first just so you know and then i will hold my bottle of seasoning on top of my head and you can shoot at it we're going to be planning a funeral for you about probably you no i'll challenge you to a shoot off you want to do it yeah all right you heard it weenie roast and uh archery shoot off i'll have my bow tech in hand there you have it now what you want to do at this point is you want to just it makes a nice comfy bed no i'm joking so obviously we've got um a bunch of really long hot dogs here and you can you can um there there's going to be talk about twisting people say you can twist this way and then you can twist that way and and quite frankly those untwist and they become uh again one big long hot dog so we're gonna show you the european method of tying seth and i do it a little bit differently um i do it the correct way he does it the incorrect way no anyway i sense another challenge there's no wrong way but i start by twisting my first heart hot dog and then in this case i i portion out like another size and i twist like this and then i come up and i go through and roll and then i'm i'm left with a bunch of three hot dogs like that he's going to tell me he loops and swoops and goes through and i think his is actually the correct way but what we've got then these are going to be um and obviously depending on what length you tie at but eight hot dogs make up a pound because we're using the 28 millimeter cellulose casing um if you want a smaller hot dog you can obviously use a smaller millimeter casing these are available on amazon and other butcher supply stores we buy obviously big bags of them you don't have to do that you can get like what do we do less than two strands here make up uh about only about one one strand one in uh one and a quarter to get these 25 pounds through and these are appealable casings so once we remove them um and and we better uh illustrate and slow down for one of these because somebody's going to be pausing this like heck ready here's how here's how i do what he does i take my thumb and forefinger with my right hand and i pinch and then i pull this loop through just like this get it to the length of hot dogs that you would like and you pinch twist turn these two and then repeat that process again so you just keep doing that you twist pull the next strand up pinch pull it through twist pinch pull through and so on and so forth and as you get speedy at it you can just like that so now you can see those are all tied up ready to go 25 pounds venison hot dogs at this point we're going to hold them in the cooler overnight obviously for you that would be a fridge or some place where you want to keep them cold the reason being they have sodium nitrate in it they do not have a cure accelerator we want to let them sit overnight let all those flavors mesh together let that cure work these are going to get this beautiful um red color when we cook them and so to cook them we're going to do the traeger 885 basically a smoker now should be mentioned these are non-permeable casing means no flavor from the smoker is actually going to go into this casing we're not going to get any smoke flavor from the traeger however it's going to be a great way to cook another thing with hot dogs is they'll mention a lot of times you watch some of the recipes about humidity control traeger is great at that whenever you cook foods in it they um they retain a lot of the moisture and again these are plastic so no if you were using collagen you have to worry about humidity but there's no humidity loss so we're going to hold them overnight put them in the traeger cook them ice bath peel them put them over the campfire see you then sounds like a good time to me let's do it [Music] [Music] it's time to get these hot dogs on the tracker these sat in the cooler overnight they're starting to get some nice color when we put them on this traeger they're gonna get a beautiful red color going man what a day this is beautiful out here sun shining scott and i got up this morning we got a five mile run in wow felt great so i'm just going to start laying these on the rack and we want to make sure that the best that put them on here the best that we can so that they don't touch because if the hot dogs touch they'll uh they'll cook unevenly there so we want to definitely want to try to spread them out get a nice little space between them and just go back and forth top and bottom see how we do we may have to split one of these just to be able to get them to all fit so this is 25 pounds and i think it's going to fill up this ironwood 885 pretty well we can come back out and turn them after a couple hours or so we're gonna do um two hours at 165 two hours at 185 and then go ahead and crank to 205 if we need to just to finish them off so now they're all on there let's go back through and make sure they have just a little bit of spacing get that heat up between those hot dogs i think that looks pretty good don't forget your meat probe kind of probe them so with the meat probe you always want to go in the thickest portion because that's what's going to cook the least amount and typically when you tie these like this it's going to be right here in this in this end so probably what i'm going to do is start here then i'm just going to run that probe up right into the end of that hot dog just like that we're going to let these go and we may come out part way through rotate them in just a little bit so that smoke gets around the hot dogs real nice and then we will um keep an eye on our tent see you soon it's time to check on the hot dogs we ran these at two hours 165 degrees we ran them for an hour at 185 and then we ran them for an additional hour at 205 totaling four hours on the traeger 885 so let's crack the lid let's take a peek there you have it i see some very nice color throughout doesn't look like there's any part of the hot dog that's not cooked so at this point what we're going to do is remove our probe i see you finally decided to get out of your chair last time so now now he wants to be with this the ice bath for the hot dogs but instead it's going to be an ice bucket challenge now he wants to be a part of the process so now what we're going to do is we're simply going to take the hot dogs since they've met internal temp of 165 and we're just going to dunk them in an ice bath this is gonna help stop the cooking process and it's gonna they're gonna cool very very rapidly so we're just gonna go right into our ice bath got the bottom rack done time for the top rack so there you have the hot dogs in the ice bath we're gonna let them sit here until they get nice and chilled and then we're gonna peel the casings and get some in some vacuum bags using the meat vacuum sealer the chamber vac and we're gonna let them sit the rest of the afternoon in the cooler and tonight we're gonna have a campfire so stick along come along we're gonna have a good time practice this do this one no i'm not holding an apple on my head hot dog beautiful stack of venison hot dogs here hot diggity dog wanted to demonstrate real quick to peel all you need to do is make a very slight incision right here and then this casing will just uh peel right off so that's what we've we've already peeled all these hot dogs so we wanted to show you the finished product wanted to talk to if you get any what we call fat out where a little bit of your fat may leach out into the case you see a little bit of my thumb right there that's perfectly normal perfectly fine you can wipe these puppies off or you can even use a little bit of lukewarm water to to rinse them off but shall we absolutely let's take a look at the cross section and see what we've got you want to do like we did with the summer sausage and cut it and then reveal it yep let's do that so here it goes there's the cut there's the hot dog so there we go we've reduced those fat particles to uh you know a very fine amount there and that's that's the goal with hot dogs so that's going to give us a nice soft bite there's another one there um i think the only thing left to do is give these puppies a taste test we cold hot oaks for breakfast all the time so oh my nice texture wonderful flavor that hickory smoked powder that we put in there those are amazing delicious um obviously we use the two shakers of the beard butcher blend seasoning for the 25 pound batch of hot dogs i want to remind you you can of course get the bucket which is a total of 12 shakers if you're gonna do a lot of these that's something that you're certainly going to want to do now that we've got our hot dogs and our vacuum pack only thing left to do is take these over here seal them up with our meat chamber back here comes my favorite part there you have it venison hot dogs now you can pop these in your freezer in this case they're not gonna make to the freezer we are taking these bad boys down to my house for a good old-fashioned hot dogs over the campfire i can't wait so just remember that when you do vacuum seal these these would be good in your refrigerator for up to about 30 days other than that just toss them in your freezer when you want to pack pull them out thaw them and they're ready to go but like scott said next time we're going to try these is going to be on a hot dog stick around a campfire good times coming stay tuned let's head to scott's house let's get some cooking over the campfire [Music] do [Music] welcome to my humble abode i gotta get my bow put a uh schooling on stuff there's my dog where's my big green egg there's my cracker that's where my bows hanging see if he's ready to go out here getting ready to get his butt whooped you ready it's about time you show up to the park both shooting identical bows bow tech revolt x's so we can't blame it on equipment it's going to be on the shooter it's very windy out here gold tip arrows it is pretty windy so whether you want to account for that these bows do shoot pretty fast so um so 30 yards there's uh a beer to butcher hot blend with my likeness on it and a beard butcher cajun blend with his likeness on it i'm gonna be shooting at my blend he's gonna be shooting at his blend see who can put one least amount of arrows to put one right through your through your bottle let me show you something though see all those marks inside my hat i brought my lucky hat those are deer that i've killed wearing this hat one two three four five six seven eight hmm i recommend everybody go to our website get one of these lucky hunting hats i don't have a lucky hat but yeah you go first go hold your bottle on top of your head i'm totally changing it up you go first okay your lucky hat will protect you you do it no you do it your lucky hat will protect you all right i'll do it chill out oh i can't balance it on my head i'll just hold it yeah don't eat anywhere in the region of i don't want to i don't want to get your hands because you still got to be able to butcher meat after this is all done you didn't really think we were going to do that did you all right put it on the string no i'm not going to make you do that what do you want to say 100 bucks to the guy that puts the arrow through his bottle just just for bragging rights i'd say just bragging just bragging rights who whoever puts their arrow through their bottle the other guy has to carry the most weight in elk quarters out of the mountains all right who's going first you ready i'm ready i'll let you go first revolt x let's see what we can do hey guys did you notice the wind much i'm not giving away my secrets we're going to go check it out oh i gotta give it up for him he got him right through his own logo and i'm oh man that's incredibly close it couldn't be much closer that was the first shot that wasn't any retakes no gimmicks oh i gotta get one shot look at that first shot each and seth takes the challenge good thing there was no money on this that was i should have went for the 100 30 yards one pound gave herself a haircut nice that's crazy so i suggest you start putting some marks inside that hat these bows are tack drivers i mean they are absolutely lethal somebody's going to ask what well how we have them set up ripcord aero rest custom bow equipment tactic micro site um this is a four actually five pin sight tight spot quiver we're shooting the gold tip we've got the hunter pro 340 shaft they are absolute tack drivers we love them thanks bowtech todd with bowtech these are incredible boats let's eat all right bring it in we're gonna have a prayer start eating hot dogs get your hot dogs here hot dogs peanuts peanuts hot dogs boys hats off let's bow our kind heavenly father god we come to you this evening thankful praising you for uh the glory of your creation here that we're enjoying we want to thank you for these um venison hot dogs we have and the other food we have the faith the fellowship that we can enjoy together all the families gathered here want to pray for our fellow outdoorsmen and those that go to the fields the streams and lakes this fall all across the world not only americans but we want to thank you for all the great freedoms that we have here and we want you to bless our evening we want to give you all the praise and glory we pray in christ's name amen amen amen all right boys break them out let's eat which one are you you're going to cross the hot dog cross i have no idea you don't you don't how many you want seven nine three

kids how to eat a hot dog what about barbecue nobody's eating nobody's barbecue nothing yeah the hot dogs are just so good you don't need them right yeah do you want a hot bun i need a hot dog you need a hot dog i'm going with a course beer to butcher barbecue and mayo relish onion on my first dog this is not gonna be my last that i'm sure bro oh that bite that smoke flavor oh that's amazing hey we should have a hot dog eating contest we have 25 pounds how many do you think you can do remember that time i flung a hot dog at you and it whacked you right in the eyeball how far i forget gave me a black eye with her with a hot dog we were playing volleyball and he threw a hot dog i remember saw it coming [Music] um so what we've done it's the epitome of harvesting it processing it in such a way that you get um a little bit on the corner of your mouth a little bit right there you get to enjoy a beautiful summer evening just like this eating a venison hot dog something that you you harvested processed you know exactly what's in it you're putting in on your family's table something you can really be proud of and it's delicious absolutely delicious i love it toast them cameraman needs a hot dog i need a hot dog you want a hot dog i want a hot dog everybody wants a hot dog i know they want a hot dog i told you i would get onto my second hot dog now i am seth's over here enjoying himself uh let's see we got four deer hunter successful you guys have all gotten deer two you want a tournament he's gotten four you guys want to trim in the hot dogs next time sure let's do it this is what i'm doing so that's a great thing about hot dogs because these kids are all eating them if it was i don't know maybe ground meat into a burger or something like that some kids are kind of funny about those so the process that we showed you using the meat equipment make something like this with that trim that's still left in your freezer and guess what here it is the end of summer season hunting season here in ohio is right around the corner and we're cleaning out the freezer and making hot dogs so that's right recommend you do it so wanted to thank you for watching the video

next time see [Music] ya you", "7zylqOIHdKA": "[Music] you gentlemen I've got a server test for you I'll be testing the power HD 20 kg and the 23 kg thus Avex 1230 SG the turnigy 959 the Trax has 20 75 X out of the TR x 4 and the hex fly HX 15 s out of the Redcat gen 7 I'm using that horn right there and I'm using the outermost hole which is one inch away from the center of the splines this is how most of your servos are measured when they're measured in ounce inches there's my tester got a voltmeter and a fish scale when I'm pulling on these servos are gonna be at a full stall so who knows one of them may die I honestly don't know but you will be able to see the volts in amps that the server is pulling and how much it's pulling so there's my receiver there's my spaghetti wires those will allow me in future tests to bypass the receiver for high voltage servos there's a castle tenant B EC and there's the bet it's going to power all this stuff this battery is in for an easy day today so basically you clamp the servo in there put that onto the horn and pull away now let's see what these servers have got power HD 23 kgs power HD 20 kg Saavik 12:30 SG turnigy 959 servo just because that was so awesome impressive hex fly servo h-x 15s tracks us 2075 eggs well that was interesting going from weakest to strongest you have the tracks that's 20 75 X with about a hundred and fourteen ounces of pull at two point eight seven amps you've got the hex fly at 175 ounce of pull at four point three seven amps then kind of a surprise here the power HD 23kg to thirty eight point four ounce at four point nine one amps and then the lesser rated one actually was quite a bit higher and it was a three twenty four point one ounce at six point five nine amps then you have the semak's 1230 at three sixty six point five ounce six point two one amps and then you have the old guy here the alloy 959 by turnigy at five hundred and fifty nine point five ounce seven point two eight amps now there's one thing to remember here as you hear people say on the Facebook groups and in person when you get a stronger servo you need to get it external BC as you can see clearly the weaker servo pulls the less that the least amps and then the amps constantly go up with the ratings all the way to seven point two eight amps for the 959 so I mean there's a lot to be seen here as far as two amps so and I know with the UH tracks as guys they get by with running the power HD servos pretty well without an external BC but when you put those two on there you're going to have brownouts and I brownout is when you're driving through the rocks and you go to turn all the side of the system kind of shuts down and reboots it comes back and if the server was bound hard enough it'll do this repeatedly over and over and over again and that just gets you frustrated so that's another reason for the BC so anyway that was the servo test hopefully it was informative so you guys have an idea of what the different circuits are good for it's possible when these service could be bad one of these servers could be really exceptionally strong for trainings I would have to wonder if this may just be a bad 23kg that I got because the difference was pretty big between those two so but anyway guys hope you enjoyed it thank you guys for watching you", "m1f3ZZ3qVno": "I got that [ __ ] bag on you the animal story got the [ __ ] bag all right guys how about a smoke on this grape Topanga that I bought from PCF today and I just had to do a video so this eighth costed me $15 it's a 22 point 27 percent THC with no CBD this strain name is Beautif Anja I believe grape Topanga is great pie with Topanga oh gee from what I read online it's a jungle boy screen originally so I'm not too sure about that but that's when I read online and yesterday I got the idea to do a video where I compare a $30 eighth versus a $15.00 eighth in California so this year is a $30 eighth I mean this here is a $15 I'm sorry not $30 there's a $50 out the door Oh tax 20 let's say 20 22 percent THC into the indica dominant hybrid from this smell and the looks of the stems it looks like it's indoor so that's pretty [ __ ] crazy the smell getting off of this is very very very great was like a hint of just the hitting of gas it's like a grape gassy some though and this was really really really good this is the PCF brand from the dispensary that I go to patient care first under the label right here versus hybrid or I'm it right here where it says the lab it says earth labs so I believe Earth Labs is like the one who grew the strain and PCA of just bought pounds of it you know and they sell it so this is a fifteen dollar 8 I just want to show you guys real quick before I smoke it and for the taste I'll update you guys after the video or when I'm showing you guys the $30.00 eighth and yeah just want to show you guys real quick it'll probably be a quick video click fives eight minute video but yeah so far I'll show you guys how this breaks up real quick too so it is soft it's not crunchy at odds breaks off to the touch honestly this is really really good for $15 I haven't gotten eighth like this for that price and I'm innocent from the dispensary but yeah guys let's see that's a great Topanga GCF $15 off the door 22 percent THC and yeah I'm awesome ok Nick Swisher I [ __ ] seen somebody smoking a Swisher today and I I just [ __ ] that tastes just got to me so I was craving one having smoked in the minute but uh yeah that's it guys peace so being pretty quiet here and I know I want to compare like a war the $50 eighth versus a $30.00 hate how it looks like we're from and this is how it looks like where I'm from so the first the first part of the video was the fitting lightly and now this is a Korova it was actually under $30 this is all I have left is what 8 but honestly house there's way bigger than I than this but also there's one bigger like huge leg and the rest of the Nerds were like either this eyes are a little bit bigger so so and that but then actually it kind of did because it was a little bit more per my bag so this other $30 a faux fur over but you know $30 ate look different all the time if you guys look back at that Koroma video I did of the sunday driver that was the crazy looking 8th you know and I got the for the same price $27 so you know this is just one example but this is very very very very very very soft and soft it looks like you just break it down very very no and the smells crazy like it's always well girl Korova I bought it a couple times already and it hasn't been one time where like it's I've had a bad batch you know here's a close-up of the information you guys weren't able to see yeah I'm not sure what this means yes I know what this means put in the comments have been pretty curious about that and this is a part I was talking about that they should take off it should only keep this sticker and this and they should take off this pickleball keep that but they should take off this little K right here with the Korova and then they probably had to keep that warning counter there but this sticker design y'all look at me though give us a better look at the but I mean it's not like I should be ashamed of the person Crazy Love that's pretty crazy because uh that's pretty crazy it's pretty [ __ ] crazy go no but it's while doctors like this isn't too different for that it's until the 8th that I had I mean like if you're very picky I mean yeah this is softer to the touch the taste is gonna be you know maybe if you're very picky the order slightly different noticeably different if you're a tricky but and also like look I know that I got this you know so there's like things like that I spot a little bit more actually literally all the stem that's all the stuff I got a lotta from that whole [ __ ] life no look look you guys used to [Music] guys so my [ __ ] phone cut off because they got to 15% in the flash cut off [ __ ] night so can't see nothing but uh I was about to end the video anyways but what I was saying is like yeah you know there's there's literally no stem the whole night there's no stem so there so there's going to be those noticeable differences you know like you know just high-end [ __ ] like if you know you're buying Express you're buying loot Louie Gucci Prada why sell you know those kinda just like that it's you know the same but at the end of the days you know the same t-shirt but there's just that little bit of quality that makes a difference you know so that's really what it is you know that's my opinion in my opinion I go [Music] sometimes I buy $30 $40 days and you know sometimes about a $50 8 and I'll stock up for a week or two and I'll save some money you know it just really depends how you doing but yeah I was gonna be here guys stay late and make sure to subscribe share videos follow me on my snapchat my Instagram I'm talking down low go on my website buy a shirt and yeah v8 guys later [Music] [Music]", "1ZfPfZPB_uc": "hi and welcome to paints and glitter this is raquel and i welcome you to my channel today i am sharing with you a very special project this is my july 2020 christmas in july project for rene of bouquets i have chosen these items to show you different things that you can get from renee bouquets and also to remind you of this month's special which is a coupon that will work on any beautiful board pieces that you may purchase i've used for this project a repurposed board i've also used items from spellbinders and of course little items from my stash that i have incorporated into this beautiful beautiful home decor piece so to begin i wanted to show you an up close of all of these different items that i've used here which are the beautiful box small square shaker box the small shabby christmas tree also different snowflakes a beautiful word that says merry christmas i've used holly flourish laser cut chipboards and the decorative scroll flourishes and i've also used holly and berry tuck-ins here and there and of course as you can tell i've also used the jingle of course i've also as you can tell use the red mulberry paper poinsettias and holly leaves flower set i've also used jingle bells in the six six millimeter size and the cranberry translucent glass micro beads so let me point those out for you so you can see how i've incorporated these items into this gorgeous project the first thing that i did was that i selected a board that believe it or not was a sign for the 4th of july and i've stripped it away i took everything off and i just left it as the particle board in the background i then took some designer paper perhaps you can see some of the detail here and it's christmas paper that i've adhered onto this board and what i started doing was assembling this little scene that you see here with the little girl isn't she adorable and she's got her little christmas gift she's already opened that up and she's riding around with her little horse here but here's what i did i went ahead and tied some of these little bells that you can get from rene bouquets onto that little horse i just thought that that would be playful and fun as you can tell this is a very victorian style home decor piece and what i did here was that i took the christmas tree now this comes in a nude color all of the beautiful board pieces come with no color at all it's up to you what you want to do with it so what i did was that i used three different colors of green and also some gold gilding i did back that up with a lighter green paper and i topped it off with all sorts of little bobbles just as you would see on a traditional christmas tree in anyone's home that's been decorated by small children and you know how children are they will put up anything that's shiny it doesn't even have to match children don't care about that sort of thing so that's exactly what came to mind when i was putting this little tree together so these little bobbles are actually made of felt these of course are little gems and i went with a red and green and just played around with it and had some fun um because i wanted this to have some whimsy to it just as any other project that i make and here i made a little fireplace now this is one of the beautiful box square shaker boxes from rene bouquets that you can pick up so yes there are this is a shaker so uh even if it were to swing at any moment you could get that interaction there so what i did was that i created a little fireplace all i did was paint some paper i cut it out in the shape of flames and i also used a piece of felt ribbon that i layered on top to create that look of flames and those little bricks that you see there are hand colored bricks that i also made with beautiful board pieces from renee's shop on here you see this gorgeous holly with the ribbon this is also hand colored i went ahead and altered that to match and that is also available from rene of bouquets as well as these gorgeous sunflowers as well as these gorgeous the heck are these okay all right as well as these gorgeous snowflakes that you see here every single one of these are also hand painted to match the background and i've also even added little dots of nuvo drops in bronze so that way they would coordinate with the background here's another one that i used to top off the christmas tree and i added a sequin and gem on top of that and it was just all so much fun to put together to make sure that it would be coordinating one with the other these beautiful board pieces here these corner pieces that you see what i did here with these flourishes was that i first painted them in red and then i used gold gilding and let me see if you can see if i hold it here at an angle you can see that so you can tell that there's some gold gilding there i did the same with the merry christmas and this is backed up with a nice frame here and i did use a spellbinders die to add this to the board and what i did here was that i painted the merry christmas and i also used the gold gilding and all of those little micro bees that you see there are the cranberry colored micro beads available from rene bouquets here's the little snowflake that i hand colored and added there and then topped off with a little red bead and they there are the gorgeous poinsettias that you can get from her shop now just to let you know so just to let you know regarding the poinsettias this is what they look like when you get them from renee's shop they do have a light beige colored center and these are just completely white what i did was that i altered mine and that's what's so great about these pieces is that you can make them your own so i'm having to hold this sideways so it'll fit in frame but if you see here what you can do is you can paint these to match whatever project you're making all i did was that i painted them with bronze and gold colors and then of course i sprayed them as well with gold so that way this would match uh the background here and these little flowers here uh these two as well as these smaller ones are not from rene bouquets were given to me but the poinsettias are all from her shop and then i did add some nuvo drops to the center i just colored these centers with nuvo drops that way it would match my project there so all of these little holly pieces that you see here these beautiful board pieces are printed and they are also from her shop it's all available there as well as these pieces down here i'll be linking down below this video all of the details and the names of all of these products so that you can take a closer look they all come in as i mentioned before a nude color so you get to color them as you wish with the exception of course of the ones that are already printed but i also wanted to show you another example of the little fireplace that i made there that's a shaker box as i said before so here's another one for this one i used glitter paper and i used some of the snowflakes from renee's shop as you can see there and those i did not color so you can see that this is very versatile you can make them however you like and what's wonderful is that it is transparent on both sides so if you wanted to use it as an ornament even you can do that you don't have to of course adhere it to another surface but i hope that this serves as inspiration for you that you like this project and let me know what you think in the comments below of course i'd love to get your feedback but all of all of these items of course are available in the shop at this moment it's a wonderful time this month of july to get started on your christmas projects and all of your christmas gifts this one was very easy to make it was just a matter of just putting them all together and coloring them and having fun with the different pieces so i hope as i always say that you can be inspired and be blessed and i thank you so much for watching and if you're wondering about the music that i have playing in the background that is traditional puerto rican christmas music i hope you enjoy that as well take care and thank you so much for watching bye", "sg44jDOL8jo": "[Applause] hey everyone ten outdoors nine and today we're testing some 12-gauge this is the Winchester P DX 112 defender two to three quarter inch shell 1,150 feet per second remember that number we're going to come back to that as a reference point in just a moment for those who choose to prefer loading their home defense shotgun with slugs or buckshot this gives you the best of both worlds here's a cutaway and is two and three-quarter inch shell our payload is a 1 ounce foster slug but in front of that you're going to have 3 double-aught buckshot and notice that those are copper plated now packed in between all of that is this matter known as grex GRE X these are plastic granules and this product and it is a product is designed to give you tighter patterns with regard to the velocity 1150 feet per second out of a two and three-quarter inch shell a slug by itself is going to be cranking along in the neighborhood of fifteen to sixteen hundred feet per second and double-aught buckshot in the vicinity of 1,200 to 1,300 feet per second so we're giving up this velocity because of this extra payload in a two and three-quarter inch shell now the pattern itself this represents a four inch group or pattern at 15 feet home defense distance this is what Winchester is saying we are going to see now we're going to do this in just a moment at ten feet so it's going to be a little bit tighter or at least it should be and also these positions ten two and six to seven o'clock we are supposed to be able to see that as well due to this design now at forty to forty-five yards Winchester is saying that this pattern will spread out to approximately fifteen inches the purpose of those opening shots was to show two things one the recoil which is it bad and two the spread or pattern that we have at approximately forty yards now typically I'm not going to shoot one ounce foster slugs even out of a two and three-quarter inch shell at less than 100 yards on two ar500 steel because it will crater I've done that at about sixty yards and I'm not going to do that again so I know it for a fact did not have a problem with these it did not crater it just simply shattered and I took that chance because I knew we had a much lower velocity and we didn't have any problem with that now the pattern what I'm thinking happened here is that this slug carried this pellet that's at ten and a half inches and this one at eight and this one is at twelve senator Center measured from this impact I think this impact of the slug brought that pellet which is at about seven seven and a half inches and this hit didn't put any pellets on there so we put nine pellets downrange and for our own and IPSC target my point with this is it relative to self-defense it's about someone who might try to use this or consider using this for hunting and you do whatever you want the slug is going to be accurate that's fine but they're not going to pack the punch that a typical slug and a two and three-quarter inch shell is going to be carrying by itself and you're really not getting that much of a benefit at this distance with the pellets themselves oh we got a draw I recall correctly this is the first time the block has completely left the table and taking a dirt nap that's exactly what's going on it's a dirt nap because of all the days I chose not to put a tarp on the ground or a drop cloth this is what happens I'm going to get this back up on the table and give you a closer view of the damage there also the pattern at this distance I know you're really interested in that as am i but I want to show you this first because we're going to lose this perspective when I do so that is one of the pellets and that penetrated about 18 inches in fact they would have come all the way out had it not been for the board stopping it so that was a concern of mine I did not see anything out the back that whole by the way that's where I calibrate the BBS I'll shoot those all into one of the lower corners and extract that section to confirm the calibration hey kids introducing the chia pet ballistic gel block hours of fun for the entire family available at fine craft stores everywhere check out that mess and that's going to need a really good cold shower before I get this anywhere near ready for recycling okay let's check out the good stuff the pattern that's at 10 feet with the ball spur 20 inch barrel and just a standard choke Center to Center from each of these pellet openings is two and a quarter inches you can see pretty much a perfect triangle around that massive opening which is the slug obviously and that sound like matter you see on the front of the block is that grex the buffer so let's take this indoors get it cleaned up and start the dissection I'm working with multiple elements here so we're going to have to break this into a few segments and we're testing handgun calibers in this format we typically see a path or track here that's an inch to maybe an inch and a quarter wide okay got that let me zoom in a little bit this is the three inch depth mark right there and this is about seven so let's focus on this area this four inch area right here check out this cavity that's not all of it that's the rest of it underneath there this cavity is approximately four four and a half inches wide got this on the tripod let's zoom in the damage was caused by the slug no doubt about that just that the volume the mass and the energy behind it but if you look closely right here that's a path of one of the pellets and also right here that's a path of another pellet and they are not going in a straight line next just a quick view of the left side of the blog just to illustrate I capture the greatest majority of that cavity on the other side I lost this track at about seven or eight inches because the slug when it went in made a really sharp turn to the right more on that right now here's that big cavity again back to the right side of the block there's a lot of paper other things brought in from the shell now we're at an interesting point here we're at the ten eleven inch depth mark when we have tested foster slugs in this media in this format well before this point they have disintegrated and the pieces have gone their separate directions that has not happened here not yet or will it happen 14 15 16 17 and this turned out to be more of a 21 inch block than 20 inches and we've got something working down in there that is the slug and it appears to be intact and given the actual length of this block that leading edge you can see it turned is coming in at about 19 and a half inches and from this perspective no fragmentation pellet update and I'm referring to the pellets based on their position in the pattern so we found the five o'clock pellet at 18 inches on the bottom of the block and we have another one that left this is the one o'clock pellet it exited the top of the block at 11 and a half inches so it's also off the grid and finally pellet number three this is the left side of the block now it spent much time there pellet came in that's the eight o'clock pellet parallel with the slug slug ventured off to the right this pellet took off like a rocket headed toward the top back corner of the block and there it is at 19 and a half inches slug has had a warm bath everything is nice and clean I have weighed this three times and I keep coming in at one point zero zero two ounces you there's no denying that massive amount of energy transfer that we saw in the first seven or eight inches of this block but we're going to get that with twelve-gauge concentrated buckshot loads and of course slugs as well we've seen that so far in this testing this is where it comes down to I think as the penetration that happened after that initial cavity all that trauma and so forth I do not use a slug in my home defense gun however if I did I would choose something that has a higher velocity and a much better chance of fragmentation we've seen that happen with regard to buckshot I do use double op buckshot for my home defense load but I do not use plated buckshot because of what we had a tendency to see here to me this plated buckshot resembled a full metal jacket in a handgun test where it just keeps on going so I think that's where this comes down to in spite of all the other aspects we saw about this concept which is interesting but that's just how I feel about it looking forward to your comments and just ask everyone to please be civil with each other thanks for watching", "_fbYLOShSdQ": "it's time to find out what electronics i chose for my arma creighton exp stay tuned and find out why and which ones i chose [Music] hey everyone rich here from the rc network.com and today we are checking out the electronics i chose for my arma creighton ex b now of course the exp stands for extreme bash and this is a roller you actually get it with no electronics armada decided to go ahead and offer a roller and they substituted the price difference with adding a ton of upgrades now if you haven't already done so please check out my unboxing video and first lick video i'll have that in the upper right hand corner there you can check out all of the differences between this and just a run-of-the-mill arma creighton as with all of my videos i'll have handy links to every item i mentioned down in the video description so you can check it out for yourself also you'll want to stay tuned for the next video in this series it'll be a running video and i just scouted out a new location earlier this morning being that the exp is a roller you will have to supply your own motor esc steering servo radio and receiver and battery packs to power the vehicle now to take off the body let's go ahead and rip this thing off and show you what i installed starting with the motor i chose the hobby wing 4268 brushless sensored motor now this is the 1900 kv version it's actually not the motor i had intended with all of the coved stuff going around i couldn't get a hold of the actual motor i wanted which is the tekken 40 38 triggy motor with a 2000 kv option that is on its way here but for the maiden voyage i will be running this 1900 kv buggy motor in a truckee now arma makes it really simple to install this motor they provide the motor bolts and of course the 14 tooth pinion that was included in the pack i do recommend using loctite on all of those components as you are going from a steel screw into a metal object so definitely apply some loctite just to make sure everything is seated correctly and let that dry for about 24 hours now this was actually a used motor i had this a long time and it's only ran just a few times if you remember way back to the s works zeus that was the last vehicle that this motor was in but it definitely has a lot of pep and running it on 6s i think we'll be able to move this creighton around pretty easily hands down one of my favorite eight skill esc's is the tekken rx8 gen 3. this thing is just a super powerhouse running anywhere from 2s up to 6s it can run almost any motor configuration from brushed to brushless sensorless to brushless censored the posts are super easy to solder on and i did configure this with two xt90 plugs just so i have everything ready for two 3s packs now the electronics tray is pretty easy it's just a couple of screws on the bottom you can remove that and stick your esc down i did opt to remove the little wire holder it was just kind of getting in the way so just simply unscrewing that from the bottom side and you can remove it and have a nice clean installation none of my electronics installs would be complete without these little avid wire separators these are little carbon fiber doodads that will make your install look absolutely fantastic they keep the wire separated which means a little bit more heat dissipation and plus it looks phenomenal last and the trio of electronics is the agf a81 b h m w now this is a powerhouse of a servo for pretty much any eight scale or tenth scale application i'll be running it at 7.4 volts through the internal bec on the rx8 at that voltage this thing is capable of 542 ounce inches of torque and a transit speed of 0.10 second but it can go even faster and have even more torque up to 626 ounce inches and .085 seconds now specs on this servo are quite nice it has a full aluminum construction steel gears a brushless motor fully digital and it is waterproof now installing this servo was quite easy arma does provide the four screws and washers to install this into the vehicle as well as a servo horn screw to mount that 25 tooth spline aluminum servo horn once again lock tight on the servo horn screw and you're pretty much set to go now i did find that i needed the smaller or the thinner spacer underneath these servo ears just to space it off of the chassis when i dropped it in it was pretty much touching the chassis and i didn't want that so i added the thinner spacer and everything's floating perfectly now mounted inside of the receiver box i have one of agf's receivers now these are compatible receivers with some of the most popular brands i chose the rfs-04c that is a futaba capable receiver in the sfhss mode it's a four channel receiver with s bus capability and it can run anywhere from 3.3 up to 8.4 volts it does include a small little capacitor just for glitch protection and i do have this mounted up to my futaba 7px radio system mounting the receiver in was quite easy with is some 3m silicone tape that i also mounted the esc down with supplying power to my creighton exp will be a couple of max amps packs these are the 5450 11.1 volt true 120c burst lipos these are hard case and they do come with an included xt90 connector now there's no mistaking these packs are quite expensive but i've had some great luck with these things i have two sets of these 3s lipo so i have an older set that i've had for many many years now and then i have a newer set that i was racing with in the u4 rc races now if these don't quite fit your budget i'll have an alternative down in the video description so you can check those out for yourself now putting two of these lipos into the case is pretty much the extreme of this actual battery tray lifting this all the way up you see it fits just perfectly these two 3s lipos the exps battery tray is quite nice it has a couple of velcro straps on either side just cross protecting the batteries in there and the front nose of it is very secure and it does have some additional apparatuses back here for holding up the balance plugs although i'm not going to be using those finally programming everything i use the tekken hotwire 3. it is bluetooth capability so i can go straight over to my iphone and control everything on that rx8 gen 3. from the voltage cut off on the batteries the bec voltage motor direction motor type all sorts of braking characteristics throttle characteristics and even additional timing well guys that is it i am ready to rock i can't wait to get this thing out on a new track i found with some monster jumps so stay tuned for that as always if you like this video hit the like button if you haven't already done so please subscribe to the channel and click that notification bell to be notified anytime i upload a video and finally my name is rich thanks for watching [Music] you", "bH6AgPdwaag": "hey guys Dan let's may be normal on doors yeah I got tagged with an 8 question 5 tag video by blackie Thomas of shaman forge bushcraft and he tagged me in this video so I went over kind of interesting I started watching a lot of 8 tag videos it's nice to see you it wastes learn from each other's YouTube channels and watching YouTube but where they kind of got their start and stuff that's kind of interesting you know what they're like so these are my questions the first one was the most memorable camp I believe it was I was 11 or 12 years old and I received a pamphlet it was a canoe camp I've always played in the woods and stuff like this but I remember it was six nine seven day camp in Little Miami River you know and it was like 75 hours which was real big Bunyan man I had asked my mom you know it's early enough I could go you know that's a lot of money so he scrounged up the money and I went and that was the first time I went camping with I believe it's for boys and for girls and two guys a male and female god chaperone and I didn't know nobody and that's that was probably one of the best times because you didn't know anybody you had to rely on other people their knowledge we were kids you know there were some city kids there they didn't know nothing and I loved the river I I just been around water Constanza stale water when I was younger to me it was just a big adventure so it's not really one camp it was six night camps flipped the canoe sleeping bags got totally wet I was carrying all the food and my canoe so everything we had our or water bags back to them were trash bags we didn't have today's modern you know dry bags they were our dry bags if you could afford a hefty bag you were in the lap of luxury we had affordable bags so they ripped my sleeping bag out totally wet I can remember sitting on the back with a girl that went there and we were eating chocolate chip cookie dough that was soaked by the creek or the river and we didn't care he was eating everything we could until we got to the next town where they went and got supplies and come back but probably most memorable it really dear to me about being on your own for the first time like that you know but I really loved it ii d prefer solo or group camping I always did lost solo stuff I've done River trapper love being in the river love on the first snow getting out in the river looking around like being by myself since I got hurt and pulled my back up real bad a lot of times stuck in the house started going to start it at the Pathfinder gathering couple years going but met a bunch of people there went to the vu last last year and then went to black Thomas gathering down in Alabama and I'm really liking to be around these people they're all like-minded I haven't run into nobody bad it's not a party fast it's a bunch of knowledge the knowledge is out there I when you're growing up I kind of thought I was alone in this knowledge you know because I lived out the country you didn't have a whole lot of friends we did they just did the same thing we didn't call it camping or her survival or bushcraft we call it we went fishing and fishing was an all-nighter when we went hunting we went you and took the tarps out and we hunted all night we didn't come home we didn't have access to full wheelers and vehicles and so you walked through the woods and you carrier and we can come back and today we call it you know bushcraft and you know stuff like that we just called it we're going fishing I'll be back in a Sunday morning you know so that's where I come from so right now prefer groups like knowledge camping or question number three what's your favorite knife well now that's that's an open-ended question no I mean I've got knives for my manners not from my grandparents my parents I've got traffic knives I've got butcher knives I've got you know fleshing knives you know it's just to me that's so vague right now what I want to kind of change it and what's my most carried knife right now yes and probably yes that's the master woodsman you know I'm done carrying the WCS K but right here from last for woodsman's with me you can get a kind of get a glimpse on it I've been carrying this knife for probably a year and a half now yes and just I don't know it's a phenomenal so the other one is it's hard to say yes I've been carrying this open L number 10 my daughter gifted me this for Christmas it's actually engraved in 2009 so I've been carrying it a long time and I can carry that I used to carry us to work everyday you know nobody's gonna best we'd not like carrying long life you know so I could go on I mean that's the whole video separate my favorite night and I could get you in $25.00 so that's what I'm carrying that's what's my most carry knives right now so that's where I stand on that where did I learn my bushcraft bushcraft skills well I was always intrigued with Daniel Boone Davy Crockett I live in Xenia and Dayton which is a very high that have very high populations of Native Americans back in the day we've got Serpent Mound out here there's mounds all over Miami any isms here so I was always intrigued with that and then when I left over in Riverside by the Air Force Museum there was a man lift caddy corners name was Victor Berg he always carried six pocket knives in each pocket and when he passed away he had like almost $10,000 in space but he was like a hoarder of knives and I was a kid I'd go down there and he had a pail of stone to sharpen and he showed me how to sharpen these knives and there was two lakes and a river crossed there and me and him with walk around him and when I was a kid it was rare to see a deer and he would walk up on deer when he found him and he showed me plant life and how to catch not one fish in the pond all the fish in the pond he was he was a true woodsman he's from Tennessee he got on when they were building I 75 northbound then without work run out he went eight times wherever what's been going forever now he's been passed away from 30 years and what a mentor mentor was just a guy who was a very simple man he was simple minded the way he looked at death not simple mind as is slow he just very simple how he thought about stuff and I could walk all day with it and he would just be carving a cedar stick and showing me you know everything is in the woods I and I did this for years and so that was probably number one minutes rest his time as dirt time friends man when I discovered YouTube videos about ten years ago man I was crazy so that's that's who it was name was Victor bird great guy never forget I actually carry I own his number one pocketknife his favorite pocketknife his selling gifted that to me we passed a wood so great guy what's your way what's your favorite way of making fire well my favorite way of making fire is flint and steel with no char cloth all natural materials I got turned onto that back in my 20s buckskin and it's still fascinating to me this day I love it some it can get tricky on you it's it's you just can't break the rules on it and just do it and I love it I don't even carry any char cloth with me to me char cloth is cheating I know that's going to be a controversy but that's just the way I feel I love it if I'm here at the house it's a propane torch when I burn the fire pit I'm not gonna sit out there and build a let steel fire to burn me some brush I use a propane torch so but yeah it's my love the Flint steel is my love I have fair same laws I have it all but I love the natural material hardness from the two with the Flint steel what is your favorite tool in the tool kit well because I've been traveling food off and on for 50 years it was an axe because an axe is a hammer and acts as a lever and an axe is an axe it's also dispatched to several uses I couldn't find the head in the shop the head finally fell off of it this is my axe since I was a kid this is about four years of trapping and yes I didn't know what linseed oil was and I didn't take care of my tools and I carry this in my belt and once you look how warped this handle this can you see that and then it started rotting because I carried it in my belt for so many years that just the water just pulled up the heads in the area I can we handle it but my brother gifted me before I got hurt a Grand Forks books for staff this is a little bit longer but basically the same action I just love this thing two items that I would love to take with me is that axe and then I have a you don't see a whole lot of these this is a Victor Knox multi-tool I've owned a lot of smaller tools I've carried this one for ten years I'm on my third pouch with us I wear him out I need to talk to granny for stitch up your outfit build me one that I don't have to replace no more but this is man I tell you what I'm lost about this tool I mean bending wire cutters law tightening tools just entraps I mean it's just one of my favorite tools I just haven't with me every day number seven do you carry a bug-out bag in your vehicle yes and no because I was trapping I worked out of my truck if you can see in the background here there is a two drawer pull out thing this is my bug-out bag this thing I hear is full of my gear for any situation I need this side here is for tools and self recovering my vehicle's changing tires lifting the truck additional here is sleeping bags MREs off you a video separate on this this is six and a half foot long I believe 11 1/2 inches deep so the give you kind of idea I do have an ounce bag in there that I can take out and put on and go so yes no we're in Ohio just last month we had 60 degrees then blowww freezing and snow so it's hard to say hey man summertime I'm gonna put that bag in there it's wintertime I just prefer to carry I it's helping me out in the past when we sleeping bag it's wet I got an X plus I actually still have a Dave Canterbury one of his first videos on his blanket kit with a wool blanket and tarp and the rope that's in this it's in this box I've used it a lot of times so that's my bug out bag truck what is your favorite stove well it's about fire on the ground for me that's I never carried stoves I have my first alcohol stoves about three years ago I've used it you know handful times what I did do is I copied a rocket stove off of bosses swamp I have a real short video on it I've been loving this thing we carried it down to the food cooked on it I cook on it here it's a handful of sticks it's so fast it is heavy it's not really a a backpacker stove ring like that I can use a fire for that but if I'm going on for a camp for two or three four days we put it in the trash bag my wife can carry it's full sand put it in the truck or in the car we took it all the way down to Mississippi and use it for three days Network it's very moment fuel low smoke and great to cook on I've really enjoyed that rocket stuff and that's it for my questions uh black you throw doubt a bonus question you know he throws it back at Matt my believes name's Matt Mercer and you know why did I start a YouTube channel be honest guys I started YouTube channel because I was shocked that people couldn't sharpen knives I've been around them all my life and I kind of took that for granted and I've run into people that you know when space with the master woodsman I got the prototype to master woodsman and the curves on it I couldn't be responsive and it's too hard to sharpening and our ancestors MANET sharpen sickles you know hands sickles sighs so it was uh I just just thought I could help out showing some technique about you know my first video was testing two knives just taking a scene you out of a deer leg and you know I could use the large knife or the tip so that's why I started my youtube channel so that's my bonus question you know it's a small channel i I've met a ton of people you guys are the best community I'm going to tell you right now I'll make a statement bass fish tournaments I used to race you know cars motorcycles everybody's about competition this world bushcraft world what we call it is it's just a wealth of knowledge I've no I'm not run into any bad person if you have a question they're willing to share run the pound of dirt with you you know I mean I'm very happy about going to these events and really liking the community on the bushcraft world so guys hope you enjoyed this video it's my score eight questions five tags oh I forgot my tags dinner dad going tags well that's going to be easier the lights guys are small channels what I'm gonna have a Chambal maker you have a channel Randy Smith the stitched career Outfitters he's got one video up but he's learned Steve Lutz that my brother he has one video he learned Michael Eli I can't pronounce the man his channel is the Michigan woodsman great guy met him first time down there been great guy mark I tagged get off your button yes video Todd Walker survival Sherpa great guy axe junkie man the guy can swing an axe like no more live into enjoys videos I lost the last ones Trinity stank Sanders that is actually the niece of Randy Smith that she went to the past on her gathering once last year she's uh she's working hard in the bush careful guys doing a lot of training do long reading about dirt time she's gonna be pretty good so there's my tags guys hope you enjoyed this video see you soon [Music]", "iwHiK23mag0": "okay and listen seven we're gonna be for the first time trying to show them how to multiply fractions by whole numbers using tape diagrams and we're actually going to be using more division at this point because that's something they're familiar with to show them and we're gonna be using the word up so we'll say find one-third of another number and the role for this lesson is try to get them to associate of with multiply they're actually multi-action by a whole number number one it says one-fourth of 24 and what they've done is they drew a tape diagram and the total was 24 on top and a sentence says 1/4 of they split it into fourths and they're looking for this one piece and what they did is they say okay well then what I can do is I can do 24 there's 4 units equals 24 so 24 divided by 4 equals 6 so this 1/4 would be 6 so 1/4 of 24 equals 6 now under B we're looking for one for 248 saying thing we draw tape diagram the total being 48 cents as quarters we're gonna split it into fourths and we're looking for 1/4 of it so since we're looking for 1/4 of it we would take 48 divided by 4 which equals 48 force which equals 12 so each one would equal 12 so 1/4 of 48 would be 12 on C's the first time we're looking for something more than just 1 a unit of one what we're gonna do the problem exactly the same way a tape diagram we're gonna put our total up top if you notice they put a multiplication sign here this time so instead of 1/4 of 24 we're saying 2/3 times 18 but that's the same thing quarter of in 2/3 times 18 are the same result now this one where it says thirds so we're gonna split it into thirds what we're looking for what two-thirds is but in order to find two-thirds we're still gonna take 18 divided by 3 which equals 18 thirds now 18 thirds equals 6 so if one unit equals 6 the second unit would equal 6 and this was 6 2/3 of them would be 12 so 2/3 of 18 would be 12 our last one says 2 6 of 18 2 X 2 6 times 18 and draw our tape diagram once again our whole number going on top which is 18 says we're split into 6 so I'm gonna split it into thirds and I'll split the thirds into 6 and it says we're looking for 2 6 it should be here but in order to solve what we're gonna go with 18 divided by 6 which equals 18 6 which we know equals 3 so since each one equals 3 we know 2 to 6 of 18 would equal 6 all right now we have three sevens times 49 so our total is 49 said seven so we're gonna split them into 7 one two three four five six not to put another one on there seven and we're looking for three sevens but we're still gonna solve for a unit of one in order to solve it so we're gonna go 49 divided by 7 because there's seven units which equals 49 7 which equals 7 so we know that each one would be 7 but since we're looking for three 7s we know 3 times 7 equals 21 so 3 7 2 49 would equal 21 now our numbers are getting a lot larger over here now we know our total is 1 20 says tenths so we're gonna spit in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ok and we're looking for 3 tenths so we know that we have 120 divided by 10 which equals 120 over 10 using what we know about multiplying and dividing we can take out the common factors of 10 and we know that equals 12 so now we know each one is equal to 12 so now we've got 12 times 3 which equals 36 so three tenths of 120 would be 36 on G so again putting your top of 31 we're splitting it into thirds this time we are looking for 1/3 so we know we have 31 divided by three which equals 31 thirds which equals ten and one-third and I know that because 3 goes into 31 10 times was 31 left over 1/3 so we know each one of these is gonna be 10 and 1/3 so we know that one-third of 31 would equal 10 and 1/3 our last problem our total is 20 we're splitting this into fists we're looking for 2/5 we're still solving for this unit of 1 so we know we have 20 divided by 5 which equals twenty fifths which equals 4 so we know we have 4 and H and we're looking for 2/5 so we know 4 times 2 equals 8 so 2/5 of 20 would equal 8 on eye the total is 25 and we're splitting it into fourths and we're looking for 1/4 notice I always draw what I'm looking for so I can keep track and make sure I would give the right answer so we know we have 25 divided by 4 to find that unit and you know that's equal to 25 fourths which we know that would go in there six times because 6 times 4 would be 24 use 1 left over so it'll be 1/4 so it equals 6 and 1/4 on our next one total once again is 25 and we're splitting it up into quarters again but this time we're looking for 3 quarters once again we're still going to go 25 divided by 4 which equals 25 fourths which equals 10 and a quarter which means that's that 1/4 is 10 and a quarter to me 6 and 1/4 thinking of a problem ahead of time so since we know that's 6 and a quarter now we have 6 and 1/4 times 3 which I can go 3 times 6 is 18 and then I have 3 times 1/4 which is 1 times 3 over 4 which equals 3/4 so it's going to be 18 and 3/4 kay says 33 fourth of a number is 27 what is the number okay they're just kind of put it in in dial word problem we know we're still looking for part of a hole the hole is 27 we're gonna split it into force and we're looking for three four seven so we know 27 divided by four equals 27 fourths 27 force equals well I know 4 times 6 is 24 4 times 7 is 28 says too much so I has to be 6 and with 3 left over here my denominator so each one's gonna be equal to 6 and 3/4 now if I just add these up I got 6 12 18 from a whole numbers and now I'm gonna add my quarters three six nine quarters which I know that would equal to 18 and four we're going to nine two times with one left over so would equal 20 in one quarter the last one over here we know we're looking for two-fifths of 14 little for two-fifths now we got 14 we're dividing it into five sections so it ends up being 14 fifths which five and going to 14 2 times 4 left over and 4/5 so we know that's 2 and 4/5 so now we know that two-fifths of 14 we add them together because we've got 2 and 4/5 plus 2 and 4/5 which equals 4 and 8 fifths which equals 5 and 3/5 2 Sall views and taped diagrams a skating rink sold 66 tickets of these two thirds of the children's tickets and the rest were adult tickets what total number of adult tickets were sold now this is where key where a tape diagram comes into play let me draw another way and we know the total here were 66 tickets so when it says two-thirds of them were children's and leaves the remaining being for adults and since this has to be a whole this is two-thirds I know the adults were one-third okay and now the question wants to know what total number of adult tickets are sold here that's what we're looking for so I want to know what one-third of 66 is so 66 divided by three equals 66 thirds I can see three going to three one time 3 goes into 6 is 6 22 times which equals 22 first which equals 22 so one-third would equal 22 and that means two-thirds would have to equal 44 if you added them up you know it with 66 tickets okay a straight angle is split into two smaller angles has shown the smaller angles measures one six two the straight angle what is the angle value of angle a well this is relying that you remember that a straight angle is 180 degrees so when we do our tape diagram our total there's a straight angle which is 180 then we had this thing split into two this one here which is a smaller angle was 1/6 this one here was angle a and just be a whole 1/6 angle a has to be 5 6 now in order to solve this we're gonna take 180 divide it by six cousin six which equals 180 over six and I look for Commons I can see that is that the six will go into six one time six go 180 30 times so this equals 30 so that means that 1/6 the smaller angle a is 30 well we can see little angle to me the angle a is five times that so it's going to be 30 times five which equals 150 so angle a was 150 degrees and you can see we added them up 150 and 30 we get 180 which is our total angle sea animal and Eric made 17 ounces of pizza dough they use 5/8 of the dough to make pizza and use the rest to make calzones was the difference between the amount of dough they use to make pizza and the amount of dough they used to make calzones now this is a tricky word problem so we're gonna make sure that we draw tape diagram form and label everything and we're going to make sure we enter Tate on our drawing exactly what they're looking for so let's start again I'm going to put my tape diagram here and we're gonna go back through we're going to redo it again this and Alaric made 17 ounces of pizza dough so that's our total 17 they used 5/8 of the dough to make pizza so I'm gonna go ahead and put this one here I know this is 5/8 and this was to make pizza and use the rest to make calzone so this was calzone now looking at this this is 5/8 this has to equal one hole so calzones had to be three-eighths now what was the difference between the amount of dough that used to make pizza and the amount of dough that used to make calzones so now I've got to solve for each one of them so we're gonna do this the same way we've been doing it we're gonna take 17 divided by we're gonna split them into eight so we're dividing up by eight to find it you to one XI equals 17 8 which equals 1 because they will go into 17 one time with 9 left over oh that's not right because 9 left over be 9 8 so we obviously this this here could be 2 and 1/8 so we now we know that 1 8 is equal to 2 and 1/8 now now we know the pizza is 5 times that so we got 2 and 1/8 times 5 and what we can do is we can go to 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 which we add them up we can go 2 4 6 8 10 and add up our 8 we have 1 2 3 4 5 so this was equal to 10 and 5 8 ounces now the 3/8 that's multiplied by 3 so now we have 2 and 1/8 times 3 which is 2 and 1/8 plus 2 and 1/8 + 2 + 1 8 which equals 6 and 3/8 so we know this is equal to 6 and 3/8 ounce now a question coming back up here they want to know that difference between the amount so even though we've solved it now they want to know the difference in the amount so we've got to take ten in five-eighths and subtract six and three eighths let's see 10 10 minus 6 gives us 4 5 eighths minus 3/8 gives us two eighths so the difference was four and two eighths now even though that is a that is a good answer we see that two eighths can be reduced because I know this is 2 times 1 and this would be 2 times 4 to get 8 take them out and I get 1/4 so this is simplified before and 1/4 D the new york range is hockey team won 3/4 of their games last season if they lost 21 games how many games did they play in the entire season okay so let's go ahead and draw and we're the top of it is total games which we don't know what that is that's what they're asking us to solve then they said they won three quarters and that means that they lost one quarter and it says if they lost 21 games well one quarter tell us what they're equals 21 so in order to solve for three-fourths we know that's gonna be three times 21 T equals 63 now to assign the total games we have 63 plus 21 which is going to give us 84 total games was 84", "f55tVcVXNjw": "how's it goin riders my name is Patrick from bike berry we're going to go ahead and mix the oil in with our gas today there's just a few things you want to remember first off is when you're mixing and breaking in your engine you want to go two tanks at 16 one ratio with your oil we're going to go ahead and use a synthetic blend we recommend a synthetic blend or better just a full synthetic pay more for your oil now because in the end they'll just make your engine last a whole lot longer we're also going to go ahead and use our Maxima quick to mix bottle today it's going to make our lives a lot easier they have all kinds of different mixture measurements on here I'm gonna go ahead and demonstrate how to mix the oil we're going to go ahead with the 16 one ratio this is one gallon of gas so we're going to go ahead and mix in eight ounces of our of our oil so let's go ahead and do that right now I'm gonna go ahead and open the oil buddy crack the seal we're gonna go ahead use our quick to mix bottle it already has the markings on it right here on the side we have the eight ounce mark go ahead and pour that in here I'm gonna line that up with the eight ounce bar so we're at eight ounces here I'd recommend a funnel if you can makes it much much easier to mix the oil and with your gas here this is gonna be a little tricky because I forgot my funnel so we're gonna go ahead and try to baby this in here then we have it that's the next year oil is now mixed with the gasoline mix it up as well we got about that mixes as well as possible when you're in the breaking-in period make sure that you do not go over 20 miles an hour so you want to vary the RPMs make sure that the engine kind of just breaks in softly you don't want to push it too hard that's just once again gonna just make that engine will last a whole lot longer you don't want to run it for too long we recommend them less than a half hour 20 minutes a very short period of time just run it for the first two tanks make sure that when you run it it's nice and cool when you start it up the next time we're just going to break that engine in and is going to run really well if you have any other questions or comments or any other ideas that you might have for videos with us here at bike Barre just go ahead and comment below let us know if anything we can go ahead and help you guys out with my name is Patrick with white Barry and thank you for watching the video", "rWEWSE2xUq8": "hi guys my name is Hannah and I'm for propane low supply comm today I'm going to show you two very important steps in the excellent candle making the first is how to choose the right wick size for your candle container and the second is how to conduct a proper breath test if you have any questions at all at the end of this video please feel free to email us directly at support at pro candle supply comm or comment below mastering these two steps will ensure that you make the best and strongest burning candles for your customer first we're going to be covering the correct wick size it's important to have the correct wick size for your candle to ensure you have a clean and even burn it also helps you determine an accurate burn time for your candle and it helps you to determine how strong your hot fragrance throw will be the first step in determining the correct wick size is finding the inside diameter of your candle container find the inside diameter of your candle container and then you want to consult the wick guide on pro candle supply comm when you're conducting a burn test it's best to always conduct a burn test with at least three different sized wicks on the same candle as you can see the jars in front of me the diameters of the inside of the candle jars are two point nine four inches if you consult the whip guide a pro candle supply calm you'll see that we recommend starting with an eco ten so today I'm going to be testing an eco 10 and eco 12 and an eco 14 the smaller the wick number the smaller the wick and the larger the wick number the larger the wick but please remember there are different types of wicks such as eco LX and seedy wicks and they're not interchangeable for example an eco 14 wick is not the same as an LX 14 wick they will burn differently it's also important that you ensure that the wax type the fragrance the container and the color is the same on all the candles that you're testing changing any of these the wax the fragrance the container the color the fragrance load any of these factors can greatly influence burn quality so if they change you'll have to Rican duct the burn test but three candles you see in front of me have the same wax no color added and six percent lavender fragrance it's best to label the front of each candle with the fragrance used the sized wick and the percentage of fragran used that way you can go back and reference these details later after you wake and pour the candles that you're going to be testing it's time to let them cure it's best to let them cure at least 24 hours but if you're going to be testing specifically how strong they're hot throw is it's best to let them cure longer because the longer they cure the stronger they are after they're done carrying it's time to cut and light your candles please be sure to cut your wicks to about a quarter inch before lighting I'll be back in a couple hours okay so it's been about four hours in order to conduct a proper burn test you want to let your candles burn about three to four hours depending on the diameter of the candle and then you want them to cool for at least five hours before you conduct another burn test a 2-inch diameter candle should reach its full diameter about pull in about two hours a three inch diameter candle should reach its full diameter melt pool in about three hours after three to four hours have passed you're going to visually inspect your melt pools write down the details and then blow out the flames so let's take a closer look at our mouth pools so as you can see we have our three candles the Eco 10 the Eco 12 and the Eco 14 the correct wick size should not have much flickering the melt pool should reach to the edge of the container and the melt pool should be around a quarter inch to a half inch deep the wick should burn cleanly without a lot of carbon buildup mushrooming or suck being given off the center candle shows all the properties I just described the flame is steady the melt pool is about a quarter inch to a half inch deep it's reached the full diameter of the candle there's not a lot of carbon buildup such or mushrooming going on a wick that is too small for a candle will not give them that pool that reaches the edges of the container instead it will tunnel down the center of the candle with a low flame and even drown itself out the candle right here is a prime example of a wick that is too small it is not hot enough and will likely put itself out the candle to my left is somewhere in the middle it does have a deeper melt pool however it hasn't reached the full diameter brim of the candle as we conduct a second or third or fourth burn test and make it hotter as the candle burns down and it may end up being okay but right now it does not seem to be the correct wicks eyes for this container a wick that is too large for a Campo has a flame that is too big it flickers a lot mushrooms and gives off a lot of smoke Ursa mushrooming is caused by a buildup of excess carbon and actually produces a mushroom like shape at the end of the wick the melt pool is often deeper than a half-inch here's another example of a candle that I waked and conducted a burn test on as you can see one candle tunnel pretty all the way down the center of the candle the other side it burned cleanly and evenly the one that burned cleanly and evenly was whipped with a correct wick size it's very important to conduct multiple burn tests ideally you'll conduct four to five burn tests or until you reach the bottom of the candle for example the candle in the center looks like it's whipped with the correct wick size however I'll need to conduct three to four more burnt us to ensure that the melt pool does not exceed a quarter inch to a half inch deep it's very important that you do these burn tests especially if you're going to be selling your candles to customers customers expect the candle to burn evenly and perfectly all the way down to the bottom okay so the last thing I want to talk about is getting a good hot throw a hot dry was measured by how strong a fragrances in a room when a candle was burning you'll want to experiment with different percentages of fragrances and different wick sizes in order to get the correct hot throw for your candle 6% fragrance load is a good starting point and then you can work your way up to 9% depending on how strong the candle is more fragrance does not always mean a stronger hot throw it's important that you have the proper wick size because the proper wick size provides an optimal fragrance combustion so therefore a candle with a 6% fragrance load and the right wick size may smell stronger than a 9% candle with the wrong wick size so to determine which candle has the strongest hot throw you're going to take each candle and place it in its own broom it's ideal that you keep the room similar in size and ventilation that way they're easily comparable you let them burn for a couple of hours and you decide which room smells the strongest I really can't stress how important this step is when you're creating a new candle on your candle line when you're creating a new candle most of the effort should be put into this step right here it may seem like a lot of work upfront but it's so important because once you know how to make this candle correctly you'll know how to make this candle every single time for years to come so that's all for today I hope you enjoyed this video and I

you believe that its third trimester already yikes anyway look at our goal today we're in chapter 8 and we want to compare and convert US customary systems that's our system okay and then the metric system now i'm going to give you a page to help you so please use the chapter 8 measurement sheet to help and I want you to paper clip it to page 190 and your note-taking guides so you always have it handy alright so take a look here at an example 1 let's say that I want to convert from 27 feet into how many yards well something that will help you notice how they gave us feet I put that first and they want us to change it into yards I put that second and now you just have to use a little bit of real life and common sense you know how a foot is smaller than a yard oh here comes kitty kitty to help well and so I would put the is lesson symbol notice how it's pointing to the left hand side like to the negative side of a number line well let's whenever it points to the left we're going to divide okay and so I just have to figure out what am I going to divide by well I know that there are three feet in a yard if you look at the sheet so I'm just going to take the 27 and I'm going to divide it by three and that's going to give me an answer of nine yards take a look at B let's say that I want to change from liters to milliliters well since leaders and milliliters are the metric system you want to use the metric part of your helpful chapter eight sheet and if you put your finger on liter the capital L and move to milliliter you'll see you have to move your finger three places to the right well that's exactly what we're going to do with the decimal point we're going to grab the decimal point at the where it starts between the four and the five and we move it one two three places to the right and that will give us four thousand five hundred milliliters okay sorry I had to pause to pull a highlighter pen out of my little pugs mouth the cat had knocked it off the table and then Fiona grabbed it and ran so anyway I'm back ok take a look at example 3 the track and field meet takes place in eight days underline that the softball game takes place in 204 hours underline that which will occur first ok so that means which will occur in the shortest amount of time the first thing to occur so we need to convert eight days in two hours so that we can compare them so put days first leave a space and then put hours and then use a little common sense right a day is bigger than an hour so that this point that it would be is greater than when it points to the right we're going to multiply so how many hours are in a day you should say 24 hours or in a day so I'm going to take the eight days and i want to multiply by 24 and that's going to turn it in two hours so i get 192 hours so now i put the 192 that represents when the track and field me is going to take place and 200 for that represents when the softball is going to take place and notice how 192 is smaller you know that that's smaller so is less than so that means because 192 hours is less than 200 four hours the track meet is going to happen first ok take a look at number one they want us to change 18 meters in two millimeters so remember use our chart and I just wrote it here real quickly so whenever they give me meters on the metric system I put my finger on meters and then I move it 2 millimeters one two three places to the right so grab the decimal point remember on the number 18 it's at the end grab it and move it one two three places to the right that would give us eighteen thousand millimeters take a look at number 2 80 ounces is how many pounds well I put the label of ounces then I leave a space and a label of pounds and you have to use a little common sense here but ounces is definitely smaller than pounds and so when it points to the left that's when we know we have to do vide to get our answer so start off with what they gave us the 80 and we're going to divide it by 16 because remember there are 16 ounces in one pound and so 80 / 16 gives us 5 so that means that 80 ounces is the same as 5 pounds take a look at number 37 quartz equals how many pints will put the label of cords put the label of pints and a quart is bigger than a pint so put is greater than whenever it points to the right we're going to multiply and so I start off with my seven from seven chords and I multiply by two because remember there are two pints in a quart and that will give me 14 pints now you can cross off four five and six because we're not going to convert from our system the u.s. system to the metric system you can cross those out but take a look at number seven the school dance will take place in 360 hours and the school talent show will take place in nine days which will occur first so put we're going to change the days in two hours so put the day and then the hour and you know that a day is greater than an hour so it would point to the right so we would multiply so take the nine days the nine and x 24 because remember there are 24 hours in one day and that would give us two hundred sixteen hours so then I would write 216 hours 360 hours and of course 216 is less as smaller so that means that the 216 represents a talent show that means the talent show is going to happen first okay some of you go ahead and cross this off real lightly but some of you have given me some really good ideas to make sure that people actually listen to the video and not just copy what they see so what I'd like you to do on this page is pleased right right here tell me what happened with my dog Fiona the pug and my kitty kitty during this movie okay thank you bye", "derLwKsa77Y": "[Music] okay so I just back from the casting field in doing the quote around square bill cast battle for the $99 real shootout so just like before I'm going to show you guys a countdown from the lowest to the winner okay out here we got the lose speed spool we got the spool tension set just to eliminate the side-to-side play and the breaks are probably three-quarters of the way to maximum that's the lowest I could go and of course we got the quarter round square bill here we go 96 feet 3 inches 96 feet 10 inches [Applause] 98 feet 9 inches 95 feet 1 inch [Applause] 95 feet 2 inches okay next up we have the Abu Garcia Revo X these settings are pretty much the same as the lose the spool tension is set to minimize the side-to-side play and the break setting is about 3/4 of the way to maximum which is not surprising since they are basically the same break system here we go 96 feet 9 inches 95 feet 7 inches 99 feet 7 inches [Applause] hmm 103 6 inches ninety-seven feet six inches okay finally we have the quantum accuracy PT the internal brakes are set to four the external magnet brakes look like they're sit to about eight or six or seven I'm sorry and the spool tension is set you just eliminate the side-to-side play here we go ninety six point five [Music] [Applause] 97.9 [Applause] 100 feet 2 inches [Applause] whoa 105 9 inches 98 feet even okay you next up we have to die before you go I have the spool tension set to just from the minute at the side-to-side play and the brakes are set it looks to be on nine so here we go [Applause] 106 five inches [Applause] 101 seven inches 99 feet three inches [Applause] 95 feet 2 inches okay since the dude systems are getting shorter for the Fuego I'm gonna back the brakes off one click to eight see if that gives me more [Applause] ninety-six nine inches okay so since that gave me a bad overrun I'm gonna go back to the nine sitting [Applause] 100 feet 3 inches okay up next is the one 3 origin see I have the internal brakes set to 5 and I have a pretty tight spool tension so the fall is medium fast because once again the origin see doesn't like loose wheel tension here we go [Applause] 103 9 inches 98 feet 10 inches 105 9 inches 99 feet 9 inches [Applause] 99 feet four inches okay so up next we have the Shimano casitas I have two breaks on inside the spool tension is set to just eliminate the side-to-side play the external dial is at one so here we go 101 and 11 inches 104 feet 10 inches 102 feet even [Applause] 105 feet 7 inches 103 feet 1 inch okay so as you can see the one this one followed by the origin see and then the fuego in third place and at fourth place the quantum Acuras PT 5th place is the Abu Garcia Revo X and bringing up the rear once again is the lose speed spool LFS now technically the urgency and the casitas tied for longest average cast in the last test with the cinco but this was a more clear-cut victory for the casitas this time is it beat out the urgency by about two feet now there wasn't a lot in it as far as like averages they all were within seven feet of each other so it wasn't like it was a blowout and this cuz he has just stomped everybody or the speed spool was just lagging behind everybody and one thing I will say is I overestimated the casting ability or I should say I overestimated the length and a quarter ounce square bill would fly because I thought at least these guys would be hitting 120 Plus feet but a lot of them struggled to even hit a hundred feet a couple extra side notes here the urgency hit the longest overall cast in practice I think it was 111 or 110 feet the speed spool did hit 102 or 103 feet in practice but it couldn't break 200 foot barrier during recording and the casitas I believe hit a hundred and eight feet in practice but couldn't replicate it in the recording now one thing I will say is as far as the yo-yo made reels which is the Revo X and the speed spool I wish they would have put numbers on the side of these reels because a lot of guys they'll pick up their favorite lure and little know automatically what number they want to set so let's say you pick up a cinco and you know that the best setting is 10 well there's no numbers here to show you what 10 is so you're gonna have to click it off kind of a convenience thing just a suggestion for Abu Garcia and or lose if one of their representatives are watching this video okay so I cleared the table of all the other reels except for these two probably wondering why now it looks like it's turning into pretty much a two horse race between the origin CE and the casitas and that's actually strange to me and I'll tell you why now first to explain why I have to pop the spools out now on paper the casitas has the lightest spool and it has the shallowest if not one of the most shallow line capacities so it doesn't hold nearly as much line as the origin see and by holding them I can tell this one is significantly heavier so I'm gonna get a wait to see what the difference is so the casitas filled with line you're looking at twenty four point eight grams so the origin c filled with line you're looking at twenty nine point four grams so almost a 5 gram difference in rotational mass so maybe a four gram difference because the of the bearing but because the spool is lighter the casitas should be theoretically at least in my eyes casting much farther with these lighter weights than the gorge see so why is the origin see keeping up and I think I found the answer now I want to give a shout out to Carl at keeping it real fishing he does some of the best real reviews out there if not the best he did a review of a real called Okuma helios now in that review he read off the manufacturers spec sheet and one of the features of that reel was that Okuma gave that real higher spec Japanese ABEC 5 spool bearings now you're wondering why that's significant to the origin see is because the origin C is made in the same factory as the Okuma which I believe is the ban axe factory so one of the features for the origin series they said it had Japanese high spin spool bearings so I'm willing to bet that those are the same a back five spool bearings that are in the Okuma Helios so that to me explains why the origin C casts a well enough to keep up with the much lighter spooled Shimano casitas so even with the light lures the origin C casts very well despite having the heavier spool so the next test is going to be the lipless crank and i would not be surprised to see the origin c when that one as well as the really heavy top water because you're looking at really long cast distances with really high spool speeds so but there's only one way to find out so one thing to note as far as the standardized testing system each reel was to get one point for every foot they averaged with this lure over 100 feet so since only three reels averaged over 100 feet those are the only three reels that are going to be getting positive points see this origin c and the fuego and the rest of these reels unfortunately will be getting negative points because they could not average over 100 foot which I will show you guys in a thumbnail after this all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "kPa8crk-NEI": "we shot this earlier today but i changed shirts to fool all of you into thinking it's a different day and i'm sitting on my garbage can waiting for this water to boil who are we kidding i don't think i'm fooling anyone hey everyone i'm claire welcome to my home kitchen today i have a very special recipe in honor of valentine's day but frankly it's perfect any day of the week any month of the year it's my forever brownies it is a perfect chewy chocolatey but not too chocolatey brownie and special bonus it has melted milk powder in it my forever brownies so named because it's the only recipe i'll ever need [Music] as a brownie lover i particularly prefer a chewy brownie not a cakey brownie i feel like a cakey brownie is just chocolate cake i wanted it to be a dense chewy brownie but one that was fully baked and didn't just rely on under baking to give me that kind of like fudgy texture why did you name it forever right so i called these my malted forever brownies because for me this is now my go-to recipe i won't need another one i'll always go back to this one it's my forever brownie we're in a long term it's a long-term thing me and this recipe [Music] special equipment zero none you just need basic stuff you already have in your kitchen so i have a saucepan over here bowl whisk and an 8x8 pan this recipe has like more ingredients than the average brownie but it's again all super basic stuff so i have semi-sweet chocolate all-purpose flour vanilla extract the malted milk powder which is optional but recommended large eggs brown sugar granulated sugar unsalted butter vegetable oil milk chocolate and cocoa powder and also i'm missing salt that's all what is melted milk powder i've really been trying to i know what like malted stuff is but i have no wheat flour and malted barley extracts so to malt something malting is a process that's used in a lot of like making of spirits and beer where you basically sprout the grain i don't really know what it is the point is it makes things taste delicious it pairs really well with chocolate it's really good i recommend it [Music] oh we have to talk about the 8x8 pan so i have a problem that is ongoing whereby i keep losing my 8x8 metal pan so this is the only 8x8 pan i could find last night realizing i didn't have my metal pan no idea where it is second time i've lost it so now i'm using glass i recommend you use metal i'm going to baking glass and it's going to be fine the first thing i want to do is prepare my pan i have the oven already preheated to 350 which is going to be our baking temp so here is just a sheet of aluminum foil the reason i like foil for brownies is because you can really press the foil into all of the corners of the pan and get it really flat and then it makes it easy to lift out and now you can use melted butter this is just very room temp butter and it's a little warm in here i just want to coat the foil so the first little pre step to this recipe is to do something called bloom the cocoa so basically i'm going to combine the cocoa and hot water and this just brings out the flavor of the cocoa oh the vet texted a photo of felix what's he it he looks so sad and uncomfortable doesn't he look sad poor kitty all right so now i have a electric kettle right here and i'm just bringing this to a boil i'm just gonna sit here and wait for this to boil i got a lot of sticky buns over here there's actually there have been [Music] maybe fewer than a half dozen little typos that i found in the book and there's a typo in this recipe and it is involving this step the recipe says a quarter cup of boiling water but then it says i think four ounces which is a half cup the correct measurement is a quarter cup or two ounces but readers have written in to say that they made it with a half cup and it still turns out great so if you made that mistake don't worry so to this i'm adding six ounces of semi-sweet chocolate then a quarter cup of oil oil contributes to a chewier texture in the final brownie six tablespoons of unsalted butter this whole thing needs to get melted together chocolate is a very very sensitive ingredient particularly temperature sensitive so that's just to say whenever we melt it we want to do that very gently and that's why i use a setup called a double boiler double boiler is kind of an old-fashioned term there's literally like a set of cookware called a double boiler that is a pot with another pot that's set into it and it fits together but most people don't have that so we're just using that same idea i have a saucepan that's coming to a simmer over a fairly gentle heat you don't want to rapidly boil it it's filled with like an inch of water and the idea is that i'm setting a bowl over it a heat proof bowl that's very important and the water underneath is going to simmer it's going to create steam and the steam will gently warm what's in the bowl and i don't need to stir this on the heat until the chocolate is completely melted i can actually take it off the heat and let the heat that's already in the bowl finish melting the chocolate i just want to go most of the way this is totally melted the great thing about brownies is like we're already almost done it's very quick once you have all the ingredients measured out so it's a very um like instant gratification recipe except for the part where i say to chill it for at least an hour at the end but we'll talk about that okay the next step is to add the sugars to your chocolate mixture i'm using a half cup each of light brown sugar and granulated sugar and i'm doing that because the little addition of brown sugar also creates a bit of chewiness and i like the sort of um molasses-y flavor it's subtle but i think it goes well with the chocolate this mixture as i whisk it it looks it's going to look grainy that's normal don't worry just power through keep whisking once you have your sugar very well incorporated i'm going to add my eggs at this stage i found that when you whisk the eggs in really well they it tends to produce that sort of shiny crackly top that to me is what i want the neighbor i think the neighbors are vacuuming it's a loud vacuum was i supposed to add the vanilla yeah i'm supposed to add the vanilla should i wait [Music] okay excellent all right the upstairs vacuuming is stopped um i forgot to add the vanilla i'm gonna do that along with the eggs so one and a half teaspoons it's important for a few reasons that you whisk the eggs in thoroughly you not only want them to bring the batter together and you should have something that looks super super smooth so go ahead and give it elbow grease that's that and now we're going to add the dry ingredients i have three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt kosher salt if you're using morton use half the amount okay now i'm adding the kind of secret ingredient which is melted milk powder two tablespoons i'm whisking slowly to incorporate and once i have all that flour worked in now i want to go ahead and whisk this i think i say in the book a full 45 seconds so once i've added the flour here is the chance to develop a little bit of a chewy texture by working that flower and trying to develop a little bit of gluten you can see it makes this beautiful ribbon i feel like i'm in one of those lint commercials last step i'm going to fold in milk chocolate there's been such a trend toward ultra bitter dark chocolate and i went along with it for a while only to kind of realize like i don't love something that bitter and i'm kind of into milk chocolate i love how creamy it is how easily it melts this is why you don't want to make that chocolate mixture too hot at the beginning you don't want to fold the milk chocolate into a hot batter because it'll melt i feel like this pan says it's an eight by eight but it's really not the bottom of this pan is six inches across do you see that in what world is this an 8x8 pan i would like someone to explain to me so in this pan whereas typically i use a metal one the batter is going to sit a little taller it's going to be a thicker layer it's going to take probably longer than it typically would to bake so typically with glass i bake 25 degrees lower than the recipe states because i always test the recipe in metal unless i say this is designed for a glass pan but in the case of these brownies because the batter is in a thicker layer i think i am going to actually leave it on 350. and it's just the nature of brownies that these are not going to over bake the way that like a cake would so you're still fine at 350 in glass i feel like a little crazy right now i think i need to drink some water [Music] i feel like i sound crazy i'm talking really fast [Music] the brownies are done they went a little longer than expected but i'll show you how you know when they're done i see cracks along the surface they have pulled away from the sides and when i press in the center what do i say in the book it's like soft but firm or something like that hold on oh okay so the center is dry to the touch but still soft when pressed which i think i nailed it so dry to the touch but still you can see i got some squishiness in there these are going to cool at room temp and when i feel like the bottom of the pan is no longer hot i can either stick the whole thing in the fridge or unmold them cover them and chill at least an hour so i'm going to let these sit here and then pop them in the fridge all right so i'm looking on maybe one of my favorite pages in the whole book which is a recipe matrix which is an idea that i had that i included in the book which basically locates every single recipe on on like a grid with time on the x-axis and difficulty on the y so the really easy quick recipes are the bottom left and i'm looking for brownies and i seriously don't even see them so there's miso buttermilk buttermilk biscuits which are very quick and easy poppy's eating almond cake quick and easy the banana bread quick and easy oh they're right here i see them i see them all right there they are malted forever brownies now this is brings up a good point so i had to look sort of toward the center of the matrix to find them and that's because even though the batter takes minutes and they only take 30 minutes to bake you definitely don't want to cut warm brownies because they won't cut cleanly and they'll you know crumble and everything the other thing is when you chill brownies it gives the butter a chance to set it gives the sugar a chance to kind of like crystallize and you end up with a super super chewy texture and basically the brownies kind of cure so i think that this recipe is not complete until the brownies have had a chance to chill and i have a batch that i made last night and i'm gonna pull out because those have been chilling and they are ready to be eaten oh yay [Applause] where do i put this uh oh the brownies so let's see these are nice and cold this recipe makes 16 nice-sized brownies so you can see the pockets of milk chocolate which have hardened because they've been in the fridge kind of taste i like an edge piece but not a corner piece i've not had these brownies in a long time they really hold up they are the right amount of intensity not too sweet the chocolate really shines and most importantly it has a wonderfully chewy texture obviously this is a rich chocolate recipe perfect for valentine's day i hope you try it but then again there's like no wrong time to make or eat brownies at all so thank you for watching another episode of dessert person i love showing you recipes from the book and stay tuned and like and subscribe oh ferocious cake let go let go oh [Music]", "-5XVRnO9BlE": "this video is to demonstrate the little tiger from Thomas lures I'm fishing here in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania I selected the little tiger 1/8 ounce spoon for this spot because I needed a smaller more for this really small stream I couldn't go throw in a quarter ounce or 1/3 ounce spoon into a stream like this because it would cause too much of a commotion in a in a stream of this size and it would definitely spook the fish I also chose us lure because it sinks very quickly so when we get it into our spot even though this current is pretty Swift it's gonna sink really fast and we can get down to where the fish are and start retrieving it if we throw in a spinner like a panther Marten it would get washed probably like 4 to 6 feet downstream of where we want to be before it would get to the depth that we want we're gonna start making our cast here we really want to get right into that corner as far as we can without obviously touching the bank okay that X is where I want to cast and then you're gonna see a wide pop up on the screen and that's where I expect the fish to be okay we laid our lower right in there on the X and now we're pulling it in front of where we expect this fish to be and there he is hopefully this video can help you out if you encounter a spot like this on the stream and you can utilize the little tiger check out our web site best trout lures calm for the best selection of trout lures and more great videos", "ZOyd9-X5I5Y": "oh then today I'm going to show you how to measure out four liters of liquid when you've only got a five liter container and a three liter container and unlimited supply of liquid now if you want to think about the answer press on the pause button in the top bottom left hand corner otherwise I'm going to go straight into the answer so so what we'll do there we'll fill up the three liter container first and obviously that is these are just scale models that doesn't actually hold three liters but just for the video I've just done it as a scale model and you can apply the same principle if you want to work out the you know measure for gallons and you've got a five gallon in a three gallon container or four ounces and you've got a five ounce and a through or and a three ounce container so there we go we've got three liters of liquid in the three liter container so we'll pour that into the five and so five and then we've got two liters remaining of space in that five liter container and so we're going to fill up the three liter container again fill that up to the brim and we'll pour that into the five liter container and obviously it'll only take two out of that three liters we'll go into the five and we'll left be left with one liter then in the three liter container and now we're just going to empty out that five liter container yep put that to one side and then we'll pour the 1 liter that's left in the 3 liter into the fight fill up the 3 liter container again you're going to fill that up to the brim and pull that into the 5 liter container we've got one liter in there and we pour in three that means we're left with four letters in the 5 liter container so there we go we've measured out four letters using four litres of liquid using a five liter container and a three liter container", "EwYSkXYq-oI": "[Music] hey guys it's Jeff compressional luck and today it is so incredibly disgusting out it's snowing it's sleeting it's raining here in Queens but we're about to make is gonna make all that go away so we make a lot of things in our instant pot or at least I do anyway right so it seems only fitting for me to make a recipe on this freezing and disgusting day in the instant pot that has the word pot in it now get your minds out of the gutter guys finally it's here we're making a pot roast and it's gonna be one of the most outrageous pot roasts you ever devoured and now you know I would never steer you wrong and I hope you know that by now so guys you're gonna see how simple this is how little prep goes into this I mean it's just a little bit of cooking time to make it super tender and divine so guys it's time to go to pot because we're gonna make the most amazing flavorful outrageous juicy tender astounding pot roast right in the instant pot instant pot roast let's go I want to begin with two medium yellow onions and then slice them up long ways and then into little wedges so we kind of have like a look like this going line see nice thick pieces let's set those aside alright guys so a key ingredient to a pot roast is a great cut of meat and a lot of people like using chuck roast I'm using a beef round or a rump roast for this I really like this for this it's nice and more bold as you see it's a great cut a chuck roast is good and so is it beef round rump roast and this is about three pounds worth so you can go between three to five pounds I feel like three pounds is the perfect amount and actually he's gonna make quite a lot on the will cook down four guys this thing's gonna be super super filling and just full flavor okay so now we want to do with our rump roast is we want to season it rump it sounds like a big ol til she doesn't it anyway what we want to do is we want to season it and guys there's gonna be a lot of seasonings going on here to make this thing so fantastic in terms of flavor so we want to do is we want to start with two teaspoons of black pepper one and a half teaspoons of kosher salt one and a half teaspoons of seasoned salt I'm using Lowery's one teaspoon of dried thyme one teaspoon of dried rosemary one teaspoon of onion powder one teaspoon of garlic powder and a half a tablespoon of dried parsley flakes and then just mix all that up together in our little mixing bowl here and then pour it onto a plate because it's gonna be easy this way to lay our meat on top of it and then make sure that we Pat all the sides of it so it's nice and coated and seasoned now I want to take my beef and I want to now rub it in all the spices and make sure we get it nice and good on both sides just really get all of it pretty much rubbed in should be plenty to go around you see that parts a little messy but it's also a lot of fun and by the way if there's a lot of excess fat on the roast which mine did not have you can either keep it there or you can just trim it off keeping it there will make more flavor happen though all the corners get all the edges and voila there we have it our seasoned delicious rump roast or chuck roast now I want to go to the instant pot and I want to add in two tablespoons of olive oil extra virgin so now I want to come down to the control panel and hit the saute function and it just saw them on the more the high setting on the dual plus by the way to adjust you just hit the saute button until you hit the desired temperature whereas on the duo series you hit the adjust button and let's give it some heat and let's let the oil heat up between two to three minutes in the pot and after about three minutes of the oil heating up in the pot let's take our roast in there and we're going to sear each side now we're gonna leave it on each side for about a minute and after about a minute let's flip it over the other side spear that one smelling great and after another minute of searing on the other side we're gonna take it out and then just transfer it back to a plate just like this and we are looking good and now let's focus our attention back on the pot I'm gonna add in one tablespoon of salted butter and I'm gonna quickly just mix that around in the pot so we can help you glaze all the spices that might be stuck on there so when we were searing the meat and this is butter is gonna help get everything up so to scrape the bottom with a wooden or plastic spoon not everything needs to come off at the bottom of the pot to be fairly clean by now alright and now let's add in our onions we're gonna stir that around in the pot we're gonna let that cook for about two minutes now as the onions cook they're gonna release some water because they're full of water as most things are even humans are full of water did you know that and so it's gonna help deglaze the bottom of that pot you see now we're looking pretty clear from what we or perfect we don't want it to be caked on with spices so it's important that you constantly start around that butter as it was melting as well as the onions when you put them in for a moment and you see once the onions have been nice and mixed around all the remnants from the seasoning of the beef are all coated in the onion as well as the olive oil and butter so it's going to be phenomenal so let's let this cook for about two to three minutes but you can make a pot roast that's wonderful what so wonderful first you Brown an onion also when I add in a tablespoon of sliced garlic and two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and that you can really be glaze the bottom of the pipe you see that nothing sticking now we're gonna let this cook for about another two minutes so all in all the onions about two to three minutes on their own and add the garlic and the Worcestershire sauce and then cook for another two minutes or so okay that's before we're finished here just make sure we scraping deglaze the bottom of the pot so it's nice and clean on the bottom but it really want any spices stuck on during this process okay now it's time to lay the trivet into the plot and leave the handles up and let's put our roast in now with clean hands and make sure the fatty side is up so the fat can drip through it and of course wash our hands after you've done that now I want to take a 6 ounces of sliced portobello mushrooms and lay them on top of our roast you can actually break them in half too if you want give you more that way there we go perfect and now I'm adding in 2 cups of beef broth as well as a cup of a good dry red wine like a Pinot Noir or something of that nature do not use red cooking wine for this use a good red wine that you would drink it's important for this and now we want to put some potatoes and carrots in there right but we don't want to put them directly in the pot because it might turn to mush so we're gonna put them inside of a foil wrapped bag that we're gonna securely create so I'm taking about a pound of baby white potatoes and I'm just gonna wrap it up in this coil there's my potatoes and then I want to take about 8 ounces of baby carrots and then do the same thing wrap them up nice and good and a little tin foil pouch will be created so I have my baby white potatoes here and then my baby carrots here lots of babies and now in our instant pot we should have plenty of room to put our foil wrapped vegetables so I'm going to put my baby potatoes right over here and my baby carrots right here just make them fit and it should be totally fine and that's it guys now we're ready to put the lid on top and cook secure my lid make sure I'm in sealing position okay and now that we're ready to pressure-cook let's hit the cancel button and now hit pressure cook or the manual button if you're on one of the older duo series and we want to go guys for one hour on this you see that on these pots that do a plus it'll say 1 and then 0 0 or as on the duo series it'll say 60 the right side on the duo plus our minutes and the left side or hours so one hour okay and be patient it's gonna take a little bit of time to come to pressure so don't worry and once the pin does pop up and it comes to pressure it's gonna stay on for about five more minutes before it begins counting down I'm while waiting for our pot roast to cook in the pot and since I had a crack open a bottle of red to make this recipe well Cheers I'll be busy for the next hour and now that we're done we're gonna allow a 15-minute natural release that means we're gonna wait until this reads 15 right over here this is minutes this is ours and the dual plus by the way and once that reads 15 then we're going to quick release so in other words we do nothing for 15 minutes except drink more wine and now that 15 minutes of a natural release have passed we're gonna finish it off with a quick release and our pin just dropped so let's take our lid off the pots and let's now carefully just remove our vegetables from the pot and then stir set these aside for a few moments come right back to these and there is our lovely pot roast inside of our pot well look at that and now look at how much more broth and sauce there is now did all the cooking alright so now let's remove our pot roast with the trivet nice and easy see how handy this TripIt comes in and then you can just flip the pot roast right on the trivet so we have it right laying on top of our cutting board perfection okay so let's let this cool for a few moments and move on to our next step so now I'm gonna come back down on my pot and hit the cancel button here and I'm gonna hit the saute button again and adjust or on the more or the high setting which it already is I'm gonna want to now focus my attention on the sauce and I want to thicken it by creating a cornstarch slurry so I want to take three tablespoons of cornstarch and combine it with three tablespoons of water and then just mix that up so it goes from like a cement light consistency to a nice smooth and creamy consistency just like that and there's your cornstarch slurry amazing thickening agent for any sauce and now I'm opening up my potatoes and look at that perfect right to the touch still perfect texture they're not mush what I want to do is I want to add it to the pot and I want to add in my carrots as well awesome and now that we're bubbling in the pot what I want to do is I want to add in my cornstarch slurry and immediately stir that around in the pot it sent me a lot of sauce guys it's almost like a stew amazing and I also want to add in a 1 ounce packet of a gravy mix if you want to it's optional and I'm using this all jewel one because well obviously it was on sale and all of why not again it's optional because the sauce already has plenty of flavor but I like to add it in as well give it a little bit more just give that all a nice good stir and let everything bubble in the pot for about a minute all right and once we're bubbling like that we can turn our pot off unless that the bubbles die down a little bit and guys let's look at this beautiful sauce full of potatoes and mushrooms and carrots and just an amazingly rich wonderful burgundy beef flavor mmm and you see how it's thickened up perfectly it's not too thick but it's not too thin it's like a wonderful glaze and I can't wait to pour it all over our pot roast speaking of which let's cut our pot roast up all right so our pot roast is gonna be super tender and it's gonna want to break apart which is totally normal as a pot Rose should so just take a good carving knife and cut against the grain and cut slices of it see this is cutting nicely I having a good knife here so there you go some pot roast right over here against the grain and you see that how it stays together perfect and you can just cut it into pieces if you want I like cutting my pot roast into pieces and then as you cut the pot roast add it to the sauce beautiful so nice so tender and you could slice it as thin or as thick really as you'd like I like it a little bit thinner but again take each slice here and just cut it up into pieces yeah look at how beautiful this is get every little last piece of that meat and let's add our final pieces of pot roast meat right into our instant pot now let's give everything a nice good old-fashioned stir and you're gonna see guys look at this it's like everything you'd ever want in a pot roast it's actually almost like a pot roast stew and I'm really okay with that because this is going to be insane look at the sauce look at how beautiful it is in terms of the glistening and the consistency and all this amazing pot roast meat with potatoes and carrots and dry and portobello mushrooms look at that a giant portobello mushrooms all right let's put it into a serving dish and serve it up all right now let's put some pot roast inside of our serving dish some mushrooms of course some more meat and of course let's make sure we get some of those carrots in there too oh boy and you know things shows everything so how about another potato will be here this is gonna make a lot by the way this will easily feed a family of four and maybe even six and you see that no mangled up veggies in this dish look at this see the potatoes still nice and firm to the touch

super X 1600 feet per second let's see if how close a foster slug can get get to that barrel at 200 yards often people think we're the most dangerous people on YouTube they'll see cars and other objects in the distance and think that because we don't have a berm that we're just doing something completely careless now they may not understand that cameras have a lot of zoom on them or understand the ballistics of a shotgun now the barrel is only 200 yards away which is not very far if you use on a rifle but it is quite a distance if you're using a shotgun shooting foster slugs now the bulldozer does look like it's very close but it is 900 yards away or just over half a mile certainly a shotgun slug can reach that far right this is a satellite view showing exactly the placement of everything the yellow X is where we're shooting the green X is the barrel at only 200 yards now before we show you the results try to estimate how far you think that one ounce slug with a muzzle velocity of 1600 feet per second will actually travel think about how far it might skip once it impacts the ground and think about things like the angle of the barrel you know lobbying it out there okay it bounced off the road and hit it yep these things don't carry as much in the wind either no yep a lot closer I gave them to the left left this okay do one more just for the road all right maybe get finally connected now remember that barrel was only 200 yards away and Greg was actually aiming about 12 feet above the target just to get it that far now it was a very hot day when we filmed and there was a lot of heat distortion but still you can clearly see that big one-ounce lug lobbying out there a 12-gauge slug is big it's relatively slow compared to a rifle round it does have a lot of mass but it does lose a tremendous amount of energy in fact it loses about 10% of its energy every ten yards even though the slug starts out at 1600 feet per second by the time it travels just 200 yards it's down to just around 200 feet per second and it just drops out of the air now bear in mind this was only filmed at 30 frames a second yet we could still see that slug traveling just a couple feet per frame and remember that Greg was aiming nearly 12 feet above the target so he was essentially lobbying them out there and at the angle that the slug impacted it's unlikely it would actually skip and go much further than that and sheeting at a higher angle will just mean that it would travel about the same distance and come down at an even steeper angle so when you watch our videos please bear in mind that objects appear much closer than they really are and the highway in the background is three and a half miles away now it would be tough to get a shotgun slug only 5% that distance you probably have a better chance of throwing a ping-pong ball with your arm a hundred yards now please understand this is just an informational video giving you an idea how far a foster slug will actually travel the distance is surprisingly short will a shotgun slug travel half a mile no will it travel a quarter-mile hmm I don't know but it's just like when they put maximum range of a 22 as one-and-a-half miles on the box you should give yourself more than enough room just to be safe thanks for watching", "ASZPgkD6fOk": "What's up guys Tim with...hold on a second. This just looks too damn good. mmmm....mmmmm That's good, I'm gonna spin this burger around when I shoot so you don't see that giant bite I just took out of it. Oh, well. All right. Let's let's start that over. Hey guys, Tim with Kitchen & Craft and today we're discussing the secret on how to make a better Beyond Burger. You know those plant-based meat patties that you find all over the place nowadays. By the way, this video is a collaboration with Marlon Doll. His channel focuses on healthy, tasty and affordable meals. So take a look at his version of the ultimate Beyond Burger when you're done watching my video. I'll leave a link toward the end for you. Marlon, and I would love to hear what burger you prefer. So leave a comment on either channel and let us know which is your favorite Beyond Burger. All right back to the discussion. This is my first time using this type of product and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed. They've done a great job imitating the look and the texture of beef but I gotta say it doesn't necessarily kill it on flavor for me. I mean. you can't just cook one of these burgers off, slap it between two buns, squirt some ketchup on it and call it a day. It's just not going to do it. So my secret is to pair it with high quality, highly flavorful, delicious ingredients. It doesn't sound like a huge secret, but there's plenty of people that'll go for a plain-jane burger and be sorely disappointed. with flavor aside, I think the biggest story here is the sustainability of beyond burger products in relation to beef. But that's a discussion for another day and quite frankly a different Channel All right back to the burger. Beyond Meat has done 90% of the work for us when it comes to the patty. They've made the burger and they pre-formed it. All we got to do is cook it so most of this video is gonna be about all of the other things that I'm pairing with it. I'm gonna knock out some delicious, super soft hamburger buns. We're gonna make some quick homemade ranch dressing I'll shred some lettuce and slice some red onion and let's not forget his spicy cucumber pickles. The recipe of which I will leave in the upper right-hand side of this video. This particular burger might not be vegan or vegetarian, but it certainly can be with some quick substitutions. It's my version of a better Beyond Burger and it's damn delicious so I hope you like it. It's time to check out my recipe so let's go. Hey guys, welcome to my video on the secret to making a better Beyond Burger. Hint...it's all about the fixin's. Alright, we're gonna kick things off by adding some warm water to a mixing bowl. The water should be about a 100\u00b0F. Add a little bit of sugar, stir that around to dissolve it and then go in with your yeast. Let that bloom for about five minutes, then add the remaining sugar, your kosher salt, all of the unsalted butter, which should be at room temp, one egg, then all of your flour. If you have a stand mixer go ahead and attach your bowl with the dough hook. If you don't no worries at all. This is really easy to mix by hand. I just happen to have a stand mixer So, you know, it'd be silly for me not to use it. If you're using a KitchenAid mixer turn it to setting number two. I find this is the best setting when kneading dough . At first, this dough's gonna look kind of dry and then it's gonna start to get shaggy and eventually everything is just gonna come together and you'll have a beautiful dough. But if for some reason the dough is too wet or dry, you can add some flour or water a little bit at a time until it comes together to the right consistency. So after about 10 minutes of kneading your dough should look exactly like this. It should be silky smooth in texture, have pulled away from the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still sort of be sticking to the bottom of the bowl. Now it's time to generously flour your work surface and turn the dough out on to it. Continue kneading for a few minutes by pulling the edges of the dough and folding them in toward the center. Then, flip the dough over and start rolling It counterclockwise or clockwise Doesn't really matter, but roll it with your hands to form a dough ball. Place your dough ball in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic film or a wet towel and let it double in size. It should take about an hour. Alright, once again, turn your dough out onto a floured work surface and cut it into eight pieces. They should weigh approximately 80 grams each. This weight works perfectly for the Beyond burger patty sizes. If you want larger buns, cut the dough into six pieces that weigh about a hundred grams each and they'll be a much more appropriate for half-pound burger sizes. Place your dough balls on a parchment lined sheet pan and arrange them using the 2-1-2 to layout. Then press each bun down a little bit. That'll keep them from puffing up too much on their second rise. Hit each piece of dough with a little bit of cooking spray or brush them with oil. This is gonna keep them from sticking to the plastic that you need to cover the dough with so it doesn't dry out during its second rise. Okay, after an hour or so your buns should have doubled in size. The final step before baking is to brush each bun with some egg wash. Be delicate here. You don't want to press too hard or you'll deflate the dough and then you just have to start all over again. Or you could just admit defeat and go to the store and buy some potato rolls. After 15 minutes in a 400\u00b0F oven, this is what your buns will look like. Not too shabby eh? Place them on a baking rack and then cover them with a towel. Let the buns rest for about 15-20 minutes so they can cool off and soften up a bit. Now, on to some good old ranch dressing. Add your sour cream, your mayonnaise, your dried herbs and spices, some salt and pepper and a little bit of buttermilk, then stir until everything's combined. As an optional ingredient you can add some lemon zest or a little bit of lemon juice. That'll give the dressing a brighter note. But again, totally optional. Go ahead and place that ranch in a container and store it in the fridge until your burgers are ready. We are moving on with our topping prep by shredding some lettuce, slicing some red onion and grabbing some of those super delicious spicy cucumber pickles that you can make with a recipe that I will leave in the upper right-hand side of this video. And I almost forgot the American cheese. Not so elegant with a serrated knife am I? Anyways, when your buns cool off, cut one in half, butter it up and toast it off on a preheated griddle. Now ladies and gents, it's time for the main event. Grab your Beyond Meat patties, season one side up with some salt and pepper, brush it with some oil and slap it on the griddle. Make sure your patty has good contact with the griddle. That'll help with browning and improve the flavor. When you're ready to flip, season the patty with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add a drizzle of oil and proceed. After about three minutes of cooking on each side, it's time to add your cheese. I'm going for a quick melt here so I need some steam and a bowl to help me with that. Now that the buns and the rancher made, the toppings are sliced, the patties cooked and the cheese is melted, it's time to build this burger. I really hope you enjoyed the video.

Bye.", "kOJFSH_Bn9U": "welcome to math with mr. J in this video we're going to convert metric units of length and we're specifically going to be working with millimeters centimeters meters and kilometers now our base unit of length for the metric system is a meter so everything's going to be based off a meter and we're going to use prefixes to create other units of length and those prefixes will tell us what those units of length mean in comparison to that meter okay so for example millimetre milli the prefix milli means one one thousandth of a meter so it takes a thousand millimeters to equal one meter centimeter the prefix centi means 1/100 of a meter so it takes a hundred centimeters to equal one meter and lastly we have kilometer and the prefix kilo means 1000 so it takes a thousand meters to equal a kilometer and all those notes are right here up top and we can reference those as we go through the convergence now as a point of reference here so we know a little bit about what these units of length mean and represent a millimeter is about the thickness of a paper clip so it's a very small unit of length not how long that paper clip is but how thick it is a centimeter is about how wide the average pinky is or how wide a staple is and on most rulers centimeters will be marked on the metric portion of that ruler and then a meter is a little over a yard so a meter stick a little longer than a yard and then kilometer is a little over a half mile so kilometers are used to measure long distances so let's get into some conversions here and number one we have three meters equals how many centimeters well 1 meter is a hundred centimeters so we have 3 100 100 100 and whenever we go 2 meters to centimeters we multiply by a hundred so 3 meters equals 300 centimeters next we have 10 meters equals how many centimeters so again meters to centimeters multiplied by a hundred each one of those meters is a hundred centimeters and we have ten of them so let's multiply and we get 10 times 100 equals a thousand centimeters number 3 9 kilometers equal Z meters well in one kilometer there's one thousand meters and we have nine of them though so a thousand a thousand a thousand nine times or nine times a thousand so when we go kilometer to meter we multiply by a thousand and for this one specifically we get nine thousand number four 400 centimeters equals how many meters well each meter there's a hundred centimeters so we need to take that 400 and split it into groups of 100 each one of those groups of 100 equals a meter so we need to do 400 divide it into groups of a hundred or meters there and we end up with 4 so centimeter two meter divided by a hundred number five millimeters to centimeters so there are 10 millimeters in three centimeter so we need to divide by ten or split into groups of ten each one of those tens is a centimeter so 50 divided by 10 gives us five centimeters so millimeters to centimeters divided by ten number six eight thousand millimeters equals how many meters well there's a thousand millimeters in every meter so we need to split that 8,000 into groups of a thousand each one of those thousands is one meter so millimeters to meters divided by a thousand and we get eight meters all right so there's there you have it there are some basic conversions within metric units of length specifically millimeters centimeters meters and kilometers thanks so much for watching until next time please you", "p-3Heh1Te6M": "desserts today i am sharing my best and favorite dessert recipes this one is chocolate brownies and for this i need half cup of coconut oil or you can use butter if you want 3 tablespoons of semi-sweet chocolate chips i will add them in my butter or coconut oil and heat in microwave i will do 11 seconds for three to four times

able to melt your chocolate chips and coconut oil or butter properly once chocolate batter is ready i will add half cup of brown sugar here i am using 1 4 cup of brown sugar and 1 4 cup of maple syrup you can use the full half cup of brown sugar and mix it well with your butter and chocolate mixture one teaspoon of vanilla extract and now two eggs one egg at a time before putting your egg see if your chocolate mixture is cooled down do not put your eggs in a warm chocolate mixture or it will scramble your eggs it's a very simple recipe here is the second egg mix it and you don't need a machine to mix everything just use a fork [Music] i have 3 4 cup of all-purpose flour and i'm using it in my chocolate and egg batter and mix everything together keep stirring it until everything is

i put some parchment in it and i'll pour my mixture on it you can see there are only few ingredients in these brownies and they are very simple to make [Music] put all the mixture and now spread it better is thick so you will use a spoon to spread it and now you will bake in a preheated oven at 350 degree fahrenheit for 22 to 30 minutes everyone has different temperatures so keep an eye on it after 22 minutes i did the toothpick test and my brownies are done do not over bake your brownies and when they are completely cooled then cut them do not cut them hot brownies are ready they look fudgy tasty chocolaty let's make another recipe delicious and tasty snow cookies hi welcome to food delicious kitchen by sabha how are you doing we are making very simple and easy snow cookies my way in general snow cookies have lots of butter and made with pecans only i like to reduce the amount of fat without compromising on the taste and i use some almonds with pecans for more flavor these snow cookies are rich and nutty in taste and mildly sweet a perfect cookie on a chilly cold day and the bonus is these cookies taste great next day before starting the video if you are new to my channel don't forget to subscribe and press the bell icon button so you don't miss my future videos thank you let's start here are the ingredients for my snow cookies as you can see there are only six ingredients in the cookies and there is no egg i have one cup of unbleached all purpose flour i am using coconut oil you can use a stick of room temperature butter 1 cup of nuts these are almonds and pecans 3 tablespoons of sugar vanilla extract and we need some powdered sugar it is confectioners powdered sugar we will use it to coat our cookies as you can see you need only few items and the bonus is there is no egg in it in a dry pan add your nuts i have half cup of almonds and half cup of pecans you can use full cup of pecans if you don't like almonds i like this almond and pecan combination and we will toast them on a medium heat for three to four minutes they will not change their color you will just know when they will have a nice nutty smell in them and it will not take longer like 2-3 minutes so stay with your nuts otherwise they can burn i can smell they are well toasted so now i will put them on my cutting pad and chop them roughly if you want to have a nice fine job put it in a food processor and chop there i just like to chop them roughly so i when i bite in to my cookie i can taste nuts it's your personal preference if you want finer chop you can do it on the cutting board or you can do in a chopper this is how i like it now our nuts are ready for the cookies and when you toast them it gives an extra flavor in your cookies in a bowl i will add one cup of all-purpose flour this is unbleached all purpose flour in it add 1 cup of your toasted nuts [Music] 3 tablespoons of sugar these cookies are not overly sweet so you need very less sugar in it one teaspoon of vanilla extract i am using 5 tablespoons of coconut oil i melted it in microwave you can use up to eight tablespoons in this recipe if you are using us if you are using butter you can use one full stick of butter room temperature butter which is eight tablespoons but i like to use less as less as i can so i will mix it and if i feel i need more fat in it to combine the cookies i will add more right now it's five tablespoons [Music] these cookies will be crumbly and they taste fantastic and i like uh the thing about them is the next day they taste better than the first day i will add basically one and a half more tablespoons so total of six and a half tablespoon of coconut oil i used for my cookies and i'll mix it together mix it well until the dough comes together as you see there is not much liquid in it when the dough will come together we are done [Music] see when you press it it comes together so this is good for me i'll just squeeze everything together with hand you can do more with your spoon this way i know that my coconut oil is everywhere and it everything is well mixed [Music] these cookies are very good they have a good shelf life and you can keep them in refrigerator for a long time like for few weeks if you can keep them that long they are so tasty they just go fast i am putting a plastic wrap on my counter and i'll put all the cookie mixture on top i am putting it on plastic crab just for an easy handling but if you don't want to use plastic wrap you can use in the same bowl and now i will just try to make it together as you can see it's coming along you can make a ball in in the bowl instead of on a plastic wrap i just like it that way it's a little easier for me and now our cookie dough is ready i'll wrap it again we'll put it in the refrigerator for 45 minutes at least after 45 minutes we are ready to make cookies [Music] you need to rest your dough so when you make cookies they will come together easily [Music] and now you will make cookies i am making bite size cookies these are crumbly cookies i don't like to make too big because then they get messy when you eat them bite size is the right size you can make a circle out of it or sometimes i just make [Music] like this rectangular kind of shape i just like it it has more grooves in it so make all your cookies i'm showing you again just press in your hand two three times and it's there if you want a perfect circle you will have to do a little effort or make your nuts very fine then you don't have the problem of breaking it for me i like to make it this shape this recipe will make 23 cookies the size i was using bite size it will make 23 cookies i will put in a 350 degree preheated oven for 13 to 14 minutes every oven has different heat so keep an eye when they are done take them out and roll your warm cookies gently in powdered sugar right now cookies are very warm so handle them with cure or they can [Music] break [Music] warm cookies will take powdered sugar very nicely as you can see [Music] and now let them cool down and then if we need another coat we will coat them again with powdered sugar i don't think i need another one but i'll show you how to do it when cookies are completely cooled down this is how they are looking at this time if you want you can do a second coating on your cookies for me this much coating is enough so i'm not doing any more snow cookies are ready they are crumbly rich flavorful and delicious you can keep them fresh for four days on shelf in an airtight container and you can keep them fresh longer in the

icon button so you don't miss any future video let's start cooking these are the ingredients for our rice pudding i have half cup of rice basmati rice which i soaked overnight 1 3 cup of sugar if you like more sugar add more sugar 1 3 cup of almond flour i am using half and half and fat free milk you can use whole milk instead with cream kiera water it's for fragrance and cardamom powder which is also called elaichi powder it gives a nice flavor i am using a nonstick heavy bottom pan in it i will add 2 cups of fat free milk i like to have thicker rice pudding so i am using two cups of fat free milk and two cups of half and half if you want a little runny rice pudding increase the amount of your milk by one more cup but for me two cups of each is good [Music] in it i will add one teaspoon of cardamom powder i have half cup of basmati rice i soak them overnight i just think if i soak them longer they cook better in rice pudding but if you don't have time and soak them at least 45 minutes now mix the rice milk and cardamom mixture together and we will cook it on a medium heat start cooking this milk and rice mixture i'll add a wooden spoon in it so i can keep stirring it after every few minutes and it also prevents the milk from bubbling out of the pan and put the lid on it afterwards so you are not closing it completely after 10 minutes our milk is starting to warm up making gentle bubbles and rice will cook in the milk it will take around 15 to 25 minutes depending on your heat keep stirring it every five to seven minutes so you will not burn your rice pudding on the bottom [Music] after 20 minutes rice are cooked and milk is getting thick now is the time to add my almond flour i use almond flour because my kids don't like to eat nuts in the dessert and this way i have the flavor of the almonds but they cannot taste it i mean they cannot bite it and secondly it helps with thickening the rice pudding if you don't have almond flour 1 3 cup of almonds if you grind them they'll give you 1 3 cup of almond flour after cooking 5 minutes almond flour is nice and thick now i will add 1 3 cup of sugar in it i don't use too much sugar so if you like sweeter rice pudding add more sugar for me 1 3 cup of sugar was enough but adjust the sugar level according to your taste and now let it cook for seven to eight minutes when you put sugar in your rice pudding it leaves some moisture so let it cook and after seven minutes my rice pudding is almost ready at this time if you want to add any nuts add them i'll just add a little bit of water [Music] so i have one teaspoon of kera water and i'll put in it and stir around and i will cook just for a minute or so don't cook it long otherwise all the fragrance will just evaporate after cooling down this rice pudding will thicken a little you want this consistency of rice pudding use the fifth cup of milk like i told you rice pudding is ready it is a rich creamy and delicious dessert as you see it takes a little bit time and effort but it's worth it you will have a wonderful creamy delicious dessert to eat you can serve it at room temperature or cold or even warm i will garnish it with some grinded

cheese our oreo cookie mixture is ready [Music] i'll add 1 8 teaspoon of peppermint extracts in it i just want to add some peppermint extracts for nice flavor and it's holiday season why not use peppermint extracts in it but don't overdo it otherwise it will taste artificial mix your peppermint extract in the oreo and cream cheese mixture [Music] now our mixture is ready i have a small tray i lined it with foil and now make balls out of it you can make any size balls you want i am just using bite cells my kids like to have and eat them in two bites and when you are making them if one chocolate ball becomes bigger than the other you can adjust the size by taking some off or by giving some more dough in it so make all the balls [Music] it's a great recipe to work with your kids they love to roll the balls and it's such a tasty recipe then when they will eat it they will feel proud of that you making this chocolate ball recipe this recipe will make with 16 cookies with the bite size ball i'm making around 10 to 11 chocolate balls now all chocolate balls are ready put them in a referee in the refrigerator for 30 minutes after 30 minutes i am putting half cup of white chocolate chips in a bowl and i will melt them in microwave [Music] be careful white chocolate burns faster than the dark chocolate so now dip all your oreo cookie balls or dip all your chocolate balls one by one in the chocolate [Music] if you want a perfect coating on your oreo balls put the chocolate and melted chocolate in a glass and use a toothpick and dip your chocolate balls with the help of a toothpick in that chocolate mixture i like to do the rustic way and just try to do a little faster because chocolate will start getting cold and hard i am not dipping all the chocolate balls in white chocolate i just like the color of black and white chocolate balls you can dip all your chocolate balls in white chocolate here are my chocolate balls i left some dark brown and some i coated in chocolate and put them in refrigerator for 30 minutes now our chocolate balls are ready chocolate is hard if you see it only took 45 minutes total of 45 minutes to make these balls and they are

total of one minute with 15 seconds each time and now i will add half cup of brown sugar in it when it's well combined brown sugar in the chocolate i will add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] mix it well [Music] now check if your chocolate sugar mixture is cooled down then we can add our eggs in it you cannot put eggs when your chocolate mixture is warm otherwise it will scramble the eggs i will add two eggs one at a time add one egg and mix it thoroughly and then add the other we added two eggs in the brownie mixture and we are saving one egg for our cheesecake filling now i am adding one cup of all-purpose flour and 1 4 cup of almond flour if you don't want to use almond flour use one end of 1 4 cup of all-purpose flour and mix gently [Music] now everything is well combined it's time for some chocolate chips in it this is half cup of chocolate chips i will add 2 3 of the chocolate chips in the brownie mixture and save the other one third for the topping [Music] we have a pan and put your parchment paper in it if you don't have parchment paper you can grease it well and put your brownie mixture and spread it our brownie mixture layer is ready now we will make our cheesecake layer i have four ounces of light cream cheese use room temperature cream cheese otherwise it will be difficult to mix with other ingredients in it i will add half cup of peanut butter i have 100 percent peanut butter it's a creamy peanut butter and it has no sugar in it you can use any peanut butter you like [Music] so half cup of peanut butter and mix cream cheese and peanut butter [Music] together once peanut butter and cream cheese are well combined we will add 1 4 cup of sugar if you like sweeter cream cheese layer add half cup of sugar for me 1 4 cup is enough and mix all three [Music] things now this is our third egg [Music] so we will add one egg in our cream cheese filling or you can say enough cream cheese layer mix properly so our cream cheese layer is ready here is our brownie there and put your cream cheese layer on top of it once you put it try to spread it gently on top of your brownie layer with the help of a fork i'll just swirl it in the brownie layer i will do it slowly [Music] and i will not go too deep but if you want to go until the end you can i just prefer to have separate layers of cream cheese and brownie but you can do however you want so just swirl it everywhere so it will mix and now our brownie cheesecake brownie mixture is ready for oven [Music] before that i will add the remaining chocolate chips on top [Music] and i'll bake it in a 350 degree fahrenheit preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes every oven has a different temperature so after 35 minutes it's wise to keep an eye on it so you will not overcook your brownies my brownies are ready don't cut them right now let it sit for two hours and when it's completely cooled down now we will cut it these look delicious and moist a great blend of brownies and cheesecake super tasty

ingredients for cupcakes i have brown sugar cane sugar almond flour all purpose flour semi-sweet chocolate chips eggs vanilla extracts some coconut oil or you can use butter more chocolate chips my sweet chocolate chips coffee i like to add some coffee in my cupcakes and cocoa powder i have half cup of coconut oil if you like butter you can use butter and in it i will add half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and now put it in the microwave for 15 seconds i will do a total of four times 15 that is one minute but it's enough to melt the chocolate and coconut oil together you have to do it in 15 seconds interval so you don't burn the chocolate otherwise your cupcakes will not taste good now you can see that the mixture is smooth and ready for the sugars [Music] so i will have 1 4 cup of cane sugar and 1 4 cup brown sugar if you don't have cane sugar you can use white sugar instead and mix these things together when chocolate mixture has cooled down and sugars are properly mixed now is the time to add eggs i am using a separate bowl to crack my eggs and then i'll add one egg at a time and mix it it's better to mix one egg at a time you need to have the chocolate mixture cool when you add your eggs otherwise you will scramble your eggs that's why we put sugars first you need to cool down the mixture before you add the [Music] eggs now add one teaspoon of vanilla [Music] extract and mix it you can see the mixture is getting thick [Music] i have 3 4 cup of all-purpose flour in it i will add 1 4 cup of almond flour if you don't have almond flour just use 1 cup of all-purpose flour in it i am adding 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder and i will add half teaspoon of coffee it's instant coffee just mix everything together [Music] add in your brownie mixture and mix everything together if you are using a fork or if you are mixing it by hand you are fine but if you are using a machine like a egg beater then don't over mix it half cup of chocolate chips some my sweet chocolate chips and mix them in i have a cupcake pan here in it i will add the cupcake liners this recipe makes 11 cupcakes and i am spraying each liner with some oil otherwise brownie cupcakes tend to stick to the liners it's just easy to remove cupcakes i am using 1 4 cup measurement and i will add 1 4 cup material in every cupcake there is no baking powder in it so they will not rise too much [Music] our cupcakes are ready to go in the oven i will bake them at 325 degrees for 18 minutes i am gently tapping them for any air bubbles now put them in the oven for baking cupcakes are ready it took 18 minutes in my oven you can do a toothpick test if the toothpick comes out clean then your cupcakes are ready you can do any frosting i am just using some sand sugars and sprinkles i have these colorful star sprinkles and these small circle sprinkles and these colorful sand sugars my kids like to have colorful cupcakes so i put some decorations on for them and i keep some cupcakes plain for adults who do not want extra sugar if you like frosting on your cupcake you can do any kind of frosting you like cupcakes are ready to eat they are colorful tasty and chocolatey [Music] subscribe to my channel and press the bell icon button give me a thumbs up if you like the recipe thanks for watching follow me on facebook and instagram [Music] let's move on to our next recipe which is baked donuts it's one of my favorite for it you need one cup of flour it's all-purpose unbleached flour in it i will add one teaspoon of baking powder and half teaspoon of salt now mix your dry ingredients and set it aside for wet ingredients in a bowl i will break one egg [Music] add 1 3 cup of sugar in it 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of melted butter and i am using one third cup plus two teaspoons of buttermilk i have low fat buttermilk and mix all these ingredients together now add your wet ingredients in your dry ingredients and mix well until you have a batter or batter is ready i am using a medium sized donut pan and i sprayed it with some oil if you don't have a donut pan just use a simple baking tray and make circular donuts in there i am adding all my donut batter in a bag a sandwich bag and i just pour it in the cavities if you don't have a sandwich bag or you don't want to use it just use with spoon it will be a little messier than this but you can absolutely do it now fill each cavity with batter this recipe will make six donuts put in each keep pressing in keep going [Music] when all your donuts are done gently tap the donut tray on the counter to take out all the air bubbles and now we will bake it in a preheated 350 degree oven for 8 to 12 minutes now your donuts are ready for the glaze i have 1 4 cup of hot cream in it i will add 1 4 cup of chocolate chips if they are semi-sweet chocolate chips and hot cream will melt the chips in it just keep whisking until you have a smooth shiny mixture [Music] now your chocolate sauce or chocolate glaze is ready pick each donut and dip halfway in the chocolate sauce and put it back in the tray to cool down place all your donuts with chocolate like this and if you want to put some sprinkles add

below follow me on facebook and instagram stay safe and healthy until next time bye", "7AZ3fLznIvM": "hey everybody I hope you are doing wonderfully today we are gonna be going into lesson 13 from module 7 today and in Lesson 13 we will be converting our units of measure in the customary system into smaller units so it's gonna be very similar to our work in less than 12 only today we're really going to focus on pounds and ounces and hours in minutes and then we'll do some review with several different units of measure so before we start let's do our quick review so if you have a whiteboard or a piece of paper and a pencil go ahead and get those out so you can practice with me so we will start with our just some basic facts again this is less than 13 for module 7 all right so I have these first four hopefully you can answer you can just even say out loud so if I have 1 foot 1 pound excuse me 1 pound is equivalent to 16 ounces 1 hour is equal to how many minutes 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes 1 minute is worth how many seconds 1 minute is worth 60 seconds and 1 day is worth how many hours 1 day is 24 hours so hopefully you got all of those correct again we will be using pounds and ounces and hours and minutes in our work today all right so now we have two quick addition problems one with hours and minutes and one with days and hours go ahead and write those down and see if you can solve all right so I'm going to solve this first one 2 hours 50 minutes plus 3 hours and 15 minutes now the way I'm going to solve it is I notice right here that I'm very close to another hour how many more minutes do I need to make this an hour I needed another 10 minutes to make this an hour do I have 10 minutes anywhere in the math problem yes I can take 10 minutes from these 50 if I take ten minutes away from 15 how many minutes would be left of the 15 five minutes would be left all right so those ten minutes I'm going to add to these 50 if I take these ten minutes and put it with these 50 it's kind of far away for me to circle so I'll just draw an arrow then how many hours do I have in this ed end now I now have three hours total so I have three hours plus three hours and five minutes okay so these five minutes came from what was left so three hours plus three hours in five minutes is equal to six hours and five minutes all right now we have two days 12 hours plus two days and 13 hours well I know my a 12 specs pretty well as should you how many more hours do I need to make this 24 and why do I want to make it 24 oh I want to make it 24 so that I have an entire day how many more hours do I need I need 12 more hours to make this 24 do I have 12 I do so I'm going to rename my 13 hours into 12 hours and one hour 12 plus 1 is 13 I can put my 12 hours with my 12 hours and that gives me another day so two days plus one day is three days there's my first at end so I took 12 hours from here so that I can have an extra day so three days plus two days and that one hour that's left all right so my new math problem is three days plus two days on one hour gives me a total of five days and one our there's my final son all right now we are gonna be moving in two pounds and ounces and taking fractions of a pound all right so I have here one sixteenth of a pound is equal to how many ounces all right I'm gonna go ahead and draw tape for this and this is probably gonna be the only tape I draw why do you think it's gonna be the only tape I draw if it has 16 pieces and you know that my scope does not like drawing tapes with more than 10 12 at most it's not an efficient use of our time so I'm gonna draw one very quickly and try and decompose it into 16 pieces as best as I can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Wow all right so here's my tape with 16 pieces this entire tape is worth one full pound so I'm gonna put my total at the top as one pound if I break a pound into 16 pieces each piece is worth what well we know that there are 16 ounces in a pound so in inside each piece of my tape is 1 ounce 1 ounce is in each one now I'm not going to label all of them but I did label several so that you could see 1 ounce so if I have 1/16 of a pound that means 1 piece is shaded so 1/16 of a pound is worth how many says one ounce now my next one I'm just gonna refer back to this same tape if I wanted 3/16 of a pound how many ounces would that be I would have to shade in three pieces so 3/16 of a pound is equal to three ounces all right what about 5/16 of a pound if I have five shaded in 5/16 of a pound is equal to five ounces all right and now we get into having to use our prior knowledge of equivalent fractions I have half of a pound here okay half of a pound so I have trained my brain to spot halfs if I wanted to express 1/2 as 16 because again that's the unit we're using with pounds to ounces all right if I want to express 1/2 as a 16th how many sixteenths is equal to 1/2 8 16 is equal to 1/2 all right so half of a pound is how many ounces eight half of 16 is 8 so half of a pound is 8 ounces all right now 3/4 of a pound yikes what do I need to do with 3/4 I need to express 3/4 as 16 so I'm going to think about my equivalent fractions I'm gonna leave space for my multiplication problem how do fourths become 16 I'd have to multiply by 4/4 if I multiply 3/4 by 4/4 I get how many 16 I get 12 16 okay so we always want to go back to that unit that we're using when we get to fractions like this okay so use your knowledge of equivalent fractions to take these and rename them as the unit that you're familiar with all right so three force is equal to 1216 so 3/4 pounds is equal to 12 ounces all right what if I asked for 1/4 of a pound 1/4 of a pound let me write that down is worth how many ounces well you could use this right here to help you solve it or you could just rename 1/4 as 16 I will do that 1/4 times 4 over 4 gives me how many 16 it gives me 4 16 so 1/4 of a pound is equivalent to 4 ounces all right now we're gonna go into hours and minutes I have one sixtieth of an hour is worth how many minutes now I am NOT going to draw a tape diagram for this why not I don't want to decompose the tape diagram into 60 pieces to you so 160 or 7 hours how many minutes so let's think about how many minutes are in an hour well there are 60 minutes in an hour so let's imagine our tape diagram with 60 pieces showing one full hour what would belong in each piece of the tape one minute so one sixtieth of an hour is equal to one minute right I would need 60 sixtieths to make the entire hour all right 567 hour is equal to how many minutes well five of those pieces in my tape would be shaded in so five sixtieth of an hour is equal to five minutes all right and now we get to these other fractions which we could use our knowledge of equivalent fractions to rename them as sixtieths I'm just gonna draw a little clock here I'm not gonna put every single minute on it I will put 12 3 6 & 9 on my clock okay so you can imagine all the other numbers in every single little minute so I need 60 little lines for every single minute in this clock if I have half of an hour I have half of this circle how many minutes are in half of an hour if there are 60 minutes in an entire hour half of an hour is I know you already know 30 minutes okay now 1/4 of an hour so 1/4 of an hour let's divide our clock into fourths okay I've divided my clock into fourths 1/4 of an hour that would be me shading in one of these pieces how many minutes from here to here in my clock if my minute hand was on the 12 and it kept moving made it all the way to the 3 how many minutes are in this 1/4 of an hour shaded in 1/4 of an hour is equivalent to 15 minutes all right two fourths of an hour is the same as 1/2 that'd be 30 minutes 3/4 of an hour let me shade in my third piece 3/4 of an hour I go from the 12 to the 3 to the 6 all the way to the 9 my minute hand moves 3/4 of an hour how many minutes has it moved 45 minutes 3/4 of an hour is equivalent to 45 minutes ok so again I did not draw a tape for my hours 2 minutes because I didn't want to draw 60 pieces um you could draw a clock that may help you I believe on the problem set and again this is problem set 13 they use a number line to show 60 pieces all right now we are gonna do some mixed numbers which we did in less than 12 as well if I have 3 and 1/8 of a pound is how many Ounces okay so let's think first about this 1/8 of a pound I know there are 16 ounces in a pound so I want to change my 1a into 16 with what fraction what would I need to multiply 1/8 by to get 16 times 2 over 2 1/8 times 2 over 2 is 216 so two sixteenths is worth how many ounces it's worth 2 ounces so I'm gonna rename this 1/8 of a pound into 2 ounces now I've got to rename 3 pounds how many Ounces are in Wolfe one full pound there are 16 ounces in one full pound so how do I figure out 3 I'd have to multiply so I'm going to use a different piece of paper so we can see this I'd have to multiply 16 times 3 to figure out how many islands is are in those three pounds okay so six times three is eighteen I'd have to bundle and move 110 times three plus another 10 is four times so I would have 48 ounces all right so those three pounds are worth 48 ounces what do I do with 48 ounces in two ounces well I have to add them together 48 ounces plus 2 ounces is 50 ounces all right now I have 2 and 3/4 of a pound well let's go back to our original piece of paper where we already solved 3/4 of a pound 3/4 of a pound is equal to how many ounces 3/4 of a pound is equal to 12 ounces so I'm gonna take these and write 12 ounces underneath 3/4 of a pound is 12 ounces now I have to rename these 2 pounds there are 16 ounces in one pound so in two pounds I would have to multiply 16 times 2 and I would get 32 ounces so those two pounds are worth 32 ounces what do I do with 32 ounces and twelve ounces I have to add them together when I add them together I get 44 ounces as my total these problems by the way I fold off of the lesson 13 problem set all right here we go now I have one in 1/4 of an hour is how many minutes well this one hour is 60 minutes my 1/4 of an hour let me pull out my clock 1/4 of an hour from here to here is 15 minutes so I have to add sixty minutes plus 15 minutes and I would get 75 minutes one in 1/4 of an hour is 75 minutes three and a half hours well what's half of an hour half of an hour is thirty minutes three hours there are 60 minutes in one hour how would I figure out how many minutes are in three well I would multiply 60 times three and I would get 180 minutes what do I do with 180 minutes and thirty minutes well I have to add them together 180 plus 30 maybe you need to write out we would add and get a total of 210 minutes three and a half hours is worth two hundred ten minutes our final one is one and a half hours one and a half hours is how many minutes one and a half hours one hour is 60 minutes half of an hour is 30 minutes 60 minutes plus 30 minutes is what our math blocks used to be ninety minutes so one and a half hours is worth ninety minutes all right last little bit and this is just a review because on problem set 13 they will throw in yards and feet and gallons in court to review what we did in lesson 12 all right so I have 7 and 2/3 of a yard so again we have to think about how many feet are in one yarn there are three feet in one yard so I'm gonna drum a little tape so I see it three feet or in one whole yard so that means inside each piece is one foot if two thirds are shaded in that means two pieces are shaded in so two thirds of the yard is equal to how many feet it's equal to two feet all right now what about those seven yards yikes there are three feet in one yard how many feet are in seven yards well I would have to multiply seven times three which I should be able to do mentally seven times three is twenty-one feet so now I add 21 feet plus whoops plus two more feet and I get 23 feet all right my next one is gallons two quarts how many quarts are in one gallon four quarts are in one gallon so if I do Maite I have four pieces what belongs in each piece one port belongs in each piece so if I have 3/4 of a gallon how many courts is that Shaytan 3 it's 3 quarts 3/4 of a gallon is 3 quarts what about six full gallons there are four quarts in one gallon if I have six full gallons I have six times four 24 quarts 24 quarts plus three more court 27 quarts 6 and 3/4 of a gallon is 27 courts last one eight and 1/3 of a foot how many inches all right so how many inches are in a foot her 12 inches in a foot so what do I need to do with this third I need to rename it into twelve how would I do that equivalent fractions one-third times what / what give me 12 for for one-third times four fourths is for 12 so one third of a foot is also for 12 seventh so how many inches are in one third of a foot four all right so one third of a foot is worth four inches now eight feet all right eight feet how many inches are in a foot 12 inches are in a foot so 12 times 8 is 96 inches what do I do with 96 and 4 put them together and that gives me a total of 100 inches okay you will see some of these thrown into problem set 13 again a lot of the problems that I practice with you you will see in less than 13 um so hopefully you were able to practice and feel free to do the lesson 13 homework as well I hope you are all having an awesome day I miss you so much be good and be nice to everybody in your household bye", "4etYbU4j5c8": "welcome to Lexus world and today we're gonna have a video that will mostly be useful to you newbie cannabis consumers and to you ones who want to save some money so how much weed should you buy per purchase I'll start by saying that for the purposes of this discussion I'm going to assume that you know how to store cannabis properly meaning not in a ziplock baggie a link to my episode on proper storage in the video description for the rest of you if you know how to store weed properly you don't have to worry about how long the buds will be good for so instead you can now focus on what's the best deal the common denominations of cannabis are of course one gram also known as a dime three and a half grams which is an eight seven grams which is a quarter of 14 grams which is half an ounce and 28 grams which is your ounces in both the legal and the black cannabis market there is a time-honored precedent in terms of price breaks for going up in terms of weight purchased so it's like most other products my advise breaks down into two categories for casual smokers who might smoke weed once per month if that and heavy users if you're a casual smoker you should avoid grams which is a very bad deal to buy because the price per gram will be heavily inflated those users should go for an 8 instead that jump to three and a half grams gets you pretty significant price breaks almost everywhere over a single gram and with proper storage you can just take that weed out once per month and slowly go through it over the course of a year for you heavy users my advice is buying by the ounce or even bigger denominations if it's legal and you can get some kind of additional price break and I'll justify that let's say you smoke even one gram of weed per week which means you smoked two to three times a week that's 52 grams of weed a year if you buy that by a single gram the price might be $10 a gram that translates into five hundred and twenty dollars on weed for the year change that purchasing to an ounce and that will give you for example a very average price of a hundred and ninety an ounce or six seventy eight a gram suddenly your costs per year are three hundred and fifty two bucks so you save over a hundred and sixty-five dollars in just one year plus you save tons of trips traveling back and forth to your weed provider by the way if you smoke a gram per day as many of my viewers do what you save per year in that example works out to eleven hundred and seventy five dollars the difference between buying one denomination versus another adds up big-time over the course of a year and even more over the course of many years so please bear it in mind when you buy also bear in mind I need your subs likes and comments to live so please subscribe to the show and hit that like button we'll see you next time", "0N6SmKVWZdI": "this is Sarah with registered nurse RN comm and in this video we're going to be doing a educational tutorial on how to solve basic conversion problems before you start watching this video though you will want to go to our website registered nurse Orion comm backslash a metric table and print out a printable version of the metric table so you can refer to it and know what's going on with how we're getting the metric table conversions because before you solve a dosage and calculations problems you must know the metric table and how everything converts because we use that as a basic guide in order to solve our problems and also get the worksheets to follow along with this video so if you go to register nurse or and.com backslash worksheets you can get the worksheet for this video it's called basic conversions so you can set there and work the problems as I work them okay so let's get started our first problem is 6 ounces equals how many milliliters okay so we're going to set up a problem like this six ounces equals how many milliliters we know that one ounce equals two tablespoons you know that from the metric table that you've memorized so you're going to say one ounce equals two tablespoons now we have converted that ounces so we're going to mark out ances and we're trying to get two milliliters so now we're going to say 1 tablespoon equals 15 milliliters and I knew that because on the basic metric table and we are told that one tablespoon equals 15 milliliters so we have converted to milliliters so tablespoons is marked out so we are where we wanted to go we wanted to go from a ounces two milliliters what we will do will take everything on the top and multiply it by itself so we will say six times two times 15 equals 180 we will take everything on the bottom which is 1 times 1 that equals 1 and 180 divided by 1 equals 180 so there is 180 milliliters and 6 ounces our next problem is 4 thousand micrograms equals how many milligrams so we are trying to go from micro grams to milligrams we're going to set our problem up like this we say 4 milligrams 4,000 my programs so four thousand micrograms equals how many milligrams so looking at our metric table we know that there is a thousand micrograms in one milligram so thousand micrograms in one milligram we have canceled out micrograms so mark that out and we have went from micro grams to milligrams that's our end so what we're going to do is we're going to multiply everything on the top which four thousand times one is four thousand and nothing on the bottom so it's over a thousand and then you divide four thousand divided by a thousand equals four and that is our answer so there are four milligrams and 4000 micrograms our next problem is 5 grams equals how many micrograms so once again we're going to set our problem up like this just as the problem says we're going to say 5 grams equals how many micrograms so looking at our metric table we know that there is one gram in a thousand milligrams because we are trying to go from grams to micrograms so we've already converted to milligrams and we're going to say to ourself one milligram equals a thousand micrograms and we've already converted with milligrams so we're going to work that out and we have reached our micrograms we will multiply everything at the top five times a thousand times a thousand equals five million and multiply everything on the bottom one times one is one and when you divide five million to one you get five million so the answer is 5 million micrograms moving on to our next problem 50 milliliters equals how many ounces again we'll set our problem up just like how they're asking so we're going to say 50 milliliters equals how many ounces and we are trying to get from milliliters to ounces so in order to do that we must look at our metric table and convert so we know that there are 15 milliliters in 1 tablespoon and to and we've already canceled out milliliters and two tablespoons equals one ounce and we needed to get two ounces so we're done we're going to multiply everything at the top fifty times one times one is 50 and 15 times 2 is 30 so now what we're going to do is divide 50 into 30 when you divide 15 to 30 you get one point six six six six so we'll round up to one point seven so 50 divided by 30 is one point six six and we're going to convert it to one point seven and will not convert it we're just going to round up and it's 1.7 ounce 96 kilograms equals how many pounds so we're going to set up our problem just like how the problem is asking us we're going to say ninety six kilograms equals how many pounds and looking at our metric table we know that there is one kilogram in 2.2 pounds and we've already reached pounds so we're going to cancel out kilograms because we've converted to pounds we're going to multiply everything at the top so 96 times 2.2 gives us two hundred and eleven point two and there's nothing on the bottom except for one so that'll be one and when you divide two hundred eleven point two over one you get two hundred eleven point two so the answer is two hundred and eleven point two pounds okay next problem number six 20 teaspoons equals how many milliliters you will set your problem up just like how the problem is asking 20 teaspoons equals how many milliliters from the metric table we know that there is one teaspoon and five milliliters because we're trying to go from teaspoons to milliliters so one teaspoon equals five milliliters teaspoons cancels out we're going to multiply everything at the top 20 times five is 100 multiply everything on the bottom there's just one thing so one 100 divided by 1 equals 100 so there are a hundred milliliters and 20 teaspoons problem number seven two thousand milliliters equals how many liters we will set our problem up just by how the problem is asking us so two thousand milliliters equals how many liters we know by looking at the metric table that there is a thousand milliliters in 1 liter and we're trying to get two liters so thousand milliliters equals 1 liter milliliters has canceled out because we've converted already and we're done because we're already where we're supposed to be so you'll take everything at the top and multiply it so two thousand times one is two thousand and only thing at the bottom is a thousand then you will divide two thousand divided by a thousand equals two so there are two liters in two thousand Millie okay our very last problem problem 8 it asks how many teaspoons are in five liters so five liters equals how many teaspoons again you're going to set your problem up just like how the problem is asking you're going to put five liters equals how many teaspoons it's going to multiply you're going to say by looking at the metric table you know that there is one liter in a thousand milliliters liters has canceled out so we'll mark it out and we're trying to get two teaspoons so in order to get two teaspoons we're going to have to convert milliliters to tablespoons so from the metric table we know that there's 15 milliliters in 1 tablespoon already converted so now we need to mark out milliliters and we're trying to reach teaspoons so we're going to ask ourselves how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon we know that there is one tablespoon in three teaspoons so one tablespoon equals three teaspoons tablespoons cancels out so we are stopping because we're where we're supposed to be we're supposed to solve for tables teaspoons so what you'll do is multiply everything at the top so five times 1000 times 1 times 3 equals 15,000 multiply everything on the bottom one times 15 times one is 15 and we're going to survive so 15 thousand divided by 15 equals a thousand so there are a thousand teaspoons and five liters so that was a tutorial on how to solve basic conversion problems be sure to check out our more complex problems that you'll get into a

quick video it's a it's a question that pops up on the forums quite often it popped up again last night about how to cast a light bait or a weightless soft plastic with a bait caster what I have here is I have a Duquette medium action rod it's their casting rod got a fairly good tip I think I guess that's probably a faster it's about a fast tip maybe a little bit a little bit lighter than that but um it's a it's my choice for v for fishing either a fluke or a trick worm one because it's got the backbone it needs to be able to set the hook and it is and it's got enough whip in it to be able to cast these light baits now the tricky is or the trick that I developed over over trial and error believe me there's a lot more error than it was trial but um was instead of you see if I'm back up and show you guys just I'll just step over here you know when you normally cast something out of a fishing rod usually have you know 10 12 15 inches of line hanging out of the end of your rod okay well what I found out that is if you lengthen that distance to about 30 inches about like that it makes this technique of casting a lot easier okay so and then the second part of this technique is you're going to want to instead of the whipping cast that you do with a with a jig or anything else or the two-handed cast you want this to be a one handed cut my trolling motor on ten flip the switch but anyway you want to a you want to do a one-handed cast and you instead of making it a whipping cast you want it to be a long drawn out cast off to the side or over your head but anyway the the major the main port part of it is you want it to be kind of a smooth long cast just like that now and your release point of your cast is just a hair earlier than you would normally okay and then you have to feather it all with you I always have my reel set really light the way I adjust them for this bait is just like I would any other big take a drag or take your your magnetic drag system off or anything like that tighten your knob up hit your button and then loosen your knob until your bait just barely starts to fall then turn your drag back up to or not to drag your brake system back up to to half way and go to casting now once again you go to 30 inches or so out of the side of your rod and then it's just a long drawn-out cast and feather your line and practice practice practice you're going to have a lot of error before you get this get this down but just remember your release points just a little bit earlier it's a long drawn-out whip you want that thirty inches of line to carry past your rod tip during the during the cast and and I promise you it'll be a lot smoother smoother casting you get a lot more distance on these light light baits be it a fluke or a trick worm or a light cranking you know crank bait things like that really works like I always say visit bassresource.com for the answer to all your questions about best bass fishing and have a great day you", "b1GlxS5f9WI": "hi guys this is John from Waltons TV and this is meet Geist ik's summer sausage is a semi dried sausage that's typically stuffed into a large diameter casing like a fibrous casing most summer sausage has a low pH which gives it that familiar tangy type flavor pH varies Ken value but somewhere between four point five to five point two this also helps aid in some shelf stability besides pH water activity can also help determine whether a product is truly shelf stable or not which means in summer sausage we need to bind water in the meat snacks and make it unavailable for microbial growth water activity is not something that can be measured by a home processor but we will still set up our process and thermal processing to attempt to achieve a lower water activity summer sausage can be made using a variety of meats and anything like wild game venison beef pork poultry combination doesn't matter we just want to make sure that we're somewhere around 20 percent fat sometimes that fat can go up to 30 or 40 percent but we like to shoot for somewhere around 20 percent to keep it at least somewhat healthy fat is where most of your flavor comes from so changing your lean to fat ratio will change the overall taste and the mouthfeel of your product so I'm going to be using a beef and pork mix about 5050 I've already cut everything up we're all ready to go you can use 20 pounds of wild game and 5 pounds of pork fat or whatever make sure you want just make sure again that your fat ratio is somewhere around 20 percent or greater otherwise you're going to have a dry and not quite as tasteful product we're going to use X calibers harbor or habanero barbecue summer sausage seasoning we're gonna add an ounce of sure cure we're gonna add some carrot fiber we're gonna put in 2 pounds of high temp cheese 4 pints of water and we're also gonna use encapsulated citric acid to give it that tang that's what changes the pH aside from the seasonings and additives we're also going to need a grinder a mixer a stuffer a meatlug to hold the meat fibers casings to stuff them in hog rings and hog ring pliers to close up the meat and all these items and more are available waltons ENCOM this is also when we're going to prepare our casings they need to soak in hot water for about thirty minutes to let them soften up so that when we stuff them there'll be some give to them one other note this is all fresh out of the freezer I did put the grinder head the plate and knife and the auger in the freezer and let it sit in there for a couple hours just to get them as cold as possible because we want to keep heat down throughout the grinding process that's going to improve the quality of our me I'm gonna grind this meat twice the first grind I'm gonna do is a 3/8 or 10 millimeter grinder plate and the second grind is going to be a 1/8 or 3 millimeter grinder plate a sharp grinder knife and plate are key to help you create a better summer sausage by helping you retain better particle definition color and it's going to help prevent any smearing of the meat so the meats also very cold that's helping this grind nice and easily you can see great particle definition in this I did that by putting it in our blast freezer you probably don't have a blast freezer at home so if you just put it in your regular freezer for about 45 minutes to an hour somewhere around there you can get the same effect as I did so I'm done with the first grind now I'm just going to switch out the plate from the 10 millimeter to the 3 millimeter so we can get our second grind a meat mixer is your best option for meat mixing when making summer sausage we need to not only thoroughly mix in the seasoning spices and whatever other additives we used but we also need to achieve good protein extraction protein extraction is visibly noticeable when the meat starts to get real sticky or tacky is another word for it what this does is allows the proteins in the meat to bind with the water and fat giving your sausage a better consistency and mouthfeel when eating plus it helps it from getting dry and crumbly hand mixing is possible but it's difficult to achieve the same result as using an actual meat mixer for the mixing time we need to mix for a total of about eight minutes there's a lot of factors that I can enter into this though so that 8 minutes may or may not be true for what you're doing during the mixing process we want to use a reverse motion for every minute that we go forward the other things we want to do is add our encapsulated citric acid and cheese if you're using any last this is important because the cheese could start to break down and you don't want to break the capsule on the citric acid or it's gonna start working in the meat too early so just add those in the last 45 to 60 seconds somewhere right around there two quarts of water works really well if you're using wild game that has a lower fat content it's going to make the product a little bit soupier and a lot easier to stuff now that Sioux penis will come out during the cooking process it'll still firm up fine or just stuff a lot easier however if you're using pork or the proper you know 20 percent or slightly above fat ratio 2 pints of water is totally fine so wild game with low fat content use 2 quarts pork or higher fat content 2 pints should be fine we're all done mixing we got good protein extraction now as long as our casings have been soaking for at least 30 minutes we're ready to stuff avoid creating air pockets when you load your sausage stuffer and begin stuffing until the casings are full with a smooth exterior remember to leave a little bit extra on the end of the fibrous casing so that you can twist and clip them tightly closed with a pair of hog ring pliers since we use encapsulated citric acid on ours we were able to go right to the smokehouse if you didn't use encapsulated citric acid or some other type of care accelerator you need to hold your product overnight before smoking to let the cure work in the meat now when you do go to the smokehouse you can either hang them on smoke sticks or lay them on racks in your oven or smokehouse just be sure to leave a slight gap between your summer sausages to allow the air to fully circulate around you can also place a small pan of water in the bottom of the smokehouse during the entire cooking cycle this is going to help you increase humidity and prevent stall outs a simple cooking schedule you can follow is 125 degrees for an hour don't really need smoke at this point then 140 degrees with an hour and you shouldn't introduce smoke then 155 degrees for two hours and then bump your smokehouse or oven up to 175 until the internal temperature of your meat is 160 if you're a smokehouse or a dry or dehydrated or whatever can't do temperatures as low as 125 just start as low as possible and slow we increase the temperature over time what we're trying to do here is prevent the outside of the summer sausage from cooking too quickly and then it's not going to want to pass heat along to the center so you'll end up with a real dry hard product on the outside and a raw product in the middle now to help set the casing to the meat and to prevent wrinkling we need to shower the summer sausage when we're done cooking or put them in an ice water bath should only take about 10 to 15 minutes to get the temperature to drop down this also is going to stop the cooking process then set them out for about an hour room temperature before moving them to the refrigerator or to the freezer after we're totally done with the cooking process then you can package it in vacuum pouches for longer-lasting and throw them in the freezer for you at that point now I made two different ones here I made one with cheese and one without both of them are excellent the habanero barbecue summer sausage is a phenomenal seasoning I love it is my favorite summer sausage up whenever we do any summer sausage that's always what I want but with the cheese it definitely does add something in my opinion as always make sure you subscribe to Waltons TV and remember to tap the bell next

gauge two three quarter inch they got a sixteen hundred and twenty-five feet per second hype their high velocity one in an 8-ounce are the size of the slugs in here so let me open it up for you okay let's take some of these out so i have about three packs of these sitting around at home I haven't even shot them yet but here they are here to stand a few up okay you look at that that's massive look at it's got the even like wind vane sketch and spin it like a rifle so there we go there in a nice black shell I like that it says a rack master on there and then it says the 70 millimeters and two and three-quarter inch so metric and imperial it's got a nice it's got a really good looking primer on there the case feels nice and solid and the actual slug in there looks really nice there's no dings and blood at all so they come in a pack of 5 there about seven dollars for this pack Walmart that's the only place I've seen them you can probably pick them up at your local hunting store and Canadian Tire wherever you are so the Winchester rack master high-velocity slugs I haven't had a chance to Matt like I said 12 gauge they look really nice I'd recommend putting like a improves cylinder choke in there because usually you need a choke otherwise you connect the threads if you have a newer shotgun and you don't want to put like a full choke or something because then you might risk wrecking the choke because it can like damage it because it's too skinny so as once again I haven't had a chance to these yet but I mean they look really good or decent at least the like wind vanes are rifling or whatever you want to call them on the slugs looks really well done like congratulations d Winchester so you guys should just go pick these up at your local store that sells ammo they look really good so once again they're like about seven or eight dollars a box I got three of these at home that I haven't shot yet i'm really excited to try them out though so there they are winchester rack master", "OFPahX7VvQQ": "how many Ounces are in a cup of sour cream milk 1 cup equals 8 ounces heavy cream 1 cup equals 8.4 ounces cream cheese 1 cup equals 8 point two ounces sour cream / yogurt 1 cup equals eight point six ounces [Music] you", "kpf13m4xMcs": "okay so I was fine be able to get out on the casting field and do the fur test for the big $99 six weight real shootout and the first lure that I chose was the five-inch weightless Cinco and this is one of the cinco's that I used a lot of them broke off and caused huge birds nests but I'll get into that later so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to do a countdown from the shortest casting to the longest casting and then I will get back to you guys and go over some notes okay so first up is to lose speed spool LFS I have the spool tension set to just eliminate the side-to-side play and I have the brakes set to pretty high probably about 3/4 of the way to maximum so here we go 104 feet six inches [Applause] Wow 110 feet 9 inches 105 feet even 102 feet 8 inches okay so next up we have the quantum accuracy PT I have the internal brakes set to 4 I have the spool tension set to eliminate the side-to-side play and they have the external magnets look looks like that's set to 4 as well it's right around here a little bit over halfway so here we go [Music] 106 feet 2 inches 112 9 inches 107 7 inches 105 11 okay so next up I have the Daiwa Fuego CT I have the spool tension set to eliminate the side-to-side play and I have the Mac force external dial set to 8 which is the lowest I could go here we go [Applause] 116 and one inch 122 feet 9 inches 107 10 inches [Applause] one sixteen six inches okay last but not least we have two brand new Revo X have the spool tension set to just eliminate the side to side plate and the external dial is set to just a little bit over halfway doesn't have any numbers so I can't tell what an actual number is here we go 108 feet 3 inches 116 feet 2 inches whoa 121 3 inches [Music] 118 6 inches okay next up we have the Shimano casitas and strangely enough I was able to go down to one break inside and the external dial is set to 6 which is the maximum and spool tension is to just eliminate the side to side plate 1:17 1 inch [Music] 116 one inch [Music] 119 9 inches 120 in 6 inches okay next step we have the one free origin see I have internal breaks set to 5 and I actually have a pretty tight spool tension the urgency does not like loose spool tension so here we go [Music] Wow 121 7 inches 115 4 inches whoa 125 feet 8 inches 110 and 10 inches okay so as you can see by the results the origin see technically tied the casitas for first place with an average of one hundred and eighteen and a half feet for both but I'm gonna give the origin see the victory because it gave me the longest overall cast and the Revo X comes in third place just barely edging out the juego CT you will X average one hundred sixteen point two five feet while de fuego averaged 116 feet doesn't sound like a lot but whether you win by inter mile winnings winning and the Revo X came out on top ahead of the fuego now in fifth place is the quantum and yes something about this real I'm gonna go over some things with you guys here in a second quantum average 108 point two five feet and of course bringing up the rear was the speed spool LFS from lose with the respectable 105 point seven five feet I say respectable because if I'm not mistaken all these outcasts the old Corrado I and the old tattoo type are when it came to throwing the 5-inch weight Lysenko so a couple of things to note the origin see does not like loose spool tension I set all these up with the spool tension set to just minimize the side to side plate but with origin see did not like that at all you have to actually tightened it up more than the others but when you did find that sweet spot it cast very well and it was pretty simple to set up because you only have a few settings to choose from so yeah origin si comes out on top it is not like the loose spools spool tension setting now I've heard good things about the this style of braking is that once you set it up they do cast extremely well the style of centrifugal brake which I like to call the Banach style braking now the easiest to set up or the the three magnetic brakes from the Fuego Revo X and the speed spool very straightforward just set your spool tension and then just dial the brakes back until you get the maximum casting distance without any kind of major overruns now the very hardest setup was the Acuras PT the outside magnetic adjustment doesn't seem to work very well it doesn't give very much braking force at all most of the braking was done by the centrifugal brakes and it was very inconsistent during practice the Acuras actually hit the longest practice cast at 128 feet and I think another one about 120 425 feet but when I actually started recording I couldn't even come close to that for some reason even though the brake settings were identical so maybe it caught a back wind on those casts but who knows okay so the casitas I feel I could have gotten more I could have backed down to external dial a little bit and maybe gotten more but I had a really bad break off where's the sink over ripped in half during the cast cinco broke in half and caused this and they just blew this fool up to where I couldn't even save it so that's why I only average forecast instead of five for this particular test so everyone was predicting to see this would just smoke everybody now well it did somewhat win this competition it wasn't like a blowout like everybody was thinking these two reels came very close so yeah so far you're looking at the origin see at number one in the casitas then the Revo then the Fuego and Acuras in the leaves so the next lure I'm gonna throw is the quarter ounce square bill and who knows what the outcome will be on that so stay tuned thanks a lot guys [Music]", "vcqIZt5My4E": "- Gringo's watching lakes calm and we're in my garage I'm here with Mike it's cold dark outside so we're doing another 101 101 video this one is on setups for a sip float fish Jenks under floats for a steelhead and salmon you can use this for eggs jigs anything you want under a float my setup is a little unique I don't see a lot of guys using the same setup I do it works for me and it's it's durable they have less less moving parts I like the different floats your mileage may vary what I start with is got my mainline start with a a bobber stop and it's just the type of bottle stuff you buy in the store put your main line through slide the bobber stop off slide the tube off the mainline cinch it tight so I have my bobber stop here then I have a bead that's so that the float doesn't swallow the bobber stop and go above the bobber stop I have my float and on the other end of that I have a rubbery rubber feed a lot of people use these heartbeats and I prefer the rubber bead you can find them in the same section of the tackle store as the heart beats what I like about them is it's a cushion against between the cushion between the float and the Swivl after a couple casts that needle actually swallowed the end of the swivel and just stay there and not move on the line at all it protects the not protects the end of the line there from the action of the flow for weight I like the inline weights there double swivels those on each end of them their streamlined they're strong and that's what works best for me some of the other setups that I've seen used I've seen people use the bobber stop float and two egg weights the sliding egg weights and this one you can adjust just by adding or reducing your number of egg waves the otherwise I seen used is this is actually a homemade inline way with this one you have your hollow core lid through the lid you have a wire kind of like a spinner spinner wire looped on each end of that and inside that loop you have a swivel on each end so it's just basically a homemade in line in line weight again these you can make them any size you want they're real simple to make another one that I've seen used is actually just pencil bit just like it used for drift fisting have your mainline tied to your swivel pencil that's hanging off the the swivel and then your leaders tied on the other end and you have your float and beat above that some of the floats that you can use there's all different kinds of floats it kind of whatever works for you I like I like these torpedo floats I like the thinner thinner model they float up and down straight no matter what the weight is I can put a lighter weight on this what's higher in the water but still straight up and down some of the fatter floats you don't use the right weight though no lay over they're clear they're stealthy and they're tough this one here has water in it that's after I used it I think three years before I finally retired so many other floats I found the leaves on the river somewhere along the way this one has wait till balsa wood float has weight in the bottom of it so you could actually fish this without adding weight to it there's your salmon stalkers for big baits you have your your classic trout bar and this is a fixed pixel bobber so you its fixed as far as how long your leader is it'll still work you have your little dink weights or dink floats rather the boat Macs are real popular on these they actually have the weight and this is the weight that ideal weight for underneath the bottom underneath the float so this one says record arounds so 3/4 ounce if you have four rounds jig and a half ounce weight under it you got your three quarter rounds so that's that helps you to figure out the ideal weight that goes under the float balsa-wood wakes this one actually I mean all it is is the packing foam or like laptops and computers trimmed up and took the shark stick poke that through there and then just all the stuff I stole a borrowed straw from Toby's spread that through I haven't tried yet but I can see why a bit more so that's kind of a range of the floats you can use gives you an idea of how to set up for floating jig fishing and go out and give it a try for those who you still around I was showing one of my secrets to Mike and he asked me to spread the word I found in a fly shop this high up paste and what it is it's it's almost like a paraffin wax and what I do before I head out fishing each time it's all full about 25 feet of my main line which I'm using 30 pound power Pro braid I'll put the braid under my thumb on top of this paraffin wax real my line it what that does is it leaves a coating of that paraffin wax on the brain itself and really helps with your line then the wax floats the brain floats so when you're out on the water and you're mending your line it really improves how easy it is to mend your line so that's a little green go secret I've also used tea candles the wax from tea candles doesn't work as well as this stuff I found in the fly shop and little do yet", "qzr82EuiJu0": "hey everybody thomas joseph here with another kitchen conundrum for you now today we're going back to the basics with measuring you need to learn how to measure correctly to have success when you are making recipes so today i'm going to show you how to do that starting off two different types of measuring cups we have a wet measuring cup and we have a dry measuring cup here now when you're using a dry measuring cup this is for things like flour and sugar and brown sugar you can also measure things like mayonnaise and sour cream in a dry measure anything that you can actually level off that is what you're going to use this for now for something that you would use a wet measure for would be anything that will level itself off so that you can see it with those lines so liquids they would go into this measuring cup here I'm going to start with dry measuring now flour main ingredient in baking here what you need to know is that you shouldn't dip your cup right into the canister itself because what that does is it packs flour into the cup so take a scoop or spoon and gently mix the flour lightening it incorporating a little bit of air because as this canister of flour sits on your shelf it actually compacts itself it settles on itself so give it a little bit of a fluff here and scoop it into your cup sprinkling it in using that offset spatula anything with a straight side you want to give the cup a little bit of a tap settling in any air pockets that might be in this cup of flour and a good swipe leveling it off and that is a perfect 1/2 cup of flour now if a recipe calls for sifted flour what that means is that you need to sift the flour first and then measure from this bowl measure this mixture here what that means is you're getting a lighter cup of flour something that isn't so heavy now something like sugar sugar is already dense so there's no need to stir it up and you don't need to scoop into the cup you can simply dip your cup into the canister itself and give it a good swipe and the weights would be completely consistent here this is a perfect 1/2 cup sugar now brown sugar we get a lot of questions here in the test kitchens how do I keep my sugar from getting too hard keep it in a well sealed container one of these airtight containers is really great take a piece of bread some people like to use a piece of apple and store it in with your brown sugar and it will help to keep the sugar nice and soft take your measuring cup dip it into the brown sugar and pack the sugar into the cup most recipes call for packed brown sugar now you know you've done this right if you tap it out into a bowl and the sugar holds its shape if it crumbles that means that you haven't packed it firmly enough and that you should start over so now for liquid measurements use a spouted glass measuring cup here and when you're measuring things like honey or molasses anything that's sticky and viscous sometimes corn syrup give your glass a spray with some nonstick cooking spray and what that does is it will easily slide out on you so I'm using honey today a half cup measure you want to check your measurement and you actually should bend down and check that it registers a half a cup so that it's nice and level and a half cup so this is good to go and that's how you measure a liquid ingredient so now to measure by weight what you need is a digital scale for this and certain recipes will call for ingredients by weight chocolate for example or fruit whenever you're baking so take the bowl that you're going to measure in to place it on the scale and you need to zero out or tear out the weight of the bowl itself so that you don't count that in the measurement so all you have to do is press the button again it should register zero and now you're ready to measure the weight of whatever ingredient you have so there you have it a few simple tricks and tips and measuring ingredients the right way and that will set you up for success in the kitchen if you have any kitchen conundrums write in the comments section below or reach out to us using the hashtag kitchen conundrum and we will solve whatever problems you may have you", "TxOI3xdN-qY": "hey this is Luke Simon's with salt strong in this video we're going to cover one casting tip that will help you get more distance and better accuracy all in one and it's what I see a lot of people not doing and it's a it's really just an easy tip and it really just takes physics into account so really the one tip is to just use use your hands both hands as a lever and let the rod do the work so a lot of people the thing to do wrong is what I see a lot of people doing is they take their hands way back alt and the rods going all the way over and then they then they start the cast from max so you're taking that rod all the way around and that way when you do that you don't have quite as much power because the rod doesn't get fully loaded and also you don't have the grits quite as much accuracy because you're doing that full span and if you're if you take your finger off just just one millisecond sooner or later that's going to make a very big difference on the arc of your cast so the better way to cast this is the way that you can get the max distance with the least amount of effort so you can just cast all day long without getting tired is to use so just understand that the rod is a lever and use your hands in tandem to just to take advantage of how much power the rod can generate because what we the best way to do it is to of course open up the bale first as far as your hands you place one hand on the butt the other hand just right above the the reel so you can hold the line and with your back hand pull down while at the same time moving up with your with your front hand that's how you load the rod so as far as loading the rod do that just just quick quick movement and I get it I take it only to about here as far as I just do it a little bit more than 90 degrees up I do not ever go back here is you just start losing control and you could hook somebody behind you so again blow the rod up real quick and then as far as delivering it almost like throwing like a dart where you get you get a ton of distance and maximum accuracy because you're just going to you're just basically pushing it straight in that direction is do the opposite you once once it's loaded you're going to pull back with the backhand and then forward with the front hand so in total I'm hardly in total I hardly moved at all you can see you can see I didn't shake the boat all it was the rod got kicked back loaded pause for a second wait till it load and then shoot it out all right so we're going to do it again I'm going to try to do this one slow-mo with the in the editing tool so again we're going to take it up halfway and we're going to take it up fast pause let it load and as soon as you feel the rod fully loaded then just shoot it out like a dart so here goes and then for a little bit more distance you can just hold the rod out like that and that just gives us to fly a little bit more when you do if you do this and have a casting contest with a friend and you do that simple technique load the rod shoot it out and then point you'll most likely cast a significant amount further than them and it's all right so that's that's the really casting tip that made a significant difference in my results as far as just being able to cast all day not get tired while also getting a ton of distance and also a lot of accuracy as far as loading the rod if you're wondering how long how long to pause it really depends on your rod because every rod is different as different flex I like to have a medium heavy to medium rod and so mine's a little bit quicker if you're using a really soft tip rod then you'll have to let it pause a little bit longer for it to just arc a little bit more and then then get ready to launch it and for live bait fishing this is a requires a lot of momentum a big momentum shift and if you're doing that with live bait and many times you could possibly cast the bait off so be careful with live bait with artificial lures it is by far the best way to cast especially when you're doing really light soft plastic lures up in shallow water there's no better way to really sling one out there with a ton of distance if you have any questions at all just leave a comment down below otherwise thank you so much for watching be sure to

Today on Maker's\nMoments, we'll be showing you how to know if you have the right sized wick for\nyour candle. To figure out if you have the right wick for your candle, it's\nimportant to conduct a burn test. A burn test will help you evaluate the\nperformance of your wooden wick in your candle so that you can narrow down\nthe one that performs best with your wax type and vessel size. Before conducting a burn test be sure to get a wick sample kit and reference the wick selection guide on woodenwick.com to help narrow down the best sizes for you to test. We have links to the guide for burn testing as well as the wick selection guide below. Here's how to conduct a burn test - first, \n make sure your wooden wicks are\ntrimmed to 0.2 inches or 5 millimeters. While cotton wicks are recommended to be at 0.25 inches, that's a tiny bit too long for a wooden wick and can cause\nperformance issues. Place the candles on a heat-resistant surface at least eight inches apart. Be sure there is no draft, and that the temperature in the room is\nbetween 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Light the candles and start a timer for\ntwo hours. Do not leave the candles unattended. After two hours, observe, record details and take photos. At this point the melt pool should be reaching the edge of the container,  but not be too deep. If there is still quite a ways to go to achieve a full diameter melt pool, the wick is likely too small in width which didn't produce a large enough flame to melt the wax properly. This will result in tunnelling, which means that there will be wax buildup on the sides of your container. A new test with the next wick up in widths is suggested unless the issue is that your wick was untrimmed, in which case try trimming it to the recommended length. The wick width will influence the size of the melt pool -  the larger the wick width, the larger the melt pool it was designed to create. Check to make sure your flame is not\nhigher than 0.5 inches, smoking, or that the candle is not too hot in general. If it is, put out the candle and conclude your test. In this case, the wick is too large. At this time, still at the two hour\nobservation point, we like to record the diameter of the burn pool, pool depth,\nflame height, smoke, level of crackle and fragrance rating. Additional recordings you can take include the temperature of the liquid wax to ensure it's not\nexceeding the flash point of your fragrance. The flash point is the highest\ntemperature that your fragrance can be heated to before the fragrance smell\nburns off. You may also want to measure the temperature of the outside of your\ncontainer and any unusual factors that you observe. A spreadsheet is very\nhelpful. Remember, Google sheets is your friend! After four hours, observe and record all of the same details again and gently put out the flame. At this point the melt pool should be all the way to the edge of your container and\napproximately half an inch or 13 millimeters deep. If there is carbon buildup, smoke, or a melt pool that is substantially deeper than recommended, the wick is likely too large and you need to wick down in thickness, width, or potentially both and test again. Once the candle is fully cooled, repeat\nthe process through the life of the candle. Many candle manufacturers wait\none hour in between burn cycles, however we suggest waiting until the candle has\nreturned to a normal room tem perature and the wax is fully hardened. This will simulate how candles are most likely going to be burned in real life. In each cycle you will notice changes in burn, therefore it is very important to complete full life testing to truly know how your candle will burn and what changes if any need to be made. Repeat the process until you find a wick that achieves a full melt pool around 2 hours, and is approximately 0.5 inches in depth\nat the end of every burn cycle. The candle should not smoke and the flame height will ideally be between 0.375 inches and one inch - depending on the size of your candle. Ready to put your newfound knowledge into practice?

Round to the 100ths place value. We are given one ounce is\napproximately 28.350 grams and one gram is\napproximately 0.0353 ounces. We will show both\nconversions in this video. In the first example, we're asked to convert 12 ounces to grams. The first step is to write 12 ounces as a fraction with a denominator of one. To perform the conversion, we will multiply by a unit fraction. The important thing to recognize here is that, because we have ounces in the numerator, and we want ounces to simplify out for the unit fraction, the ounces must be in the denominator and therefore the grams\nmust be in the numerator. Now, using the first conversion of one ounce is\napproximately 28.350 grams, one possible unit fraction is 28.350 grams over one ounce. Using the conversion of one\ngram is approximately 0.0353 ounces, another possible unit fraction would be one gram, or 0.0353 ounces. Before multiplying, notice\nhow in both cases we have ounces divided by ounces.\nand therefore the units of ounces simplify out,\nleaving us with grams. And now, let's determine the products. Multiplying here, notice\nhow we have the denominator of one, and therefore, the\nproduct is just 12 times 28.350, and the units are now grams. Here, we have 12 divided by 0.0353 and again the units are grams. And now, let's go to the\ncalculator and determine this product as well as the quotient. And again, we are told to\nround to the 100ths place value, or two decimal places. Notice how the product is\n340.2 grams, and the quotient is 339.94 grams, rounding\nto the 100ths place value. Notice there is a slight difference because these conversions\nare approximations. But, the homework system\nwill take either conversion. I'm going to go ahead and enter\napproximately 340.2 grams. And now, we want to convert\n320 grams to ounces. And again, let's show both conversions. We first write 320 grams as a fraction with a denominator of one. Now, we multiply by a unit fraction to perform the conversion. In this case, because you\nwant grams to simplify out, and we have grams in the numerator here, grams must be in the denominator\nof the unit fraction, and therefore ounces\nwill be in the numerator. Using the first conversion of one ounce is approximately 28.350 grams, one possible unit fraction is one ounce over 28.340 grams. Using the second conversion, a possible unit fraction would be 0.0353 ounces over one gram. And now, before multiplying,\nnotice how in both cases we have grams divided by grams, and therefore the units\nof gram simplify out, leaving us with ounces. In this first product, we have 320 divided by 28.350 ounces, and in the second product,\nwe have 320 times 0.0353 ounces. And now, let's go back to the calculator. Rounding to the 100ths place value, notice how the quotient is\napproximately 11.29 ounces. Because we have a seven and a third decimal place, you round up. And then, for the product,\nbecause we have a six in the third decimal place you round up. Because we have a nine to the\nleft, this rounds to 11.30. So, we have approximately\n11.29 ounces, and 11.30 ounces. And again, the system will\naccept either conversion. I'm going to go ahead\nand enter 11.29 ounces.

jewelry so here's my outfit of the day he even picked my shoes and socks he did a great job so today is october 1st i can't believe it today starts all of our new challenges run walk a mile a day yeah i just said that i'm gonna do it it's gonna be a 102 degrees here today so i'm obviously going to wait until much later this evening to do my mile but i'm going to get it in and today we also start our recipe challenge so i'm gonna make something new for dinner tonight and i can't wait to show you guys what it is but first let's get started with breakfast so last week i discovered that fat free cottage cheese is zero smart points on the purple plan what an awesome find so today i'm using the last of my fat free cottage cheese i'm having it with sliced tomatoes i really forgot how much i like cottage cheese and then also with the tomatoes it just makes it really fresh like a fresh breakfast so this is what's for breakfast for me this morning for zero smartpoints okay it's lunch time i'm driving to the bank it's 97 degrees 97 supposed to get to 103 today so my plan is to run my mile directly after work at six o'clock at six o'clock it's going to be back down to 97 degrees which is what it is right now which feels terrible um but it's i don't really have a choice because i didn't wake up early to get my run in so i'm going to have to run in the heat i don't want to wait too long to get it done because obviously i want to get to dinner and have dinner at a decent time so it's going to be real hot this is the time when i wish i had a treadmill remember back when we had the gym at work and all i had to do was walk down the stairs and walk into the gym and just get it done i so wish i had that right now i think that the gyms are open here right now but i just don't have a gym membership right now i don't think it's something i'm interested in getting at this point because i'm not exercising enough to really make it worthwhile i think that maybe potentially if i can build up my exercise over the winter then um you know when the temperatures are cooler if i can build up my exercise and start to exercise again on a regular basis then it might be worth looking into getting a membership at la fitness again um for next summer but for now i'm good i'm good i don't need it so that's my update on exercise and how thrilled i am about exercise headed to the bank real quick to withdraw and then deposit some money just shuffling accounts and then i'm going to go back home and show you guys what we're having for lunch today so last night we had that stuffed stuffed chicken breast from costco they have two different ones one is a spinach stuffed chicken breast and the one we had last night was a broccoli stuffed chicken breast they're both really really good um but really big big chicken breasts so we're gonna have leftover stuffed chicken breasts for lunch today i'll show you what that looks like in just a couple minutes okay i had to break a 20 at 7 11 and out of all the things they have there all the goodies all the drinks everything there is to buy i bought this bubbly yay success why did i buy this we live on this stuff not only for lunch for water that i drink throughout the day but also we mix our drinks with it at night so i figured this was a good choice something i can actually use and not something like a candy bar or chips which really sound totally unexciting to me anyway i don't know about you guys but i really just don't crave sweets anymore i used to love sweets like years ago but now i don't crave sweets i don't eat them and i'm fine without anything sweet so if you wonder why i never do any sweet recipes on my channel that's why i just don't really crave it it's not my flavor palette at the moment okay here's lunch here is the costco stuffed chicken here it is one point per one ounce so today last night i had five ounces for dinner today for lunch i have just three ounces so that is three smart points for the chicken and then the vegetables are this bird's eye broccoli cauliflower and carrots it has a cheese sauce on it that is so so good this is one of my favorites so it is two smartpoints per serving so my total for lunch today is going to be five smartpoints [Applause] [Music] guys i did it i just ran my mile i feel so good right now i actually ran i ran walked of course but i ran a lot farther than i thought i would be able to so that makes me really excited i just got back it's a hundred degrees outside so that was really challenging i went one mile run walk took me 13 minutes and 20 seconds so that's the time i'm gonna use to gauge my success hopefully by the end of the month i will be number one running the entire mile and number two finishing in less than 13 minutes and 20 seconds but for today i did it if i can did it if i can did it you can get it we can all do it okay today is day one of our october recipe challenge and i'm super excited to start we're gonna cook tonight we're making summer squash taco casserole so gabe is gonna help me out todd's probably gonna help as well we're gonna make summer squash taco casserole okay here's all the ingredients we need and i'm going to read this off to you but hopefully if i can remember i'm also going to post the recipe in the description box for those of you who are not in our recipe challenge if you want the recipe for summer squash taco casserole so you we are gonna start with two cups of summer squash or zucchini thinly sliced this is i don't know if that's gonna be two cups but that's all we have left so there's our two cups of summer squash or zucchini casserole we're using one can of diced tomatoes all i have is stewed so we'll chop those up a little bit so they'll be diced i'm using this the recipe calls for a one and a quarter pound of ground beef cooked and drained we're going to use ground turkey um i know you're supposed to get like the 99 whatever ground turkey for it to be zero smart coins this is what i got this is what i'm using and i'm not counting it for points so this is an actual three pound container we're going to use one and a half pounds so half of this container for our turkey and i'm counting zero smart coins for that so we're at zero smart points so far we're using one and a quarter teaspoons of chili powder butter um one and a half teaspoons of paprika there one and a half teaspoons of cumin which is this little baby one right here one teaspoon of onion powder i don't think we have onion powder i'm gonna have to check we may have missed that one so i have to check for the onion powder a fourth a teaspoon of garlic salt we're using garlic powder instead of garlic salt the recipe already calls for salt so i feel like it's enough and we just use the garlic powder way more than garlic salt uh half a teaspoon of salt see and an eighth a teaspoon of cayenne pepper which is this one and then the last ingredient this is the one that's going to kill me on points the recipe calls for two cups of low-fat cheddar cheese grated all we have i looked for fat i looked for fat free all i could find from walmart great value was just regular medium cheddar cheese so i'm using two cups of low-fat shredded cheddar cheese and i don't know how many points that is but for the entire recipe eight servings because of the cheese it's going to be four smart points if you can get a lower points cheese it's going to lower the smart points but everything else is zero points so it's legit just all in the cheese my recipe for eight servings will be four smart points each let's get started okay i feel like we literally just bought onion powder so it should be i'm serious i really think we just bought onion powder i know we did does everybody else's spice cupboard look like this onion powder here we go we're going to use onion powder as well okay first thing we're going to do is preheat the oven to 350. there we go let's start prep okay next step we're going to just brown and crumble the turkey in the saucepan until it's done okay while this is cooking let me just tell you what i think about ground turkey i used to hate it i thought it was flavorless and dry and just not good at all i grew up on ground beef i grew up in the 70s and the 80s and we had ground beef all the time this whole ground turkey thing is a new newfangled low-fat thing but here's my stance on it now i really really like it like once you make the switch and you don't go back to ground beef all you have to do is season the ground turkey so that it has enough flavor you have to add like this recipe has a lot of seasoning so the ground turkey is going to be good with all of these seasonings you have to season your ground turkey and then i promise you you get used to the flavor it really is maybe an acquired taste but i don't miss ground beef at all so give it a try it's worth it especially if you're on the purple plan and ground beef lean ground beef is zero smart points give it a try okay while the turkey cooks we're gonna slice our zucchini we want some nice medium sized slices here gabe's going to slice it up for us super fast here we go [Music] okay the turkey's done so we're gonna add our diced tomatoes which are not really diced tomatoes they're stewed tomatoes but we'll chop them up with the spatula we're gonna add our tomatoes and then we're gonna add all the seasonings to this notice there was no fat to drain off of the turkey so yet another benefit of using turkey instead of beef so let's chop these tomatoes up a little bit and then we'll start with the seasonings [Applause] [Music] okay so we simmered our turkey seasoning for five minutes now we're gonna spread that out on top of these zucchini slices that we have in a 19 by 13 baking pan this is the really cute baking pan that my daughter-in-law got me for our wedding it's pioneer woman and you guys are probably familiar with her adorable cookware so we're just gonna spread this on the top [Music] and kind of spread it out a little yum and then the icing on the cake is always cheese we're gonna use about two cups of this shredded cheddar cheese and just spread it out all over the top of the casserole cool now spread it that's probably good oh my god all right done ready to bake we're gonna make this for 25 minutes at 350 degrees okay tonight with dinner we're enjoying some merlot we're using this blackstone merlot for dinner just a nice hopefully dry red wine i feel like this dinner is akin to a beef dinner so you would want something more along the lines of red white is more typically for a light chicken or fish so we're going with blackstone merlot tonight don't forget five ounces is four smartpoints fresh out of the oven here it is oh my gosh that is a pool of cheese we're gonna have to eat our way through it um i don't know how many smart points that is but um a lot okay so let me just tell you what i did was to me this looks like six servings and not eight so i recalculated the recipe in smart points in the ww app um i actually put every single one of the ingredients into the ww app to find out the smart points so instead of eight servings i'm going with six and this is a six smart point per serving recipe okay here's the final product and oh my gosh does it taste good so we have our zucchini taco casserole here a little bit of zucchini there lots of cheese that's the cheese that's bumping the points up so if you can use a lower fat or a fat-free cheese definitely do that mine is six servings for six smartpoints each serving and i'm gonna enjoy

structure of the dough kneading whether by hand or machine is a way of mixing the dough by stretching it which is what makes the gluten Network stronger intro dust your work surface and the dough with flour deflate the dough and Pat it into a rectangle shape rabbit and refrigerate overnight now how to make a slab of butter here is my secret weapon just place the 16 and 1/2 tbsp of butter in a 7 by 8 inches plastic bag and shape it into a slab once chilled prima of the edges to take the bara slab out when the bara slab is soft enough removed the chilled dough from the refrigerator now in a floured surface roll the dough into a 15 by 7 inches rectangle place the softened butter slab on one half and fold in the other half tape the dough gently with the rolling pine then roll from the center out until you have a rectangle 24 inches long by 8 inches wide when you have reached the proper size sweep off any excess flour then fold the left corner 2/3 of the dough up to the end almost fold in the right corner and readjust the thickness of the fatone fold in half like a book you have now made a double turn called to do blue repeat the same step and roll out until you have a rectangle 24 inches long by 8 inches wide fold the left third of the bottom up to the center and the right third over that you have now made your simple turn wrap it up and refrigerate for 1 hour meanwhile to make a perfect egg wash crack two eggs and blend them with a pinch of salt when the dough is rested shaping the croissant using half to do a time chill the other half making sure the croissant dough is always cold while working with roll it to a rectangle 18 inches long by 9 inches wide 1/8 thick which is about three millimeters with your chef's knife divide the dough into 6 large croissants roll them giving it that beautiful and familiar look repeat this with a remaining dough and place the croissants on a greased parchment paper brush them with egg wash you can make the croissants ahead of time and refrigerate them up to 12 hours before baking before the proofing process arrange croissants by 6 on a baking tray to proof the croissants place them on a counter top set aside to proof for two and a half to three hours at room temperature until puffed up and spongy pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees and bake them for 10 minutes then turn down the heat to 375 degrees and bake them for another 12 to 15 minutes gorgeous I love it you've all been waiting for delicious buttery and flaky croissants sorry guys you", "6sKyBfaWfDM": "well welcome back today I will do question 7 - question 9 okay for this paper journal paper 2019 okay so let's start my question 7 previously I've done question 1 2 3 on a separate video and then 4 to 6 on the non separate video so if you need help on that please go check it out ok so all those question 7 get questions up yeah so this is a standard form question so you need to understand what does this all means multiplied by 10 to power 7 what does it mean okay um so first question Chris simple they're asking you right 7:21 1/8 multiplied by 10 to power 7 so 10 to power 7 is basically 10 1 zero zero seven two seven zeroes right so we will do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so throughout order so let's do it 1 21 2 okay so let's move 7 times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so 1 2 3 4 5 ok so it should be 7 1 8 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 this is the final answer the ordinary number okay so we get the dog I've shifted here so this is final answer okay and then they want you to calculate a volume of these 4 C's or and all this up basically okay so I've done is that I've taken out I've written it like that first and this one and then what I've done is I take out 10 to power 7 okay so it looks nicer so I take out 10 to power 7 I did so it looks much nicer and then three point one times ten is thirty one and then two point six four times ten is twenty six point four so I'll add this up using my calculator I sixty six point four six and then because the one so it's always best to leave your answer in standard form so what I would do is that all instead of writing sixty six point five six multiplied by 10 to power 7 I'll do sixty six points for six times ten or something ten out all right and then I'll multiply this ten of over seven to ten so I'll get 10 to power 8 so therefore this is the final answer I know this is a bit long but doing this you can see the addition really clearly and to eliminate careless mistakes okay so this one this question asks you to leave the answer in standard form so it is very very easy question so you can see that is should be one two three four five six so 10 to the power six and nine point eight eight okay next question eight okay this is a question whereby we need to find X obviously so and five the only clue we are given is that the area of the triangle is 12 centimeter square so immediately I will come up with this equation area of the triangle is 1/2 times base times height so we know the area is 12 we know the base is 5 centimeter right so 1/2 times 5 times height is 12 so we work out the height which is 4.8 so height is this okay perpendicular height always is not this it's not this it's not this okay so it's always the perpendicular height okay then with this perpendicular height you can see that this is a right angle triangle all right if it's right angle triangle what does it remind you of it reminds your the Pythagoras theorem so this triangle here right we can draw it out like this so I for example right and go triangle so just 2.5 because it's half of five and then this is X then the height because it's 4.8 found previously from here all right so for this we can use Pythagoras theorem right the hypotenuse X square it goes to two point five squared plus four points where so x equals the square root 20 nine point two nine okay so this is X Wow okay and then what son except that the main purpose objective of the question is to find a parameter so it's basically a parameter as X plus X plus five right so we get 2x plus 5 so X is square root we nine point two nine so two times twenty nine point two nine squared plus five so our final answer is fifteen point eight okay right so let's go to our next question yeah so the table shows information about speed of 60 cycles right so we have this so you want to do it in cumulative frequency table okay so basically this is accumulator so at the end and my it must add up to 60 cycles okay so how do we do it three plus sixteen so we get 19 okay 19 plus 24 yet 43 43 plus 10 yet 53 53 plus 5 we get 58 you see it plus 2 60 okay that's how we get this table here all right ok let's go to our next question here so we need to draw a cumulative frequency graph so what we need to do is to use this table here and plot 3 1943 53 58 16 so 3 K 3 19 so in 1953 is 43 sorry then this is 53 58 and then 60 okay so clock the crosses and then linked up the line the red line and there you go okay that's the cumulative frequency graph done okay then next one use your graph to find an estimate for the interquartile range of the speeds okay so 30 so the lower quartile is 15 so how do we get 15 is from 1 over 4 multiplied by 16 so that's 15 okay there's our lower quarter 15 so it's here it's in and then 45 is our apical surface is a 3/4 okay then pull it down I get 17 17 yeah and then 32 so interquartile range is upper quartile minus lower quarter so 32 minus seventeen gives me 15 ok so let's go to the next question the next question is this we need to calculate the size or angle a BAC so BAC we want to find this angle here okay so it's not that easy but we got quite a few clues on this diagram already so we got 13 we've got 20 we got b c kb c okay then maybe maybe less fine CD for us okay so how can we find CD we use the tangent right tangent 20 for sturdy opposite over adjacent right guess this is the CD is the opposite and then this one is the adjacent right so what we get we get this opposite over adjacent then we cross multiply over this and then CD is 13 tangent 20 so therefore BD which is the full speed in Jesus here is CD plus BC hi CD plus BC so is 13 tangent 20 plus BC is 8 okay so with that you see that we have an adjacent ya and an opposite green and then therefore we can find this whole angle here be a D so BA D is BD over ad okay so CD over ad so BD we got it which is from here and then ad is 13 all right so inverse tangent yes yeah this and then therefore b ad is this forty four point four three two for dinner so I always do four decimal places so therefore BAC you just need to minus 20 so this purple angle minus 20 gives you BAC the blue angle okay so your final answer is forty four point four to one decimal place okay so I hope this helps for my next video I will do question 11 okay thank you", "IBijHL6ktG4": "- Don't panic! Has this happened to you? I'll teach you how many\nstitches to cast-on, how many rows to knit, and how\nmuch yarn to buy, right now. Welcome to GoodKnit Kisses. We're all about helping\nyou stitch your love and love your stitches. Help! Ahhh! How many stitches should\nI cast-on, Kristen? How many rows should I knit? And how much yarn\nam I gonna need for that queen-sized blanket? I get to answer these\nquestions all the time but I want you to be able\nto answer them as well. This is all about Interactive\nKnitting Calculators and you can get it by clicking on the link below to get this, this is our blog and this\nhas all the calculators in it that you're\ngonna want to use. So, you can go and\nread this article, it gives you lots more\nfantastic information. I'm gonna show you right now\nhow to use the calculator. So we're just gonna\nscroll on down, this is telling you\nwhat you're gonna need, and I'm gonna move this aside\nand show you everything. All right, so let's\nget into what we need. You have got a swatch\nthat you're gonna need, It's made in the yarn\nthat you're going to work on your project, make it\non the needles or the loom that you're gonna be using,\nand you're gonna make it in the main stitch\npattern that you want. This is made in a stockinette because my pattern is a main\nstocking stitch pattern. I also need a measuring\ntape and that's it as far as calculating\ncasting on stitches and how many rows to make. If you want to\ncalculate yardage, you're going to\nneed a postal scale that measures in\ngrams or ounces. I like to measure in grams. And then you're gonna\nneed this yarn label 'cause you wanna know how\nmany yards or how many meters that you need to cast-on. All right, so let's get\ninto the calculators. You're first gonna\nmake a gauge swatch and this talks about all\nabout making a gauge swatch, so go to that on how to\nmake that gauge swatch. So once you've got\nyour swatch made, you're gonna want to go to\nthis Cast On Calculator here. And we're gonna put in our width of our measured area for gauge. Now, I don't measure\nthe entire swatch. I just measure across\nin either two inches or maybe four inches, you're\ngonna put in that number and then you're gonna\nput in how many stitches that you count in that number. So I'm gonna show\nyou how mine works and then we're gonna\nput in the project width that you actually want it to be. So I'm gonna move this\naside and show you. So, first of all,\nI've measured across and I'm gonna leave\nout these two side, the inches on the side, this\nis about a six inch project, and I'm measuring in\nthe middle four inches and I've measured\nacross and I've counted how many stitches that is. All right, and then later on\nfor your rows calculation, you're gonna do the same. Now I don't do the sides\nand the top and bottom because I think it's a more\naccurate representation of what that is. So lets move these aside\nand I'm gonna show you. All right, so the\nCast On Calculator, I'm just going to\nput in here first, the width across that I measured and I counted all my stitches. So I did four inches, all right? And then I'm going to put\nin the number of stitches that I counted, and I\ncounted 14 in this area. 14. And now I'm going to put in\nthe width of the project. I know that I need\n30 inches wide, I'm making a flat panel, and\nI'm gonna put in 30 inches. Now you can use inches\nor centimeters in these, it doesn't matter in the way\nwe've done the calculators. And then I just\nscroll down and look, it's already put the\nnumber in for me. So I know that if I want\nto make this whole panel in 30 inches wide, I\ncan use 105 stitches. Now I can divide that in\nhalf or in threes if I want to make it in two\npanels or three panels. Or I could even put\nwhat width I want my, that particular panel\nin, so let me check. I'm gonna do, divide it\nin half, I'm gonna say 15, I wanna do two panels of 15. So it says that my stitches\nI need 52.5 stitches here. Okay, see 52.5? Now I know in my pattern, I want to adjust it to whatever\npattern that is. So in my pattern I know\nthat I need an odd number of stitches anyway\non my cast-on, so\nI'm gonna make it 53. So that's really helpful for me. Now I'm gonna scroll\ndown and figure out how many rows that\nI need to work. Okay, so we're just gonna\nuse this same swatch example. When I did count those stitches, that I told you about,\nI did it in four inches. So let's just move that\nin so you can see it. Four inches and then I got,\nlet me look at my notes, I got 19.5 rows, so 19.5, and then I'm gonna\nput in my project length, and my project length\nis going to be 54 inches and as soon as I do that, look\nit came up how much I needed. So these are the rows\nthat I need, it's 263.52. Now that's if I was to\ncount all those rows out. I will tell you this though, if I need a finished\nlength of 53 or 54, and I get that many rows\nand it's that decimal point, just remember you do have\na cast-on and a bind-off. So, what I do is I\nmeasure the length here and then I measure\nthe length here, which ended up being, I've\ngot a quarter inch here, and a quarter inch here,\nand then I add that together and that is a half an inch and I can actually take\noff this half inch here. So I only need 263 rows, if I knit 264 rows, then my project is gonna\nbe a little bit longer and if you're trying\nto match it up to something else in\nsize, then that's, you're gonna have\nto account for that. All right, so let's scroll down to the Project\nYardage Calculator. Okay this is how many\nskeins do I need? How many balls of\nyarn do I need to buy? So we're gonna scroll\nup here and it says, now this is not an\nexact calculation, and it's designed to give\nyou a ballpark estimate. It will be close but\nit can't be perfect. It also isn't gonna take into\naccount changing yarn colors and things like that, so if\nyou need an extra ball of yarn, I would do so. It's always a good call to\njust get one more ball of yarn in case of whatever, it's\nalways a good insurance policy to get one more ball and\nbesides there's always projects you can use them in. So, we're gonna\ncalculate the yardage. You're gonna need a\nfew more things here. So, we're gonna need to get\nthe yarn information off of our ball, so we've\ngot the wrapper here. And then we're going\nto look at the weight. Now you can put in\nounces or grams. I recommend grams, even though\nyou normally might speak in ounces in the U.S. Now, I'm in the U.S.\nbut I like to use grams 'cause I think\nit's more accurate. So I put in 150 grams here. So let's type 150, and\nthen skein yardage, in yards or meters, and\nthen I'm gonna use yardage 'cause that's what I'm\nmost familiar with, 312. So 312 yards and then I'm\ngonna scroll down here and we're gonna put in\nour swatch information. Now, you use your gauge swatch that you already made to\ncollect this information but the width and the\nlength measurement of the swatch are for\nthe entire swatch, not the small section\nthat you measured to calculate the cast-on. So, you're going to\nmeasure the entire thing. So, let's look at that again. We're going to measure\nfrom, and I blocked this, I did a light steam\nblocking on here so that it wouldn't roll on me,\nand then I measured all the way from here to here, so\nto the very outmost edge and I measured\nfrom here to here. So I'm including the cast-on\nand I'm including the bind-off in my numbers for\nyardage because I'm going to have one in mine\nanyway and it allows for that extra amount of yards,\nso, I've got all that and then I also count in\nthere, my stitches and rows. So, my whole width\nof the swatch, I\nmeasured at six inches. And then the whole length or height of the swatch is 6.75. Okay, that's what\nmy end measured. And then the number\nof stitches across, I know that I casted\non 20 stitches. Okay, my number of rows is 34. All right, this is where we get into the weight of the swatch. If you've never\nweighed a swatch, the easiest way to do it is\njust turn on your postage scale, you can actually go to the post\noffice if you don't have one so you can get this at\nmany different stores. I actually did get it at\na office supply store. So we're gonna go here and\nI'm going to put my swatch in. And I'm just gonna make sure\nit's laying on there right. It told me nine, and then earlier it\nactually said 10. So it's kinda teetering on\nthat number, see the 10? So I'm gonna go ahead\nand use the 10 number 'cause that's probably\nthe most accurate, and then that's all\nI need for that. But make sure your scale is\nset to either grams or ounces when you're reading this thing. All right, so we're putting\nin our weight of the swatch, which is 10 and I'm\ngonna scroll down and my project width is\ngoing to be 30 inches and it's going to\nbe 54 inches long. And when I go down here,\nit's crunching the numbers, all the little calculating elves have already done their work\nand it is a total of 832 yards or meters, whatever\nnumber you put in. And then the number of skeins, it's already programmed\nit in for you because I told it how\nmany is in my skein and so it says\nthat I need three. Now, if I get the calculator\nout and I look at this, I can actually show like\na regular calculator, and I take 832 divided by\n312 which is my yardage, I actually get 2.67 so I can\nsee how close this is to three and if I have a color-changing\nyarn like this one, I'm gonna go ahead and buy\none more just to be sure. So if it's on the low side, then you're probably\nfine with three. So you need to use\nyour judgment there. But that is it and\nthat is how you make this Cast On Calculator,\nRow Calculator, and your own\ncalculator work for you for our interactive calculators so that you don't look\nlike this next time.

will need a few things to get started a printer a pair of scissors a paper crimper or decorative scissors some adhesive and your selection of chips so let's get started i forgot to mention you will need paper the type of paper you use is really a personal preference depending on the look you're going for whether it be matte or glossy finish i use hammer meal premium color copy a lot of crafters prefer to use brochure paper to achieve that glossy chip bag look in my experience with brochure paper i find it too thick and hard to work with however i have heard from other crafters you can find some really thin brusher paper that works well so try out different papers and see what works best for you okay we're in silhouette studio i'm using the business edition but you'll be able to create this design in any version of silhouette studio i will be using a one ounce size bag and i made my template smaller than the standard full sheet that most chip bags are made by for the sake of time i've already imported my template and my clipart images and the first thing we're going to do is to add our background to our template i have that image saved on my desktop and i'm going to use the drag and drop method it attaches itself directly to my template this is our picture of reference and we're going to follow this guide to build our template i already have my images attached to save time and i'm going to bring in and we're going to work on the middle let me bring all these images to the front so we'll put mario here and i will hold my shift and select my background and i'm going to go to the transform panel and we're going to center this it centers it on the page okay so now we want to bring in our blades of grass right now it doesn't really look like he's standing in tall grass but i saved these png grass images from google and we're gonna give this a 3d effect sort of so you see how that is going behind mario all right we're going to line it up there then i'm bringing this one and it's going to go in the front so can you kind of see how it makes it have a 3d illusion sort of and when we bring our eggs in our eggs are going to go in the grass and not on top of the grass let me show you the difference okay see how this looks it doesn't look as realistic as as it does when it goes in the grass i like this much better i'm gonna make them a little bit bigger so they can sit out okay so our eggs are in the grass and i think i want to take that all the way across and i want to bring this to the front okay so those eggs are in the grass and i want to put these in the grass here all right so all we're doing now is just plugging in all of our clipart pieces this is a bag of cheetos so we're going to put that there i don't need this set of eggs so i delete that bring mario in here let's look at our picture okay let's get our barcode this barcode is a font brain to front this is a a barcode font that i downloaded to my computer and i can add any saying to the bar code that i want whether it's numbers words whatever as well as the name here this is a mario font and i ungrouped the letters and i was able to color them individually all right cheetos we're almost done designing this bag it's almost ready to print bring mario up just a little bit we're gonna add our nutritional facts i did design these nutrition facts they have some that are already made on google but they won't be custom to your party if you need help learning how to design custom nutrition facts in silhouette studio just let me know and i'll do a quick video on that so this bag is ready to be sent to the printer i'm going to print it out these lines are on here are only for reference they're not going to print out they're just guidelines if you want to delete them after you have designed your bag if it makes you feel more comfortable you can do so but i'm not going to delete them because i know they're not going to print so i'm going to print this out and i will be back and we will assemble our chip bag okay i have my image cut out when you print it out it's going to be a white border around it you want to cut that off i'm going to use my tape gun to apply my adhesive you may also use red line tape which is really good or you can use those small adhesive um strips so you want to put tape down the right down the bottom and across the top i'm gonna put a little adhesive in the middle just to hold the bag and all you do now is bring it in and try to line it up as best as you can on the edge okay so now you have something that looks like this and you just want to close the ends so just squeeze and close do the same thing for the top i messed that one up a little i will cut that out you just get your scissors and where you see that white just cut straight across no big deal then you're going to get your paper crimper and insert your chip bag inside and give it a couple rows into the bottom and it puts that crimp in there and that's your chip pad and for those that do not have this um there's an alternate thing you can do you can use these decorative scissors to have the um crimping edge this right here is hard to find it's on ebay i saw it for about thirty dollars i think friskers has discontinued this particular one they have another one that's on amazon and i don't like it at all but this is our chip bag this is volume one i'm going to be doing a series of party printables that we will make an easter basket with once we are complete with the series thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video", "qO3c4bZDa2k": "[Music] [Music] hey guys today I'm gonna be showing you how to install this slime tube sealant into my Xiaomi scooter the stuff will slow down or prevent leaks into the tube what it does is uses some fiber and suspended liquid to seal up the leak the stuff will last for says two years and can seal a puncture up to 1/8 of an inch and is non-toxic and cleans up with water so the amount that you need for the tire is I could use the online calculator and it shows I need one point two ounces so you're looking at the bottle here this is a 16 ounce bottle and the markings only show four and eight ounces so it's kind of hard to measure one point two ounces so what I do is I go into the dollar store and I picked up a food flavor syringe and pretty much of a needle side I've got some electrical tape and made it thick enough there like so so that I can use the included tube here no fit over here to create a seal and now this one measures up to 30 millimeters or one full ounce so what I'm going to do is I'm going to inject a full ounce in there and then later add another quarter ounce so they'll get me about 1.25 ounces so yeah I'll show you what to do so the tube sealant bottle comes with a tool this is the tool end and there's a valve core remover so we'll just take the alcohol remover and loosen off the valve core and remove it careful not to lose it off core so now my tire is fully deflated so next I need to open up the bottle take off the seal so I'm going to fill this up to the one ounce mark so that's load over that's okay okay then we just put this end try to keep the try to keep with the nipple end up up on the higher side once we get it over the nipple we'll just squeeze all the stuff in okay so I'm going to add the last quarter ounce and then now we're going to put back the valve so of course so now that the valve core is tight I can just screw on the adapter so I take out my handy portable air compressor and then fill it with here [Music] [Applause] double-checking the tightness devout core and then I will rinse it off a little bit of water go for a ride and we're good to go thank you for watching and I hope you to see in the next one bye", "CjWLdCDI3YY": "hi I'm Charley case of I'm a math teacher and today we're going to learn how many milligrams are in one gram for conversion so first 1,000 milligrams equals one gram now to remember that remember that the prefix M before the G is milla which is one one thousandth so we say one gram well that's the base measurement and one milligram is one one thousandth of a gram thus there's a thousand milligrams in a gram now if we want to use that we can say two thousand six hundred and forty two milligrams and we want to convert that to grams well we have two thousand milligrams so that's two and then we have 642 so that's two point six four two grams or if we said 750 milligrams well that's point seven five grams because there's not a full thousand milligrams so I'm Charlie case of and you just learned how to convert milligrams into grams for conversion thanks a lot", "X6qNDG-3kxg": "so here's the deal a couple weeks ago I put video out about the new nine and a half foot Chad Ferguson signature Sue's robbed that I released with whisker seeker and I mentioned in that video that I was going to post some more information with a casting test on that rod well I lost my voice and couldn't talk for about five or six days and since then have tried to get this video filmed several times and it just hadn't worked life's gotten in the way for whatever reason and actually kind of a funny story that goes with that I'm going to actually post in the next video that I'm going to post about something that happened this morning when I tried to come film this but anyway long story short we tried several times out on the lake cast in with nine and a half foot rod seven half foot rod trying to really kind of pin down the difference and it didn't work out just really too hard to kind of tell what the difference was and get it accurate so what we don't have done is gone redneck scientific and the best way that I could figure out to do this was to come to football field Saginaw Rough Rider High School where my son plays football get out on the football field cast from the end zone with both rods seven half foot rod nine and a half foot rod and see what the difference is in the casting distance between the two rods so what I did is I took that nine and a half foot heavy power rod seven and a half foot heavy power rod both brand new rods it had never been used before I took two brand new avenues 6500 C three reels out of the box that had never been fished with before put brand new whisker seeker orange monofilament on both of them so they had fresh line so same exact setup same exact specifications only difference having and a half foot rod seven half foot rod to see what the difference is so came down to the football field stood in the endzone right on the goal line or close to the goal line and made three cast with seven half foot rod made three casts with the nine and a half foot rot but I was not casting into the wind so I made three casts with seven half foot rod from the goal line and casted 75 78 and 85 yards with those three cast so I want to say 80 yard average with the three cast with the seven and a half foot rod with a 3-ounce no roll sinker now I'm using three on snow rolls because that's what I use a majority of the time when I fish I have absolutely no doubt that if I put probably five six ounces of weight on there got a little bit more weight but not quite too heavy that I can get some more distance out of there but for the purposes of what I'm trying to show with the difference of using a longer fishing rod in this situation it'll work so three cast seven half foot yard rod we're going to call it 80 yards is the average for those three now made three casts with the nine and a half foot rod the first cast I got 95 yards the second cast was just a hair off of being in the endzone it was so close that you wouldn't have been able to tell from from the stands the third cast that I made went over the goal line and about seven or eight feet past the end of the endzone that was the best cast I had by far and I suspect that there may have been a little bit of a gust when I made that last cast that got all that distance and and that would veer off to the right like the other ones that I cast and the longest cast that I got with that seven and a half foot rod was the same way it that cast stayed straight where the other ones I had a little bit of crosswind and they carried that sinker over to the right a little bit so I think the wind may have had something to do with those longest cast but you know we'll say a difference of about 25 yards if you want to average out the cast that I got with the nine and a half foot rods Cassidy got with seven half foot rods now I have no doubt that I could get much more scientific about it get out here when there's not very much wind I had some people that I was fighting against that were running around here on the field I was trying to keep from hitting somebody the last cast that I made with that nine and a half foot rod got really really close to a woman that was out here working out on the sidelines and I was kind of tensed up I was afraid I was going to hit her because I couldn't tell where the sinker was and it got really really close to her when it went went down that way surprised I didn't hit her in the head so that's the difference in casting distance and what a longer fishing rod will do for you like I mentioned before nine and a half foot rod is not going to be for every every application it's not going to be for every angler if you're a Shore fisherman a bank fisherman where you're trying to get those rods and baits out away from the shoreline then nine and a half foot rod is going to be a good fit for you because it's going to give you that extra casting distance to really hum them out there and get some more distance to get your baits out away from the shoreline the 9 1/2 foot rod is great for fishing from a boat if your drift fishing you want to use them for outside rods or if you're fishing from planer boards or if you're fishing with planer boards like I mentioned before having that extra distance really helps get that line up out of the water and helps those planers really pull out away from the boat it's not going to be for everybody it's not going to be for every applique because it is it's a big fishing rod if you got a boat with a bunch of people in it or just a couple of people in it it's it's kind of difficult even in that big 24 foot Pro cat that I fish from to kind of navigate those big fishing rods around people when you've got a fishing rod that that's long that's kind of the difference that you can expect and and the extra benefit that you get from a longer fishing rod casting distance again like I said I have no I no doubt you know if I worked on super tuning those reels some really worked on tweaking my casting technique you know put a lot of effort into it that I could get even more distance than what I got but this was a quick get out there on that football field make three casts with each rod real quick and get out and I stay very long because that it's about a hundred degrees right now I don't know how hot it is out there but the astroturf was burning the bottom of my feet through my shoes so I didn't wanna stay very long plus I didn't want to run the risk of hitting anybody like I said before so that's the difference casting the two rods I'll be back with another video here on a big giveaway that I'm doing for the YouTube channel and catfish edge web site and fixin to load up and head out to ICAST 2016 going to be hanging out with guys at whiskers secret tackle helping them promote fish and rods and all their other tackle products and stuff that I've

lot of a used car dealer there are three chryslers 12 ford 7 dodges 15 chevrolets two jeeps and a tesla go ahead i want you to talk to each other i've talked to each other there's other people there fantastic if not i get it but go ahead and think about it guys what percentage of each vehicle type do they have at this dealership you're going to want to pause the video because we're going to get talking about this as soon as my calculator loads this is the calculator song with a ti smart view trademark emulator software for the ti 30x ti 34 multi-view tm calculators from texas instruments validating software license hey i made it perfect oh those look familiar all right can i get you back up yonder in five four three two one all right distance learners if you haven't already finished this go ahead and pause it in three two one pause real quick does anyone happen to notice what all of these car manufacturers have in common does anyone know what those car manufacturers have in common henry [Music] okay oh yes eddie they do indeed make cars adelaide you're absolutely right about that colin that's true which all have a very uh a very uh something something in common jonas uh what jeep is awesome what are you talking about guys i'll tell you right now they are all cars that either are or were owned by companies based in the u.s whether they are still manufactured in the us is uh another story hello oh okay shane shane's back it's shane the lupine of shame all right coming back in five four three two one what the what on earth is happening right now whoa uh oh hang on okay hold on this is really really bad news if okay hang on because my screen is currently blank okay i think all right i'm gonna try this again okay sorry distance learners okay i'm gonna hit that button and i need maybe it usually gives me the option let's see here [Music] okay so this is still bad but maybe it'll be good okay hold on everybody oh no um i need you in five four three two one here's what i want you to do guys okay so those of you at home are wondering what on earth is happening right now uh let me go ahead and at least give you something to look at that's not a blank screen so also to make sure that i am not completely messing this up hopefully i don't have to restart my computer or anything okay hello you're back hello there distance learners okay so let's see here let's get that there and what we want to do is so this is what it looks like here i need you to talk about the following so distance learners uh sit tight and those of you here at uh at school let me talk to you guys about what's going on uh tomorrow so tomorrow we're gonna have it was supposed to be a skill check on all the percentages because we were supposed to do three weeks a worth of percentages uh in three days but unfortunately because i was absolutely one of those days we only got through one week oh man so we're gonna review that first let me tell you what a level one is i can turn a fraction a decimal or percent into the other two that is got a pencil 0.256 1 8 and 132 can you guys turn that 0.256 into a fraction and as a percentage and can you turn 1 8 into a decimal in percentage and you can turn 132 into a fraction and a decimal see what you can do while i try to figure out what the heck's going on with my computer here teach so this thing's gonna get mad yep oh there we go all right yay okay can i get you back up here in five for what the three two one wait a minute why is this happening now it's not it won't show anything to the distance learners what is going on here uh hang on this is all kinds of not great boo boo boo i say okay hang on so i need to go over here maybe what i need to do is i need to say we're not going to duplicate we're going to extend and then we're going to keep those changes and then i'm going to go over to number two and maybe i need to duplicate here so we're actually going to duplicate these displays and we're going to keep the changes and keep the change and now oh there it is yay holy moly what a nightmare anyway what i was trying to accomplish guys is here we go huh we're gonna come back to that question i was asking you in just a second and we're going to do all three of those but first let's do the actual warm-up because now it's working i think let's see here are we good here we are maybe we'll check on that in a second but everything seems to be in order okay whoo sorry about that everybody xavier how did you manage something like this what do you mean what did you do with your calculator so you got three chryslers 12 fords seven dodges 15 chevys two jeeps and one tesla and that's 40 vehicles how many of us missed the tesla at first that happens to a lot of people because they didn't put a number value by it happens people do this out of 39 you're like wow these are some terrible numbers anyway what did you do with that so that's what i'm saying when i say turn that in fraction into a decimal and percent three-fortieths is already a reduced fraction so you're good there 0.075 is what that is as a decimal and 7.5 percent is what that is as a percentage that's what i mean by convert a fraction into a decimal and a percentage okay cool and so on and so forth right like twelve fortieths however guys if i want that on canvas i don't want that i need that reduced that reduces to eight twentieths which reduces again to two-fifths is it six twenty oh you're right six points mr peterson boo and it reduces by four or two excuse me see i got all like tripped up here and that's three tenths which by the way is 0.3 which by the way is 30 how many of us were either able to get all these or we see how we got these and we're not too worried about these okay that's good so let's go ahead and talk about what's happening tomorrow now that we can actually see what we're talking about oh yes india you look alarmed and angry what did you do and that's seven point five one hundredths which is seven seven point five percent that's beautiful very good excellent all right guys will you go ahead and open up your planners to page 80 and i don't know if this is looking small for you guys at home it's a little small here in class but i'm not going to move i'm not going to move it because i'm worried about messing it up open up your planners to page 80 everybody page 80 or look super excited to write this down in your notes here page 80 i didn't have time to get there guys i came in and i just had to dis like reassemble my classroom uh in time to get it started so let's see here i'd love to get a little bit of help from danica what is our first essential question what can i expect to see on tomorrow as a skill check [Music] mhm okay so guys originally i was going to give you the longer harder skill check right out the gates because we were gonna cover all of percentages in three days since it didn't happen that way what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna cover uh we're gonna have to give you two smaller scale checks one that's the basics and then one that's what we actually are doing with them in the 7th grade core so without further ado let's get to it so underneath your warm up got a pencil percentage skill check review [Music] i know now with a hundred percent less mummies because there was a mummy in yesterday's remember we mummified russell wilson to see how much he would weigh okay so like i said level one level one i am able to convert percentages fractions and decimals into the other two okay and a good example of that would be let's start with one that i think you're going to feel more comfortable with i'm going to give you a fraction like 1 8 and your job is going to be to tell me what is that as a percentage and what is that as a decimal talk to your partners what is one-eighth as a decimal and what is one-eighth as a percentage teach teach did you guys get a percent in a decimal yeah beautiful get that written down for me all right everybody can i get you back in five four three two one okay let's see if i can get a little bit of help out there jameson what is one-eighth as a decimal very good how many of us are gonna get 0.125 for that right because it's a fraction and a fraction bar means divide what is that as a percentage jameson 12.5 percent and you get that because if you grab the decimal and move it twice or multiply it by 100 or however it is you want to think about it that's how you get a level one okay guys another another thing you need to be able to do to get a level one is i need to be able to give you a decimal like 0.6026256 and i want you to give that to me as a fraction it could be a mixed number or uh not that's one though this could be uh so this as a reduced fraction and as a percentage will you guys talk to each other can you get that to me as a reduced fraction and as a percentage teach teach or it already is a decimal so it needs to be a fraction is no it's almost lunch time all right everybody can i get you in five four three two one what was easier guys trying to get into a fraction or turning it into a uh percentage it was easy to turn it into a percentage i completely agree how did you turn that into a percentage and i'd love to get a little bit of help alec how would you turn that into a percentage yeah you move the decimal twice multiply it by a hundred twenty-five point six percent now guys if you've already turned it into a percentage one way to turn it into a fraction is that a percent is a part to a whole comparison always to what what number are we always comparing to 100 so you could write it as 25.6 over 100 that's not simplified by any stretch of the imagination so i'm going to get rid of that decimal by multiplying by 10 in the numerator and denominator and i get 256 divided by a thousand which i believe i can reduce by at least four let's see if i can do more 256 divided by four 64. and then that's going to be 250 i can actually do it again reduced by 2 and that's 32 over 125. here's another thing guys you could have gotten to this point right here if you just remembered your scary third grade teacher yelling at you when you were like teacho is that 0.256 and they were like 0.256 scrub your mouth out with soapy little weasel that is 256 thousandths and then someone's like teacho that's zee whoa and 256 thousands and then the teacher quits in shame because they're right anyway you could remember that they said that has to be 256 000 so you can put it up there and you can reduce it you guys feeling comfortable with that give me a hands up if you guys are feeling comfortable you guys okay there yes henry please no because here's the thing it's a proportion related to a hundred but there's three ways to think about these things there's a decimal where it's like .256 of it there's a fraction it's 32 125ths or a percentage 25.6 percent the all these three represent the same thing in the simplest form possible and that's how i want them to look that's a great question yes go ahead right and you could you could though right it's i guess you'd call it 12 12 and a half 100 so it's just weird to say right okay last one guys if i give you the percentage first and what if i gave you something over a hundred like what if it was 132 can you get me that as a fraction and as a decimal talk to your partners and teach right now okay can i get you guys back in five four three two one hey you guys are doing awesome i think you guys deserve a point also i've missed you guys all right so let's see here matthew what was easier to get this as a decimal or as a fraction what was it as a decimal how many of us got 1.32 for that decimal that'd be perfect because you moved the decimal over twice that's beautiful can someone tell me what they did to turn that into a fraction let's go for danica what did you do okay okay and i can tell you exactly what your calculator does your calculator says that is 132 100 because it's a percentage which we can reduce by uh at least four i can show i can show you that in just a minute depending on what kind of calculator you have 132 divided by 4 is 33. oh good 20 fifths very good did somebody get the get uh the fraction a different way and possibly in a different form did anybody get that a different way jonas what'd you do yeah and that's i think eight twenty-fifths so i will accept thirty-three twenty-fifths or one and eight twenty-fifths they are both perfectly acceptable on canvas you'd use the slash can i get your voices guys off in five four three two one so you do 33 25 or one space eight slash 25 that's the only time you use a space there cool how many of us feel confident we can get that level one you get that level one you get that level one okay perfect level two got a pencil oh hold on got a pencil let's write this down and i'll get right there we gotta keep moving level two i can use part and whole to calculate percentage for instance look around you what percent of our classroom are boys go ahead teach what's that no don't count absences don't count absences those of you at home we'll get to the numbers in just a second obviously you can't see [Music] yes so in this class we have six girls 15 boys if you count me which i will because it's gonna make the numbers nicer all right everybody can i get you in five four three two one it's okay it's okay guys it's okay because it's going to make the numbers nicer i counted myself so if you count me there are six girls and 15 boys so i'll tell you right now the number one mistake i've seen on this skill check is if i say what percent of this class are girls people do 6 divided by 15. can someone tell me why that's incorrect why would that be incorrect sam yeah that's part divided by part which has a meaning but not for us right now so what should i really do if i wanted to find the percentage of boys yeah so 15 divided by 21 is what i believe that comes out to be and 15 divided by 21 actually that number's not that nice so if i'm gonna round that and by the way guys what you'll see it say is round to the nearest tenth of a percent sometimes it won't tell you to round in that case i want all the numbers but if we round to the nearest tenth of a percent that's the same as rounding your decimal to the nearest thousandth 0.714 and what would that be as a percentage because those answers need to be in percentages what can i what would that be as a percentage and i'd love to get that from let's see here empty seats empty seats there we go uh johnny what would that be as a percentage about 71.4 percent of the people in this classroom are boys now guys there's two tricks some sometimes it's really easy it's like a class has 15 boys and 21 students what percentage are boys 15 divided by 21. a class has six girls and 15 boys what percentage are boys you got to add them together and then divide but sometimes i might make it tricky like there's 15 boys and 21 students what percentage are girls how would you get the six if i didn't tell you that how would you get that six if i didn't tell you jameson yeah you would do the total students subtract the 15 boys and the rest of girls okay cool that's a level two level three got a pencil level three i am able to calculate whole or part given percentage and the other value okay for instance let's say you are at a concert and at the concert there are 21 000 uh justin bieber fans and it turns out that 8.2 of them are robots how many robots and also for the record how many non-robots are at this concert beep boop teach teach teach [Music] oh let's get that up and over our nose please and then so this is like do you have your notes from yesterday so what am i giving here do i know the whole amount of fans do i know the percentage so i need to find the part what do i need to do to find the part let's see it should be in here somewhere the hole is equal to the part divided by the percentage but i don't know the part i know the hole looks like you forgot one that's okay see if someone at your table can help you we'll have it up here in just a second correct but the percentage as a decimal always as a decimal yeah if you multiply by 8.2 you're going to get more people than we're there and that doesn't work is all right everybody can i get you in five four three two one riley how do i do something like this so every fan twenty all twenty one thousand fans let's see here 0.82 times 21 000. seventeen thousand two hundred twenty how many of us got seventeen thousand two hundred twenty now i've got a problem guys because here we go sometimes we split percentages into talking about not very many some most about half guys if 8.2 percent of the fans are robots is that most of the fans or not most of the fans it's less than most of the fans right 8.2 percent is less than 50 so fans should outnumber robots however if there's 17 220 robots they're greatly they're greatly outnumbered uh outnumbering the fans so what's gone wrong here something's gone wrong why don't you guys talk about it teach teach good excellent jamison jameson's got it okay can i get you in five four three two one i heard someone suggest this oh i have counted down i heard someone suggest that we take 21 000 and subtract away the 17 220 but look what happens oops that does not have a minus sign that's just a really big number 21 000 minus 17 220. can i get your voices off guys i get 3780 which seems reasonable until you divide it by twenty one thousand because is that eight point two percent zero point one eight yes or no i'd say whatever i'd say no that's eighteen percent so jameson what really went wrong here yeah remember guys to turn that into a decimal you've got to move it twice always twice so it's actually 0.08 and so if we do that 0.082 we're going to multiply that by 21 000 and we get the much more reasonable what riley 1722 robots how many of us were able to get 1722 robots that's better okay so yes go ahead oliver ah so it all stems from this go ahead maybe you want this in your paper maybe you don't i'll leave it up to you i'm not going to tell you to put your pencils down because maybe you want it it all stems from this we're used to being given the part and the whole and then we divide them to get the percentage but of course we get the percentage as a decimal we have to do some work to turn it into a percentage yeah now if we actually try to solve this equation because it turns out i'm allowed to add subtract multiply and divide with equations even if i don't know these values you'll be doing that a ton next year by the way i can multiply both sides by the whole and this gives me a new equation the part in this case the part that are robots is equal to the percentage as a decimal 0.082 times the whole that's why we multiplied them you wanted to know about you took the percentage and divided it by the hole the whole percentage and let's see i'm not even sure if i can get this to say that that's going to be a little bit tricky means we need the hole in the numerator and the percentage in the denominator it's going to be very difficult to pull that off what i think you might have been thinking of is that if i divide both of these sides by the percentage that means that the hole if i don't know the hole i can take the part and divide it by the percentage as a decimal and it would take some work to like i'm not sure how you could manipulate this to make it so that the percentage was being divided by the whole you'd almost have to there'd be another hole in there somewhere it gets to be kind of nightmarish but that's the thing is they're all they're all variants of part divided by whole equals percentage you either multiply both sides by the whole or divide both sides by the part and then invert it and you're off like a shot hi jonas only decreased by 10. oh you mean the answer well actually the answer decreased by a factor of 10. so it's like basically what happened was we took that number and divided it by a 10 and that extra divided by 10 got showed up right here which would move the decimal over one more time it's kind of cool the way that happens i gotta do one more problem like this guys got a pencil [Music] suppose that you're dynamite fishing and at the end of the day you count up all your fish and you're like uh oh 42 were endangered oops and an emphasis on they were endangered they are now extinct whoopsie daisies and then when you count up all your fish you're like well what percentage was that and it turns out that was 15 of your catch now i don't know the whole the question is how many fish did you catch and how many non-endangered species did you wind up or how many non-endangered fish did you catch talk about it look at the equations that i just gave you above and teach i want to know how many total fish we caught and how many are not endangered well you had a lot of dynamite well it's where you light dynamite and throw it in the water and it explodes and kills lots of fish it is it was a lot of dynamite it's also a lot of illegal [Music] and also this is exactly why okay everybody can i get you back in five four three two one so we know the part that we're endangered and we know the percentage that was endangered what am i supposed to do with those numbers sam to find out how many fish i caught overall right the 42 divided by the percentage as a decimal and 42 divided by 0.15 is equal to 280 fish now what if i asked how many fish were not endangered what should i do with that number sam before i let you go 280 minus 42 which is 238. you've got 238 fish that aren't going to not get you in trouble one last thing folks actually two last things on your skill check tomorrow i'm actually going to give you these three equations on the top because i'm gonna get questions like can i use those and i'm gonna get people who the temptation to use them is just going to be too great so rather than punish you for being honest i'm just gonna put the i don't want you to use your notes but you are okay i'm gonna put these three on the top of your skill check and you can use them is that okay guys okay that sounds fair to me now a level four let me tell you what level four looks like it's a little bit crazy i'm just gonna tell you what kind of thing it is it goes like this you've got three jars filled with liquid the first one is six ounces the second one's eight ounces the third one is ten ounces the first one is five percent poison the second one is ten percent poison the third if you mix all of these jars together what percentage is poison that is a level four that is a level four that that is not exactly it it's not even about well it's not even about poison it'll be a number that's actually discrete so rounding it'll be nice about rounding okay guys do you understand there's a skill check tomorrow sweet go ahead and that's all i got for you guys let's say goodbye to the distance learners", "SmRr86Y188w": "The Multiples of Nine Are You Ready to Dance? 9 (nine) 18 (eighteen) 27 (twenty-seven)\n36

(2)", "Jth1Y8oCOg8": "hey Francis from RC review and I'm here today to talk to you about a B EC what does the BAC it stands for battery eliminator circuit and in the world of crawlers when you get a high powered servo which is kind of what we need for these crawlers I thought you need an external bc or another be easy so i'm here to talk to you about the ins and outs of a b ec so it turns out your vehicle already has a b c a b ec is used to run your receiver and your servos and in the old days in the world of nitro cars we had an external another battery pack with four sells for four double-a cells in addition to the gas and that was solely to power your electronics and because there were four 1.2 volts each for naik ads that would be four point eight volts so in the world of electric cars to duplicate that now that they have the ESC electronic speed control they said hey got some electronics here why don't we put a b ec in this thing to power the receiver and the servos so that's what we have and i'll show you right here this is the Traxxas TRX for defender so your ESC already has a B EC build it and it puts out 4.8 volts and that powers your steering servo and all your other servos and that's cool but the bc in there it's not very powerful usually 1 amp I mean a lot of these new servos powerful servos require up to 5 amps maybe a little higher so this is where the the world of external DC's comes in your whole world will become a lot more complicated the other option is just to get another ESC like a hobby wing or a castle and some of these es es have more powerful B and some of them have adjustable voltage outputs other than 4.8 volts oh the other thing before I jump into the BC is the servos run on four point eight volts but a lot of them will really run a lot better on 6.0 Walt's volts and some of the new ones that will run on 7 point 4 volts and what does that do figure it out it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna ramp up the power just like running to sell or three cell for cell on your motor that's what it does to the server the server will have a 25% 50% boost in power if you if you give it a good VEC 7 point 4 volts as long as you can handle it so the popular option for a B EC is a castle right here it's a $25.00 10 amp BC from castle right there and it's a great one it's not that expensive it's tiny few grams 5 grams and it's very reliable and it's adjustable from 4 volts to 9 volts so that's what I'm using but there's a few problems with it and a few problems BC in general one for the castle to adjust the output when you when you get it from the factory it's shipped with 4.8 volts so it's pretty good but it's not that good ok where's my good power it's not coming out so you can reprogram it but you need another module a la casa link they call it and you need and this is the crusher an IBM PC and so on this video I'll show you I had to dig up an IBM PC figure out how to boot it up and stuff and and it works so primitive this software and they don't do it for the Mac unfortunately so it's it's pretty awful now they do sell a Bluetooth interface for so you can reprogram it with your iPhone but then that is about 50 bucks so little unfortunate so couple problems to the B EC the first one is wiring you know your world is simple you connected connected out D or ESC everything's good and easy no problem do you see the wiring is a lot more complicated because there are so many options on how to do it basically the the the B the B EC itself has to be wired to the to the battery and so you have to do some some rewiring and then the BC has to power up the the receiver so you have to connect it the receiver somehow but then you're all BAC is also powering your your your receiver so you have to cut that we're a little uncomfortable but it's done so here's a the complexity on a track system x4 it's running 4.8 volts I want to run this servo at 6.00 or seven point four volts the problem is when you run it on the standard way the the servo the everything is gonna be run at 7 point 4 volts including the little service and those little servos cannot take it so that's that's a little bit of a problem so there's a special way to wire it so your only power wire powering the steering servo another problem is you're switching you lose your switching ability in in this classic formal wiring meaning as soon as you plug in the the electricity the the BC and the receiver is powered right away the the switch on my ESC doesn't work anyway or it only works on the ESC so that's a little bit of problem but it one easy way is to run at 6 volts and that that's pretty safe for the for the little server and it's got good power for the steering servo oh the steering servo what kind of power will it deliver for this one and let's say the most awesome server around is the sandbox table 10 3 300-ounce inches of torque rounds per inch a torque at 6 volts but then when you put it at 7.4 it's gonna be 404 440 that's amazing so and it makes it faster too so so there you go next video I'm going to talk about a new bc from praxis so that's 6 volts but simply yeah if I simply have a new servo so you can do this with your stock tracks of servo just add a BAC and to see if you upgraded your servo so it's not only stronger it's faster as well so I'm gonna do a interesting pair I'm gonna go 7 bolts here that goes", "qSzyUx1kClk": "okay one type of ratio that seems to come up a lot on different tests is the connection between pounds and ounces so this sprite here is a unit rate because it tells you what one unit or pound is in terms of ounces unit rates always relate something to one in some way we could reverse this and say that one ounce right this is another unit rate is equal or the same as 1/16 of a pound I just reversed these two ratios right those are both unit rates so now what we can do is ask questions like well how many pounds are in 48 ounces and I might set up a ratio table or even just a list so here for every 1 pound that's the same as 16 ounces so if I have two pounds right that would mean I have what while I'm doubling the pounds and since the other are 16 ounces for each pound it should also double the ounces that's 32 ounces and if I add another pound alright every time I add a pound I add right 16 more ounces and I would get 48 ounces and if someone was asking how many pounds are in 48 ounces you could say there's 3 pounds and the important thing is to notice the connection here that as you scale up this ratio right as you add pounds you're also adding groups of ounces and we could skip ahead we could have just instead of doing it in two steps we could have realized that okay well 16 ounces is 1 pound if I want to know what 48 ounces is I can set it up to say okay 48 divided by 16 is 3 which means 3 groups of 16 ounces go into 48 ounces which means that we'll have 1 right times 3 pounds and as our answer 3 pounds so of course we look at another way we can say all right well I look across the ratio to get from pounds to ounces I multiply by 16 but 2 to get from ounces to pounds I divide by 16 so as soon as you're given an amount of ounces you would know how many pounds you have simply by dividing by 16 so there's lots of ways to solve these problems that I hope want works for you thanks", "c_E89SWV_ZU": "welcome to our channel top 10

rear shock this should be done in about every 30 hours this is part one of this tech lesson I'll be showing how to change the oil in the front port only part two will be for the rear shock to start off we'll just need basic hand tools and then later on we'll need a few specialty tools as well the first step is to remove the front axle nut and then we'll loosen the fork pinch bolts and remove the front disc cover bolt as well now we can slide the front axle out and remove the front wheel from the bike the fort guards and the front brake caliper will need to be remove the forks next before we remove the forks from the bike we'll need to loosen the fork cap and the fork inner cartridge and so on my bike the bar mounts are in the way of getting a fork cap wrench in there to loosen the fork cap so I'll need to remove the bars and the bar mount if you have stock bar mounts you won't need to do this there's enough room to get a fork cap wrench in there to loosen the fork cap so if you do need to remove your bar mounts you'll just loosen the nuts on the bottom side and remove the damper rubbers and then the bar mounts will just slide right out of the triple clamp now that there's room for a fork cap wrench we can loosen up the inner Carthage's and the four caps after that we'll just loosen up the triple clamp bolts and remove the forks from the bike if you're having trouble getting the forks out of the triple clamps just twist the fork and it should slide right out of the clamps I'm going to be showing the process for only one fork changing the oil and the other fork is the same exact procedure before we start disassembling the forks we'll need to back out the compression and the rebound adjusters all the way and make sure to write down the amount of clickers you had in those so when we get the forks back together you can just set them back to your original setting we can start taking the forks apart so the first step is to loosen the fork cap all the way and slide down the fork tube and pour all the oil out and do a drain pan then we're going to put the fork lug into a bench vise and make sure to wrap a rag around the fork lug so it doesn't get damaged when you're tightening it in the vise we'll need the fork and a vise so we can loosen up the inner cartridge assembly so the bolt on the bottom of the fork will need to be back down once that's loose we can compress the fork and insert a wrench so it holds the cartridge out then we need to put another wrench on the lock nut and then get your socket assembly and so just turn those against each other and I'll loosen the rebound adjuster on the bottom once the bottom bolt is off the fork will need to remove the rod as well after that compress the fork again and remove the wrench so the cartridge goes back into the fork now we can remove the fork from the vise and bring it back over the bench where we will remove the inner cartridge assembly from the fork the next step is to remove the cartridge from the fork damper you'll need a fork cap wrench for this so pull the cartridge out and dump all the oil into a drain pan as you're dumping the oil out pump the damper rod and this will remove all the old oil from the damper now it's time to put new oil back in the damper the oil capacity for a 2011 is 8.3 ounces but the oil capacity for every other bike varies so make sure to check your manual to bleed all the air bubbles out of the oil pump the damper rod several times once you've done that we can insert the cartridge back into the fork damper so try to insert it at an angle so Eric escapes and to get the cap all the way down I found that it kind of helps the pump the damper rod and this will bleed out a little bit more air so just snug up the cartridge you don't have to tighten that up all the way as we'll tighten it up later to make sure the damper assembly works properly compress the damper rod and let it rebound on its own if it doesn't rebound it then there's probably air still on the damper assembly and you'll need to bleed that again now we're going to put the fork back into the vise again make sure you use a rag on the fork lug so it doesn't get damaged compress the fork so the damper rod pops out and put a wrench in there to hold it out then we can insert the rod back in the damper and install the rebound jester after that tighten the adjuster against the lock nut and then torque it to 16 foot-pounds press the fork and guide the damper rod slowly back into the fork so you don't damage the threads then tighten the center bolt down the torque specification on that is 51 foot-pounds now we can add new oil to the out or Fork the minimum oil capacity is 10 ounces if you want the fork to be a little bit stiffer you can add up to three ounces extra so the maximum capacity is 13 ounces once you've added the oil you can slide the fork tube back up and tighten the fork cap down now it's time to set your compression and rebound adjusters back to where they were before the final step before putting the fork back on the bike is this to wipe off excess oil off the outside of the fork it'll be easier to work with when it's clean so slide the fork up to your preferred for height and tighten the fork clamp bolts the torque spec on these pinch bolts is 15 foot-pounds once the forks are torqued into the clamps you could tighten up the four caps and the cartridges if you had to remove your bars and your bar mounts now it's time to reinstall those on the triple clamp next step is to brake calliper make sure you route the brake line on the inside of the fork the torque spec on the caliper bolts is now we can install the guards and a front brake line guide on to the four guard before reinstalling the front wheel make sure to grease your front axle when putting the front wheel back on the bike make sure to line up the brake rotor with the pads before you put the axle through then we're going to Snug up the front axle nut don't tighten that down all the way yet the left-side axle pinch bolts will need to be torqued the spec on those is 15 foot-pounds once those are torqued then we can tighten the four an axle nut all the way the torques back on that is 65 foot-pounds after that we can put the disc cover bolt back in to get the front forks aligned spin the front wheel and jam on the front brakes and then take the bike off the stand and compress the front forks you got to make sure the right side axle pinch bolts are loose when you're doing this last step is to torque the right side pinch bolts the spec on this is 15 foot-pounds so this is part 1 of this tech lesson make sure to click anywhere on the screen to view part 2 where we'll be changing the oil and the rear shock all right that's it for this video thanks for watching everyone", "uS1fV1443T4": "[Music] good morning and welcome back to thoughts from a dizzy dude my legs just will not hold on there we go today is Thursday November 8th 2018 good morning you can join the live shows Mondays through Fridays between 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. Central Time turn on notifications because those times will vary today I want to talk about accuracy and precision when we are measuring things what's the difference do you know do you know the difference between accuracy and precision accuracy is how correct you are at measuring something so for example I could say I am 46 years old and that's correct because less than 47 years ago I was born that's not very precise so precision is how specific you are in your measurements hold on a second had a little glitch so if I said I am 46 years 11 months and two days old that's more precise it's not more accurate it's just more precise it's not wrong to say that I'm 46 years old so when we measure things this comes into play we have to consider how precise do you need your measurement to be and then you'll be able to select the appropriate tool for example I have these scales here this scale they're both set two ounces whoops this one turned off they're both set two ounces but this one zero this one has more decimal places so I can measure more precisely the mass of something or the weight of something on this smaller scale than I can on the bigger scale so let's just see how that works I'm then measure the mass of my phone in ounces and according to this scale it's six point eight ounces now if I wanted to know if that was accurate I would try it with several different scales and hopefully I would get the same the same measurement every time all right so let's try it on this other scale now bit so we can see that I have more information now more precise information my phone is six point nine four ounces over here all I know is that it was six point sorry it was six point nine ounces it's got my stuff as a chance to do there we go six point nine ounces six point nine four ounces so this one is more precise than this one now they both gave me the same results within their level of precision so I can feel pretty good that this is accurate now if I really wanted to make sure I would try two or three different ones but I've used both of these scales before so I know that they have accurate readings um you'll also notice this on some rook devices for measuring a length so let me show you this ruler it's a little tricky to see because the ruler is clear but if you look the ruler it has is broken up into 16 so I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 so this can measure to a precision of 1/16 of an inch all right this one is not as precise this one we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 markers so this one is precise to 1/8 of an inch depending on what you're doing that may be okay but you may need something more precise you can get rulers that are broken down into 1/32 of an inch for ultra precision so that's the difference between accuracy and precision now for accuracy I want to show you the number one mistake people make when they are using a ruler which causes them to get an inaccurate measurements now let me show you this ruler again you'll notice that the zero on this ruler is not at the end of the ruler so if I want to measure this book and I put the end of the ruler at the end of the I will not get an accurate measurement it's because I'm not using the tool correctly okay so I have to slide this over so that the wine I mean size of the zero is lined up with the edge and then this ruler tells me that my book is eight and what eight and a half eight and a half inches now with that measurement I could have gotten the same level of accuracy using the other one right because that that would give me a half as well so whether so what level of precision you need really depends completely on what your purpose is in measuring if you're trying to fit together pieces of of a cabinet that you're building then the more precise you are the better right if you're just you know saying oh it's about a mile down the road that's fine too so that's the difference between accuracy and precision and now I'm just babbling because I lost my train of thought okay so it's Thursday that means that tonight is orbit at a tilt 7 p.m. Central Time I will be talking about the Kepler space telescope since I didn't get to do that last week as you know Kepler has been retired it is in an orbit safely away from Earth and it will just sit out there until somebody decides go get it I guess so tune in tonight 7 p.m. central time for orbit out of tilt if I don't see you then I will see you again tomorrow for thoughts from a dizzy dude and until I see you again have a great day [Music] you", "OF-EoyGkT1M": "what is up guys you remember scallop in the building in hope you having a wonderful day I am having a good day myself it's just really really cold outside before starting the video I want to thank you so much for all the support you guys have been giving me this past few weeks I can't thank you guys enough I've said this before but I want to say it again because I can't thank you guys enough for all the support what that said let's get right into the video in today's video I'm gonna do a follow-up on the mod pack for the Xbox controller a lot of people have been messaging me asking me to do a video on the mods itself the mod target cell already comes with a mods that already included into here but you can opt for more and do an upgrade for $15.99 a year and you can get all this like upgrade their versions of it for example you can have a pack for tonight you can have a pack for call duty black ops war for black ops 3 all these other games I'll have that link down the description if you are interested in on buying a subscription it's done description out there so if you're wanting that you can go ahead and get it I personally really won't get it myself just because I don't really have the drive to go and buy it because I don't really use the mods but for the sake of this video I have used them in a private match no worries and I've come to the conclusion that yes they are good but they have a delay I'll show you guys more in detail what I mean by that let me start by telling you guys the a mods that already comes in the mod pack itself so you actually have an idea of what I'm talking about I'm gonna go ahead and read them by order because that's how there are preset on the mod pack so number one is primary weapon fire so that pretty much rapid fire for your primary the number two it represented us Tabo anti recoil so you can pretty much have less recoil if you're on seven three number four quickscope pretty much what it tell is it that's what it tells you a quick scopes it doesn't do the kills for you if that's what you thinking it's just quick scopes if that makes sense like looks in today aiming that that's all so number five outer run auto run so pretty much you can run without pressing them that on the analog stick and you can keep on going am i explaining details just been a bit more number six it's drop shot so pretty much you press a button and automatically it will like go down and once you hit prone it will start shooting until you let go over the button number seven left paddle mode pretty much you can do whatever you like with this one where you can do its instead of using your an X B Y a buttons you can pretty much set them to that and it does wrap your call pulsefire optimized rapid-fire optimized jitter drop shot reload and slide ec a double jump adjustable button turbo 2.0 jitter tech jitters and all those things and same thing goes for the right one it just depends on which panel you want to use but both of them you can set them up and to do whichever one you like so let's go ahead and get a closer look on the controller that way I can show you guys better and explain you what it actually means to do all this here we have the expert controller now that the guys glow on white is on tournament mode now you hold the left button and then the right one at the same time for five seconds in the eyes should go green instead of white and now you're on mod mode now we look at the top there's a little squares on the top each indicates each mod so pretty much if you want if I want to use the first mod which is rapid fire for the first primary gun you hold the left on the d-pad and then it should glide up after that's done if you want to use the first mod you click Y and it should Rumble now you have that on there if you want to use primary in secondary you use same thing as before you hold the left on the d-pad as you vibrate and then you press X to go to the next mod and then you press Y to confirm now you have rapid fire for your primary in your secondary now if you want outer run on the controller pretty much you do the same process you hold left on the d-pad and then you click X till you go to v one v one will light green the first four are white and then the second ones are green and then Y to confirm and now you have rapid fire for your primary secondary in auto run now to show you guys the rapid fire for the primary and secondary I have the K in no more speed in the sprite and almost beat you it's a pull now let's get the rep fire for the primary and then secondary pretty much hold it back the one the back and then left from d-pad should light up and then and then there you go now we have first in secondary rapid-fire now secondary see how I'm just shooting not trigger pulsing or anything like that and just shooting it now if you want to set up quick sculptor and drop shot or any anything else pretty much the same thing as before hold it one in the bag left on the d-pad and then press X you see which where you want to go the three it's for anti recoil for its quick scope five it's our one six its drop shot now you should have rapid fire for your primary secondary and then you should also have quick scope out of one and drop shot for the other run just press on the a little analog stick and then you run before you have to push down and go but now just push in ill run now drop shot you can either program your paddles in the back or press B now for a quick scope pretty much press left on the trigger and I'll shoot for you and aim shoot an aim shoot an aim now if you no longer want any of the mods onto your controller you pretty much press down on the teeth on the d-pad and then the lights will flash green press Y and then the option button or start and - all clear out now if you want to go back to normal mode you pretty much hold left and then right button on the back for five seconds at

slick and try to make me laugh is well hey we're trying to make the red velvet brownies that Beth me for my birthday so I'm so excited because we already have everything bober already melted the butter and the four ounce but um chocolate bar which is a ghirardelli's that we got it's like the bittersweet so like bittersweet chocolate baking bars and just chop it up put it in the bowl and then melt it with 350 4 cups of cups of water so it's all here so it's all pretty and smells so good so go ahead and whisk it and then what we're going to do is go ahead and whisk in the sugar if I can do this I'm not sure what the sugar is two cups of sugar give me some  sugar so we're just whisking in I don't know how bet does this like so easily without making full on mistakes like I do so I'm just going to whisk it whisk it in hopeful my brain is perfectly we're making mud pies so make these when I was a key so we're whisking this in and after this it's going to be the four eggs one at a time people you think this is good enough how long have you have to beat it not that much just whisk it in ok Oxford is a loser I'm sorry risk it and whisk it in ok all right and then the four eggs see if I can do this with what just one use your spoon no see I have to whisk it in there's one egg crack Oh fall before this would be an epic fail one can't put the ACL while you was I could yeah I want to be just like bet she does it with one hand I watched her video bet it's fun watching them I wanted to make sure I did it all correctly make up the yolk wreck on the gooey stuff done liked it Oh Martha hurting okay ladies removal wisdom egg number four he said so like me because I don't like eggs I wonder if we can use a blender with this hang in there you go to good job work out my arms fruity he should do this she just said that said that on my phone sorry sorry be careful okay so all right what's next what's sexy if you guys can see I have my recipe right there gently stir in flour and next four degrees okay dates are not like you seem a little it will hang in the butt just saying she's me naughty back there alright so the next thing is go ahead and gently stir in flour goodness so it's a flower is one-and-a-half teaspoons and I'm going to put it at the bottom if I forget to give either the actual ingredients one and a half wat one and a half cups almost like I'm like that's more than to wanted a half teaspoon I know right water juice postponed oh because it says start okay it's not whisk stir okay I'll just add some fine so we have this we're just like stirring wonder if we stir gently stir in flour and X 4 ingredients should I put on homework all ingredients what's the next morning reading next four ingredients is one-and-a-half teaspoons of baking powder 1 ounce or one bottle of red food coloring one taking a teaspoon of vanilla extract and an eighth of this teaspoon of salt hey you might as well put anything right now okay hopefully that's always supposed to be done Oh flanged if my lab done all this there and all right what does that bacon colic this is taking powder people how much was that one teaspoon and then this is half a teaspoon of baking powder okay okay and then after but I don't have an eighth of a teaspoon of salt so hopefully I can't do this without where is the salt it's rather my goodness trigger so I'm just going to put a pinch of salt don't mind me how much is it its eighth that's too much okay that's enough now you can have two legs right we are ghetto as hell I'm ghetto as hell right now so ghetto food tastes the best and then he's just screw it up okay I need to take one teaspoon of vanilla extract this is new have to open it so excuse me while I do it I know that it's all clumping in there so this is intermission is like a commercially okay so gotta go pee yes it's one teaspoon of vanilla extract so I'm gonna do what that does oh crap she puts a whole ton a ton of vanilla in there so let's go ahead and put this whole bottle of food coloring Canelo smells good it does i put too much I think whoops you only do that with liquor oh yeah and liquor to food I know right like that rum cake I made for Christmas but you didn't get to taste did you I didn't get to taste because I was sick look at that pretty take your spoon might be tones and colors to what your spoon might change colors now oh crap really just my let me see if it's going to look like you cut your finger off all right so I'm going to put you guys on a break here and then I'm gonna just stir this up and make sure it's all creamy to put in the pan hopefully it did everything we're not going to put the up the frosting on here we're just going to do regular brownies so what you guys on break for a second all right Logan's gonna get it anyways so Audrey was nice enough and yes we're back roger was nice enough to go ahead and stir it for me and we have a 9-inch pan that that we have foiled and make sure that the it's foiled two to three inches to extend over the sides so it's like this and that basically you're just going to pull the farming on the brownies out cool to it so it cools and everything so I'm just going to pour this beautiful red it's pretty isn't it yes which I was pour it in here can you see I see you didn't have to spray the foil I really did oh you don't have to you don't have to but I like to lightly it should be lightly greased hold you drizzle I put pen so Roy Clark could use this break 10 use quickens right yeah it's a regular of cooking spray are you just like over my shoulder you want to lick the bowl moni you don't do that you just don't want to taste it oh I did that isn't it pretty that okay so we're just going to put it in a 350-degree oven and we'll let it sit for about 40 44 48 minutes okay all right so so so let's just put it in and we'll see little fortune read hey everybody we're back so it we took about 4 to 4 minutes and it looks like it's done kind of cracked a little bit around the edges but I guess that's how brownies is we put a hole in it and it's ripped it looks like it's ready so we're not going to wait for two hours like that the people said but you have to wait two hours some of the cools and everything but we're just impatient people and get old people here so we're just going to cut it and everything and his brother didn't came at the right time what the problem is it was about ready to be done we're going to go ahead and cut it I'm going to try to take a picture with it and Lee it comes I really like how that didn't in her if it's not like this it's an epic fail yes it is so I would catch you guys all later and I will let you guys know how it is soon all right you", "5qfOkmUAfNQ": "hello my name is Maria wheeler from Matt Montcalm and this is mathie my assistant and mascot in this lesson we're going to study measuring in each ease to the nearest 1/8 inch and also measuring in centimeters and millimeters and I intend this lesson for about third or fourth grade level ok so children have already been measuring at least in ho centimeters and maybe knit to the nearest 1/4 inch before this and here I drew a really big ruler this ruler is for measuring to the nearest 1/4 inch and let's see what it has these numbers signify the whole inches from here here would be one whole each and the blue marks signify the half inch marks so from here to here is 1/2 inch then from here all the way to here is one and a half inches right and then the green little tick marks are for the 1/4 inch increments so from here to here is 1/4 inch from here to here is 1/2 inch but it is also to thoughts of an inch and then from here to here is 3/4 of an inch so this red line here actually measures exactly 3/4 of an inch like that now let us practice a little I will extend this 3/4 of an inch line a little longer and let's see how long it becomes let's see I drove up till here now how long is it can you tell there's one whole inch up till here then 1/4 of an inch so now it is 1 and 1/4 inches and let's make it all the way here how long is it now ok we go past the 2 inch mark so it is 2 inches and the blue mark is the half inch mark 2 and 1/2 one more over there how long is it now we will have three inches and then over here three fourths right 3 and 3/4 inches now in this ruler we have the same marks as here the blue marks are the half inch marks and then the green ones are the 1/4 inch marks 1/4 and then then 3/4 so and then I've added one tick mark in between each that was there now we have a rule that measures to the nearest 1/8 inch okay this inch here is divided into eight parts now so therefore each little increment is 1/8 of an inch okay this distance here would be 1/8 of an inch and from here the view is two eighths of an inch which at the same time is also 1/4 of an inch and from here to here would be 3/8 of an inch from here to here is four eighths or 1/2 and from here 3/8 5/8 that's my redline 5/8 of an inch and so 6/8 and 7/8 and then eight eighths or one whole each okay let's do the same I'll draw a few lines let's say we have a line up to Leah can you tell how long it is there one inch and then this little increment is running one and one eighth of an H let's say it goes over here we have one inch then the green mark here it was for the 1/4 inch increments so we have 1/4 1/4 1/4 or 3/4 1 and 3/4 inches and how about one more over there now we go past the two inch mark so there's 2 inches here and then you can count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7/8 of an inch all you can notice that it is the last tick mark before the three inches and these tick marks were for the one eight inches so it must be 7 8 2 and 7/8 inches okay also on children to learn to measure in centimeters and millimeters so this ruler is for that and this of course hope centimeters of course this is drawn to a much bigger scale than in real life okay but it is so that you can see it on the video clearly these are marks for the hole centimeters then this little thing is here of all the millimeters there's ten little millimeters in each centimeter remember that ten millimeters in one centimeter let me write that down one centimeter is equal to ten millimeters millimeters the millimeters are the tiny things here let's see my line here how long is it it has two hole centimeters it goes past two centimeter mark then a little bit further how many little tick marks one two and three so this line is 2 centimeters three millimeters flow you have to write it like that two centimeters three millimeters or you could also write it in whole millimeters because here would be 10 millimeters is another 10 total 20 and then three more that is also equal to 23 millimeters let me continue it a little bit and let's measure another line here up till here can you see how long is it can you measure with this ruler we go past 4 centimeters so it's 4 centimeters and then we need to check these little marks I'm going to now check how many little marks it is missing from the next hole centimeter that's too little too little millimeters lacking so to speak from 5 centimeters so that must be 8 here 4 centimeters 8 millimeters okay which is also 48 milli meters remember each one of these is ten millimeters 10 20 30 40 and 848 millimeters and of course students need to practice this by measuring lines measuring objects so they become familiar with both kinds of measuring both kinds of rulers but now let's go on I don't Mattie here what do you think Massie did I enjoy the well this is pretty well okay and we're going to measure how long message picture is and students might enjoy this exercise still if they draw if they sketch the favorite stuffed animal and then measure how long it is I'll just measure the animal without drawing it okay I'm going to use this ruler and first measure in inches let's just measure the longest distance I can find from the tip of the tail till the tasks okay you may not be able to see it but it is eleven and a half inches let's make a masse also in centimeters and millimeters my roller here actually doesn't Mark the millimeters it is max centimeters and 1/2 centimeters but let's try six twenty nine and a half or it would be twenty nine centimeters five millimeters about and you can do the same with your stuff then then draw a line that is these lengths but before before I draw it with the ruler I'm going to estimate I'm going to guess and when sometimes it's kind of estimate how long would it be anything it would be from here to know maybe here that's my guess 4 8 and 1/4 inches but now I'm going to draw it exactly okay my guess is way too long I guessed a little bit over 10 inches 10 and a half inches in reality I have to go to 8 and then 1/4 inch there that's how long it is in reality let me do the same with this let me first guess how long will it be 32 centimeters and 5 millimeters I don't know maybe over there now let me check draw it exactly oh I got it really close uncle didn't it - just a little bit longer would open is 32 centimeters five millimeters and lastly we will practice a little bit converting between centimeters and millimeters here five centimetres to millimetres how many millimeters is it to simply remember that each centimeter is ten millimeters so he has 50 millimeters and two more so 52 and here 21 centimeters okay each centimeter is 10 millimeters so I multiply this times 10 I get 210 millimeters and then seven more in fact it is very easy I'll just copy these digits to 1/7 over there as a shortcut but now the other way 18 millimeters many centimeters is it and maybe millimeters leftover this is easy because each 10 millimeters makes a centimeter so we have here 8 centimeters and then 72 millimeters while 70 millimeters is exactly 7 centimeters and then the 2 millimeters are left over so to speak and similarly here 245 millimeters 240 millimeters is exactly 24 centimeters and here's 5 millimeters oh that is easy I hope this video was also helpful", "scDfrVqB6o8": "                                                                                                   ", "QOdlR7r6IrY": "hey grandma five hope you guys are all doing really well so today's lesson is going to be pretty darn easy so let's go ahead and get it started hopefully right now you've done your mental math warmup your facts practice and you're ready to rock and roll okay so all we're gonna talk about today is volume make sure that you do this problem-solving question because really that's like a precursor we're going to talk about today so volume of an object is the amount of space the object occupies so we're gonna be talking about geometric figures on geometric solids so those would be a cubes spheres cones cylinders pyramids and combination of these shapes but today we're just talking about rectangular solids so let's go ahead and then rectangular solids the units we use to measure are called cubic units and either they're cubic centimeter which is this guy right here or a cubic inch which is much larger so we know that volume is super-important the volume of a cube equals the number of 1-inch cubes needed to build the larger cube so this cube is really a composition of a much smaller much smaller cubes all built together so here we have 8 total cubes that make up 8 cubic inches we know we have 2 on the bottom row we have 2 on the top row then we have 2 on the vertical row and so to find this multiplying we go 2 times 2 times 2 or 2 inches by 2 inches by 2 inches which is gonna give us eight total 1-inch cubes so let's go ahead and find the volume of this rectangular solid we know that it is three-dimensional and it's got three pieces of information here we know that the width is gonna be 3 centimeters because it is three blocks or three cubic units wide we know also the width here um it's gonna be two cubic centimeters or two centimeters we'll just say and then the height is two centimeters so since the solid has two layers we know that we're gonna multiply three times two times two for a total of twelve cubic centimeters altogether so then let's look at this one right here where it's not as easy when it doesn't have the cubes already drawn in there for you but there's pieces of information here that we need to know we know that it is 4 inches long which means that there are gonna be four lines here to represent four inches we know that it is two inches wide which again is gonna be cut down the middle so there are two blocks here or two cubes and then we know that is three inches high which is gonna be three inches wide or tall so in order for us to find then how many total cubic how many cubes are in this we're just gonna multiply four times two times three which is a total of 24 cubic inches all right let's look at example three says as dianna eat breakfast he estimated the volume of the cereal box what is the approximate volume of the box all so let's just go ahead and acknowledge that this cereal box is called sacks and o's i wonder if when they came up with this if they were all patting each other on the back for being super creative all right so let's go ahead and find out so we're gonna round the length width and height to the nearest inch 12 and 1/8 inches rounds to 12 seven and seven eight inches rounds to eight two and three-quarters rounds to three so then we're just gonna multiply each of these numbers we're gonna multiply 12 by 8 by 3 and when you multiply 12 by 8 by 3 you get 288 cubic inches all right guys go ahead and practice this on your lesson practice make sure you get checked off also acknowledge sacks and saltines right here waiting for you also I love saltine crackers I prefer salted over unsalted and that's that guys that you should after you do your lesson practice do your mix practice and then have an awesome day and looking forward to checking in with you guys on Thursday okay bye guys", "ks8SaSqSxVs": "to find the coordinates of the point dividing the line joining two points in internally in the given ratio the line joining the two points a x one y one and b

No matter what you\u2019re doing, you have\ndozens of suitable chamberings to chose from, and ammo companies and wildcatters are always\ncoming up with new ones. Shotguns stand in stark contrast to this.\nThe number of gauges in common use has only decreased over the years, and now, there\u2019s\njust a handful of bore sizes to chose from; most of which have fairly well-established\nniches. This makes selecting a chambering and finding\nammunition for your shotgun quite an easy matter compared to most other long guns.\nHowever, there is one wrinkle here; the matter of shell length. Unlike most modern rifle\nchamberings, shotshells of the same gauge come in a variety of different lengths, and\nmost shotguns are able to accept multiple shell lengths.\nIf you\u2019re getting into shotguns, it\u2019s important to understand what shell length\nis, what lengths are available in your gauge, and what lengths your shotgun can and cannot\nhandle. Let\u2019s get one very important distinction\nout of the way right off the bat. A shell\u2019s length refers to its overall length in its fired state. This can cause some confusion, since the mouths\nof shotshells are usually folded or rolled over - a process called crimping - in order\nto contain the payload. Crimping a shotshell results in a shorter\noverall length prior to firing - though exactly how much shorter varies depending on the nature\nof the crimp. While unfired length and crimp types are worth\ndiscussing - and will be discussed in another video - it\u2019s the unfolded or fired length\nthat\u2019s the standard length measurement for shotshells.\nIt\u2019s what the number printed on the shell or packaging is referring to, and when someone\nmentions a shell\u2019s length, they almost always mean the fired length.\nThe reason for this is that a shotshell\u2019s payload needs to have an unrestricted path\nas it moves out of the mouth of the hull, through the forcing cone, and into the barrel\u2019s\nbore. Whatever its crimped length is, if the shell\nis longer than the chamber in its open, unfolded state, the end of the hull will extend into\nthe forcing cone, and create a constriction that the payload is forced to squeeze through. Shotshells have relatively low peak pressure limits, and use fast-burning propellants,\nso even minor obstructions like this can easily cause pressures to spike beyond what the barrel\nand action are designed to contain. Patterns and function will likely suffer,\nand repeated use of overly-long shotshells can damage or even destroy a shotgun.\nTherefore, you should be aware of how long your shotgun\u2019s chamber is, and not use any\nshells longer than that. But as you may have already noticed, because\na shotshell can be significantly shorter when it\u2019s crimped, it may seem to fit in a chamber\nthat\u2019s actually too short to fire it safely. So, don\u2019t assume that a shell is safe to\nuse just because it chambers; always confirm a barrel\u2019s actual chamber length before\nselecting shells for use in it. Shotgun barrels should be engraved with their\nchamber length, somewhere - refer to this over any markings elsewhere on the gun, as\nmany shotgun designs allow the barrel to be easily replaced or changed. On the other hand, as you may have already known or guessed, a shell that\u2019s shorter\nthan the chamber is not a problem, because the payload still has a clear path. Like many common revolver cartridges, standard shotshells have little to no taper, and headspace\non their rims. So, just as a .357 Magnum revolver can also chamber and fire shorter .38 Special\ncartridges, a shotgun with a 3\u201d-long chamber can also safely fire 2 \u00be\u201d and shorter shells. And as with magnum and parent revolver rounds, in cases where one shotshell length has an\nincreased maximum working pressure, it is also longer than other shells of the same\nbore size; so a gun built for a longer, higher-pressure shell will also be strong enough for anything\nshorter. The fact that shotgun chambers can shoot shorter\nshells, but not longer ones, is also why fired shells will sometimes come in below their\nadvertised length if you actually measure them. Length tolerances for shotshells allow for little - if any - extra length, but a very large amount of slop is permitted in the other direction. Therefore, ammo companies can choose to aim a little low when manufacturing hulls. A slightly\nshort hull is no problem as long as the intended payload still fits, and it\u2019s a cheap and\neasy way to ensure that the shell won\u2019t be over spec. Alright, but why are there different shell lengths anyway? Well, the primary reason for different-length shells is to accommodate different payloads. A longer shell provides more space for heavier shot & powder charges, large pellet sizes,\nand/or lower-density shot materials. It\u2019s worth mentioning that there\u2019s no\nreason a small amount of shot can\u2019t be loaded into a long shell by using a taller wad or\nlightweight fillers to take up the extra space. However, to use a longer shell, you need a\nlonger, heavier chamber; and for repeating shotguns, a longer & heavier action as well. Heavy magnum loads are unnecessary for many shotgunning activities, and for guns intended\nfor these lighter applications, shorter chambers and actions can significantly reduce bulk\nand weight. Thus, ammo manufacturers prefer to use shorter\nshells for lighter payloads, so that their product can be used in both lightweight and\nmagnum shotguns of the same gauge. So, let\u2019s talk about what lengths are out\nthere for the various gauges. Most of the currently-used shotgun shell sizes\ncome in just a handful of standard lengths, but there are also many less-common shell\nlengths that you may run into. It\u2019s good to be aware of the different shell\nand chamber lengths and their capabilities, so that you can better choose a gun and ammo\nthat meet your specific needs. Easily the widest variety of shell lengths\nhave been made for the long-popular 12ga. However, the majority of 12ga shotshells these\ndays are 2 \u00be or 3 inches in length. Most current & recent-production 12ga shotguns\nhave either 2 \u00be\u201d or 3\u201d chambers, though the more versatile 3\u201d chambers seem to have\nbecome the standard these days. A 3\u201d 12ga chamber will allow you to shoot\nshells containing anywhere from \u00be of an ounce to 2 ounces of shot, as well as nearly any\n12ga slug load. For most folks, this range will cover anything\nthey would realistically need to do with a shotgun. But, there\u2019s always someone who\nwants something bigger. The 3 \u00bd\u201d 12ga super magnum provides significantly\nmore space and a higher peak pressure limit than other 12ga chamberings.\nIn anticipation of the upcoming ban on lead shot for waterfowl hunting, it was introduced\nin the late 1980s to provide improved performance with low-density steel shot, which was the\nonly nontoxic option at the time. It\u2019s still commonly used for steel, but\nits extra space and higher pressure also allow it to launch more than two ounces of lead\nand other high-density shot for things like turkey & buckshot hunting.\nIt can certainly be argued that such heavy payloads rarely offer enough benefit to justify\ntheir ferocious recoil, but since a 3 \u00bd\u201d 12ga chamber will also shoot any shorter 12ga\nshells, it is undeniably an extremely versatile option, even though super magnum guns are\ngenerally less-than-ideal for applications that call for lighter loads. 2 \u00bd\u201d-chambered 12ga guns were popular for a long time, especially in Europe, and since\nmany of these older guns are still in use, a number of companies offer a range of 2 \u00bd\u201d\n12ga shotshells. Similarly, 2 5/8\u201d shells & chambers were\ncommon in the early-to-mid 1900s in North America. Some loads still use this length,\nbut you\u2019ll likely have an easier time finding 2 \u00bd\u201d shells, especially in the US. Other lengths have been produced specifically for unusual specialty shotguns, such as the\ntwo-inch 12ga shells used in some ultra-light British doubles, or the 60mm shells sized\nfor the box magazines of the Techno Arms Mag-7. If you\u2019re interested, Ian at Forgotten Weapons\nrecently posted a video on the Mag-7 shotgun that\u2019s worth checking out. Various other short 12ga shells have also been offered; but I\u2019ll talk more about short\nshells a little later. The once-popular 10ga has seen a fair number\nof shell lengths as well, but 2 7/8\u201d and 3 \u00bd\u201d eventually became the two common ones.\nHowever, the former has pretty much faded from use, as the 10ga has long since been\ndisplaced as a general-purpose bore size. If you can find them, a handful of light 2\n7/8\u201d 10ga shells are still made for use in older guns, but modern 12ga or 20ga loads\ncan easily match or surpass the payloads in these old-fashioned, low-pressure shells - while\nalso benefitting from modern performance-boosting shotshell tech. The spacious 3 \u00bd\u201d 10ga magnums are about the only thing that\u2019s kept this old bore\nsize out of obsolescence. 3 \u00bd\u201d chambers are the norm for the few 10ga shotguns still\nbeing produced, and pretty much all 10ga shotshells from major manufacturers are 3 \u00bd\u201d. Going back down to something more popular, the 20ga has seen its own share of shell & chamber\nlengths over the years. In the early 20th century, the standard 20ga\nshell length was 2 \u00bd\u201d, but as with the 12ga, 2 \u00be\u201d and 3\u201d chambers eventually\nbecame the current norm, with 3\u201d chambers becoming increasingly prevalent in order to\ngive shooters the option of slightly heavier payloads. 20ga shotshells are widely available in both lengths, and a number of ammo companies also\nstill produce 2 \u00bd\u201d shells for older guns with shorter chambers. With the neglected 16ga, you\u2019re looking at 2 \u00bd\u201d or 2 \u00be\u201d shells these days. Either\nshell length can accommodate a payload range that\u2019s very nearly the equivalent of the\ncombined 2 \u00be & 3\u201d 20ga. 2 9/16\u201d hulls and chambers used to be the\nstandard for the 16ga, and remained common up until the mid-20th century, but these shells\nare tough to find nowadays. Many 2 9/16\u201d chambers can be safely lengthened to 2 \u00be\u201d,\nbut some repeating shotguns might not cycle the longer shells reliably without further\nmodifications. For these guns, 2 \u00bd\u201d shells may be a better\nchoice. Some older 16ga shotguns were manufactured\nwith 3\u201d chambers, and for a time, ammo manufacturers offered both loaded and empty 3\u201d and 2 7/8\u201d shells for use in them. However, these weren't magnum shells intended for heavier payloads; the extra space was instead used for a longer wad column. This was apparently something of a fad at the time with the three popular mid-size bores.\nSome shotgunners believed that the extra wadding improved patterns by creating a better gas\nseal, and providing more cushion for the shot. Whatever the actual benefit, the idea eventually went out of vogue, and while the 3\u201d 12 & 20 gauges found success later on as magnum chamberings, the 3\u201d 16ga was forgotten. With the little 28ga, the most common chamber\n& shell length is 2 \u00be\u201d, though 2 \u00bd\u201d 28ga hulls with lighter payloads were popular\nvery early on, and 2 \u00bd\u201d shells are still being manufactured for low-recoil shooting,\nor use in older guns. 2 7/8\u201d 28ga shells were used for heavier\nshot payloads in days past, but with modern propellants and components, a 2 \u00be\u201d 28ga\nshell can now hold up to one ounce of lead shot. However, \u00be of an ounce still seems\nto be the sweet spot for this little shell, and the lightweight guns that fire it. The idea of a 3\u201d shell seems to get tossed around every so often, and a few 28ga shotguns have even been manufactured with anticipatory 3\" chambers. Personally, I can\u2019t think of any good reason for a 3\u201d 28ga; it won\u2019t fit in the 28ga\nshotguns that folks already own, and it won\u2019t do anything that the more popular 20ga couldn\u2019t\ndo better. With the diminutive .410, the common shell\nlengths are the 2 \u00bd\u201d standard, and the 3\u201d magnum, though \"magnum\" here is really\nonly a relative term. .410 shotshells as short as 2\u201d have been\nused in some older shotguns, as well as converted military rifles such as the Ishapore Lee-Enfield conversions used in India - although those guns used shells formed from rifle cartridges, which is actually something you can do with the .410. There\u2019s another good Forgotten Weapons video with details and history on these Ishapores\nthat I\u2019d recommend checking out. If you have a .410 with a short chamber, 2\u201d\nshotshells are still offered by some manufacturers. Reaming out a short chamber for the more common\n2 \u00bd\u201d shells is often possible, as well. Looking at some rarer bore sizes for a minute,\nshells for the now-obsolete 8-gauge ranged from 3\u201d to 4 \u00bc\u201d in length. Loaded 8ga shells are neither cheap nor easy to find; but if you reload, the currently-produced\n3 \u00bc\u201d industrial 8ga hulls can be modified for use in shotguns, or you can buy 8ga brass\ncases in a variety of lengths. What limited ammo is currently manufactured\nfor the 24 & 32 gauges seems to be mostly 2 \u00bd\u201d, but I have heard of 2 \u00be and 2\u201d\n24-gauge shells as well. Shotguns chambered for the latter would probably require handloads\nor custom ammo. In addition to what I\u2019ve talked about here,\nplenty of other less-common shell lengths have existed at one time or another for the\nvarious gauges, especially if you look back at the early days of cartridge shotguns, when\nthings were far less standardized. But even today, most shotgunners will come\nacross unusual shell lengths - either on the internet, or store shelves. As I mentioned earlier with the 12ga; most nonstandard-length shotshells manufactured these days are short shells containing light or specialty payloads. It\u2019s also fairly easy for handloaders to cut standard hulls down and load their own\nshort shells to feed older guns, or get more reloads out of a hull. Powder companies have\neven published load data for popular 2 \u00be\u201d target hulls cut down to 2 \u00bd or 2\u201d lengths. When loaded with shot or slugs, these special short shells often appeal to owners of tube-fed\nrepeating shotguns, since the reduced length can allow for a significant jump in capacity.\nIt\u2019s an attractive idea, but repeaters designed for standard-length shells can have trouble\nfeeding or ejecting short rounds with complete reliability. This is most likely to be the case with extremely-short mini-shells below 2\u201d in length. Less extreme short shells will often function properly however, and while they may not double\ncapacity, they can still provide an extra shot or two over standard-length ammo. Mini shells are also marketed as having very low recoil, due to their lighter-than-typical\npayloads. While not untrue, if light recoil is the primary\ngoal, there\u2019s no reason similar light shot charges can\u2019t be loaded into shells that\nare long enough to function reliably. As I mentioned earlier, all that\u2019s needed is\na tall wad to take up the unused space. Shells that are longer than normal are much\nless common than short shells, but they were and are out there.\nCurrent examples include the 3 \u00bd\u201d 20ga developed as a dedicated slug chambering for single-shot guns with rifled barrels; and the high-pressure \u201c12 Gauge from Hell\u201d\nwildcat that uses custom-turned brass hulls, or blown-out & re-rimmed .50 BMG rifle cases. Since they require custom-made or specially-modified shotguns with long chambers, you\u2019ll rarely\n- if ever - see these long shells for sale in gun shops. They\u2019re almost always home-made or custom-made shells intended for very specific purposes. Well, I\u2019ve talked about shell length for nearly 15 minutes at this point. If you\u2019re still awake, hopefully you have a good understanding of what shell length\nrepresents, and what lengths you can safely use in your gun\u2019s chamber.\nIf you don\u2019t have a shotgun yet, and you\u2019re watching this series to learn some basics\nand figure out which gauge and chamber length best meets your needs, good for you. You\u2019re\ngoing to be much better off than the vast majority of first-time shotgun buyers. Please don\u2019t hesitate to leave a comment if you have questions or feedback, or if you\nwant to mention or discuss some old or unusual shell length that I didn\u2019t include here.  I\u2019m always interested in hearing about new ones. Until next time, please shoot safely and responsibly, and help promote and protect our shooting\nhobby by educating others about it. Help!

the product opening I am going to be opening a plain packaging sativa this one caught my eye because not showing any of the normal brands I'm gonna guess this is kind of like the Sobeys quote-unquote no-name brand that is actually just a Sobeys brand today is April the 1st and no you're not gonna have to concern yourself with an April Fool's joke from me so as we see on here right off of the jump it was um packaged March 22nd that was only a couple of days ago that is actually the first one that I've gotten so quick after it's been packaged most of them are a couple of weeks if not longer so OOP there it is right there it's tweed I didn't even notice that until right now so plain packaging comes from tweet all right so onto the getting your open so once we pull the top off and again tweet has a cover over top which means we probably don't have to worry about it being too dry and last days put it in the package completely dry that is alright so I ripped that cover off immediately I had a wonderful smell not all of them smell that great but this one most definitely did and I forgot to zero that if you haven't noticed from some of my other videos this scale is finicky sometimes it wants to work sometimes it doesn't sometimes it wants to recognize my input pushing the button sometimes it doesn't anyway so I'm pulling this out we're gonna give it a bit of a lock first looking pretty nice and squeeze test so initial squeeze nothing is coming off of it it's just kind of compacting it a bit more running it through the fingers it's kind of breaking apart but it more kind of tries to bunch up so again I'd have to say this is probably pretty close to the exact optimal dryness that you would actually want at least me this is what I would prefer it's not too damp it's not too dry it'll definitely bust up real nice once I get it in my grinder so onto the taking out of the actual buds in here mmm [Music] then we'll see if she weighs out if she's on nurse she's over you know that kind of stuff isn't getting to the bottom of the buds are getting tiny but they're still buds outside of the very first one I bought I unfortunately into a video one from tweed I hadn't found that they've been moving a lot of stem with their product either which is a very good thing over the first time I bought one and it was legitimately just there one gram option it was well fire more stem and I was happy with so we pulled it all out so all the buds at least and put it on the scale as we see we are at three point three these are a couple of buds I suppose I'll toss those in two didn't seem as though it made it much of a difference at all so it's still sticking that three point three let me grab here we go so I guess there is a couple of tiny tiny super tiny buds and that shake if you want to consider that is buds but I don't however as you see as soon as that shake went on it went right to wait which again perfect this is what I would expect bare minimum some of them have been doing a couple of points I mean that's not okay I want what I paid for nothing like a plane if I get a little bit more and let's be honest back in the days with the black market or the dispensaries anytime you got stuff it was never under it was on point or a little bit over at least that's how it always was with me anyway that is pretty much all it is for that review of that product I do quickly want to touch on these moisture packs because they've actually been quite useful for me I get them for just under a dollar each at the local stores what they look like in the package once you open that up you will get two pieces the actual moisture pack itself and an indicator the indicator turns blue once it's time to change it is you see the difference in colors with these two here kind of and that's what the boost pack itself looks like I'm only beginning smaller quantities so I haven't had one in with product that has dried out majorly for a long time so I can't say that it really reverses stuff from being too dried out however it does prevent your product from drying out prematurely on you which is always nice because let's be honest anytime you buy stuff by the end of it and it's right dry and browse and that's just yeah it is what it is anyway that's all for today folks and I hope to see you next time", "cTLkqhvXDxw": "what's happening party people we're here and you know what time it is we just got back from super Clinic and I've got myself fifty two dollars and 22 cents after our $20 first time patient discount a week we went down the super clinic and picked up two eight four five grams that were 35 so I came out to 70 and then - the first time patient discounted 20 bucks we got a math it's a lot of [ __ ] math dude like five gram eights like do people even do that in non like legal states have you ever had a dealer bump up your eighth to an extra five grams never well whatever you got some mean [ __ ] like these bags - we got some sativas here these bags do you normally dispensaries I wish I had an example of one around here but they give you these little like pop top like things and this time they gave us like a nice like container like those do like the heat seal it in the dispensary so when you're like getting your weed they weigh it they put it in here they put it in a machine heat seals it doesn't actually doesn't make noise and then they put a sticker on the back with the strain name and stuff it's pretty cool so we picked up XJ 13 and cinnamon these were there like top-shelf strains not exclusive but top-shelf so I wanted to check these out and those actually look pretty good let's take a look at them bring you guys we're gonna go nug fishin all right so we have the weed here this is the cinnamon get in for you guys let's see really big nice man that's you know it's like it's like perfume but it's also kind of creepy and it's like it's got like some interesting tones to it you know it smells like someone's apartment that I've like smoke the weed at you know when they've like burn some incense and they just smell like this I don't know they smell like kind of like old people but that really it's kind of like fruitier really interesting smell we've tried I think the sin mints before once and I had like a little popcorn nose so I've never actually had sin mint words this big of a nut this thing is like the size of my thumb that's nice it's a pretty good amount for 5 grams this is like this was drive out weed this was a nom that we're weighing it with so let's put that back in there and we'll clean up those scraps later and then this is the XJ bring it out for you guys a little bit so shiny bro I can't see [ __ ] check this over I'm a big fan of XJ 13 I'm a big fan of like anything Jack Herer whoa it wasn't exactly smell like XJ 13 but it kind of does you know it's got more of a funk to it but it definitely has that that blueberry tone oh yeah once I get it out of the bag and airy it's a little more really getting those like kind of blueberry sweet very light tones really good stuff yeah this one yeah you can see this one this one doesn't fill out as much this one the notes are a little more wet or just a little more dense dude oh I can feel it look at this yes ah I'm like pressing hard dude that's pretty good that's pretty crazy so I rarely see sativas this dense I'll be really interested to crack into this bad boy see what's up I'm gonna sleep out there that's the XJ and that completely mixed it up okay which way'd is which no I'm just kidding you can't really tell to be honest like normally when you look at two different strains you can kind of like a look at the different characteristics and really see giant distinguishing factors I mean here you can really see the shape of the top of the nug it's like the really spindly top sativa classic kind of thing that you'd normally see and then this is like a blunted hybrid top but then this is also super [ __ ] dense like an indica so there are just so many like factors like this is dense too so smoke some of this [ __ ] but packable I need some sativa in my life okay I'm gonna try to bring you guys a yeah yeah perfect Bowl packing height alright I think I'm gonna do the cinnamons first I mean what would you guys do would you guys do the JIT the XJ 13 the Jack or would you do the cinnamon I don't know I'm torn Brown torn I think I'm gonna do the cinnamon just because there's just so much more of it visually so I feel like if I smoked more of this there's just more of it you know I'm saying really nice stuff I really like the smell of this cinnamon really something different you know like I appreciate when things I get a lot of Jack Herer I get a lot of like tangi I get a lot of those like really fruity sweet Terps and stuff so they all become kind of OneNote after a while and I mean I got no problem with that OneNote you know it's [ __ ] it's fire but sometimes you got to switch it up introduce some new Terps into your life and the cinnamon should be a nice nice example of that I think it's like Girl Scout cookies cross but I can't tell you with what but man for the life of me I wish I could tell you the Instagram I used to follow in Miami for years probably like 3 or 4 years I used to follow this guy on Instagram oh I still do I just don't see him on my feet anymore and he grew cinnamon and he was like I am mr. cinnamon I am the original cinnamon and he would post these like plants always like super dark room with like flash and the nuns would be like super tiny like it'd be like a classic Girl Scout cookies plant where the nugs are just like super tiny you know it's like [ __ ] and I getting like a huge yield off this thing but it was super frosty

quite a few of them have told me that they like weed that tastes like this and it's like a super heavy indica it tastes like piney it tastes like woods but it also kind of has like sweet almost like grape --is-- berry like tones to it not like completely like purple grape but just like the sweetness of like the berries and the deepness maybe like a more of a blackberry or something that profile is like super California to me we used to get Cali weed and Miami and it used to taste like this where it would have a really distinct profile and be super super like tasty but super musky super piney super tank-like not like a I like this [ __ ] and I like the [ __ ] Jack where it's like blueberries sweet nice no [ __ ] California rough pine 100 year old redwood that's what California tastes like

convert pounds and ounces use the following equivalency one pound equals 16 ounces so let's say we were given an arbitrary number of pounds let's say we had 10 pounds for example now to go from one pound to 10 pounds after multiply by 10 so I have to do the same thing on the other side of the equation multiplying 16 by 10 is the same thing it's just moving the decimal over once to get 160 ounces if I wanted to do 20 pounds so make things easy let's go from this 10 times 2 would give me 20 so 160 abscess times 2 would give me 320 ounces so basically you want to use this equivalency one pound

Bhavana today I wanted to talk about our 62% product in the herbal market but first since we're relatively new in the herbal market I don't want to assume that you know everything about our company so the quick history is that back in 1997 under the name humid OPAC we invented and patented to a moisture control for packages and containers so we make what's now called Bovada in three different sizes lots of different humidity levels between 13% and 97% all of which are engineered to add or remove moisture depending on the ambient temperature and humidity they're smart enough to know what's happening outside to know whether it needs to add moisture or remove moisture to get to that specific humidity level engineered into the pack so we've been revolutionizing storage in premium tobacco food electronics music medical devices pharmaceuticals and now medical cannabis so each of the three sizes that I mentioned small size is two inches by two inches this is our old packaging the white with blue water drop is our human pack packaging that's being phased out in favor of the brown packaging but the two inch by two inches of four gram you're generally only going to see this handed out of samples it shows or in the specific packaging needs for delivery services or merchandising medical cannabis the eight gram pack measures 2 and 1/2 by 2.75 inches and the largest that we make the 60 gram Bovada measures three and a half by five and a half when a bullet is new it's gonna be nice and squishy super pliable like this when it's dried out is literally going to become a solid wafer it's gonna feel like it wants to crack in half so the life of any Bhavana depends on how hard it has to work which generally means giving up moisture and that's going to depend on how many times whatever you're using to store it in is open and closed so for example in a container like this this is tobacco but imagine this were cannabis if you put a pack in here sealed it up tight you could lose this for more than a year and it would be as good if not better than the way than the day that it went in because once it reaches 62% in here it's just making really small adjustments to keep it there on the other hand if it's open and closed all the time then it's starting over at least starting over the air inside so we landed on 62% in the herbal market not by accident we had people that were using higher humidity levels they wanted something lower so we commissioned some testing determined 62% is ideal for cannabis because it maximizes the color the aroma the taste it cools the burn but the biggest thing is that it maintains the efficacy keeps it strength because generally product sitting around dries out the trichomes flake off and it's weaker medicine so all fantastic things it's also shown great results in bringing back dried cannabis so there's a lot of videos and a lot of reviews of people have had great success with that so literally for the first time ever bovid allows you to keep a lot of medicine on hand and it won't go bad as long as the Bovada inside is good again as long as it's squishing it's got fluid so the first time ever you can age cannabis like people aged wine and cigars and there's a lot of people out there that have had a lot of fantastic results so the way that you'll see this displayed at your local stores is in a container like this that's got an airtight seal with the 8 gram packs inside it's got about a two year shelf life in here and then our 60-gram packs come in boxes of 12 and they're individually wrapped in this cellophane which will give it another two year shelf-life so if you need to know where to find it you can go to our website Bova to inc.com under the where to buy section that's kind of up on the top right you'll notice the store locator there or you can buy direct from us if you ever have any questions you can go to our facebook page it's facebook.com slash over2 herbal or feel free to send us an email we'll be

but you're gonna have way less shot coming out of the gun let's see what that looks like out of our Mossberg 500 pump got your eyes and ears on drew alright it's going to take a quick peek make sure everything's intact we've got the high speed so we can see where those rounds went now let's see what it looks like with a real regular two and three-quarter buckshot load so this has nine pellets in it significantly more energy here we go ready drew so perfect perfect illustration of what happens when you get diminished energy way less lead a lot more lead food for thought holy [ __ ] that was cool that was cool so here's the thing guys we could pattern this on paper we could show you what it looks like that I thought was a better illustration I see guys say but wait Mick they're still sending buckshot downrange you saw the difference in the amount of energy transferred into the target simple physics you've got over twice the amount of payload than you do here over twice this is also high brass so in shotgun world that means more powder low brass high brass you can see the difference it's just an energy thing so if you're going to use a shotgun for home protection you want to make sure that what you have gets the job done that said from a penetration standpoint and we can look at the high-speed the first run of buckshot that stuff penetrated to about 16 17 inches somewhere right in here between like 14 and 16 inches and it all stayed in the gel what's crazy is looking at the watt Eng you can imagine check this out so that'd be inside of you if you were if you were the bad guy getting hit you'd have chunks of plastic inside of you that is no joke look at this one can you see this drew get shot with a shotgun it ain't like the movies you go to the hospital with a chunk of dirty plastic in your guts the other thing to think about with this stuff is it doesn't always feed through every gun I'm gonna grab a couple rounds and we'll see if we can get it to cycle through a couple of our guns stand by so let's just see one two three four five six shoot I gotta grab some more of them [Music] seven and they get some more [Music] eight eight so I can get eight of them in this tube well as long as we got our ears on let's see if they'll feed through you're ready drew all right safety off its chamber one so technically technically butterfingers here if we chambered one we got nine rounds of those shorties on board here we go let's get it done smoke Joe so they fed through the Mossberg let's try it now with the fan out here we'll see if they'll feed through here it's not a habit oh it doesn't like the doesn't like the ramp in here I know that that there are special parts made for some of these guns to help facilitate loading these little shorties yeah this ain't going to happen in this gun I would have to finger feed it in there so I'm not going to try the loading ramps on these guns are made to carry a longer shell these little shells don't like it wow this one which is a little longer boy are we going to be able to have some fun with this let's see how they feed through this monster [Music] so we finding up that they don't like to feed through every gun it fed through the shorty they don't like it through this one for some reason which means to me that they're unreliable for anything but fun I guess if you had a single shot or a break action or something like that that's a different story but for a pump just what you see is what you get I know that for Remington and maybe other guns they make a product that helps them get up the feed gate let's try it again [Music] [Music] that's it [Music] funny [Music] do they have a purpose yeah are they better than good old fashioned two and three-quarter buckshot for stopping bad guys not if you can't feed them reliably they're expensive too I think it's fun high-capacity low recoil peak performance 20 car Gooch's I don't know guys I like stuff that works you just saw me having to fight through that think about why you buy stuff think about what you invest energy in if they work heck yeah you'll see the high speeds in this video of what they did to the gel that's not meaningless if it's sending those projectiles and it's got energy to penetrate and not over penetrate into your neighbor's house or through a bedroom wall there might be some food for thought if I can't get him to run through my little fashion Punk shotgun they're not going in my house Vicky and drew with Kyra trainer.com it's a hot day on the indoor range remember guys tell somebody you love them tell yourself you love yourself take a deep breath tonight and tell yourself tomorrow I'm gonna handle up kick-ass day and then make it happen don't be a [ __ ] that was kind of a [ __ ] move who the hell spins to say goodbye that's weird that was Drew's idea there was true his idea [Music] [Music]", "yKupN4-4F3Q": "hello this is an unboxing video from you've action under SL 1 to 2 CL n dash 1 201 820 this is by brenneke these are five shotgun slugs for a 12-gauge classic Magnum there two and three-quarter inches 118 thousands of the box here for you so you can get a better look", "Xp5iQwvX0eE": "all right 8th grade math here's lesson 15 writing a situation for an equation all right we have a reminder adding is putting together or putting groups together subtracting is taken away or comparing or seeing how many more you need multiplying is repeated addition dividing is finding how many groups of a certain size you can make from a total or finding the size of a certain number of equally quick groups it says write a problem that can be solved by the equation we have x plus 45 equals 70. so we are given the equation one way to see what this equation means is to model it with some paper clips this diagram shows that we're looking for a number that when added to 45 gives a sum of 70. here are three problems that would match this equation the window is 45 inches wide the total width of the window and shutters is 70 inches what is the width of the shutters steve and noah put their money together to buy a canoe that cost 70 dollars steve paid 45 how much did noah pay or clara waited 70 minutes in line to get tickets to a rock concert that was 45 minutes more than la shronda waited how long did lashonda make wait so those are this is the equation these are possible problems that we're going to find the answer for so the equation 15 minus 3 can be modeled with paper clips also you start with 15 how many many must you take away so that you only have three so the problem is continued on the next page so here's a problem for this equation alicia went to the book fair she had fifteen dollars to spend when she left the fair she had three dollars left how much did she spend so they drew out 15 paper clips and they knew or she knew left with three dollars so they circled all of the paper clips except for the three so how many paper clips are in that circle so if you count them there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so there are twelve how much did she spend she spent twelve dollars all right so now on down below it says complete the problem for each equation now we could draw pictures i'm going to share with you guys how i want you to set up equations for solving so if i have the equation of i'm going to write it over here 5 times and i'm using the dot n equals 105. when we solve equations we're going to draw a line down the center we're going to box in our variable now what operation is being done between the 5 and the the box or the n it's being multiplied the opposite of multiplication is division so i'm going to divide both sides by 5. well when i take 5 divided by 5 i get 1 and 1 times any number is that number so what i'm left with over here is my n and if i do 105 divided by 5 you can do it on a calculator or i know that 5 times 2 is 10 and i know 5 times 1 is 5. so my answer is 21. so over here it says jill has a pocket full of nickels the total value is a dollar five it's how many nickels does she have well n for nickels equals 21 whoops that should have been 21. it should have been 21 nickels so i'm going to write my answer there now when i come down to the next equation i have and i'm going to change colors we have z being divided by 8 equals 4. now there's that but i don't like when we get into algebra we don't write it like that what we would do we would write it as z divided by eight now if i draw my line i box in my variable what operations being done to the z it's division the opposite of division is multiplication so i'm going to multiply both sides by eight and this cancels out so one times z is z and four times eight is 32 so my answer z equals 32 and then if we labeled it it's ounces all right so when you come down to problems three and you're given the equation you don't have to solve it you have to write a problem so for example it says write a problem for each equation you may use the situation given but you don't have to so these are all possible problems we have a plus 15 equals 40 000. it says two bank accounts add up to 40 000. so my problem could be my mom had a bank account and i had a account an account a bank account together oh oh let me go back and change that a little bit i had a bank account with fifteen thousand dollars i wish that was true together we had forty thousand dollars so that would be a word problem that goes with that equation so what you have to do on problem number four is write a word problem that goes with that equation when you get down to the application since you're watching this video guess what i'm doing i am crossing it out you do not have to do that problem now that is it you have one problem one problem to do on your own for this assignment get it finished submit it to me through canvas good luck and have fun", "kXACW7fdWb8": "all right welcome back today we are going to be working on 7.5 day 1 notes we will be talking about factoring trinomials alright let's first start by talking about what you know in the last video we pasteurize example you should Boston we know we got the answer correct alright let's go on to example number two when you're looking at number two is you suggest inaudible 3 and positive 3 and they also share another thing in common nobody sees with smallest exponent so between M Squared and after the first the smallest one is n to the first my GCF would be 3 and number 3 and all these days on the outside always reduces goes on the outside now we divide 3 divided by 3 is 1 times 4 divided by 5 is an to the numerator once I want azusa process and then 27 divided by 3 positive 9 there's a tie with the X all right and lastly looking at example number 3 you notice that they all share is x over X cubed exported extra first we always choose the smallest x so my smallest exponent tax taxes comes outside dividing X cubed divided by X finally two runs five to put effectively X to the first tax we're here might noon later we'll try one because it's between two and one cost or Act one lastly X divided by ax there's a tie but I still have to do bring down the positive one just like five divided by five is still one we still need a drop down not one so we are going to learn how to do days when to start the time oh no and I'm going to factor it into the two binomials remember you can also check Vince because we control and I just repeating forget the original question all right no matter what we still have to check to see if you can factor out a GCF first that is always the first to always see if all of the terms of the visual I the same number or same variable if so factor that out and then continue the process what we're gonna learn today alright what we're gonna learn how to do is factor x squared plus 7x plus 6 into the two binomials that originally multiplied to it the first thing you're going to do is write on all the factors of X list so the only way to make x squared then you're going to write out the factors of the first term so hot what multiply since X well it's 1 times X and 2 times 3 now you have to pick what combination works and I'll tell you how you know it works you want to know which combination 1 & 6 & 2 & 3 both recognize 1 & 6 when you ask them you make 7 which that's what we wanted so here's the first one YF x first acts first in both parentheses when I can bring this now I'm going to have a plus one plus six and now the colors after it again because technically she's office right we check find three distributing I'm gonna distribute X plus 1 times s foot six and I'll see you I get the original problem ryback's back x squared X times six five the six packs one contacts positive x one times six is positive six my my middle terms x squared plus 7x plus 6 which is exactly what I started with so again you right off the bat is were thrown on the first part of the parentheses then you may either write the factors of the third term white multiplies to say 1 and 6 2 & 3 from those combinations to choose the combination that adds to the zeros 1 and 6 because one time fixes things but also one plus 6 is 7 the one in the six goes in the second term it does not matter the order again you could have X plus 6 times X plus 1 they're the exact same answer order does not matter all right let's go ahead and try example number 2 again we should always check to see if we can factor out a GCF and cannot sense that a GCF in example 2 so let's determine what makes our way to the parent what not sometimes the tops of 8 1 & 8 2 and forth from these combination blade 2 combinations to choose from I need to pick one that can add to negative 6 1 1/8 obviously I was gonna work with their heads after 9 2 & 4 as 2 positive 6 I want negative six so hopefully you remember your properties with negative numbers I can a negative times a negative so we will make a positive eight but now it will add to negative six so we have two binomials - two and - redistribute it again I repeat when I have two numbers that multiply - Podrick we were there false positive or both negative that's the only way I can multiply two numbers fever there's why they needed capital negative two times negative four no action to fix it all right let's go ahead and do some examples let's go through number one again one I don't see anything to make it fit these on how to get what makes fine let two terms most make it wait where's my I don't write down everything that multiplies now all the combinations all right example number two again always checked we're juicy yeah you can't divide everything by accident you get risk from here what to now your calculator to 36 divided by 2 so I of 2 and 18 now Chuck 3 and your calculator you do 36 and if I 303 and talk now we're going to go ahead and try 4 so your calculators do 36 divided by 4 that is the first and ask Mike 5 wouldn't work 6 work six six seven women were 8 wouldn't work and those are all the factors from all the combinations you want to figure out what do you like pasta 20 I don't even make both of them negative all right example number three again always check for GCF again we can't divide everything by a W because negative 21 doesn't have it dosage to begin with but now I have to a three I have to write all the factors of negative 20 negative number one number is negative so you have negative 1 and 21 and one of them is negative and I have negative 3 positive 7 all right so now I gotta figure out between those two combinations which this force we should recognize right here because negative 3 plus 7 is positive here and there's no combination if W minus 3w plus 7 now for example what about a few little negative 21 and you have the negative with the 7 instead of the 3 so 3 minus 7 so people negative 4 but take me when a positive is definitely be mistaken we're just going to flip flops where the negatives are so that might happen in your homework or the next couple examples all right let's go ahead and do a special number 4 again always check for a GCF there's not anything that I can divide all three terms by so let's go ahead and write the factor x squared now in rating factors of a negative 24 remember when I laid factors of a negative number one number again I'm getting these numbers so I'm just I'm just joking with my calculator negative 24 divided by one and I developed a 2 and I divided by 3/4 ounce so Jason don't make it to only say that equals positive I don't want popular tools that I can't thanks so much combinations gonna be very disturbing rate example number five 702 for a GCF but there is nothing that I could divide our squared thirteen hour and 22 great number six again always check to see if your piece if you have a GCF number six a genus alright x squared I go after that to act 16 everything that all 6 1/16 to 1/8 4 & 4 right to take the combination that adds to negative 8 well this one is pretty close but you should recognize my ass for in for that makes positive 8 I want negative thank you easy fit there either one can become negative constantly come like this since this is positive it means to mount hyjal top and the person that needs to focus on negative from here my factors are X minus 1 times X minus 4 right again you should be asking yourself the first question Karen / GCI the answer is yes - how's everything going - and I'm going to bring this to them it's weird what 11 be 128 now normally for what we learned in the last lesson we cannot normally go further but everything in here everything they multiply 8 1 and 28 to 40 for the seventh on this operation is one four five seven because today be really careful about is that - that we sponsor us begin with must keep drunk sit down now I write myself me for be alright let's go D number eight if we recognize that all three terms are divisible by three so again I do want three I'm going to take that three training I'm going to see if I can explain make thank and positive manage one and nine three and three and looking for which combination and negative 6 so 3 and 3 make positive sick again I do think since it multiplies feel count remember both of us be calm and very carefully discrete if you scroll down you dropped me down and I'm a fast things are gonna be - all right little 9 because this one does not have a GPS system : 8 so this video interactive and the only you should see that we're running into a problem to say 1 plus 5,000 make 7 there's no way negative 1 times negative 5 makes 500 in camp that equals negative 6 so not every turning only acceptable so there are 9 is not factorable so when you cannot find a combination there's no numbers that multiply to 5 but also add to 7 they are not factorable all right let's go ahead and do time again you should always ask yourself can I sense 302 GCF and the question answer is yes you can everything we're going to bring down the side I'm left with some squared minus 2 plus 1 always check to see if we can factor further that's time I'm squared by vectors into I'm an N and the only two novels that make lines or one one I'm looking for combinations of one set absence ticket issues be careful 1 plus 1 is positive 2 so they can oh that's an easy fix they both become negative again don't forget and my selfies are going to be after minus 14 alright number 11 this is the problem that we did on the last video you should always check for a GCF then folds link between 27 and 3 3 can go into salsas on which use the smallest exponent number a to the 5th 8th class would be squared and to the first it have the smallest one to be the first for those pcs from an outside now we divide today divided by 3 is 1 these are the things that went into the court you later win size 1 C squared divided by B numerator wind size 1 minus 27 divided by 3 it's mine there's a tie with the 80s high with disease and I can't sell their third there down here like I did over here after so dosages yes because I'm not left with a quadratic meanings of X fondest shot to this just be my final on all right and number 12 you should always check to see if you can factor the GCF and you can't so my GCF is 3 again 3 on the front with G is + 7 g minus 8 always to see now my leftovers I'm left with the plot is different I wasn't I was not less so when you're done with the whole grounded all these try to progress further G squared G times G now everything that makes a negative 8 remember in order to make a negative number we have a positive and a negative in his summation so let's executive 1 and 8 negative 2 & 4 of these combinations add to positive 7 so negative 8 and positive 1 foundation so here again don't forget to bring down that 3 and my fact is our G minus 1 times G Plus 8 all right please go ahead and complete the following homework assignment", "xXtYvWmMmO4": "hello everybody and welcome back to our third lesson in our blue book expressions and equations three and we are on page 12 and this page will be nodes so applications what that means is um when do you use this kind of math and so those are always good problems because a lot of students will say well why would i ever need to learn this well this is maybe one occasion you might need it we will write equations to solve problems we will apply what we've learned about formal algebra to solve equations that involve rational numbers so rational numbers are fractions so i will show you how to deal with those fractions okay any number that can be written as a fraction then that's a rational number it's also decimals that end or repeat so a decimal that ends or the numbers repeat over and over those are also rational numbers because you can actually write them as a fraction getting started two friends sadie and bettina are both saving for the same phone on their graduation day sadie received a two hundred dollar gift and bettina received a hundred and fifty dollar gift how nice right sadie will save forty dollars per week and bettina will save 25 dollars per week so the starting points are the ones you need to underline these are the startings and then this per week means every week you're going to add 40 so that'll make the amount bigger right and this is the same 25 dollars per week yeah so let's look at our table here we have the number of weeks on top week zero is your start week one two three so this is going up to eight weeks right and then sadie on the the starting week she started out with two hundred dollars and she uh added forty dollars per week so now the second week she'll have 200 plus 40 is 240 dollars the second week after the second week is over she'll have i'm always adding 40 dollars to this number 280 see if you can do that yourself without me look without watching me up 40 each time see if i did this right or if i made a mistake sometimes teachers do make mistakes but i think that's correct forty dollars each week added on to two hundred dollars gives you 520 dollars after eight weeks of saving but tina started out week zero that's your starting point with 150 dollars and she saved 25 dollars per week so now i'm adding 25 each time try that yourself without me watching me and copying me you can use a calculator if you like or you can do it in your head looks like bettina is not going to have as much money as sadie right 350 dollars after eight weeks of saving who started with more money it was saiding correct write an expression for the amount of money sadie will save after w weeks so w is the number of weeks so that would be these numbers one two three four five six seven eight so the expression will look like this you you take the starting point 200 plus we're adding money each week we're not spending any that would be a minus we're adding forty dollars not forty dollars week so we want to use our w w is the number of weeks so this is the expression for sadie and now bettina gets she started with 150 dollars and she saves so we're adding she's not spending any 25 dollars per week so this right here is a multiplication part 25 times the number of weeks so let's say your number of week is eight it would be eight times 25 plus the 150 she started with and you get 350. so no matter what number for the week you substitute here you will get this answer okay it's the same here number of week times this is a times problem the 40 dollars she saves each week but you have to add that to the 200 she had to begin with so these are the two expressions and then explain why bettina's savings will never catch up to sadie's well you can say well she's already behind she'll never catch up because she's only saving 25 dollars and she's saving 40 dollars every week you can say that here yeah or i'm going to show you with formal algebra they're talking about formal algebra okay so you can say when will the two expressions be equal formal algebra can say when will both have the same amount saved okay now the with the what that means when will both expressions be equal these two so that's what we're looking for when will both expressions be equal and then we're setting up an equation because equal means equation something is equal so say 200 plus 40 w when will that be equal to the other expression and remember w is the number of weeks so whatever we get for w that would give us the answer when they have enough when they have saved the same amount okay so let's solve this equation and we practiced in class solving equations so let's see we start with a line i see people doing that that's a great start uh let's look at the w i'm going to subtract 25 w that's my choice how i'm starting 200 40 minus 25 is 15 w subtract the 200 15 w 150 minus 200 is negative 50. divide both sides by fifteen w is a negative answer and it's three and a half so let's remember w is the number of weeks when they have the same is that possible can we have a negative number of week when the number of weeks is a negative number they will never have the same amount of money because there's no negative weeks okay so the reason is because our variable is a negative answer w means the number of weeks they need to save to have the same makes no sense to have a negative number of weeks in the context of our problem therefore that will never happen this is formal algebra you can also say that she's always going to be behind because she only saves 25 dollars and sadie saves 40 dollars so there's no way she's going to catch up but this is the proof this is the formal algebra is the proof okay copy that and we're going to the next page this was page 12. you always want to stop your video you want to rewind you might want to watch it once without taking notes and then write it down afterwards sometimes that makes more sense to you so it takes a little extra time i agree but you want to learn the math rather than just get it done so we're moving on to number 13 that's all notes more savings problems so savings money that's called applications because this is real life we want to save money okay use the following organizational structure this means you're organizing your work and that's always a very good thing in math to be organized to solve these problems with algebra so we're using formal algebra to solve it which means setting up an equation and solving it here are the steps we always want to identify a variable if you look at the previous page i wrote w is equal to the number of weeks they're saving so i let my variable i pick a letter w works they actually told us w in the problem somewhere i can't remember where oh did it say anything nope i don't see it but i use w for weeks because that's a good reminder what w is but you need to write it down okay so that's called identifying a variable and so we're going to do that each time then we have to write an equation solve it answer the question with the sentence usually and then check your answer and i'm always lacking on that last part what it's a good study habit just to start okay so let's read number one i always like to underline what's important sven is saving for a 680 phone taxes included he has so this is your total amount he wants to pay for his phone he has already 118 dollars to start with this is your start and will save 35 dollars per week now here's the thing the question is going to identify to you what are you looking for and that's your variable so let's look at the question it's usually at the end of the word problem after how many weeks so what are we looking for weeks yeah the question is tell me how many weeks so of saving will we be able to purchase the phone so that right there tells me my variable after how many weeks so i'll say let i i like to use the word lent because it's your choice i use w again is number of weeks this is not hashtag this is a number symbol he saves so he has to save a certain number of weeks and that number w will tell us that okay this is called identify a variable so i've done that now we have to write an equation so let's look start out 108 oh no 118 start out point okay and then he saves 35 dollars per week saving means you're going to add more 35 dollars each week so let's w 35 times each week add it to 118 and now we wants to pay 608 he needs that 608 dollars so this is our equation now we need to solve it if this is a little tricky for you stop the video look at it again subtract 118 35 35w equals zero nine one is it 490 i think so divide by 35 and use a calculator don't erase your w that's the number we need 490 divided by 35 let's see 14 weeks remember now let's look back what is w stand for w is the number of weeks he saved so that's a good start to answer our sentence he needs to save 14 weeks to get that phone and last so we answered the question and i'm going to check so 14 times 35 plus the 118 should be 608 so 14 weeks each week 35 dollars plus what he started with 14 times 35 plus 118 is indeed 608 dollars check okay i just reversed it if you're like well why would she start with 14 i used this but i flipped it it's okay adding means when you add something you can flip it so i multiply this first you could still do it this way 118 plus 35 times 14 and it'll also should give you 608 dollars the key is he needs to save for 14 weeks for his phone okay let's do number two ben is saving for the same phone so that's also 608 dollars correct that's probably why this is here and wants to buy it at the same time as when ben already has 73 dollars starting point right and we'll save the same amount each week how much here's the question this is where you identify what you're looking for this is your variable how much should his weekly savings be so when it says how much am i looking for weak or am i looking for a dollar amount i'm looking for a dollar amount how much is always well is savings how much is telling me how much am i going to save each week to make it at the same time as when with just 73 dollars per week so this is where i identify my variable so i'm going to say lead and i can pick any letter i could say a how about a is the amount ben has to save each week and it's always good to spell it out correctly because when you find your answer then you can just say oh well what did my answer mean go back here and read because sometimes we have to think what is that what am i even looking for by the time you're done you're so happy you got a number but then you have to figure what does that answer mean in context of the question so let a is the amount of the amount of money i should have written i'll just put a dollar sign above it and has to save each week so now comes my equation so ben has what's his starting 73 plus we don't know how much he has to save but i know he wants to save it at the same time so i'm using 14. 14 weeks that's the same time right so i have to refer back to this so and we don't know so 8 x 14 and he has to get 608 dollars as well but this right here does not look right so i'm going to rewrite it the way algebra should be it's 14a solve so this is your equation a times 14 is 14a in algebra 608-73 i used a calculator 535 divide by 14. is a calculator oops it says 38.2 i'm gonna round it uh so remember oh so 38.21 because it's money remember a because now we're thinking oh weeks weeks no it's a is the amount then has to save each week so now it comes back here where you can kind of remind yourself what does this answer mean he has to save he should save now put a dollar sign two decimals for dollar and cents each week for 14 weeks if you check so i'm going to check over here i can say the 73 that he started with plus the 3821 for 14 weeks should give me the money i need to buy that phone okay let's try it 78 plus 38.21 times 14. it might be a tiny tiny bit off think about why i think why 607 94. think about it why is it off so he needs 608 but he got 607.94 well the reason is we rounded this money amount we dropped off a bunch of decimals correct so therefore this is going to be six cents under that's all right but it works okay rounding made it off i'm not gonna write anything i'm i'm hoping you understand that okay number three by the way we're not doing number four do we well maybe okay number three because the philadelphia eagles won super bowl that's 52 i believe 5 4 50 l means 50 and this is 2 52. their ticket prices are going up for the 2018-19 season so going up right i'm always kind of thinking ah more expensive barry and ryan ryan are eager to buy some tickets barry has four hundred dollars saved already that's his starting point and starts to save another twenty dollars per week in your mind already think what's that expression look like okay at the same time ryan starts to save 40 dollars per week but she ha oh it's a girl she has a hundred dollar debt so that's a negative 100 that means negative number yeah to pay off to her brother first before the savings are truly hers to keep after how okay here's the question underline it this is what the variable this is where you identify your variable after how many weeks there it is after how many weeks of savings does ryan catch up to barry so remember first thing identify your variable let you can also make a l like this you don't have to write it like me let w mean the number of weeks when she catches up to barry with our savings right so i identified my variable i called it w because it reminds me it's weeks you can call it x y z whatever you want okay but you got to write down what the variable represents then we write our equation so let's think barry started out with four hundred dollars and he's saving so it's adding twenty dollars a week and that should equal because when they're eat when they have the same that means both expressions are equal but the gal has a hundred dollar debt remember that's a negative 100 and she's saving forty dollars per week so there's our equation now i want you to save that yourself work it out yourself and i'm just going to put the answer so you can pause the video see if you can figure out w that should be a good exercise for you and i will just put the answer down please pause you do need all the work here okay you should have w is 25 if you did it correctly so that means let's see what our w means number of weeks when she catches up to barry she has the same amount after 25 weeks i'm going to skip this one and use this column over here this little space to check because i never show you how to check really really good so 25 weeks so let's see hmm so what is ryan got what is barry got after 25 weeks barry started out with 400 plus he saves 20 dollars and 25 let's see what would that be 400 plus 20 times 25 is 500 400 so they have 900 dollars after 25 weeks and then the gal ryan she starts out with negative 100 in debt and then she saves forty dollars a week for 25 weeks so it's negative 100 40 times 25 is a thousand so one thousand take away one hundred is nine hundred see how they both have the same after 25 weeks so this is the number of weeks and they both have 900 bucks and that's how you can check very good this is page 13 guys make sure you copy it correctly try to make some sense out of it so when you study math sometimes you have to go through it one more time like i always say and kind of look from step to step and there's always some hurdles that you're not sure why that happened or what did she do that for and those are the things that with more experience you if you do more and more math over your career in school you'll become more familiar with okay so don't feel like you're not as smart as somebody else because you're going to get those hurdles done as well but you do have to put some effort into it so that was page 13 and now page 14 is called perimeter what is perimeter perimeter this is in geometry perimeter is when you walk around a shape like let's say this is a garden plot so the perimeter is if you start walking here here here here here you walked around the perimeter the outside but you have to add up all the sides so let's write that it's the outside of a shape and so you add all the sides again we're going to do the same thing use the same organizational structure as the previous page to solve the following problems we're going to identify a variable which is going to be a little trickier in this we're going to write an equation solve it answer the question check your answer in the original problem that's another thing you always want to go back to the original to the top and check your answer this rectangle and this triangle have the same perimeter when it says same it's usually where your equation equal sign is yeah that's always the indication this is because remember you do have to write an equation the same means equal what is the perimeter of each this is the question what is the perimeter of each so that tells me my variable so i'm going to say let p be the perimeter of each shape right that's what they're saying each shape rectangle triangle okay now i have to write an equation but the perimeter is all sides so there's something missing this side is called x this is x minus three this is x and this is x minus three because it's a rectangle so now i have to add all these sides so i'm going remember the equal this is equal to that so x plus x plus x minus three that's actually two x minus three two groups of x minus three can be written like that and then over here this side this triangle x plus six plus x minus two plus x plus three so all we know is that this is the side length you don't know what x is yet we will find it but um but that's you're just adding these expressions these are expressions okay so now we have to simplify so that needs to be multiplied x plus x is two x plus two times x is two x two times negative three is negative six x x x three x six minus two is four four plus three is seven so we still have to combine the x's over here four x minus six now we can start shoveling things around i'm moving the three x to the other side this is a big problem there's no room 4x minus 3 is x add 6. x equals seven plus six is thirteen okay what are we looking for we're not looking for x we're looking for oh shoot i didn't no no no you see how much trickier this is p is the perimeter but i used x x is not the perimeter okay we're gonna adjust this i'm going to fix my lead maybe somebody can think i used x what does x mean in my problem this is why you use pencil for math let x since i used x what is x think about it length of rectangle this is x so in this case we're not going to use the question remember i said it's a little trickier with these we're not looking at the we're going to have this is my intermediate step so x is 13 that means this is 13 and this is 13. we're still having to look for the perimeter of each shape so x was the length that was 13 x minus 3 13 minus 3 is ten the width is ten ten and then x minus three thirteen minus three is also ten so we can find the perimeter and then here we can plug it in x is 13 x is 13 13. so now let's find the perimeter this is where the question is perimeter 13 plus 13 plus 10 plus 10 2 times 13 plus 2 times 10. i'm going to put a little rectangle here that's the perimeter of my rectangle that's 26 plus 20 that's 46 and then the perimeter of the triangle 13 plus 6 is 19 plus 13 minus 2 is 11 and 13 plus 3 is 16. 19 plus 11 is 20 is 30 30 plus 16 is 46. the perimeter of each shape is 46. very very tricky questions i'm going to have you guys think about this we're going to do another one number two i'm going to erase this so i'm not running into the question um you might want to pause and copy because in a second it'll be gone all right in a rectangle there's our rectangle the base is 5 units more than its height x so they call this base and height this is your base and this is the height you could also call it length and width i'm not going to write that there you don't have to i just wanted you to see it and most likely in most problems it's called length and width base and height okay so we call the height x uh in a rectangle the base is five units more than the height so that would make it x plus five five units more than the height x twice the height is equal to the base remember the word equal or the same that indicates your equation so first of all let's identify a variable so let x be the height of triangle oh of rectangle but what are we really looking for we're not looking really for x that's just an intermediate step to get us to the answer what are the dimensions and its perimeter now dimensions is base and height they want to know the base the height and the perimeter but in order to do that to find that we got to find x first okay so here's our equation you have something is equal twice the height 2x is equal to the base equal to the base okay let's read that again twice the height x twice 2x is equal to the base x plus five let's solve that you have 2x minus 1x is simply x x is 5. very quick equation now we know that the height is 5 and the base is x plus five well x is five what's five plus five it's ten correct so ten five ten five so now we can find the perimeter and we know the base and the height so here's our answer the base is 10 the height is five and we also want to find the perimeter five plus ten plus five plus ten five plus ten plus five plus ten which is fit is 30. okay i think we answered it yep we wanted the dimensions the base and the height and we needed the perimeter okay last one i'm skipping number four that's the one this last one this number three is very very tricky but i'm skipping four because i think this will take every ounce of energy you have out of you an equilateral triangle sits on top of a rectangle to form a house what does equilateral mean it means all sides are equal so if this side is x this side is x and this side is x that's what equal our equilateral means okay the height of the rectangle this is your height is six units less than the base the base is also x because it's a rectangle six units less means the base minus 6. the perimeter of both figures is equal that's our equation remember something is equal the perimeter of this perimeter of triangle i'm gonna write it out and erase it just so you see it actually you know what symbols is good i'm going to just show it to you in symbols the perimeter of the triangle is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle that makes sense to me because it says the perimeters of both figures are equal okay so now let's identify a variable in this case our question is what is the perimeter of the house so i know that's what i eventually have to answer but to do that i need to find x so i'll say let x be the base of the house because that's what i could also say it's the side of a triangle but i'm just making it short here's the equation perimeter of the triangle is x plus x plus x perimeter of triangle x plus x plus x is equal to the perimeter of the house the the rectangle x plus x minus six plus x plus x minus six so i start here add this add this add this 3x one two three four x minus six plus minus 6 is negative 12. so i simplified my equation i'm going to choose to subtract 4x i want to show you something eventually you're going to run into it one is if i say i want to subtract 3x from both sides just to show you what happens what is on this side nothing right make it a zero 4x minus 3x is x minus 12. add twelve that'll happen sometimes i don't want you to be sitting around going well what happened zero plus twelve is twelve so x is twelve but that's just our intermediate because what is the perimeter 12 12 oh it's the perimeter of the whole house be careful we only want the outside remember perimeter is only the outside not that that does not count as perimeter so i'll make it green so you really see it so we need to figure out what each side length is well this is 12 because it's labeled x but now what do we have down here that's 12 that's an x and it says x is 12 but this is x minus 6 so that's a 6 and that's a 6 because 12 minus 6 is 6. so now the perimeter 12 plus 12 plus 6 plus 12 plus 6. and then i'm gonna count one two three four five sides one two three four five and now i'm going to add them 24 30 42 forty eight 48 whatever the units are i'm not sure meters don't know what they're measuring this end so i'm just using the number 48. very good guys this is a little tricky here you have to know how to read you have to know how to understand what you read translate it into math and able to answer the question so this is very very hard lots of steps if you're not ready for this do not worry you're not a bad math student you're just going to step back and say that part i did not understand it happens all the time we're going to read out what we understand from what we're not understanding okay so next page this was page 14 and this one we skip so write skip on top you can cross it out if you like let's see if i wrote notes yep this one needs to say notes just checking make sure i have something on top of each page yes skip that one and now this one page 16 we're going to do notes plus homework this is the one with the fractions i wanted to show you equations involving fractions rational numbers so i'll call it fraction buster i'm going to show you fraction buster so i'll say use fraction buster we're going to get rid of these fractions so on these this is homework homework homework these are huge homework i want to show you this one these you just use a calculator for sure with those decimals but i'm going to show you what you can do to get rid of the decimals definitely i'm showing you these two okay fraction buster on these don't write that yet later maybe okay because i wanna have some room this one with the decimal a quick way is since you have one digit after the decimal point move your decimal two spaces but that means you have to multiply everything by ten so now that turns into 50x plus 4 equals 2 times 10 is 20x plus 7. that's a option to get rid of the decimals or you can just use your calculator and do it the same way as you wouldn't normally solve this equation okay but this is an option remember if you move your decimal one space you got to multiply everything else by 10 because that's one space is multiplying by 10. everything else otherwise you're changing the equation with this one you could let's multiply it out you can use a calculator 0.2 x plus 0.2 times 0.3 i believe is 0.06 but let me try it yep 0.06 not 0.6 don't be hasty minus this would probably be zero 0.04 yep okay now if you want to just continue with your calculator and solve that that's fine but if you want to get rid of the decimals notice the biggest one you're moving it twice that means you have to multiply by a hundred or you're moving everything twice so you now have 20x plus six you're moving this one twice that's 40x minus four so now you got rid of your decimals if you don't want to do that that's too tricky for you just use your calculator and your decimals now these i will show you fraction buster it's a lot easier so look at the bottom of the fractions eight and four common denominator is eight because four goes into eight so you're multiplying everything by eight just put it on top in parentheses each part gets multiplied by eight eight times six is 48x minus 8's cancel out 1 8 times 4 32 x plus 8 divided by 8 times 1 is eight divided by four is two now you don't have any more fractions that's why they call it fraction buster and now i'm solving i subtract 32x 48 take away 32 i think is 16x add one 16x 2 plus 1 is 3 divide by sixteen x is three sixteenth that's a rational number so your answer might be a fraction it's not a big deal use 3 over 16 rather than dividing if you divide 3 divided by 16 it'll give you 0.1875 which is a ending decimal which is also a rational number but this is much more accurate 3 over 16 is okay the part up here that's tricky is probably getting rid of the fraction let's look at this one so your fraction you look at the denominator lowest common denominator between two and three is six because six is divisible by 2 and 6 is divisible by 3. so now you multiply everything by 6 however you do not have to multiply this because the one half takes care of that don't multiply this because the one-third out front takes care of it six times one is six divided by two is three six times one is six divided by three is two so notice your fractions are gone okay multiply that out 6x plus 12 plus 1x is x plus twenty four six plus one is seven x plus twelve seven subtract seven x twelve equals eighteen minus seven is eleven x subtract 24 negative 12 divide both sides by 11. negative 12 over 11 is an improper fraction you can make a mixed number out of that so that's negative 1 and 1 12. wow what a question what a long problem now if you do not quite get this yet don't despair but it's there if you want to deal with the fractions go ahead and do it this might be easier to distribute one half one-half times two and one-half times four one-third times nine and one-third times twelve it'll actually give you whole numbers so you can try that as well but the answer needs to match okay this was page 16 and now this page is homework page 17 is homework and then we're done with our book we got a review i'm looking at this this is cool we might do that in class if we we need four people though two and two or six people or eight we need two and two so hopefully one day everybody is there so good bye everybody have good luck with these equations", "IWYuPE8rkeE": "welcome friends today in the kitchen\nwe're gonna do something a little bit special we're going to do the 1880s\nPemberton coca-cola formula and so Pemberton is the guy who invented\ncoca-cola recipe he invented coca-cola in the hopes that\nhe could wean himself off of morphine with cocaine in the end it didn't work\nfor him. so so he came up with this formula and this is out of one of his\nnotebooks and it is by no means the recipe or formula the coca-cola uses\ntoday and they're very adamant about that but by making this it should give\nus a little bit of insight into where this product started and what it tasted\nlike at the beginning and often what things taste like way back then is\nnothing like they do today so I started out with some high proof alcohol you\nwant to get the highest proof that you possibly can and so what I've got is 76%\n152 proof grain alcohol that's the highest that I can get where I live if\nyou can get higher make sure it's food grade make sure that you can drink it\nbecause you can get yourself into very solid trouble if you don't make sure\nit's food grade which brings us to the next thing which are these essential\noils now I first wanted to do this back in 2011 what eight nine years ago I\nheard a broadcast This American Life on NPR and it was all about this formula\nand it really intrigued me and I wanted to do it and at that time everyone said\nto me don't bother you can't get all the ingredients and they were right I\ncouldn't get all the ingredients and you know what I still can't get all of the\ningredients so these are food grade oils that you need to get there in this form\npretty toxic you don't want to touch them you don't want to get them on you\nand there was one in particular that I couldn't get and that is neroli oil and\ntiny a little bottle of neroli oil like this\nthis is five mils of neroli oil was four hundred and eighty dollars us to get\nthis little bottle and the company said to me oh we can get it for you at a\ncheaper break if you buy four hundred pounds it's 1.2 million like I don't\nthink I need 400 pounds of neroli oil so the first thing we need to do is measure\ntiny little amounts of these essential oils and mix them into this alcohol and\nso I've got these tiny little syringes they're one milliliter each and we'll\nmeasure these out being very careful not to cross staminate not to get it on your\nhands and to get the right amounts so the oils we're working with our orange\nlemon nutmeg coriander neroli and cinnamon oil so the first substitution\nis bitter orange oil instead of Naru Li or neroli everyone seems to say that's\ngoing to be fine so this is our 7x formula this is the 7x\nflavoring and we're only going to use a tiny little bit of this for a couple\ngallons of coca-cola very tiny little bit the next substitution that you have\nto make is is the coca part it is illegal to have coca leaves in North\nAmerica and you need coca leaf extract there's no cocaine in coca-cola anymore\nthey they pull that out in a factory apparently in New Jersey and then only\nput in the bittering compounds from the coca leaf but since we can't have coca\nleaves I'm worked around a little bit and I found another extract that has\nsort of the same flavonoid bittering compounds and I'm gonna give that a try\nI think you should probably just leave it out though I'm a little worried\nobviously that wasn't a real coca leaf I'm a little worried that I'm not going\nto get it quite right so now we move on to the sugar syrup\ncomponent so we're gonna start it with some water in a big pot and the next thing is to weigh out the\nsugar so I know that everyone has been freaked out for years that you know\nperhaps way back there was cocaine and coca-cola I would posit that the real\nkiller in this soft drink is the sugar like that's a lot of sugar so and it\ngoes into the water and we want to just we just want to dissolve that we're\nmaking a simple syrup it's we'll just gently heat this and\nstir it until the sugar has dissolved while the sugar is dissolving I am going\nto juice some limes so the sugar is pretty much dissolved and now we just\nadd in caramel okay the sugar syrup is dissolved we\ndidn't bring it up to a boil we didn't really get it hot just warm enough that\nthe sugar crystals disappear into the water next in is vanilla I've got my\nnotes open because I just want to make sure I get this right so in goes the\nvanilla and I normally don't measure vanilla I free pour but somehow this\ntime I think it's important to to measure this is off to the point where\nif you were using extract of coca you would put it in we're not putting\nanything in and I decided not to put anything in in its place\nso next in is the caffeine extract now I know it's called coca after the coca\nleaf and cola after the Kola nut but by 1880 1885 Pemberton already wasn't using\nKola nut he was only using citrate of caffeine so directly he had decided that\nit wasn't the flavor that he was after it was the caffeine that he was after so\nhe stopped using Kola nut at that point and there's no reason to believe that\nCoca Cola is using Kola nut anymore so it's just straight caffeine\nmixture 3.75 mils and apparently this is about five times the amount of caffeine\nthat is in Cola beverages today at the store or any beverage today at the store\nare really high caffeine what's that goes in the lime juice so\nfreshly squozen lime juice and citric acid citric acid is something that is\nnot used in today's coke you can tell that because they use phosphoric acid I\nthink it is on the label they do list the acid that they use and that's it for\nthe sugar syrup okay so we've got our 7x flavor mixture and our sugar water\ncaramel mixture and there's a bit of math involved because you only use a\nvery little bit like 1.5 milliliters per liter of sugar syrup so I need to\nmeasure how much sugar syrup we have and then determine how much 7x to mix into\nit so it looks like two point two five liters so we need three milliliters of\n7x let's see living dangerously there we go mix that in let's just give that a\nstraight-up taste so this is this is really concentrated let's just see if\nit's even edible huh I can see where that's going\nlet's see what Julie thinks a little enthusiastic poor little yes on the\nfirst pour well I mean I want to make sure that the I know that the\ncarbonation mixed with the syrup and also I've over carbonated that keg of\nwater that's you got a kind of a brownish brown tone it smells very\nthere's no interesting there's it over Smith yeah like there's a smell to it\nyeah there I get a lime I do get a lime flavor overwhelming lime flavor okay\nthat's the it's sweet it is sweet it's very sweet but don't you sweet for me\nit's a refreshing beverage I like it it's not coke I think it's too sweet oh\noh no no no no but you can it would be considered a : it's a brown beverage\nyeah it would go well with people who like rum and coke it would do just fine\nPepsi do you think it's like Pepsi I I don't think I've ever had a Pepsi I\ndon't think I've ever had a Pepsi yeah you probably have anyway it doesn't\nmatter um no no but it's I can see how this evolved into coke this doesn't have\nthe bite that Coke has there's a bitter that sort of yeah yeah what I don't know\nthat's a lovely beverage so I would just might we make it less sweet yeah I would\nI would chop it some of the sugar I've definitely chopped it some of the\nsugar and maybe up the amount of 7x so an interesting experiment I think\nit's a worthwhile beverage yeah there's the funny fun right yeah I mean as much\nas we look very you know it is longer it's like we were we're not\nyeah it is a worthwhile beverage it's I would definitely drink it I don't know\nthat it's would stand up against beside a coke but in order to actually test\nthis we are going to do the ultimate Pepsi challenge we're going to test this\nagainst you stated yourself I know again well I am part of the Pepsi generation\nI'm gonna we're gonna do this Coke and Pepsi Canadian Coke and Pepsi okay\nMexican Coke and Pepsi okay Jessica just came true yeah oh okay the actual\nMexican Coke versus Mexican colas yes like the would probably find a hurry\ndose see if we can find the hurry toes Mexican Cola Inca Cola Inca Cola and\nwild card thumbs up thumbs up yeah yeah another colas type in the world and so\nwe'll do a blind tasting of all of them the reality is all of the large\nmanufacturers of beverages have multiple versions of their beverages that they\nserve sell it in multiple nations because everybody has a slightly\ndifferent palate depending upon what the reading and what they're matching it\nwith right so there's so many versions so if you want to try the 1886 Pemberton\nCoca Cola recipe give it a shot I mean there's a couple there's no cocaine\nthat's know so that might change the fact it's not good as exciting might\nhave been long ago with that shot of cocaine I think that's pretty good I\nthink that's pretty good and the fact that we now have two and a half liters\nof syrup I feel like we're gonna have to host a children's party between all the\nother beverages we've made recently yeah pop and chips for everybody two and a\nhalf liters yeah we're gonna we've got a lot of this to go through it next we're\nstopping by see you consume", "lRE2jOM1ndc": "hello how are you indicates make them we are going to answer a

another unboxing of a Saavik servo kind of went a little servo crazy lately here at the RC network and this is the new 1270 TG servo this is part of their new line of servos these things are part of the high voltage series and definitely have some pretty cool features now the 1270 series they have the 12 70 71 72 and 73 they all have slightly different traits and also different specs as far as a steel gear versus titanium gear they have different speeds they have an ultra speed they have an ultra torque monster torque all sorts of different variations so definitely check out the differences on those now I chose the 1270 and this is going to be going in a new project here at the RC network it's going to be going in an 8 scale project that I cannot quite reveal yet so with further ado let's take a look at this servo um you know once again I I'm just prone to stab ox I don't know why I just I've had several Saavik servos over the years and this one is one of my first that's going to be a not only a high speed one but also that's going to pack lots of torque for that 8th scale project now first off you definitely see the high voltage little icon right there 1270 t GT stands for titanium gear and 12 70s or new series so let's check out some of the specs on here as far as the speed of this thing at seven point four volts point 11 second response time and for some reason they only included the kilogram 35 right there but I just did a quick cross-reference and it's 400 and 87 inch ounces today this is going to be my most torquey servo so definitely going to be good for that eight skill project kind of see a little bit of a new top cap on this servo and we'll kind of do that here when we open this thing up so let's go ahead and open this up see what we get inside the box and take a look at this new servo from Samak so you know I've kind of mentioned this on a lot of the unboxings that I do for these Saavik psa's is uh I just love the box I don't know what it is but I just I love using these things for parts and whatnot and I just kind of sharpie up you know what project I'm working on you know whether it be the / or the scx10 through all the parts in there that way I don't go mine trying to figure out you know what's standard and what's metric and all that other stuff so inside here you know of course that great gold anodized aluminum case that it's in in just super good-looking servo to say the least let's go ahead and pull this thing out of the box and let's do some of the boring stuff first the hardware comes with is it's just great I mean it comes with those very wide shouldered screws to really kind of keep the servo and its holder and you know all the different grommets and hardware that you may need to install for your application so pretty cool servo horns lots of different options there you know different things for different vehicles and specs you have the little mounting screw there and you also got the little lock net or locking washer right there to to keep it all nice and tight as far as other things inside the package I always like to check this out in case there's a variation you get the SAVAK stickers which is always great and a little business card right here just kind of talking about the warranty which I've actually never had to use for a Saavik so good that they offer the warranty but I never had to use it so can't really tell you about it so one-year warranty on it and I'm sure it's limited to some degree so let's pull this thing out of the box here Wow long receiver lead and I think you know they definitely taken to consideration that people are going to be using this in larger vehicles considering the 500 almost inch ounces of torque and I'd have to guess on this thing about 12 inches in length on the receiver lead and you know really cool-looking servo here is kind of I guess somewhat streamlined it is kind of rounded over has that new kind of look to it which is pretty cool really dig the little high voltage kind of icon on there digit Corliss servo Corliss of course stands basically that it right when you first start turning the dial on your remote you're going to get immediate torque it's not going to ramp up so to speak so I on all very cool there's the official model number on there sv 12 70 TG titanium geared once again that's a little S logo right there on the far side which is pretty cool let's do a really quick size comparison a lot of guys out there have these 1258 but just want to go ahead and show you guys the difference in size which there is none so pretty much the same size servo so I mean you're looking at 166 inch ounces versus 487 oh my god so that's it for now guys I hope you guys enjoyed this little quick unboxing of the new 1270 series and that's it for now so if you have any questions once again about Saavik servos this one or the RC network in general please post it on down below and as always thumbs up and subscribe that's it for now guys over now", "JBP5DXbCBOs": "[Music] hey guys Matt Allen here welcome back to tactical Bassin today we are talking under spins and we are gonna give you everything we're talking about different styles different brands different colors why we throw which ones what they're for so that you can adapt and catch more fish there are all different shapes and sizes out there on the market of under spins and there are all sorts of different things that you can do you know like this guy which'll claps this is a stand-up this is just your standard under spin with a screw lock little tiny weedless you know everything under the Sun is out there I personally only use a handful I've really streamlined my fishing and I think that you should too now I'm not telling you you need to throw the brains I'm throwing I'm just saying you need to streamline your fishing I'm gonna show you what we fish with and why we fish with it and then you can adapt accordingly for your fishing you know there are only a handful that you need if you fill a couple niches if you get a finesse and then you get a heavier version with or without a screw lock and then you get a couple options in a weedless you're pretty much good to go it's that simple so we're running through some of my favorites and then the baits that we fish on them I keep baits really really simple they're basically three baits three baits that we fish with we use different sizes right but one's gonna be that kite eCPAT swinging impact everybody throws it it's like a senko they eat it skinny dipper or the Little Dipper and then the little shiner as well that Chi Tek Shaner different action more finesse II works extremely well let's start on the finesse end we'll go up from there where did I put him there he is this is a little cool bates head works really well for those true little finesse rigs we throw these all winter and anytime that you need to really finesse and I mean we've thrown these in what 10 videos that you guys have seen this is not brand new but this is one of the setups that we throw a lot little tiny finesse head throw it on your lightest bait casters throw it on a spinning rod throw it on four six eight pound line and it just works killer and it's a great option when they're not keying in on just the bare head like the know if I have any laying around here yeah here's one you know just like a little guppy head either the revenge darter head or the dirty jigs of guppy head we throw both of those if they're not keying in on that bare head on a certain day typically the reason why is because there's too much bait in the water so like this little guy will just crush fish but if there's tons and tons of little minnows you're just another minnow but if you go to an under spin and add that blade now you're a minnow that stands out from the crowd that's the difference if they won't eat this if you're throwing it and it's just not happening well then you go the other way you go to that bear swim bait you start putting fish in the boat so little tiny finesse with an exposed took you also have the option of little tiny finesse without an exposed took now this is a three OTT it's an owner flashy swimmer but this also comes in a one-off and that one ought literally fits a 2.8 or a 3.3 Kai Tech or fits really well on that four-inch shiner so this guy I think for this one yeah we'll put it on there for the sake of argument but really I would use the one on for the little guy not the three OTT but just take it screw it into the nose twist it on got some waves coming through here and then poke it all the way through and skin hook and now you're truly weedless but really with a three OTT I'd go to a little bit bigger body so again the option is true finesse with an exposed took or weedless and you can do that all the way up the range so this guy the three OTT I really like it on the three point eight tie tech I'll show you that so screwed into the nose we're gonna stab all the way through the body till it lays flush on top and then we just barely skin hook it and there's a three point eight that's truly weedless still with an under spin blade so if you're in cover or you're in grass or you're fishing hard on bottom you can stay weed less and it works incredibly well say you're not in cover well let's switch over and there's the exposed tech version this is the blade runner and you can get those with or without a screw lock on them so you can do it with a standard keeper or a screw lock the standard keeper is really really nice for like generic style baits see how the Kai tech has a rounded front when I cram that up on there they don't actually fit perfectly so oftentimes I'll just take this little barb and just cut it off completely because this lid holds really really well or you buy the other version the screw lock version and if you've seen under spins with screw locks and wondered how on earth you get a bait on there let me show you really quick it's actually easier than you would think we're know right through the nose just like any other bait slide that bait on up and it just takes practice to judge the right distance to pop out okay I'm starting to pop out bring that around now I'm bunched up over here all we're gonna do is take the entire bait we're gonna start twisting it on start twisting and then the tail we come through and follow it around there's a full rotation bring that tail through and there we are that's simple just twist it around and follows its way right on I actually missed my distance a little bit on that one there we go perfect so that's a 3/8 ounce head paired with a 3.8 Kai Tak then if you want to go bigger used to dapped accordingly yeah 4.8 Kai Tak exposed head same deal here with or without the barb this one I'm just gonna put on there a lot of times that Barb's just exposed but great and there are plenty of other brands out there but these are the ones that I personally throw the same ones Tim throws get that barb to stick in there just a little bit so that's actually a three-quarter ounce head with a 4.8 Kai Tak but you could throw that 4.8 on a 3/8 ounce head half ounce head one ounce head whatever fish is extremely well as you get larger with the hook size you also get larger the blade size with every brand it's very very consistent you want to keep that in mind because the larger the blade gets the bigger the bait needs to be to offset the blades the blade itself has resistance drag in the water and that drag is going to be offsetting the drag of the tail kick so if I put too small of a swimbait on here if I put a little guy on here there's not enough kick the blade takes over and it'll want to roll that rig upside down and have the blade spinning so you really want to adapt accordingly if the blades bigger you need a bigger bait the blades smaller you can do a smaller bait and then everywhere in between now color color is very dependent on your personal preference if I could only have one it would be straight silver and I pair that straight silver up with all sorts of natural colors but if you've got cloudy water now this is a horrible pairing color wise but I'm just gonna put it on here so you could see how the bait looks there's a little reaction innovations Little Dipper little guy on there that little bugger see the gold color shines in not that true muddy water see if I'm going true muddy water I'm either going to be throwing that one's big but a chartreuse right chartreuse or chartreuse blue or plain white like that guy there because those colors stand out really well in that muddy muddy water and plain whites fantastic clean white the silver blade works really well but when you start getting that in-between dingy colored water it's not mud it's not clear I mean that's that's when the gold really starts to shine that gold works really really well and then when that water clears up then I'm going natural then I'm going to the grays and the silvers and typically we fish fairly clear water you know three feet of visibility up to unlim you know 10 20 30 feet of visibility anywhere in there I'm I'm typically focused around a silver head silver white and then at those larger sizes you can also go weedless so there's a five up flashy swimmer and then it's amazing you know the industry is always adapting so as baits are getting bigger so are the solutions you saw me pull out that big under spin that like ounce or ounce two quarter that's a 12.12.2012 one on three OTT five on a tot 10.12 OTT you could take the 7.8 Chi tek and put it on here a lot of the garage baits that are out there and put them on here with a big saltwater swim baits on here and you've got that weedless underspin or you can put them on those big heavy exposed hooks as well keep it simple there's so many brands out there down in the video description we're gonna link to some of our favorites the same stuff that I just showed you here but keep it simple carry a weedless and an exposed hook in those key sizes so that you can adapt if the bite is tough or the water is cold you throw those little bitty guys then as it warms up you're just matching the hatch if the bait fish in your lake are this big you throw that 3.30 or a 3.8 if the bait fish in your lake are big you go bigger you just adjust accordingly and then you want again you want an exposed took and a weedless hook exposed hooks are great in open water they're fantastic when bass are schooling on bait the key to that under spin is flash you got a drill that home the key to the understand is flash if there's a lot of bait fish in the water that is the time for an under spin it's just like a spinner bait only it's more natural you've ditched the skirt you've ditched the giant blades you've streamlined everything it's easy for me and big ones they fall for it man they fall for it in winter they fall for it in summer they fall for it everywhere in between the big ones love eatin those under spins they just wolf them and then the weedless is amazing yeah you throw it in the cover say you got a laydown log you know bass or bustin you gotta lay down you know that the best fish in the lot is gonna be sitting right there in the cover you take that weedless pitch it up there cuz if you throw an exposed took in there and you start trying to creep through cover you're gonna hang up you're gonna blow your spot you adapt and get that weedless out put it up there creep through and you can pluck those fish right out of that heavy cover whether it's wood docks rock Tooley's and grass doesn't matter you can take that bait little adaptations and use it for everything but if the fish are around bait fish if they're keyed on minnows and their schooling the under spin out fish is just about everything almost every time hope that helps you guys down in the video description will link your gear I didn't even get into rods and reels all that stuff but I'll link you the exact year that we like to throw it on down there along with all the baits and then you can just adapt accordingly for your fishing style whatever that may be so that you can start sticking more fish take the concept apply it to your lake you're gonna start getting them hit that like button subscribe to the channel we appreciate your support down in the comments if you have

Chip Recipe Hello and welcome back to In the Kitchen with\nMatt, I am your host Matt Taylor. Today, I am going to show you how to make\ncrispy crunchy potato chips, or in other parts of the world, potato crisps. They are really easy to do, if I can do it,\nyou can do it, let's get started. All right we start with cold water in a bowl,\nyou don't have to measure it exact, and then I am going to add about 2 tsp. of salt to\nthis, and make a nice little brine solution, go ahead and just stir the salt in. Now we need some potatoes, I have two russet\npotatoes here, you can peel them and get the skins off if you like, I never do, I like\nthe skins, now we want to slice them to make our potato chip shape. Now to do that I am going to use a mandolin\nslicer, I really like this one, I will put a link down below where you can pick one up. Or you could just use a knife, but it takes\na long time, and it is really hard to get them exactly the same thickness, and we really\nwant these the same thickness, now for these the ideal thickness is about 1/8 of an inch\nthick, and on mine, that setting is a number 2. Okay and then you just set it on top of your\nbowl, and you take the potato, go across like that, okay. I will just kind of show you how then one,\nis see, it's a nice perfect slice, that we can crisp up to make a potato chip, and you\nshould probably put a guard on top, so you don't hit your fingers, and I will just discard\nthis piece. All right and once you have all of your potato\nslices in this bowl of cold salty water, we want to let this sit and let this soak for\n15 to 20 minutes, and what this going to do, this salty solution is it is going to, is\nit is going to leach out or bring out the starch, most of the starch in the potato,\nif we don't do that the starch when it gets hot turns into sugar, and that gets burned\nreally easy, when you put it in the oil, so that is why if you have ever tried to make\npotato chips in oil how they burned really quick before they are done, we don't want\nthat, we want these to be a nice blonde looking chip or crisp, here we go, let this sit. Now meanwhile what we do while this is sitting,\nis we take a large pot, this is just a stew pot and I have it half way full of water,\nnow I am going to add about two tablespoons of vinegar and what we are going to do is\nwe are going to bring this to a boil and add our potato slices to it, why are we doing\nthat, this is a further process to get more of that starch out, and also what it will\ndo is it will precook the potato a little bit, it is a really cool process and works\nreally well, takes some more time to do it this way, but it is well worth it. All right once our water starts to boil, what\nwe are going to do is I am going to take about half of these, and go ahead and put them in\nthere, and we are just going to move them around so they are separated, so we are just\ngoing to pretty much do these in stages, so it winds up being about a full potato, per\nstage, depending on how big your bowl is, we are going to boil these for three to four\nminutes, and we will stir them occasionally. Now when our three minutes is up, I have a\nbaking sheet here, lined with kitchen towel, or paper towel, and then we just want to take\nour potatoes, and we are going to lay them out so they can dry, and you kind of want\nthem separated, they might stick together a little bit, now I am going to put this last\nbatch in. And once we have all of our potatoes boiled,\nI am going to go ahead and remove this, and empty out this liquid, and then I think I\nwant to use this same pot for my oil, make sure it is dry, you don't want to add oil\nto water inside your pot, and I am going to go ahead and turn this on medium, and then\ntake my canola oil, or you could use peanut oil, and we want to put in about an inch inch\nand a half deep. In this case I used 1.4 liters, or 48 ounces,\nnow we want to heat this oil to 325 degrees F. All right and once we are at 325 it is\ntime to start frying our potatoes. So what you do is you just take your potatoes,\nand put them in, and I am going to do about a third of the ones that I have here, just\nto make sure I have plenty of room, we are going to fry these somewhere between five\nand fifteen minutes, and what we are going to do is we are just going to gently move\nthese around like this with our spoon here, I could probably put a few more in there,\nbut we don't want them to get over crowded, make sure they can get nice and, every little\narea can get nice and fried, and we are going to keep doing this until they just get slightly\ngolden, and usually all of the bubbles, will subside a little bit, and that is how you\nknow they are done, we will give it a couple of more minutes here, and these should be\ngood to go. These look good they are slightly golden brown,\nthere is no more bubbles, I am going to go ahead and take them out, use your spoon and\nthen I am going to put them on a paper towel lined plate here, so they can drain, that\nwill give you an idea of what they look like, when they come out of the oil. And what we are going to do is just let them\nsit there and dry a little bit, and uh, I am going to take some salt, awesome, I am\njust going to grab one of these, give it a taste, oh yeah, hear that crunch, wow, these\nare amazing, mmm. So this gives you an idea of about how much,\nhow many chips, or crisps, 2 medium sized russet potatoes make, it's a fair amount,\nit's awesome it is enough for two or three servings. All right, our crispy crunchy potato chips,\nor crisps, are done. They turned out amazing, they are really easy\nto do, super crunchy, they do take a fair amount of time to make, so if you have a craving\nfor potato chips, just go to the store and buy a bag, but if you have the patience, to\nmake them at home, they are well worth it, you won't be disappointed, go out there and\nmake your own, I am Matt Taylor this has been another episode of In the Kitchen with

I figured I'd just show you a recent load I just came up with here or a recent combo I guess I'm working with some of these ballistic products sold there just chat a two and three-quarter inch holes come pre-primed got federal 12s three odd and a one ounce drive key slug you know cast out of a scrap metal I picked out of the you know the yard or whatever so far with these an issue that I've had with these is a the cup this is like a 1 to 1 8 ounce shot cup and the slug is not tall enough to fit in here now we know that people say this kind of works really well maybe with a star crimp but if you're trying to roll crimp these it's it's way to to cut this way too deep for the 1 ounce and especially the 7/8 balance it'll be even your even deeper so the next thing I'm gonna try is the 12s 0 which is a 7 8 ounce cup and I think I can get away with maybe just one of these mini nitro spacers 20 gauge so it's actually kind of nice for these new holes there maybe a little expensive I could probably get maybe a couple of real oohs out of them but I'm running blue dot and the way I load these is light on here the 134 powder I guess insert they call them I do that twice and I notice that the thing will throw in consistent powder charges unless you cut tap it she do that that's thrown about 45 grains of blue dot roughly you just take your wad with two nitros and a one on slug you drop it in there right I'll see fine I can do this one-handed I know other people on YouTube have been saying that you notice how you got a good amount to roll there still I have tried these two and a half inch tenets there are shorter shorter wad but these guys are just a little bit too short and maybe these would work really well with a 7/8 ounce slug with a maybe is still a shorter double A or EE 12 wide or something like that well I think that down range blue with a 7/8 ounce in one mini nitro would probably work really well with these two and half inch anyway I'll show you this I had a drill press Harbor Freight whenever is cheap gets the job done I set the depth so it bottoms out where I want put the guy down there 600 rpm on the press oh I just take a paper towel spray some rub oil on it get you some oil in there that's all you need till the bottoms out and the way I set this as I went down until I could hear the inside of the the roll Carper touch the top of the slug now we're going to kind of know that's where I need I'll show you this closer in a minute it really makes a really nice alright this is a finished product on the Jedi two and three-quarter inch hole comes pre-primed which is kind of nice with about 45 grains of blue dot a federal 12s three wad to 20 gauge mini nitro cards and a li 1 ounce drive key slug I'll see how closing it out here but uh they crimp came out awesome and I like to clear you know it's actually clear is great for shot development because you can really see what the heck is kind of going on here but uh kind of see see what's shakin check these out and maybe see just a little bit see right there on that slug where that kind of rubbed a little bit that's from the roll crimper and let's having issues I've tried a couple different wads I tried the Windjammer wad which is a light blue clay Buster wad that has a really thin pedal on it and the slugs when you jiggle it they you know has a tendency to kind of jiggle unless you're really put like an aggressive role crimp on there I'm talking like you know really drive that sucker down it kind of jiggles this wide it will jiggle a little bit with this Cup unless you have two of these nitro cards and mini nitros I also have the the larger nitro cards which are the these are the small ones the 0.07 own mini nitros I also have the the regular nitro cards which with a thicker I think point one to five but these it's just a little bit to focus on there but these are just a little bit too thin so one of these will still have a jiggle this cup I was saying before federal also I actually I like these wads a lot because they they fit the slug like perfectly they'll go right down the barrel and I don't think these are gonna get tore up like some of the other wads have tried I like the clay Buster like this one here hey Buster fun these have a tendency to get kind of tore up if you try pushing this down a cylinder bore barrel it's real tight I mean you can't get the slug down in one of these I also tried just for the hell of it I bought a bag of these a short shell 12-gauge wads these are the real shorties that ballistic product sells thinking that maybe I could make some kind of like handy little two-and-a-half inch shells with these the problem of these is uh the cup the the pedals are way too thick the slug won't fit in there and it's a real tight yeah real real tight fit and actually if you try chambering it it won't it won't really chamber all that well so anyway so this is kind of a the result you get and using that drill press works out awesome versus a hand drill the hand drill they kind of come out all crooked then it's hard to get consistent results here with a depth set I get very consistent results the slug is pretty much seated in there exactly on all of these the crimp comes out real nice looking you know like a factory slug and you know the cost is a little bit higher with you know with these pre-primed should I holes I'm hoping maybe I can get a couple reloads out of them I'm using the the BPI they're the premium real crimper is it's an all-metal real crimper yeah you know Harbor Freight drill press you know I'm nothing special you know get the job done kind of drill press this is what we're looking for man we're looking for nice nice crimps all right looks good they're all the same height is all the same right they look awesome all right like pull some of these out of your pocket oh yeah I'm a decent home what that's awesome right so that's what we're going for right we're home for hopefully shoots real well I think these are gonna shoot great these wads are really good they're strong in the bottom here I've got the you know those cards really help you gotta have a card in here because these drive key slugs man they they just beat the hell out of a regular plastic wad especially if you're firing this thing you know Magnum you know blue dot you know as a much prouder as possible without blowing up your shotgun tape low 45 greens is that's that's up there that's I use 45 grains I use 43 grains of H 110 and my 500 Smith and Wesson Magnum this has got more powder of course obviously different powder but still 45 grains of smokeless powder is a lot of powder and you'll it'll indent the plastic will actually like indent into here and you'll cut the you know the base of the wad so you have to have a MetroCard and having to you know cost a little more money or whatever per shot but this is gonna come out of there nice and straight that's right", "iv5PRIrRBMw": "All right! In this video I will teach you how to convert from pounds to kilograms We say that a pound is a unit of mass while the kilogram is the Basic unit of mass in the international system of SI units one pound Is represented by its symbology is lb while the kilogram is kg One pound owned 0.4535 kilograms while one kilogram Owns 2,2046 pounds Well having these Having this data Then proceed to perform Our operations or our exercises Which tells us to convert five hundred and fifty Three hundred thirty-five and one hundred and eighty-seven pounds a kilogram Let's see the first five hundred Fifty pounds to kilograms then I say 550 pounds for a kilogram and its equivalent in pounds of two point forty-six pounds. Then how he is dividing tacho pound with pound and multiplied five hundred and fifty By one kilogram between two points Twenty forty six as a result Two hundred and forty-nine point forty-seven, which is equivalent to or can be rounded to Two hundred forty-nine point fifty kilograms The second exercise tells us convert Three hundred and thirty-five pounds per kilogram I do the same Multiple the three hundred thirty-three pounds By one kilogram and its equivalent in pounds which is two point twenty forty-six pounds Pound pound with pound because it is dividing As a result it would be one hundred and fifty-one point ninety-one hundred the rounded Would be 152 kilograms The third and last exercise, I say One hundred and eighty-seven pounds a kilogram I do the same Multiplied by one kilogram and its equivalent In pound, which is Two point twenty forty six pounds Pound pound with pound and I have left Eighty-four point eighty-two kilograms All right!

Mossberg 590 a one special purpose 20-inch barrel and this has a cylinder bore choke shooting the brenneke Blackmagic Magnum 3-inch slug and evidenced by the packaging of the angry bear this load is designed for hunting large game so I had some assistance from a bear light creature in opening the video a very powerful slug one and three-eighths ounces this is it on the right compared to the foster slug one else on the left this one in 3/8 ounce slug has an advertised velocity of 1500 two feet per second that's going to give you just over three thousand foot-pounds of energy at the muzzle you'll notice what appears to be a plastic stabilizer on the slug that's actually the wadding or compressed paper wadding you'll have that in your foster slugs but we don't have that in this when I cut it open I have just the slug and the plastic attached to the slug and the shell and the powder of course that's it this also has a hardened lead in other words when we've tested this foster slug you may have seen a couple of those videos it will fragment in a soft target this is not supposed to do that it's going to take something pretty serious to break this apart so let's go back and look at what happened with those opening shots this first shot was from 30 feet this is rather was a 30 gallon tub plastic tub it was full of water you can see it busted all the way through that's approximately 250 pounds of weight I have 180 pounds of sand as a backstop after passing through the water tub it went into this first bag of sand and stocked about right there that's approximately seven seven and a half inches here is the brenneke it broke into two pieces you can see the plastic flyer there on the left and the slug on the right and really isn't deformed in any manner second shot was also from 30 feet two by 8 inch pine boards untreated there's the entry point on the first one there's six of these lined up by the way exit there's an entry on number two external number two entry on number three all the way through number three and to number four that's how to number four into number five and it shattered this one and let's see what happens here it stopped there so it just about poked all the way through number five but had a pretty good impact on number six let's take a quick look at that so this is the back of board number five I'm not going to bother to dig the plastic part out it's embedded in there pretty good and by the way these boards are one and a half inches thick so we have approximately seven and a half inches of penetration plus the half inch or so in board number six where this poke through to some extent but check this out I mean we're really not getting a deformed slug and that's after eight inches of penetration in pine board at thirty feet and finally shot number three was also from 30 feet with the Mossberg and I guess you would expect that as we increase the density and the hardness of the materials that we are eventually going to have less penetration that obviously happened here we stopped at the back of the first cinderblock and we actually in this case caused some damage to the brenneke I'm not finding that plastic section anywhere it could be fully intact on the ground I just haven't come across it yet but we finally had an impact on the brenneke now for the next test we're going to step back and go to a really soft material let's check it out next up is a block of the sim test media this is calibrated comparable to 10% ordnance gel typically my blocks come in at 50 pounds this one is super-sized 60 pounds and we're going to be tagging it from 30 feet with this brenneke I think that might be a new record for flipping a ballistic block especially since this one was heavier you may have noticed a point of impact was centered but it was low nonetheless it stayed in the block at least just for a second all the way through the 21 inch length passed through and as it came out the exit was a little bit higher than the point of impact after going through the block we had 180 pounds of sand for the backstop and it is somewhere in that first bag of sand let me dig it out after passing through the 21 inch block and then the plastic tub it had only enough momentum to get one inch into the sandbag by the way there's the plastic piece and given where it is sitting I'm thinking it made the pass through the block and then fell off once the slug hit that plastic tub that's what I'm thinking happen but here it is looks very much like what we saw with that water shot earlier let's take a quick look at what this did to the block I've got the entire 21 inches of the block laid out for you it pretty much broke itself in half once I started cutting just because of the sheer size of this permanent cavity from top to bottom on this half and the bottom being actually the bottom of the block because the low hit it is running four inches at its widest point in this direction and you can see that covers quite a big area and on this side the cavity runs to about the 13 inch mark I think that's misleading because when I come over to this side again the huge nature of this it's running all the way out where it tapers down to approximately the 18 inch mark and of course it exit out the back so four inches at its widest point which it's actually most of the block running this direction then when you get into the actual track where the slug was running that is one and a half inches deep on this side and about one and a quarter to one and a half on this side so even though it didn't expand it's making a channel about three inches of diameter in addition to all the damage that is causing just from that incredible amount of energy you I hope the video Illustrated for you that while very very impressive this is not the best choice for home defense in a shotgun it is specifically designed for hunting large game or large game that likes to hunt large game thanks for watching", "legh0mQe9p4": "hello this is an unboxing video manufacturer number H one two three seven five two federal cartridge 12-gauge shot shells I'm gonna open it up with you so you can see what they look like you can see the length is a 12 gauge 2 and 3/4 inches 1.10 1/8 ounce of shot to a seven and a half shot and it's your heavy field load there's 25 shot shells in here", "gN9PYfZ5r8E": "so just in case you don't know already real pong hue is the ash of a special type of grass called the pong pong grass and when you add this special ash to wheat dough it makes the dough stretch better and makes the noodles taste better most hand-pulled noodle chefs will rely on panghui to quickly produce good-tasting hand-pulled noodles for their restaurant but the thing is as chinese cooking demystified pointed out well basically all lamian chops use this brand of bagpung way this stuff isn't actually the ash of the halogeetan arachnoidias plant either see given how much lanzhou lamiana has consumed in china you could imagine that there just wasn't enough ash to go around so in 1989 researchers at the lanzhou university in gansu developed this stuff a mix of additives that is the pung hue used throughout china today and that sums up the situation really well very few noodle masters actually use the authentic ash instead they will use a replacement that functions the same as the ash but actually is just a mix of different compounds now what can be considered a good replacement for pung hoi a good punghoy replacement when added to wheat dough needs to do two things one it needs to make the dough stretch better and two it needs to make the cooked noodles strong and chewy and that's it as long as a punghoy replacement does these two things then it is a successful pong hue replacement no matter what it's actually made of as you may have guessed there are many possible pong way replacements out there that you can use but and here's the big problem all these replacements have some issue or another let me show you the most commonly used penguin replacement is a mix of salt sodium carbonate sodium tri-poly tripolyphosphate and sodium metabisulfite in case you don't know the salt sodium carbonate and sodium metabisulfite help with the dose stretch the salt and alkali make the dough stretch evenly and alkali also helps a bit with the needle texture and then the sodium metabisulfite is actually the dough relaxer that makes the dough stretchy sodium tri-poly phosphate on the other hand makes the cooked noodles strong and chewy although this pungaway replacement achieves both of the functional goals of panghui it has a wide plethora of other issues first these chemicals are not healthy to ingest and they are a huge skin irritant its effect is only temporary and on top of that it is not available outside of china you can also make this punghoy replacement at home by mixing the four chemicals together yourself but it is very difficult to obtain these chemicals and it is also dangerous to work with these chemicals for restaurant production given that you have a good relationship with the punghoy manufacturer in china it should be decent except for the fact that it's a skin irritant so wear gloves or something but for most people i mean it's impossible to even get a hold of this and of course there's the issue of serving phosphates and sulfites which are not very healthy to your customers in your restaurant without declaring them this is not the only commercial pong hoi replacement though a different brand known as lanjo nirolami and wang uses different substances to achieve the same effect most people have never heard of this brand before so let me explain a bit about how it works this panghui replacement contains xanthan gum calcium sterile lactolate amylase xylenase and lipase now all these ingredients except for lipase function to improve the texture of the cooked noodles lip base is kind of a weird addition and i think it just helps to eliminate oil from the dough so that it doesn't get in the way of gluten now this is not ideal because although we do have things that improve the texture of the cooked noodles we have nothing to actually make the dough stretchy like a dough relaxer but this is actually not really that much of an issue because i think what you're supposed to do is you're just supposed to use a high hydration dough to make the dose stretch and that will work just fine this brand in my opinion is one step above the first punghoy replacement i mentioned because it uses completely safe chemicals look them up they are all completely safe very natural and are not skin irritants however one problem with this brand is still that it's really hard for people outside of china to buy it or if you want to buy the components and mix them together yourself it's hard to find all these except xanthan gum how could i ever find calcium sterile lactoly or amylase at my grocery store i also have never tried out this brand myself and i'm sure there are other issues that i'm not aware of another punghway replacement is nutritional yeast introduced by tim chin from series eats if you haven't seen his original hand pulled noodle tutorial you should definitely check it out after this video ends and it will be linked in the description tim chin is an absolute genius and his research into dough relaxers changed hand pulled noodles forever now what makes nutritional yeast so great although nutritional yeast is not a commercially produced punghoi replacement nutritional yeast does contain a natural dough relaxer called glutathione and that's why it's viable in hand pulled noodles and also why i made an entire video about the subject now the real factor that made nutritional yeast a big deal is because nutritional yeast is actually commonly available you can just go to any grocery store and find nutritional yeast it's also healthy natural safe and definitely not a skin irritant at all however it is not a complete panghui replacement because there's nothing that makes the noodles strong and chewy many people who use nutritional yeast find themselves with very weak or soggy noodles it is possible to make good noodles with nutritional yeast but it takes a lot of practice nutritional yeast also imparts a weird cheesy flavor on the noodles but this is not the biggest issue be sure to watch my video about nutritional yeast to learn more about it it will be linked down in the description now there's also one more option which is to just use flour water and salt and nothing else many people say that this is impossible but that's not true of course many people have done this including myself it just requires more skill to make hand pulled noodles with just flour salt and water so that's where we are today i am very unsatisfied with all of these options an ideal pung-hoi substitute in my opinion has to meet four requirements it has to make the dough stretchy of course it has to make the noodles strong and chewy of course but it also has to be safe natural and harmless and it has to be commonly available so that you can make handled noodles at home this is a tall order but i have found a perfect solution so keep watching this video so i've tested and experimented with 20 to 30 potential new punk way substitutes but one of them really stood out to me as the perfect solution this was a simple combination of glutathione xanthan gum and salt now we've never talked about xanthan gum before so let me give you a rundown of what it does in hand pulled noodles now first is a hundred percent safe especially in the quantities we're going to be using the main function of xanthan gum is to provide strength and chew to the noodles now lots of other things also strengthen noodles but xanthan gum is one of the very few that actually does so with little to no downsides sodium tripolyphosphate strengthens noodles but it is unhealthy and hard to get salt and alkalize also strengthen noodles but the problem with those is that you can only add a very small amount of salt or alkalis otherwise they will make the dough stiff and hard to work with and not stretchy xanthan gum on the other hand can be found at many grocery stores as well as online and it does not make the dough stiffer or anything like that now there is one very very small downside let's run the side by side comparison so here's two identical dose except the one on the left has xanthan gum you can see that during the stretch and fold stage the two doughs are practically identical and that just shows how xanthan gum does not make the dough stiffer or anything now i've loaded these doughs up with way more nutritional yeast and way more water than usual to make sure the cooked noodles are soggy but watch as i put the noodles into the pot only one of the batches is soggy and breaking and the other is still strong can you guess which one that is yup the batch with xanthan gum just look at the side by side comparison and see for yourself which you would rather be eating [Music] now remember i said there was one tiny tiny downside to xanthan gum well it's that it makes the noodles less even see how there's a super thick one there i promise i tried my best to do the same technique for both those but the xanthan gum batch was definitely less even but i say that this is only a small problem because it is easily fixed by adding just a bit more salt using xanthan gum in moderation and obviously pulling the noodles with good technique even the batch of noodles with xanthan gum that i used in this very experiment could be easily fixed when i added just a modest amount of salt and i was once again able to get perfectly even noodles even though there is xanthan gum in this dough and remember i added way too much water and nutritional yeast than you should ever use in this test if you actually remove the unnecessary water and no relaxer and also use xanthan gum you can get noodles that are just perfect chewy strong that rival those from most hand-pulled noodle restaurants i've ever been to now i know that some of you may be saying that xanthan gum can't possibly make for authentic hand-pulled noodles but i think zanthinko makes perfectly authentic hampled noodles first of all the brand of punghoy i introduced earlier uses xanthan gum so if they can use it why can't i second of all there is a lot of documentation about using hydrocolloids in chinese noodles and you can just read this article which i'll link to in the description to learn more about it it's really fascinating but that's just xanthan gum there's two other ingredients in my perspective punghoy replacement which are glutathione and salt now glutathione as i said before is a dough relaxer or reducer and thus its job is to make the dough stretchy and extensible what if you don't have access to glutathione powder no worries at all just use nutritional yeast which itself contains glutathione obviously if you're using nutritional yeast you will want to use different proportions so that the total amount of glutathione is unchanged and lastly salt i said before is to help the dough stretch evenly as well as to dilute the other ingredients now to use my new punghoy no new techniques or steps are required start by mixing together flour water and salt rest the dough for a couple hours then add doses of pung hoi substitute into the dough along with water over and over until the dough stretches properly and then bam we have hand pulled noodles this is just the same procedure that i have been talking about for months and the only difference is that every time you add water you also add a bit of the punghoy substitute as well and using this pungboy substitute will make the process easier and faster and the needles will have a better texture and of course if you find proportions that you like there are no consequences to just mixing this punghoy substitute straight into the flour at the very beginning before you add water how much salt xanthan gum and glutathione should we use well i like to use 74 salt 24 xanthine gum and 2 glutathione glutathione percentage is low because doe relaxers should only be used in very low concentrations xanthan gum should be between 20 to 40 percent because if it is too low it will have a negligible effect and if too high it will start to make the noodles uneven as i was saying earlier and there will not be enough salt to control that unevenness to make the punk white substitute first crush up 74 grams of salt to crush it up efficiently you'll want to dilute the salt with water just barely enough to completely dilute the salt and then heat it for a long time to evaporate the water once dried use a mortar and pestle to crush up the salt and the salt will fall apart into powder once the salt is crushed add to it 24 grams of xanthan gum and 2 grams of glutathione some scales have trouble weighing small amounts so you may want to do a 2x or 4x batch to increase accuracy mix very very thoroughly make sure to smash the clumps of glutathione because glutathione tends to clump together and you want that distributed as evenly as possible once those are all mixed together transfer it to an airtight jar and you will have yourself pong hue that is all ready to go now if you're using nutritional yeast you'll want to use different proportions of course something like 88 nutritional yeast 3 xanthan gum and 9 salt should do fine just remember if your nutritional yeast comes in flakes you'll want to crush that up into powder before you mix it in with the other ingredients now let's talk about alternatives is using glutathione xanthan gum and salt the only solution no as i mentioned earlier i've tried over 20 different pung hoi substitutes and there are lots more i haven't tried the two places where we can kind of mix and match are with the dough relaxer and the noodle texture improver with the dough relaxer you can switch glutathione out for other dough relaxers such as sodium metabisulfite cysteine or even proteas however the effect should be roughly the same across the board i strongly prefer glutathione or nutritional yeast however because they are the most healthy options and they are also relatively available with the noodle texture improver there are also a wide plethora of options first i want to mention that adding an egg has a similar effect to adding xanthan gum however i do not care for the noodle texture that egg produces and using an egg is also not as flexible as xanthan gum on the plus side though everyone owns eggs so you can feel free to give that a try another solution is using completely safe noodle enhancers such as calcium sterile lactolate or glycerol monastery or monoglycerides or xylenase but frankly i'm not about to order all of these obscure substances from all the dark corners of the internet and try them all out maybe one of you has access to some of these and can make an even better punghoy substitute another option is you can just go straight into the some of the potentially less safe noodle improvers such as sodium tripolyphosphate or sodium pyrophosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate or sodium dihydrogen phosphate propylene glycol algae and the list goes on and on but remember the requirements it has to make the dough stretchy it has to make the noodles strong it has to be safe natural and harmless and it also has to be commonly available at least for an effective easy and available punk way those are the requirements that make sense to me these requirements actually eliminate a lot of the possibilities which makes this quite a hard problem but now you know my solution glutathione or nutritional yeast plus xanthan gum plus salt using this punghoi substitute has allowed me to create some of the best hand pulled noodles i've ever made in my life and i never have to worry about the dough not stretching or the noodles not tasting good or not being safe or anything i am satisfied a few final thoughts the name i'm going to use for my pung hoi replacement is pong hoi x for both the nutritional yeast version and the glutathione version my initial thought was that x stands for xanthan gum but in chinese this would probably translate to pong hui yi because yi is the only character that looks like x and also can sometimes mean stability why stability i honestly think this is basically the ultimate solution to making hand pulled noodles at home pong hoi x is just as easy and effective as the pung hoi in the blue packet and it's way more healthy in everything honestly even restaurants should use this because the way that the xanthan gum strength complements the gluten's chew tastes so similar to how the real pung-hoi would strengthen the noodles but there's no aftertaste of rotten eggs that you would get with sodium bisulfite now before the video ends i just want to mention one more thing which is that the only functional flaw that i see with pung hoi x is that it doesn't quite dissolve in water because xanthan gum doesn't dissolve in water you can still do the same routine where you dilute the phoenix water and add the water but there's always bits of xanthan gum floating around so you may want to add it similar to how you would add nutritional yeast which is adding it dry and then adding water separately now the cleanest way is to just add it into the flour dry of course but sometimes your ratio is just a bit off and you just need to add more punk way to the dough if it weren't for this one tiny thing of not dissolving it would just be so much better and one more thing is for those of you who are ambitious obviously feel free to play around with the ratios of the ingredients i think that in six months i myself might even be using a slightly different ratio so we'll see what happens anyway thanks for watching check out my video about nutritional yeast if you haven't already and i'll see you in the next video", "np7ZM4q4p4A": "I'm Elaine hilum in this video I'm going to show you how to use et eyes and vertex light and biotechs

different sizes the one gallon kit is ideal for coating bars and tabletops while the half gallon kit exclusive to large projects but for smaller projects such as placemats photo frames and clocks a smaller kit will be sufficient to calculate the amount of resin you need measure your project dimensions and use ET is online flood Coast calculator it's always best to mix a little more in very excite than you need you'll need a painters drop sheet of protective eyewear graduated measuring mixing cup stirred 6 with a flat end a disposable brush a handheld barbecue lighter and in biotechs lights for larger projects you can use a chef's butane torch instead make sure you use cups with smooth flat walls and a flat bottom this will aid with proper mixing avoid wax-coated cups as the wax can peel away and contaminate the resins apply not absorbent tape or a generous coat of paste wax to the back edges of the projects once the ribbon has cured you can remove the tape along with any drips and it will leave a clean edge behind protect your workspace with a drop sheet or several layers of newspaper elevate the item approximately 2 inches above the work area making sure it's level this will allow the resin to self level and any excess to flow over the edges of the project and vertex light works best when the room temperature is between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit if the bottles are present feel cool to the touch warm them up in warm tap water for 5 to 10 minutes if you mix the resin when it's cold it will result in a cloudy finish filled with microscopic bubbles now put on your gloves and protective eyewear and measure out one part of resin and one part of hardener it's important that you measure each part exactly even if you need the whole kit for your project here you can see that there is slightly more resin list than hardness mix the resin and hardener together four to four minutes making sure you scrape down the walls and bottom of the container to free any unmixed resin that's fair occasionally scrape off perfect now transfer the resin into the second container and stir for another full minute with a clean stir stick pour the resin evenly over your project and carefully work it out to the edges with the long side of a stir stick or a business card use a disposable brush to smooth out the drifts along the side edges you will need to repeat this until the coating is firm enough that it no longer drips and biotech life and self level provided you have applied enough resin to the surface bubbles will rise to the surface of the coating and about 15 minutes after pouring you can pop these by gently exhaling on them or by passing a flame over the surface use a gentle sweeping motion until a bubbles are gone you can do this again if needed while the resin is still liquid allow the resin to cure in a warm dust free place where it won't be disturbed here I've elevated a piece of cardboard over the project and then draped it with a drop sheet to keep dust away from the curing resin it will take 8 hours to reach soft cure and approximately 72 hours to reach hard cure with just one coat application and biotechs light will give you a beautiful

is cannabis product that has come from California so instead of like the rice we're gonna use the base is this fire og okay so there's our rice I'm hoping we can get this to be like super perfect so

just gonna kind of get this snake puff the parchment nice one right that's even I for a moment was like is this too much no not so that's two and a half grams of shatter its wow so we can get some of this cake batter which is like our whipped oh gee deliciousness so that'll be a full gram of cake batter Wow yeah I think that's as much as our tobacco leaf is gonna be able to hold right now yo yeah

the bigger the bigger containers of them so it has a ton of juice in here and if you're wondering what they look like when they come it's just in this nice little white box here so when yeah let's let's go ahead and open up and I'll just show you quickly how to uh just how to rig them so it comes it starts with a nice watertight little compartment here let me just pull that thing off he's on there pretty darn good yeah definitely no water getting out of there so we'll pull that thing off and toss that out because yeah this whatever kind of juice is in here is just potent but it sure is amazing as far as fishing so so here they are again they're just just free-floating in there what we're going to do is we're going to I'll show you how to put it onto this jig head and this is actually jig head made by gulp that in the style of it is specific for the type of material that this is from these little tiny ridges hold it amazingly well so you can catch a whole lot more fish per goal when you use a jig head like this so as far as rigging it it's really standard with any any kind of soft plastic where you want them to be you want them to look natural or you if it's all curved like that it's just going to helicoper so you want it to look perfectly natural and to do that obviously you want the top of the gulp to end up all the way at the base of the jig head so I kind of you know put it on the side just to match and you can see where my thumb is my thumb is marking the spot where it would naturally come out so I keep that marked with my thumb right there and then through the top we'll just go straight from the top make sure we get dead center from the top all the way down and it will come out directly on the top of the bait right where my thumb was marking so always want to make sure that this hook point is coming out through the middle and now that we've confirmed that it is we can just shift the debate up to the up to hook and this thing is on here good there we are so there's the there's the shrimp again this this thing will wear this thing will swim real nice in the water you can see it's perfectly straight actually if anything I was a little bit off you can see it's not quite perfectly in the middle I personally would actually redo it to make sure it's in the middle but you'll get the idea from from this clip so this is it recommend this this type of hook with these gold drug baits I start with these gulp shrimp and and it definitely will be a great bait for you to catch some awesome inshore fish whether it's smoked redfish and trout so hope you

channel um by the title of today's video you guys can probably tell what i'm going to be doing already but i just want to say merry christmas to everybody hope everybody had a good uh christmas eve last night and having a good uh christmas day today um i decided to roll up a eighth blunt about like i rolled it up like three or four days ago but i decided i wanted to smoke it today on christmas for you guys so i put together two dutch master wraps and i rolled inside of the wraps like a whole eighth it was like a it's 22.8 from the dispensary so not too bad this is like a 20 blunt right here so what she's looking like she's fat you guys she is dummy fat she's packed she's not packed she's rolled nicely on both sides this is my mouth hole so that's why it's smaller than right here but it's looking really good it's tasting really good as well too i haven't lit it but just the dry pools are something serious it's very nice so yeah i'm just going to be listening to music sparking up this um 3.5 gram blunt and big chilling it's been a while since i smoked something this big but um i usually always smoke like a gram in the blunts but [ __ ] it i'm rambling on too much i got to get this christmas blunt started you guys 3.5 grams that may be normal for a lot of you guys but i don't smoke um gorilla fingers a lot anymore but cheers everybody let's get this park up close uh all right it's getting lit i think it's lit it's definitely lit it's a little bit um it's a little bit good but yeah this was a pretty good christmas i guess i still haven't even celebrated christmas really today yet i celebrated christmas eve yesterday with family i'm gonna celebrate christmas today with a little bit more family anyways i was just doing the same thing pretty much yesterday getting big faded smoking this thing burns very nice i have no idea how long an eighth blunt would last for but i'm going to predict it to last for at least like at least 15 minutes it's hidden i just wish it would be hitting a little bit more [Music] i'm just playing this is pretty much as much as blunt's hit i'm looking for that like concentrate high but i know that's not what i'm going to get from this this is a fire blown for what it is though 2.5 grams two dutch masters put together let me know what you guys are smoking for christmas what you guys are doing for christmas too no no no [Music] but 3.5 grams what do you expect i should probably be listening to christmas music and [ __ ] but to be honest i wasn't really even listening to christmas music this christmas i was listening to just the normal music i normally listened to [Music] i'm chain smoking this i'm not trying to waste none of this in here i'm trying to smoke all this [ __ ] [Music] [Music] definitely hidden on a different level it's getting me pretty faded rap music this is a christmas song and a wrap song it's so smooth though i can basically only taste even though i have two blood wraps there i can taste mostly just the weeds it's a lot of weed [Music] it's a [ __ ] slow burner though fatty too this camera angle may not even look that good i mean the lighting and [ __ ] but it took me a solid 15 minutes trying to find lighting that's good this morning for some reason the sun's just way too bright the angles just weren't working for me but this i like the angle so i had to spark up [Music] this is just going to be a little christmas special 3.5 grams for you guys i won't be smoking 3.5 great eight blunts a lot on this channel but on holidays i might be rolling up this big maybe my next holiday i might roll up two times as fast who knows maybe i'll write roll up an extendo next time i've been thinking about that so stay on the lookout for an extendo video coming up [Music] i got a solid like probably two grams left [ __ ] [Music] gotta get a drink real quick [Applause] invaded [Music] and i do enjoy smoking blunts like this just for the actual act of smoking i enjoy that because i understand and you guys need to get this too if i take one hit off of this pin right here i'm gonna be higher than this whole eighth makes me smoking you know unfortunately that is how it is concentrates are really just that strong and they'll [ __ ] up your tolerance just like that but i still do enjoy smoking just for the act of smoking it doesn't really get me blasted or high anymore but it's definitely a nice buzz complimentary to the concentrator [Music] starting to smoke real good getting down to the roachie big ass roachy i couldn't see how long this was going for but i see it's already a little bit over 10 minutes i'll try to cut it out before 15 minutes just to make sure youtube will let me upload the video but i'm trying to make this one as long as i can for you guys so i have the blonde left very fat you guys like seeing me roll up fat and want to see me roll up fatter let me know in the comment section down below you guys want to see me smoke more concentrates take more blinkers let me know as well i'm always down to do that really smooth i don't know how it's so smooth since they're i'm going to repeat there's two blunt wraps in here but 3.5 grams of weed and i can mostly just

the roach and", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results

"qIdhu5T83j0": "hi everyone i'm chris from symphony classic welcome to my youtube channel today we're going to take some inspiration and creativity to make something our own and we're going to do a full pattern tutorial so we have a lot of exciting things planned for you today so we're going to use a textile that is new and actually it's not new it's probably the oldest textile or at least one of the oldest textiles known to man um but it's new to this channel and that is hair on hide so i'm intrigued by it i think it's i see these hides online and they're just beautiful i mean they're absolutely gorgeous um i've always been wanting to try to use them but i didn't want to spend two or three hundred dollars on hide so first thing we do is look at some inspiration because that's what i did when i um decided i wanted to dive into this i said well let me look online and see what i can find so let's look at these photos so this first photo is a typical heron hide bag that you're going to find online when you do a search and that is with the fringe it's a very western looking bag it's got the x's there on the seams and it's really a beautiful bag but it really wasn't the look i was going for i wanted to take that and move it into a more professional woman's bag so i started searching some more and i saw a lot of bags like this now this is you'll see a bag where the leather the leather is on the side and you see that in the vertical um going up and down you excuse me yeah vertical going up and down you see that's where the heron height is and i'm going to flip through a couple photos here and you're going to see i found a lot of them with a just a strip of that leather going either vertically or horizontally and then mixing it with another product in this case it was either leather or faux leather and i like that i like that it broke it up a little bit and i think it toned it down and it didn't it wasn't so much in your face western kind of look um so i thought well i think that's kind of what i want to go for um so another photo i found was this one right here and i don't know that this is genuine hair on high leather i think it might be a faux just because it looks a little slouchy but it is one-sided and i thought well that's a really good idea i like that i like that the of course the handles leather i don't think you'd want to make your handles out of a hair on hide i think you'd end up with hair all over you so of course your your handle you want to be a different product but i like the fact that the back of this was either leather or faux leather and the front was the hair on hide and i thought that's a great way to break it up and not make it so overwhelming so i really like that now this one right here i thought was really pretty it definitely gives a nod to the western look but i think if you take that medallion off it wouldn't be quite so western and i like that they did something different with the accent fabric or the accent textile they didn't just put it vertically or horizontally they did something different they did that middle section there so i thought that was really that was really a pretty one this next one i'm going to and that one there is by um rock and b designs now this next one i want to show you it gives a little bit of nod to western i think with the handle with the um the beading or whatever that is there on the hand on the strap but i'm going to zoom in and give you a close-up of this look at how they stitched on top of the hair i didn't particularly like that so i wanted to find a solution so that i didn't do that i just think it kind of takes away from it some and if you're gonna do that i think you're going to go back to the first bag we looked at with the criss crosses and the seams to hold it together so that it's obviously it's kind of a leather attachment whether rather than just the thread on top of the hair so i knew i did not want to do that um this here you know i'm tote bag girl i've told you all that like a hundred times but this is a gorgeous bag look at this and see this is kind of what i was looking for i was looking for something that was you it caught your eye is oh that's a gorgeous bag but it wasn't so western um it was very classy now i think the rivets do add a western feel to it but the way you have that leather going up the middle and then you can see how the the top of the bag is kind of it kind of comes to a v it's almost like it's crisscrossed there i'm not really sure how they did that that is really pretty i like this one and then this last one i want to show you it's a bag by hbg by azaria and i really like this bag too and look at how they dealt with the top stitching on this bag they actually took a piece of leather or faux leather on the top and they just folded it over kind of like the way i do my interior slip pockets and they just stitched on that so that your top stitching is not on top of the hair it's actually on top of a piece of leather that is on top of the hair so um so anyway those are some inspiration photos and that's typically what i do when i look at something new is i go through photos and see what i like and what catches my eye what i don't like and then kind of make my decision based on that so i want to put the camera down for a second and just talk to you a little bit about heron hyde fabrics so this here is a faux faux heron high so this is a faux fur and i got this in new york city years ago um and it is i mean it is absolutely it is gorgeous so but this is not necessarily i don't i don't want to say you can't make a bag out of this but i don't know that i would make a bag out of this i think that this is more of something you're going to make a jacket or a vest or something like that out of when you cut this you want to be very careful you don't just take your scissors and you don't just cut the fabric you don't you don't just cut it like like you would normally cut fabric if you do you're going to end up cutting all this hair and your edge is going to look like you put a bowl on top of your head and cut around it it's not going to look right so when you cut it you you want to and i'm just going to tell you this in case you do use a hair that's a little bit longer you want to take and cut it from the back and when you cut it you're just going to you're just going to barely put your scissors like right underneath and you're going to cut like that okay so i'm just going to come down here and cut a little piece off so you see how you you don't really see the the side or the end here right it kind of folds over so if i take this and i just stick my scissors underneath here and just cut like this then you just kind of pull this apart not too much of the hair comes off and then you can see you don't even have to finish the seam it is it kind of just falls over on itself okay so when you're using um this longer kind of fabric or or whether it's faux or real um it is more of a high end it's more usually more used more for clothing and if you cut it right it won't quite be so messy but that's not what we're using what we're going to use is this hide right here now i got this hide from uncle george's leather he has a facebook group and he had these highs i think they're goat hides and he had them for twenty dollars a piece so i thought well that's great i think i'm going to do that because i don't want to spend again two or three hundred dollars on a huge cowhide so i bought two hides twenty dollars a piece and this is the high that this is how we're going to use today okay i'm gonna put you out a little bit and hold it up so you can see about how big it is and again it's a goat hide and this is it here okay so it's it's not huge obviously goats aren't huge um but it's got a very obviously a very short hair just like a cow would have cows goats deer all have short hair i'm going to try to bring it a little closer so you can see so i you know i really can't there's not a lot to it i mean it is definitely hair on there but it's not something you can push the hair out of the way and cut in between so huge disclaimer here this is messy you want to have your vacuum close by because you're going to need it so before i once i decided what bag i was going to use or what pattern i was going to use i tested the pattern out first and i did not use hair on hide i used cork so first let's go over the pattern that we're going to do today we're going to do and i hope i'm saying this right the mauricio hobo and this is by rlr creations this bag goes together differently than any other bag i've done and i don't think there's a tutorial out there on it so i'm going to go ahead and do the whole bag for you and of course we are going to have to make some changes because we're using a textile that is not a textile that's necessarily common with this this sort of bag although i think the hobo style and the reason why i chose it is because of the fact that she does have some um accent panels on this and i like that mid-sized bag i mean it's not too terribly big um but i thought it would be a really pretty hair on high back so the first thing i did i made it in cork and i'm going to show you so this is the cork version that i did okay so the reason why i did this i made this exactly well except for the straps and we're going to make the straps just like this because i didn't have swivel clips big enough to go in here but um i made it exactly like the pattern said i want to make sure i had the pattern down i want to make sure i felt like the pattern would work with the hair on hide before i just dove into cutting the hair on hide now this bag has a really cool panel at the bottom you see that and the panel kind of comes up on the side okay that's a really neat design i really like the um accents here on the side to hold the strap on and then on the inside she calls for a slip pocket and a zipper pocket which i did um i did both of those you see the slip pocket there excuse me the zipper pocket there and then she has a pattern piece for and i have a stuff but she's a pattern piece for the slip pocket that actually fits until on this entire side of the bag this pattern is really written well it is a very very good pattern so i'm going to link it down below go ahead and grab a copy and make it up in something other than hair on high first okay so then my second bag is a hair on high back and what i did on this bag is this accent panel of course is just like it is in the pattern no different i did add a faux leather accent up here at the top because when i top stitch this on i did not want to top stitch on top of the hair like we talked about even though it is a short hair uh hide on the seams it really the hair doesn't stick up too much you see here it sticks up a little bit and that's just part of having a hair on high back okay i think it's i think that looks really i think it looks really neat i think you can see that and then you'll see even though you have to cut this straight across at the bottom your hair is going to you know the extra little hairs will kind of go over the accent piece a little bit that's just the look of the hair on hide and honestly i really i like this i think it came out really good it actually came out better than i thought for my first try with hair on high so we're going to go over like i said the pattern changes and um what you need to do to make it and we're going to make it out of black and white we're going to use black uh accents and of course instead of brown and um we'll see how it comes out so we're going to start out by i'm going to go over all the pieces i'm going to go over what you need to cut and in addition to um and what you need to cut a little bit differently there's a few like this main piece here we're going to cut a little bit differently and then we're going to kind of go from there okay so let's go ahead and look at our pieces okay so i have my hive laid out here on my cutting mat now my cutting mat is 55 inches long by 32 inches wide this height is about just about the right or just about the same width about 32 inches and it's about 41 inches long now hives are done in square inches [Applause] and this one is not marked they're usually marked when you buy hides on the back as to how many you know how big the height is and so if you're going to like if you have a pattern that you want to convert to the hide you have to um get it down to square inches and multiply it out and you have to kind of go through the math but in this case we only have two pieces that we're going to be cutting out now i am making the everyday size there's two sizes in this pattern the everyday size and then the large size like a medium and a large so what i did was i printed the pattern pieces out twice taped them together so that i had one full pattern piece and i think that's important when you do this because you can't i mean i guess you could theoretically you know crease this but you really don't want to do that okay now the hair goes in one obvious direction so this is the top of the hide and like if this was a dog you would pet this way you went pet this way right so you want to make sure that your top of your pattern piece is going at the top of the hair or what would be the top of the bag okay now i can put this anywhere on this height i don't have to put it in the middle if i decide that i want that's one good thing about leather it doesn't have grain so if i decided i wanted to have it over here if i like the pattern of this over here that's what i would do i could do it this way i really because it's hair on high you don't want to turn your pattern pieces but you could do that on regular leather so i know i definitely want my pattern piece to go in this direction and then it's just a matter of where on this high do i want that to go now we are not going to bring this hide all the way down to the bottom of the bag so what i did was i folded this you can see on this pattern piece she has it marked right here this is where the overlay starts and you'll see a line it kind of goes like that so you kind of know where your overlay is going to go so what i did was i folded the bottom up so that it was well within the overlay and then i also that went ahead and folded each side in like this now we do want to cut the top and then we're going to end up putting an overlay on that and cutting it away but it's not a lot we're only going to cut that a very just a very small maybe two inches but there's no reason to have to go through and try to cut all of these angles and all that which we're just going to cut it off so i'm going to fold my pattern piece and i'm going to figure out exactly where i want this to lay [Applause] now i kind of like the you can kind of see this stripe going down where the you know where the spine was i i like that i want that to be in the middle but i also kind of like this spotting up here so i'm probably going to do one side with this a little closer to the top so i get more of that black in and then i'm going to do the other side with it closer to the bottom now you have to look at your leather because like in this case there are some markings on here and i think you can see that where the leather you know the fur isn't their fur isn't there and let me say i used to live i used to have being on a farm i had horses and mules and i like kind of cows and everything and i mean sometimes that happens you know the animals get bruised or they beat up on each other or whatever they do and they get scars and so that may very well be for something like that okay so we're going to place this down figure out where you want it now i know where the middle is because i have that on the fold right or i have the fold line here so i'm going to make sure i place the middle of this right on that line and i'm going to put something on here to hold this down and i'm just going to use my scissors to cut this now i'm not going to use my best favorite pair of scissors i will tell you that um i'm probably going to just use kind of an older pair and again disclaimer this is very messy so i'm going to pull you in a little bit closer just so you can kind of see and i'm just going to cut this just like you normally would cut like you would normally cut fabric now before we get going it is a stiffer piece of hide and i will tell you that it is about about 1.5 ounces but it's stiff so the edges where we sew the two together we're going to use the um surface leather um skyper on the sides which will be up this side and over here up this side but we'll get to that okay so i'm just gonna kind of hold this straight and then cut this and down here does not have to be perfect because we're just going to end up cutting it away okay move this out of the way and you can see all the hair on the table i mean that's just kind of part of it okay cut my other side so so so now i'm going to keep this piece because i could probably maybe use it as an accent in a pouch or something okay i'm going to take this and i have my trash over here so i'm just going to kind of put in the trash and take this put this in over the trash get all that off and then of course you can see on the table how much hair we have okay and then i just kind of brush this to get all the hair off and isn't that just by itself that's a very unique look isn't it okay so now we're going to cut the other side the same way and this side obviously i'm not going to have that black part i'm going to have it a little bit further down all right so this is going to be the other side it's going to be beautiful it's going to be absolutely gorgeous okay so there are two sides so i still have all this left over and that's all we need of the hair on hide for this bag and so you'll see you still have enough left over you could do another bag with it you could do some pouches with it you could do whatever and um you know for twenty dollars a hide it was i think a great deal excellent deal okay so i'm going to go ahead and clean this up and then i'll be back and we'll go over the next pattern pieces okay let's talk about our pattern pieces so of course we have our two main hide pieces which we've cut out already and set those to the side i have i was going to use some real leather for the accents and the only real leather i have is a deerskin which is very very very lightweight a little stretchy so i decided not to use that instead i'm going to use this faux leather from bodio so i cut my handle and my handle is four inches by 18 inches which is a little bit different than the pattern you're going to need two connector pieces for your handles and these are one and a quarter by five and there's no no kind of interface or anything on those then you're going to need your two accent panels and these are going to be the bottom of the bag i went ahead and put some deco bill light on the back of both of these and kept it out of the seam allowance and she actually gives you a pattern piece for that a pattern piece for the deco bill so go ahead and use it now she suggests using some fleece in this bag which is probably a good idea if you want it to be kind of a hobo slouchy bag you don't want to use deco bill light you're going to want to use some fleece we have our bottom panel and that has some deckable heavy on it we have our two bottom panel side pieces and these are fused with deco light and she gives you a pattern piece for this as well we have our strap connector pieces now here's how i did this on the strap connectors i cut two pieces exactly as they should be cut she also gives you a pattern piece for the deck of the light i went ahead and cut those out exactly as they should be cut and i fused them on the back you're gonna put this on the other piece and then you're going to sew around and then you're going to go ahead and cut it and when you cut it you're going to cut a little bit of the main piece because the way the pattern is is you put these pieces wrong sides together and then you flip them out so by not doing that you don't have to worry about um a seam allowance or you don't have a seam allowance so when you put this on you sew around you can actually instead of sewing an eighth of an inch away so a fourth of an inch away and then when you cut cut a little bit of both pieces off and then when you go to edge coat it's gonna be nice and smooth and easy to do so again i've got my two two connectors i cut exactly right and then i have two just scrap pieces that i'm going to spray adhesive and then get those on your grommets eventually are going to go on here so you do want to use some decorative light on these pieces we have our interior zipper panel now these two pieces are not in the pattern these are extra pieces and this is the zipper facing for the top of the bag because as we talked about before i do not want to have any thread stitching top stitching on my hair so the way i got this piece is i cut an extra main panel and if you can see the way that these are put together you have to tape it right here so i just took these two top pieces i didn't worry about putting the bottom on okay so i cut two extra just printed out extra pattern pieces and cut them so essentially what i had were just these two upper main panels then what i did was i folded them in half and i took and so now again pretend this is gone i took a um a ruler or a measuring tape and i measured and i think they're two inches down actually it's um an inch and a half so you're going to measure an inch and a half down and you're going to make just little dotted lines all the way and then you're just going to cut it and you're going to end up with a piece that looks like this and you can see that was a pattern piece so i just folded it in half cut it off so now i know that the top shape is exactly the same as my main piece so that when i go to put this on it's going to match up exactly right now when you when you cut these pieces you do want to um try to go ahead and use a rotary cutter for these just go kind of slow and because if you use scissors you're going to get kind of the choppy look and you don't want that now before i sew any of this on for both these top pieces and also the bottom accent pieces because this has a gray backing i'm going to put some edge coat on these pieces and maybe just a tad bit on the back just to kind of hide it and then it'll all blend in i'm going to burn my edges first because i can see some little threads coming up and then i'll edge coat and that'll be on these pieces here these two pieces here and then once i get my strap connectors done i'm going to do the same thing for those okay so those are the exterior pieces for the lining you have your bottom panel and this has woven piece too this is just a cotton that i'm using so i put woven fuse on the back of all of these so you have your same bottom panel you have your same two side pieces you have two pieces of interior lining which is the same pattern piece as your main piece and again i have some deco ville light on this which i'm going to trim up before i cut or before i sew it just trim up the edges here then you have a pocket piece now the pocket piece this is your slip pocket says to cut two and then you're gonna sew them together at the top what i did was i took my pattern piece and i put it on the fold so that i had one large piece then i put some deco bill excuse me some woven fuse two on the back of half of it and then folded this down put it back in my steam press and pressed it down really well so now all i'm going to have to do is top stitch this and then i'll be able to connect it right to the bottom of the bag and do my divider pockets okay that's just a little shortcut and then you have a piece for your interior zipper pocket okay and those are all pieces just place it on a piece of scrap and sew around up the side across the top and down the other side be sure to backstitch do not sew across this bottom side because we're not sewing it wrong sides together and turning it out in the top stitching you can actually sew this at a quarter inch seam allowance and then we're going to trim the edges so that they're all nice and even and then we'll edge coat them so i'm gonna do right now do the other one the same way okay so now i'm going to trim this up i just have this is just a little bit of oil on here from my machine so i'm going to trim this so that the bottom edges match i'm going to trim this seam allowance down to about an eighth okay so now all my edges are nice and smooth it'd be easier to edge coat okay so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to edge coat these and set them to dry and then we're going to go on to the next step while they're drying i skyped these edges and i have to tell you i accidentally deleted the video of me skiving the edges so i am sorry but if your leather needs it you need to go ahead and skype the edges i will make sure that next time i do a leather bag that i do not delete the video of me skiving so i apologize again for that so what we're going to do now is we're going to and i did we're going to take our overlays and put them on the bags now i did edge coat the edges that are going to show so that's the bottom of the top piece and that is the top of the bottom piece those are the two edges that are going to show i also marked on the back of the main panel exactly where the overlay needs to go the bottom overlay the top overlay is going to be even with the top of the bag okay so i'm going to go ahead and clip on this top one now you can use double-sided tape i did find that it does stick but it's obviously not the easiest thing to use with the hair on hide um but if you need to use it you can do that to hold it in place and i am going to use just a little bit of it down here at the bottom in the middle because i can't clip that so i'm going to take just a little bit here stick this on off that back and you're going to line my edges up let me get this other piece out of the way here i want to line my edges up with my markings on the back we're going to top stitch top stitch this on at 1 8 inch seam allowance let me just so we're going to stop top stitch the top of the bottom in the bottom of the top uh and clip it so here we go so now what we want to do is flip it over and go ahead and cut away the extra that we have at the top here and a little bit that we have at the bottom so have your trash can ready because it's going to be messy and you just want to leave this does not have to be exact just make sure when you cut it you don't cut your bottom piece here but you just want to cut some of this away okay so there's the front panel so i'm going to do the same thing on the other side and there we have our two pieces front and back okay we're going to move on to the next step so we're going to work on our handle necks our strap so i cut mine different than what the pattern called for i cut mine 4 by 18 and drew a line down the middle and i'm going to put some double-sided tape but i'm only going to put it in the middle section so probably starting about four inches from each side you don't want to put it all the way to the end if you're going to do a handle like what i'm doing if you're going to do a handle like what's in the pattern then obviously follow the pattern instructions but i do not have any swivel clasps that will fit in my grommets so that's the reason why i'm doing this a little bit different and it's going to be like what i showed you in the beginning of the video so you're going to do the normal thing here where you're going to fold it into the center you're just not going to have any double-sided tape down here at the ends so you can put a few clips to hold that and then we're going to fold this in half and we're going to top stitch an eighth of an inch down each end just like a normal strap and if you're off a little bit on the ends here you just go ahead and even that out that's good so i'm going to go ahead and edge coat the ends here and here i'm going to singe the threads here and then we will move on to the next step now this here is an extra piece as well these are our strap connectors that i'm going to be using instead of the swivel clasps so they're an inch and a quarter wide if you recall and so i just took the put some double sided tape i'm going to take that off fold the edges to the center and i'm going to top stitch these we will use these when we get ready to put our strap on so the next thing we're going to do is get our bottom pieces so that's the um straight bottom piece and our two little triangles here we're going to go ahead and put them right sides together we're going to stitch then we're going to open up the seam allowance and top stitch so there's our bottom piece all right so now we need to work on the lining because we're going to put our zipper in um in top stitch before we sew the rest of the bag together i told you this bag comes together a little bit different and i really like the way it does so i'm going to get the pieces for my lining and we'll get started on that okay so for the lining we have the same pieces that we just sewed we have our bottom piece and we have our two triangles so i'm going to go ahead and start by sewing that so there's our bottom put that aside for just a second now we have our slip pocket now the slip pocket piece is exactly the same with as the lining okay now i'm just gonna see my woven juice is kind of sticking out here i'm gonna cut that and then i'm going to go ahead and cut my triangles out of the woven fuse you certainly could have done that while you were cutting up piece that is not a problem i just hadn't done it yet so i'm gonna go ahead and do it now okay now in the pattern she has you put your zipper pocket on the same side as this foot pocket which is great you can certainly do that i'm going to go ahead and put it on the opposite side so what i'm going to do from here is put this pocket piece on here put some clips we're going to baste it in place but i'm also going to go ahead and draw a line so i can divide it i'm going to do all that one time so i'm going to fold it in half go ahead and mark my halves here in the centers and then i'm just going to use my ruler to draw a line down the center here which i need to get my ruler okay i'm just going to go ahead and mark that now of course you can do whatever you want here with pockets you want to put maybe do it in thirds you could certainly do that i think i'm just going to leave mine in half though and cut the thread in between the triangles and i'm going to go ahead and put i always try to put a rivet here just to reinforce pockets so i'm going to go ahead and put a rivet there so now on the other lining piece i'm gonna go ahead and put my zipper pocket on here now she has you um take your your large zipper pocket and stitch it stitch a box on pull it through and then use your bottom half and pull it up to the top and then go ahead and stitch around i'm going to do it the way i typically do it which is to use a piece of the faux leather stitch that on cut around it i'm going to cut this piece in two and then stitch it i just i think as we the more we sew we find that there's certain things we like to do a certain way if that's fair to say we kind of have the our favorites so i'm going to do that put some double-sided tape on here to hold it in place as i sew it oops i swear i have the dropsies in my sewing room i don't know if y'all do but wow nowhere else in my life except for in my sewing room okay so i'm gonna put this let's see how far down well let me mark my centers first it's always a good thing to do okay now from that center point i'm going to come down an inch and a half and go ahead and put this on so if you want to do your interior zipper pocket that way this way i should say i would suggest an inch and a half from the essentially from the lowest point in this curve just mark your center and go ahead and stitch it or lay it down okay so i'm moving all over the place here see if i can manage to do this and then of course center your zipper let me see where my center is okay look at it make sure it looks straight which it does go ahead and stitch this on okay so now we're just going to grab this and cut in the middle and we're going to cut all the way to the edge now go put your scissors underneath your overlay and just snip beyond the edge okay then you're going to fold this or turn this over and cut up and then go ahead and trim this off now this does not need to be pretty or neat just as long as you don't cut your zipper overlay you are good to go here and you can't see the lining on the right side when you turn this over so don't be super particular about it just cut it away no big deal okay now you can see how messy that is right no big deal because this is what we care about right there see how pretty that is all right so now what i'm going to do is take my pocket and i'm going to fold it in half and then i'm going to cut it in half now this is if you're doing a pocket the way i'm doing it if not if you're going to follow the pattern you're actually going to be using this piece as the back facing the pocket all together okay so now i'm going to sew the zipper right side of the fabric right side of the line to the wrong side of the zipper we're going to go ahead and baste that on and then from here i push this up fold the seam allowance down and top stitch that then we're going to do the same thing with the other side so now with our zipper going to the left we're going to lay this on top now i have some double sided tape on here when i pulled the lining away and cut it my double sided tape showed from when i put the overlay on so i don't need to put any more on there now make sure your pockets open this can be centered a little bit better okay and with your pocket open you want to go ahead and stitch now around the inside of this overlay i'm going to go ahead and singe and then i'm going to close my pocket now we do not want to close the pocket all the way and you are going to have some left over because we cut this piece in half you should have roughly an inch and that's okay just cut that off so we're going to sew around down the sides here to close our pocket before we leave the bottom open and you can certainly press this here and make it a little easier to um since it's cotton i can do that i can go press it with my iron to make sure that when i'm ready to close this it makes it a little easier to do okay so there we go all right so now let's move on to the next step okay so we have our two main pieces here and we have our two lining pieces so what i want to do is to take our little triangles here and i'm just going to fold it and i'm going to stitch up and close them now i'm taking a generous half inch seam allowance on the lining and i'm just this is what it looks like you're just sewing a straight line all the way up and cut that and what it does is forms a little pleat there okay so i'm gonna do that with the other side so we're going to go ahead and move on to the main piece main pieces and we're going to do the same thing i'm just going to go ahead and fold them and you're going to stitch now here you want to do a not so generous half inch seam allowance okay just be a little bit smaller with it what do i have going there we go okay and you do want to backstitch the beginning and the end and see when it pops out that's what it's going to look like it is a very pretty design i really like this so there we go okay so next we're going to work on putting in our zipper so you want to take your zipper for the top of the bag and just go ahead and cut it into or not cut it to open it up you want to find your center a little snip and we're going to take one from the center here okay a little snip okay so we're going to take our zipper we're going to put it obviously right side down and you're going to put it on here now you can go ahead and make little slits in this curve but if you do don't make them too deep because we don't want them to show obviously when we turn this around i'm going to go ahead and use a little bit of double-sided tape on here i found that it helps i normally don't want to put zippers in like this on the top of the bag that i did find that it helped on this one so i'm just going to use my eighth of an inch double sided tape just to kind of help hold it in place so i'm going to line up the centers and you just want to curve it around okay okay just like that so see the zipper is almost gonna the teeth are gonna stick up a little bit i don't know if you can tell but that's okay because you have this curve here and you have a smaller shorter edge here than you do here so therefore it's going to do that it's going to want to flip up now you can do a couple things you can go ahead and put more double-sided tape and put a piece of lining down or you can baste this on um i'll tell you this double sided tape is holding really well i know i said don't do this but i think it's going to work so let me go ahead and put some more double-sided tape down on here see if i can't do this in one fell swoop okay let's see how this goes i might regret it i don't know okay so this is gonna be the front of my bag so i'm gonna use my slip pocket piece i'm going to line up the centers and then just go ahead and make sure all of my edges match here okay so we're going to go ahead and stitch this on fourth of an inch all right hmm i think that might have worked go ahead and flip it around he did very good okay so we're going to go ahead and we're going to topstitch this in an eighth of an inch seam allowance look at your zipper don't freak out when your zipper looks like this it's okay it's going to get better when i first did this pattern i was like oh my zipper's so wavy but it's not going to be wavy when you're done okay so it's okay it is okay all right so got that part done let's go ahead and we're going to do the other side exactly the same way now i probably should have put some relief cuts in my other side i'm going to put a few in here this is not a huge seam allowance so it's not it's not the end of the world but so you just put some little relief cuts in there okay so we turn this around and top stitch so we have our two zippers on and we have the bad crop stitched that's my favorite thing we don't have to topstitch when it's done okay so next what we're going to do is put our bottom piece on our main and our main face here so we're going to find the centers if you haven't found the center of your main panel yet go ahead and do that then we're going to clip that together now this is the most amazing thing to me i love this part too and this is just a well-written pattern when you stitch this on okay you've got now you've got this curve here right we did that pleat you're just going to kind of work that around the pleat and it's easier if you push the pleat out okay go ahead and work that around the plate and it's going to come right to the point here okay so into the other side push your pleat out [Music] and it's going to come right to the point here okay all right so we're going to back stitch and we're going to sew this at a half inch seam allowance now when you start sewing it don't start get this out of the way you're not going to start at the at the very point you're going to start a half of an inch in so basically here's a good way to look at it let's look at it on this side you want to start where your deco ville is so we're going to sew on this side all the way up to this point and then when we sew the other side we're going to sew all the way up to that point and it's going to come together beautifully so you know don't start at the edge of your fabric is what we're trying to say and i'm actually going to sew from this side it might be easier to see so i'm actually going to put my needle in right there at that point so on this side when we get to the edge we're going to stop sewing right at the point i could bring you in here so i don't want to go past it in the back stitch okay so you see i sew just to the point here and on this side i started right at the point so we're going to take our other main piece and we're going to do the same thing so see how i can get my light on that right to the point on both sides and same thing my here cut we started and stopped right at the point ingenious i love the way this pattern comes together look at that okay so now we're going to do the same thing with the lining so now because we don't have deckable here to help us know where the point is you can certainly mark it and i think i'm going to do that so that i don't over sew although of course it's not as important on the lining but still we want it to look nice right so i'm going to just mark and i'm going to do it three quarters of an inch because i'm going to take a bigger lining i'm just going to put a little dot big dot okay so what i did was i measured from this edge right here three quarters of an inch down and i just centered a dot right there i'm going to do the same thing on the other side and that's how i'm going to know where to start and stop stitching now this is not in the pattern but i do think that just from doing it a few times that it's going to help me be a little more accurate and sew in this lining piece on okay so i'm going to sew this one in full and then the next one i'm going to leave a section open now i'm going to leave an opening that is really wide really wide because the now in the pattern she calls for a cotton for your main fabric not hair on hide leather so if that's the case you should be able to pull it through the pocket the zipper pocket no problem um this is just a change that i need to make because of the material i'm using the textile i'm using just a little change in the pattern and we all have done it a bunch of times pulling it through the bottom and then closing everything off through the pocket okay so i'm going to pretty much leave an opening um from these two bottom seams i'm just going to stitch to the seam on each side and i'm going to stop okay so we are in the home stretch here so now we need to close up the sides so you're gonna have to you're gonna have to pull the bag open like this and go ahead and clip your sides and you're not stitching over your zipper okay so see and you're not stitching this little short edge right here you're just going to stitch from your seam here that we just did all the way up and you're going to back stitch up here you do that for both the lining and the main fabric your your front and back your main purse fabric so you're going to when you do this you're going to start and stop okay so on this side we have our dot right where we start and stopped so when you fold this in like this you're going to see that seam that stitch right there that's where you're going to stitch from and then you're going to stitch all the way up to the top you do the same thing on your face fabric you're going to so here's my here's my little dot here here's my edge and this is the stitch on the outside i'm going to start from there and i'm going to stitch all the way up okay so you're going to have to kind of fold this in now one thing i am going to do before i do that i'm going to cut my excess hair off my lining overall sewing with hair on hide is really not that different or difficult it is [Music] messy a little messy but it's really not different than working with regular leather you have to make the same concessions to the pattern as you would for regular leather um you know due to thicknesses and all that kind of stuff but other than that you know we we added a facing at the top of the of the bag just so we didn't stitch on top of our hive but other than that it really has not been that difficult or that different right so if it's something you've been wanting to do i would say try it go ahead and keep your eye out at uncle george he like i said periodically has some great deals and i mean well he always has great deals but he periodically has hair on hide or just kind of search around and see what you can find and give it a try makes for a stunning bag there's no doubt okay so we're going to start right there and our stitch so let's see let me see if i can fold this down so you can kind of see what i'm doing here so i'm going to put my needle in right at that stitch and pull you in okay so right there at that stitch so i'm stitching on the hide now and you know no different everything is same now it's a little a little fake and it's okay and trim it down over my trash hold on you're not gonna see this i trip that over my trash so i can keep my mess to a minimum here okay do the other side so we're gonna go right in that hole and this is a half inch seam allowance here all right trim it over my trash okie doke get all this hair off all right now we're gonna lining [Music] now as i do this seam i'm going to start at about a three-quarter inch seam allowance but i'm going to taper it to a half inch seam allowance so that the top edge matches up easily with the top edge of the bag okay trim this down and one more then we get to turn this out now if you want to put a key fob in now is the time and actually i'm going to go ahead and make a key fob real quick and stick it in because i like to put those in my bags so i'm going to do that and i'll be back okay so i sewed up my side seam put my key fob in set up the side seam so now we are ready to pull this back through so i'm just going to reach through the opening in my lining and i'm going to what it looks like see how nice these corners line up look at that matches perfectly and everything lines up fabulous fabulous all right i'm going to put this lining and just make sure we're not super baggy here before i close up yeah that is good that looks good so that's with a three-quarter inch seam allowance on the um on the lining okay so what we're going to do from here is open up our pocket grab our lining pull it through and close it up and then we'll close up the pocket okay so here's what we have i mean this is just such an awesome pattern y'all didn't come together really neat i love the way it did different than i like the way you you put the zipper on top stitch before you even finish the bag to me that is like the best so make sure you go and buy this pattern because i think you're really going to enjoy it and again this is the medium size or the smaller of the two so i'm sure the larger is even obviously it's even bigger but i bet it's even better and especially me being a tote bag girl okay so the next thing we need to do is put our zipper pull on and of course we want our when this is the right side we want the bag to open this way so i'm going to go ahead and put the zipper pull on on this side okay so what we're going to do is we want to kind of flatten stick your fingers in this little section over here and kind of pull it apart and flatten it as much as possible now i've got zippers sticking out and overlay sticking out so i'm going to go ahead and just kind of trim all that off okay so we're going to try to get this kind of take this part and push it down some and we want to just stitch across here to hold that closed okay and then we're going to do the same thing on the other side and this side's a little trickier because this is where our zipper closes but very doable so i'm just going to cut that off i'm going to stitch that closed okay i'm going to move you over here all right let me do this side first and of course you're not going to be able to see this so let me move the camera for you okay so here we are getting these corners good to go and you don't need to go crazy going back and forth and back and forth the main thing we're trying to do here is hold these closed so that when we go to put our connectors on it'll be um it'll be nice and easy i almost lost my zipper pull there so you might have to play with it a little bit and again you probably are not going to have to play with it quite as much if you're using a quilting cotton but so you notice i kind of start in the middle of that because i don't want to start at the end and have it push my zipper and the um you know sometimes just the pressure of your presser foot will push it forward and i did not want that to happen so now i'm going to go back and just stitch from the end all right and again this is not anything fancy it's just to hold it closed all right let me get you out uh okay there we go i have to kind of train it here okay so now we're going to um get our strap ends ready our connectors here so that we can go ahead and put those on so we're going to put grommets in them use my grommet press to do that and um i will move the camera so i can show you how to do that okay so we're here at my grommet press this is a press from rowley r-o-w-l-e-y rolly company they're a work room supply company but i used to order a lot of things from when i was doing window treatments and duvets and bed skirts and all and i did window treatments with grommets in them and this thing came in handy so it comes it's just like a rivet press it comes with all different cutting dies and pressing dies you can do buttons with it you the big covered buttons and you can do grommets and um anyway works the same way so what we want to do is take and we're going to use a this is a number six grommet and i want to put that you want to put it at least three quarters of an inch from the bottom of this so what i'm going to do is just take this and i'm going to kind of figure out where i want it and i'm going to make sure it looks straight and all and then just draw a circle if you can see that yeah so now i'm going this is my cutting die i'm just going to stick my little cutting board on here and i'm going to cut cut one out okay so what i found the easiest thing to do to make sure they're even is then to take the these two line them up and then just draw your second circle in using the first circle as your or the first cut as your template okay now this is exactly the same size as the die this circle here so it's going to be easy to make sure you get in exactly the right spot and then i have my two holes cut okay so now we're going to go ahead and put the grommet in and i'm going to switch this out put my press on and then i'll show you how i press it in okay so now i have the pressed part on i've put the the front of the grommet in right so this is what the front of the grommet looks like stick that in this is what the back looks like line that up and each grommet has its own press die so it fits right in you can kind of hear the way it clicks in okay so it stays good and sturdy and then you just take and press it down and then just like that you have a perfectly set grommet voila there we go oops sorry i nicked you and you're moving around okay so now we want to take these and we're going to sew it on the back so i'm going to move you back over and we're going to do that okay so if there's a tricky part to this this is probably it we want to here okay so we want to take our edge connector here and we want to stick it on the bag and then we're going to sew this on now i've tried a couple different things i've tried some to just sew it on like this it likes to move a little bit i've tried some double-sided tape i've tried a couple things and i think that the double-sided tape isn't a bad idea um so that's what i'm going to do i'm going to go ahead and take a couple of small pieces how is that when you put the double-sided tape on you take the tape off and try to stick it on and it's hard to it's hard to get on so if there's a tricky part to this bag this is probably it it's not hard it's just you got to work with it a little bit it's maybe just a little tricky okay so i'm going to peel back off the tape keep it opened up and then go ahead and get it on there and obviously you want to make sure it's as straight as possible and as even as possible and then what you're going to do is sew this on now i've been sewing two lines of stitching just to give it a little extra support so looks like this side popped up a little bit i just want to make sure i get it down there good all right and i'm going to sew one more time okay here we have it so we're going to do the same thing with the other side okay so the next thing is to put the um strap on so because i didn't have any swivel clasps that were large enough to get around these grommets what i decided to do was to kind of come up with my own little connector so we did those little one and a quarter inch straps here and we're just going to stick this through a little bit and come up like this okay do that on each side now the reason why we didn't put double-sided tape all the way to the end here is we're going to stick one of these straps in one end and we're going to strip stick the other one in the other end so an all is a great thing here which i need to find my all okay so your straps folded over four times or you've got basically two spots because you have four layers here right so i'm just going to kind of stick my all in here because i edge painted this so i want to make sure i can i've got space in here okay okay so we're going to take one end and here's i know i put these on but really the easiest thing is to take it out and stick one end up one side of this you may need your all to kind of stick it push it in okay so um taking this i'm pushing it up in there okay and you want it up about well put it in about an inch you can kind of see where it stops there so now we're going to put this through and we're going to put the other side up the other end okay so you see you can see it real good right there where it is so now we're going to put some rivets in here to hold it and you obviously need some pretty long rivets i think i use my 12 millimeter let me see here yeah see how long these are because you're going through quite a bit of um vinyl here so i'm going to just kind of mark this where i want i have my little tops and bobbins rivet guide here which is absolutely wonderful if you don't have one you need to get one because it measures it out exactly for you and i'm going to put one right here okay okay so i'm going to go ahead and press or do my holes here rivets in put the backs in and then we're going to go ahead and press those in and we'll do the other side i'm going to press these in in just a minute i'm going to back you up and it is completed so look at how oh you can't see this lining is like perfect in here it is amazing at how nice and there you go you can kind of see that fits perfectly no wavy zipper and just to kind of give you an idea on where it sits see it's about right just right under the arm plenty of space to put your arm in because of the dip here but anyway all right so again this is the mar rochelle hobo by rlr creations i'm going to be linking it below and really just a couple of changes with working with hair on hide and i hope you enjoy the tutorial and it gives you some inspiration to go ahead and maybe try a little so until next time happy sewing", "AyD0arsxdII": "three two one welcome back to fourth fleet stone everyone today i got me some cherry pie got me something sweet you know more my type last train we did was the um what did we do last time we did the cereal milk the cereal milk was actually pretty good was me and my girlfriend she loved it i loved it and you know we always aim for that that we always aim for that thick that thick strain that we like i mean if we get the fruity strains we also gonna we we still do reviews on them but that's not what we really be aiming for so right now i got something that i'm i'm always aiming for which is the cherry pie i'm gonna mix it with a little the goliath gas this is the goliath gas right here that's a delta eight strain i've been dealing with the delta h lately i made a video describing delta eight and uh delta nine you know and i recently discovered that the delta eight has affected me way better than delta nine ever has it's like i feel like the delta is probably gonna be the new th probably the next two three years same level thc is gonna have it's it's constants it's compounds and the high level it gives you and the melonness is unbelievable like i can't even explain what words you definitely have to try it out it's definitely a recommendation for anybody that smokes weed and that wants a substitution for something real mellow like i know a lot of people that gets mad and blow you know i'm gonna get high i wanna get high i don't wanna i don't want delta eight i wanna do something i wanna get high i wanna get high but in reality it's all the same [ __ ] just a lower percentage of you know thc content and little do people know delta eight if you're getting your delta in from the store and you're getting your thc from whatever supply you get it from i don't know i'm not in your business but a lot of times the delta e is going to be fresher than what you're buying from the streets or wherever you're getting it it's probably going to be fresher than that because most of the delta 8 is like all that it does eat this lab test you can't can't sell delta 8 unless it's lab tested so anything that's lab tested you know i definitely recommend smoking just to to see how it makes you feel and focus on the body height more of just a psychiatric [ __ ] up high a lot of people just want to get banged up you know i'm high as hell or reality you got to focus on the health benefits and therapeutic benefits and the feeling in your body so that's what i like to do when i when i explore with different strains of delta 8 and um delta 9. but right now i'm gonna put the cherry pie in here and i got a i got a i got a gift for y'all a little surprise for you i want to pick me up some more concentration last time we did the king louie concentration now i got some pineapple express check this out come on get it zooming on this [ __ ] right here nice and fresh oh shout outs out to clyde 9 vapor they got it all at this athens california at this bumble [ __ ] where the [ __ ] you at but yeah they got it all so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna of course paint use it as a paste to paste my blunt down because that's what i always do think by now if y'all guys watching my videos y'all should know how to roll the fonzo leaf y'all should know what the [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] with brandon the link will always be in the description below i've been wowing on a glide guys i'm gonna scrape the jar the goliath guys is really kicky this [ __ ] is really resonance sticky and kicky like a lot of times cbd if you smoke with your cbd flower you're thinking that okay i'm gonna get this nice ass terpene hi going to kick me right you know you see a tv show you're like oh yeah i'm gonna photos of tv you see i'm gonna feel the income in reality you don't feel that with just the flower or just a cbd flower it's just like a it's more like a relaxation maybe a terpene kind of profile you'll get but delta eight that's your case like you're gonna feel it it's like he's gonna as soon as you smoke that she's gonna you're gonna feel it you're gonna get that kick like you smoking the real the normal [ __ ] that you would spend a lot of money for with high or high percentage of thc you're gonna feel it but five minutes later it's gonna drop and it doesn't go away it's not like a cigarette or you know just regular cbd where you smoke it five minutes later it goes away you don't feel anything you're gonna feel something it's gonna be a melody's like my girlfriend tried and she she went to sleep a lot of times she don't like to see me when she tried that [ __ ] she went straight to sleep you know that's that's that's a lot of times what you want that's the reason why we you know a lot of people smoke weed you know a lot of people have their reasons you know and some people's reasons are just to go to sleep so if you see you're smoking something and it's doing the job for you know what you need then you know you want to keep investing in that train maybe grow that shrink keep a keep a high collection of that strain you want to always focus on your trains that's why lately i've been really concentrating on different kinds of trains i smoked because back in the day it's like a whole different ballgame from back in the day back in the day i would maybe buy a train smoking blow yeah i smoked this train it got to a point where i was just buying blood and not even asking what the [ __ ] i'm buying i was just buying there's a smoke and a lot of times if you realize you're doing that you got to stop because you might end up buying the wrong thing one day and it gives you the worst time in the world and then you build this this bad conception of marijuana i know a lot of people that happen to so if you if you want to make sure you focus on your strengths and make sure you focus on seeing it in the love of cbd not everyone is affected by the same levels of cbd in the levels of chc some people can't take too much levels of thc some people can't take too much love to cbd some people need half and half so me i realize that you want to pick the right strain you want to pick the wrong train because with the wrong strain it could definitely have you building this this bad conception of marijuana because it might get you too high you know it might not get you high because you know some some high levels of tac can can get someone really high but not to the feeling that they want to feel and higher cbd levels will probably make them feel even better with a lower thc level it depends or maybe some people might feel better with a higher thc level and a lower cbd level it all depends on your body you know so don't don't don't just smoke weed just to smoke weed and not try to do your homework on it or learn the the background of what happened with it and the science of it don't just do that make sure you always get the science of what you're smoking you you find out the name of it the strain how much level the chd has in it and they set you this is only going to help you on the longer it's not gonna it's not gonna hurt you it's far from hurting you i need something to do this one you have a sticker so now when you extract your your um your cbd oil you want to make sure you use a nice stick i don't have my own i don't have my my tool right now i left it in the house so i'm going to use a i took it at tobacco let's keep it real natural right now and you know me i'm a real i'm a naturalist so i don't lick my blunts i don't lick my blunts but if you have to you have to so what i like to do is i like to i like to just paste it right along crosstalk come come zoom in just paste it right along across right there boom bang just like that probably get a couple more scoops out a couple more scoops out and you don't have to use a lot i like to use a lot because i like to get hot but you don't have to use a lot bang right there all you do is gotta just tuck it down and flap one flap rest in piece of licking butts that's it and you got a whole blunt boom shout out to molly yeah if you do lick your blunts gargle so that's that's um pretty much it i don't want you guys to to make fun of my lighter i don't have the proper lighter with me today but we need to light this sucker and show you guys how i smoke oh sweet real sweet i definitely like the king louie better than the pineapple express but definitely doing the job give you that thick taste i always wanted to thick taste more smoke [ __ ] like citrus [ __ ] thanks a lot guys thanks for watching and that was the review of the cherry pie stay strong [Music]", "fMP-uBaqBq4": "Don't just stare at him. What are you waiting for? Why don't you strike? Baalveer! Baalveer! Look! It's Baalveer.. It's Baalveer. Look.. Baalveer! Baalveer! 'People have seen me.' 'I must wear my disguise.' What is wrong with you? You nearly had him there. I mean, that's what people in the Dark Realm\nwill say. Oh! Take it easy.. Oh, King of Fear.. Look over there. Baalveer has returned\nin disguise. Are you all right? Here, drink some water. Here. It is Baalveer. He is only wearing a disguise. Well done, Baalveer! I mean.. Better late than never. Now shoot the venom at him otherwise you will have\nto wear a disguise to enter Dark Realm. Thank you. Ma'am, you're really lucky. Baalveer saved you. Are you Baalveer? No.. I'm not Baalveer. I just came here to\noffer you some water. Baalveer did stop the tempo but he flew off before\nanyone could meet him. Come, let me drop you home.\nCome with me. Where do you stay? B-Bharat Nagar. You got busy staring again! If you had to pierce him\nwith your gaze why did you bring Jerua here? Fool! What if this is one of\nBaalveer's tricks to expose me? What if the fairies\nare hiding nearby? We will have to catch Baalveer\nunawares when he is isolated. Wonderful! Keeping company\nwith me has sharpened your brains. Not that I am bragging.. Autorickshaw.. Please come. 'Now, I must keep an eye\non Baalveer.' Will you take me\nto Bharat Nagar? - No. Fine, now you cannot say\nI never asked. Hey, what are you doing? How dare you refuse\nthe King of Fear? I will.. I will take you\nto Bharat Nagar! Wow, Vivaan! A remote controlled wheelchair! Vivaan, add two seats to this. We'll ride it to school\neveryday. Yes. Not a bad idea. But I've made this chair\nfor grandpa not for us. Why is that? Grandpa is going to\nguard the neighbourhood all night to catch\nthe garbage thrower. All that patrolling\nmight tire him out. That's why, I made him\nthis chair. See that, Chinty? They're planning to foil\ndad's plans. We're not going to\nlet it happen, Chintu. In this neighbourhood we're the real villains. Oh, Queen of Fear.\nWhen, where and how will you capture them? The fairies? What are these, Queen? These are rocks from Fairyland which are made from\nthe same fairy dust that the fairies are made of. And just like these rocks fairies glow in the dark too. Suppose this is the sun\nthat shines on Earth. The fairies do not glow\nin the rays of the Earth's sun. But now, Timnasa's sun will rise. Before the real sun sets my sun shall take its place. The fairies will start glowing\nin its light. And then.. Then what? The fairies will be dead? They will be finished off! I swear by my little finger,\nQueen of Fear! You are great! Simply great! But, Queen, where is your sun? Here you go. We've reached your house.\nMy job is done. Here..\n- Wait, don't go. Listen to me. Listen, if Baalveer saved me that means he exists, right? But my son refuses to\nbelieve it. He is totally against Baalveer. Could you please talk to him? If my naughty son knows\nmore about Baalveer he'll learn something. No, I have some urgent work. I..\n- Don't talk. Come with me. There. Do you see that\nbroken glass pane? Yes.\n- My son did it. As such,\nhe's not good at anything but when it comes to\nbreaking things no one can beat him. 'You!\n- You!' Yes, I met a kid\nwho was exactly like that. He was good at breaking things. Must have been trained\nby my son. Come with me, speak to him.\n- But.. Akroor!\n- Tell me, Timnasa. It is time for the fairies\nto glow. Glow, they shall, Timnasa. And they shall die too! 'This is my sun. It shall shine' 'on the earth this evening.' If there are no fairies\nin this neighbourhood this will be last good turn\nthat Baalveer does. Let us go. Stop right here!\n- What! I'll have you both arrested. I've been whistling for you\nto stop since the previous signal. Can't you hear me? Are you hard of hearing? I collect marbles\nin my free time. And you make these\nfancy contraptions from broken objects! Really, Vivaan. You're so smart! Well.. Smartness is all I have. Anyway, I'll go\nand tell grandpa about this in an hour and a half. You'll take an hour and a half for such a small thing? No..\nI'll take only two minutes. Then, grandpa will take\nhis own sweet time to give his response. That'll take at least\nan hour and a half. Vivaan! You'll be away for\nan hour and a half. What will we do in the meantime? You can summon Baalveer\nto entertain you. Oh, yes! I almost forgot. How will you summon someone who doesn't even exist? That sounds like\nChintu's laughter. Someone will hear you. Now let me see\nhow the chair works. Who cut that wire? Whoever did it just made this the worst day\nof his life. This is a bad day\nfor both of you because you've messed with me. Neither do I accept bribe nor do I spare offenders. Name.. Tell me your names. Why are you staring at me?\nI have to make a penalty slip. Tell me your names.\n- Jerua. I am enjoying so much\nseeing him die. Then imagine how much we\nwill enjoy seeing Baalveer die. Please come, this is my house.\nPlease come. I will meet your son later.\nI'll leave now. Don't speak, just listen.\nSit for some time at least. I will just bring some water. 'I'm also allergic to favours.' 'And don't you dare\ndo any favours.' 'I will teach you such a lesson\nyou won't forget.' 'Come along now.\n- But..' 'Listen to me.\n- Let's go.' 'Her insistence and her son's\nactivities are so similar' 'to that of that naughty boy.' Wow, Vivaan, you fixed the chair. Yes! I fixed this chair,\nnow I have to deal with Chintu. Hey! Stop this chair!\nStop this chair.. Hey! Stop!\nStop this chair! Hey, someone stop this. Someone stop this. Stop it.. - Please stop Chintu!\nPlease stop it. Now watch the chair\nmove at high speed. This is my son. Vivaan. This is your son?\n- Yes. Do you know him? 'Tell me one thing,\nin this superhero costume' 'when you want to go\nto the toilet' 'how do you manage?' No! No! I was just saying,\nhe is such a cute kid. Yes, he is very cute. And he is my beloved.\nBut he is very mischievous. Well, you wait here,\nI'll get tea for you. Okay? God, what mistake have I made? Why do I meet this kid\nagain and again? Vivaan, we are troubling\nChintu so much. What if Baalveer\ncomes to save him? First of all, there is\nno such thing as Baalveer in this world. And even if he comes I'll introduce him\nto my grandpa. And grandpa will talk so much that Baalveer will not know\nhow to stop him and get out of the situation. Then Baalveer will never\nset foot in this locality again. My daughter-in-law, Karuna,\njust told me how you helped her and brought her home. You are great. I want to thank you\nwholeheartedly. Your greatness reminds me of a coconut tree. A coconut tree?\n- Yes. When a small coconut tree\nis a mere sapling the human nurtures it. Gradually, it grows tall. But the coconut tree never\nforgets the favours done. It yields fruits\nand coconut water for years. And you helped us\nin the same way. I wonder if I will ever\nbe able to repay you. I have some urgent work. I.. I'll do it and be right back.\n- No.. Dear, I'm not done\nthanking you yet. Let my feelings\nof gratitude flow. Let me say it. 'Now Baalveer's fate is\nin his successor's hands.' 'And it is up to Baalveer\nto find him.' 'I'm badly stuck.' 'I hope at least the fairies\nare looking for my successor.' Look, he could be\nthe new Baalveer. No, he doesn't have the mark\non his hands. - Vision Fairy! This one? Could he be the one?\n- Fairies! We are spent looking\nfor the Baalveer's successor. while you two are sitting here\nwith this device. Even we are looking for\nthe new Baalveer. Look! What!\n- Yes. - What village is that? It's Insta Village.\nLook, this is called a phone. People can talk to each other\nwith it and even type in it. And look, it has Insta Village. Wow! It's a splendid village. I, too, want to live here. Wait and watch, we will find\nour new Baalveer in this village without any efforts.\n- Right. I'm extremely worried. I wonder when we will\nfind Baalveer's successor. This day is over too. And it's almost sunset. Today, as soon as\nthe sun sets on earth my sun will rise in the sky. It will be a long day\nfor the fairies and their last, too. Because they will shine tonight but their luck won't. Wow, my Queen! Incredible!\nI swear by my little finger I'm becoming a fan of yours,\nday by day. I'm impressed. But, Queen, on earth,\nyou can't use your powers. Then, how will you get them out of earth's atmosphere without any powers? By using all wicked tricks\nlike luring bribing, punishing\nand threatening. This is a trick\nwhich will be revealed only when it has worked. Unintentionally,\nBaalveer has given me an idea which I will employ against him because I am unstoppable now. Somebody stop me! Please help! Hey! S-sorry, sir. Dear,\nthe holy scriptures say that true happiness lies\nin helping others. - Exactly. It's absolutely right.\nI'm oozing with happiness. I'll go now.\n- Hey! No, dear. The guest is like God. I regard you as God.\nHence, I want to say that.. 'He won't stop anytime soon.' 'When will I look for\nmy successor?' You are going to\nget beaten up now. His Highness enjoys\nbeating up children. Hey, mister!", "5JDo5EV8-nk": "hey everybody how's it going into daily tutoring you know there's a lot of people that were really excited about the vortex one-to-ten right up until they saw the price point which is about two thousand dollars well today we're going to be taking a look at another option for a 1 to 10 this one is the arrowhead from swab fox optics this is a great optic right here they sent it out to the channel for me to test out and review i've had a great time with it as a matter of fact they gave me a pretty incredible discount code of 20% off which will drop this price down to just over 400 bucks and that discount code and link will be over my website so you guys can click the link down below to my website head over there find your discount code and get a 1 to 10 that's not going to break the bank so let's go and take a closer look at it [Music] now I'm a big fan of value just like everybody else you know you're always trying to find the best deal you're always trying to find something that will work without you know having a refinance your house or something I mean these days things can get very expensive so when you find something that's a little bit more affordable it definitely feels like more justification in your purchase and so that's why I was really interested in trying this thing out so again it's a one to ten one to 10 basically means goes all the way from no magnification all the way up to 10 power and if you ask me I really feel like the 1 to 10 is just gonna kill any 3 to 9 scope so there's a lot of scopes out there that you'll see that are 3 to 9 and they go all the way down to 3 power up to 9 power and I don't even see a need for a 3 to 9 anymore if you can have something like this which will dial all the way down to 1 and you can use it kind of like a red dot and then go all the way up to 10 power and give you that magnification that'll stretch way out there so again I think a 1 to 10 is a really nice scope I just I love the ability to go that far in your zoom range so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this thing off we're gonna put it on the table I'll move the camera so you guys can get a closer look at it and we'll talk about all the details and features and you know what you get with this okay so here's a closer look at our scope now again this is a 1 to 10 by 24 so it has a 24 millimeter objective and a 30 millimeter tube so if you're looking for rings you're gonna have to find those 30 millimeter rings I currently have mine set up in a Warren 20 MOA offset mount and this is not necessarily the mount that I would recommend for this scope right here it's just what I had available to me really what 20 MOA is good for our 20 MOA mount is good for is shooting long ranges so 800 a thousand plus yards where you need that extra elevation or extra dial that's when a good 20 MOA mounts gonna come into play but it's working out just fine for me so far for what I need it so anyway this scope right here is the second focal plane scope and like I've said in the past second focal plane has its gives and takes just like first focal plane does one of the nice things about second focal plane though is that the reticle is gonna stay the same size throughout the entire magnification range unlike a first focal plane where you might have this very complex reticle at maybe some of the higher settings so in this case let's say up to 8 or 10 power and then the reticle will start to get smaller and smaller and smaller as you dial it back down to 1 to the point where it's really not usable it becomes more or less like a red dot this one right here is usable all the way through the magnification range however the holdovers if you want to use the holdovers that are pre-built into this reticle you want to have it at that higher magnification range I'll try and keep that in mind but it is a second focal plane now on paper this has about 3.5 inches of max eye relief for me when I'm using it I'm sitting at about 3 inches so a little bit closer than the max eye relief and I don't get any ghosting no circles everything looks perfectly clear it's got very nice multi coated glass great image quality there's a lot of light that's allowed to be seen through this scope so that 30 millimeter tube is gonna allow a lot of light to pass through it which is nice because once it starts to get a little bit dark outside you don't lose a lot of that color you still maintain a lot of color and a lot of transparency even in low-light situations but this does have an illuminated reticle as a matter of fact this has 12 settings on it so we have 12 settings for our illumination and two night vision settings and one of the crazy things about this scope is even versus scopes that cost I'm gonna say eight times as much as this this is actually daylight bright on the max setting so if I bring this thing all the way up to 12 power I can see it during the day no problem which is fantastic because it gives you a little bit of contrast against your target so you could choose to run no illumination or with a little bit illumination in a scope like this and so you have a black reticle or the option for a red reticle and depending on what you're pointing at you might want to go with that red and so having a daytime bright illumination like that is fantastic and then being able to dial it all the way down to to night vision settings especially for the price point is great and then another nice thing I like about the illuminated reticle is that each one of these clicks on the side right here each one of the arm sorry on this side each one of these clicks is got an off switch in between so if you turn it on right there and you go to the next setting the next setting is gonna be off and then if you click it again the next setting is going to be on and then off so you don't have to scroll all the way through all of the illumination settings on this thing just to get to the off point and then scroll all the way back so if I'm somebody who knows I'm gonna be using this mostly during the day I can bring it all the way up to 12 power and then just click it back one notch so that I'm ready to simply click it up one notch and be at my 12 power again which I thought is great this thing runs off a single cr2032 battery which is located in this little compartment right here and it's ipx7 waterproof and they're saying that this thing is rated to over a thousand g's okay over a thousand g's of shock resistance in this thing which is absolutely incredible to be honest with you so you can use this on just about anything that you might own without having to worry about it breaking thousand tree G's is an incredible amount of energy that could be transferred to the scope without losing zero or having an issue with it now for somebody like me I have transitioned mostly to one two eight and one two tens over red dots reason is because I like the ability to be able to reach out and see my target a little bit clearer so if you have like a man-sized target and sitting out about 200 yards it's it's pretty difficult to see but if you dial this thing all the way up to eight or ten power I mean it really brings it within your field of view so that you can make a better shot at that distance so it really helps with those long distance shots but at the same time like a simple 1x red dot if I dial this thing all the way back it allows me to engage things that are much closer and much closer than let's say a traditional scope so if you have a three to nine or a four to twelve even if you're dialed down to that three or four anything within let's say 20 feet is still gonna seem a little bit blurry but with this it's gonna be crystal clear and right up front so if you're gonna be using it for like home defense or personal defense something like that and you know that your max distance within your house is gonna be maybe thirty or forty feet something like that having something that dialed all the way down to one or maybe even two or three power depending on what you're looking at I think it's fantastic it just fills a lot of different role okay so now let's go and talk about the turrets these are really nice turrets they have a lot of texture to them a lot of knurling so you get a good grab on them they are tactile as well as audible you can hear a very slight click when you are turning this thing they are lockable and reasonable so that I think is pretty nice the way that you use these turrets because they're capless is you simply pull up on the turret just a little bit like that that will free the turret so that it can move and then you have 1/2 m away per click on this thing then when you're done you find your zero you simply push back down on the turret and that locks it in place so the turrets not going to move at all and it's going to be the same for both windage and elevation now if you want to let's say lock your zero down so that you can make whatever adjustments you want and then come back to your zero once you have this thing zero once you know exactly where you want to be what you do is you simply take a coin or a screwdriver or something like that you take this top cap right here and you spin that top cap off when you spin the top cap off it will allow you to remove the outer portion of the turret like this you take your zero stop find out where your zero is push it right back down like that put your cap back on tighten that down and when that cap is tightened on that means now you're set let's say you're set at 100 yards zero right you go ahead you put your cap on so that it's at zero at that point now you're shooting out to let's say 600 yards or something and you went ahead and you made some adjustments and changes well now you can bring it right back to that zero and you're gonna be back at your hundred yards zero so it's it's a really nice very easy setup but also a safe setup because if you have this thing in a range bag or something you don't have to worry about these capitalists turrets moving on you at all now another nice thing about this scope is you get a couple little extras with it you also get some flip up caps which I almost always just take off but if you're somebody who likes to use those flip up caps or you plan on storing it and save for something like that you don't want anything to be scratched up then you can go ahead and put those flip up caps on and they're actually pretty decent flip up caps and you also get a little throw lever so you can see our throw lever right here it's a skeletonize throw lever and you can actually mount the throw lever just about anywhere that you want on this little adjustment ring right here so you can see that the throttle lever I have pretty much all the way over to the right side of the scope but if you move it just a little bit you'll see that there's different holes all along right here so depending on where you want your throw a lever to stop or start then you can go ahead and you can adjust it I felt like this last setting right here even though it does come pretty low on this side worked out pretty well for me so you can pretty much put that thing wherever but I thought it was nice that not only did it come with the throw lever it comes with the flip up caps and you do get a lot of really nice features especially for that price point so the swamp fox optics Arrowhead I got to say it's definitely 110 percent worth the money and it's a great option versus some other stuff that's on the market right now that will just absolutely kill your bank account I mean things are getting really really expensive and even though you know over a little bit over 400 bucks is still out of some people's price point I think for what you're getting here you're definitely getting a good investment I think that something like this will hold its value even years down the road so if you ever decide to sell it I think you'll be able to get a pretty good amount of money back for a good 1 to 10 so anyway I want to thank you guys very much for watching I really do appreciate it please like

barrel at the end here so let's see the difference between the stinger 243 maple and the victus 243 maple is it worth that 80 bucks to get the victors here let's check it out all right folks we're going to start out with the stinger maple 243 here to see who our last elite eight entrant is gonna be in wood bat madness we're out here at las vegas ball park big old yard we got 340 down the lines and then it goes way out the air is thin though we're at high elevation the ball flies here like a good 40 50 feet further a lot of the times than back in oregon those oregon duck videos i couldn't freaking even get it out at 3 30. here i'm hitting the 380 sign so let's get it boys all right baby this feels nice dude for 100 bucks all day oh yeah all right man that's pretty impressive let's see what the victus has got all right folks now we got the victus v243 last time we tried this bat out it was smashing the ball super loud well all right big boy time now we got the the v243 let's see what it's got today can it beat out the stinger maple and move on to face the american bat smith that's wow dude oh oh yeah with this bat if you barrel it up you literally can't feel it it's like you just you hear it and see it you don't feel it oh oh that's so loud there's a tank [Music] same exact ball i swear those were two different swings dude stinger's hanging with these expensive bats that's honestly pretty impressive let's do one more with each year all right smashed that's tough bro they're both good kind of feeling weird about this one we got another big vote let's go all right fellas voting time for our last spot in the elite eight the last matchup in the first round we got the stinger 243 against the victus 243 we're gonna say victus or stinger on the count of three do you guys got your votes yes sir kind of a close one honestly let's see here three two one victory this ah the queen's sweep only i think that's only like our second clean sweep the entire first round it is wow all right nick you've honestly matched with both bro uh what put the victis over the edge for you man yeah ultimately they felt pretty similar the only thing i'd say is the victus is a little bit more well balanced um the barrel starts a little bit earlier so it feels more evenly weighted handles kind of the same and you just can kind of feel the difference with the hardness of the victim you can hear it too i think yeah you guys will hear it in the video but uh ultimately it just came down to the hardness yeah all right trace why'd you end up going with the victims man it really just had to do with the hardness of the wood and just the balance yeah you were dipping a little bit with the stinger brush when it was the same term model the stinger is just a little bit too heavy and i just i really like the 243 model that victus has obviously and um you know i just felt like i swung way better with this i felt more confident with it i mean all in all his victus 243 takes the dub yeah dude victus does a really good job of having these big turn models but slimming them down and making them more manageable for like your average hitter exactly excellent job at that yeah guys and for me um really just the barrel profile kind of tells the story here you can see this is a slimmer longer barrel a bit more balanced out and this really just tapers at the end makes it quite a bit more end heavy you really have to kind of get it towards the end get that barrel out a bit more and really like just the hardness of the wood man you can tell by the sound and the feel if you barrel it up with this you can't even feel the ball whereas this you know gives you a little bit of feedback uh just a little bit louder denser wood out of the victus today so you can see even though these are both 243s both companies kind of define that a different way so but yeah i think the viktor just slightly edges it out i will say though if you don't want to spend 180 on a wood bat for 100 bucks that's a pretty good cut of wood man this and the louisville slugger m9 maple the 5 series those i mean i'd honestly probably go with that still bro the 5 series m9 for 80 bucks that's a killer deal this is another great maple budget option solid bat from stinger just tough to compete with victis bro that's a good cut of wood and there it is folks again stinger honestly putting up a really impressive showing hanging with the big boys but the victus just squeaking its way through really solid cut of wood here we're gonna have the victus 243 against the american batsmith ts28 in the elite eight so there it is folks that is a pretty gnarly looking elite eight right there which four of these will move on to our bat madness 1.0 final four all right guys thanks for hanging out today fun

appreciate you guys hanging out we'll see you next time [Music] so you", "CLvf4FMAUx8": "all right so you've decided what type of audio system that you're gonna design 8 ohms now the question is you've got a whole bunch of speakers and amplifier how do you wire it up properly so you don't damage the amp or the speakers well hey everybody Nick here for snap AV and this how-to video we're gonna walk through the different types of wiring parallel series and a combination thereof as well as the different calculations that you need to understand in order to design an efficient system let's go Dan you started alright in the first example we're gonna take a look at a standard 8 ohm amplifier stable to 4 ohms we're also going to be referring to speakers that will be 8 ohm now in order to wire it in stereo you simply hook up positive positive negative to negative pretty simple right well let's say we want to double up the number of speakers on to this channel as the example we've drawn out here simply wire that in parallel so you'll double up the amount of wires positive positive and negative to negative now can this be done well let's take a look the implications using our calculations all right so here's our calculation to determine total resistance with speakers running parallel we have 1 over R T equals 1 over R 1 plus 1 over R 2 so on and so forth for the number of speakers that you have with R stands for the resistance and we said each speaker is paid ohm so we have 1 over 8 plus 1 over 8 this equals 2 over 8 which equals 1 over 4 to figure out total resistance we simply flip the equation so that equals 4 homes now obviously we said this is a form stable amp so we're good to go in this scenario well let's say we want to add on another speaker can we do it well common sense is going to tell us no let's take a look at the equation to figure it out anyway so we'll add on another 8 ohm speaker this equals 3 over 8 flipped over is 8 over 3 or 2 and 2/3 home now obviously 2 and 2/3 ohm is less than 4 ohms which means will damage the speaker if we damage the amplifier if we add on any more speakers now let's take a look at wiring in series again we're going to use an amplifier that's a dome and for Au Sable now you're gonna find series wiring is rarely ever use but for the purposes of this example we need to show you so you understand now to warrant you go positive out of the amplifier to the positive of this first speaker and then negative out of the first speaker into the positive of the next speaker and so on and so forth down the line out of the last speaker you're going to wire the negative to the negative terminal of an amplifier to close a circuit let's take a look at the calculations to understand the total resistance of wiring it like this all right so here's our calculation to determine the total resistance for wiring in series very simple you add up the total resistance of all the speakers that you're using so since we have one two three speakers at 8 ohm apiece our total resistance is 24 ohms well wait a minute I've got an 8 ohm amplifier here and twenty four ohms there what does that mean well let's take a look at how power is calculated power equals V squared voltage squared excuse me over resistance now in this case voltage is constant our resistance is going up with each speaker there or our power is going down this simply means we're not going to get near as much amplification out of our speakers even if our amplifier is high-powered now knowing all this let's take a look at our third and final example of wiring in parallel and in series again we're going to use an amplifier that's 8 ohm 4 ohm stable now with the combination wiring we're going to run these speakers in series so we'll simply connect positive to negative and again with these speakers now since we're also going to run them in parallel we're going to take the positive terminal of this set of speakers and run it to this channel and connect this this series speakers here then we're going to take the negative terminal out of this speaker and run to the negative terminal the amplifier and then connect this via so now we have these figures and these speakers in series as well as being in parallel now for our total resistance with these being in series we learned that we just sum up the total resistance so we have 16 ohm here and 16 ohm here to calculate our total resistance in parallel as we've already calculated in series we have 16 ohm and 16 ohm we want to do one over RT equals 1 over 16 plus 1 over 16 this equals to 16 equals 1 over 8 now again to figure out the total resistance we just flip the calculations on both sides so R over T higher resistance total here equals 8 ohm now as you can see the benefit is well we now have an 8 ohm speaker load on 4 speakers with to an 8 ohm amplifier instead of running them down to 4 ohms which happened when we ran them in parallel now unfortunately this can get more complex as you get to bigger systems and more speakers and that's where you'd want to use impedance matching speaker selectors now let's say you put a volume control and with a whole bunch of speakers now you did the calculation and your total resistance was 2 ohms well if you look at the back of an episode of volume control you're going to see jumpers 4 1 X 2 X 4 X + 8 X the sole purpose is to multiply the total resistance and not damage your amplifier well obviously if you have 2 ohms and we have an 8 ohm stable amplifier we'll take 4 X as our jumper so 4 times 2 equals 8 ohms perfect for our amplifier well that concludes this how-to video on designing an 8 ohm system we covered wiring and parallel wiring in series as well as a combination of parallel and series wiring in addition to all the calculations and those pesky jumpers on the bond controls if you do have any questions or any issues while you're in the field please feel free to call our tech support team thank you very much

optics optics are a inter part of any weapon that you're gonna be messing with so today we're gonna be talking about the Collis k-16 eye now if you're not familiar with what that is it is a low power power variable optic it goes from one power all the way up to six power if you're not familiar with what a low power variable optic is and you're looking at this and you're like that's a scope why would I want that who would use that I'm sorry you're coming from they look a little odd so what a low power variable optic is is you have a glass that at its lowest magnification level aims to be a red dot like and the fact that you can shoot it quickly and it has good eye relief that means you can see through it and at the same time when you put it up to you know pass one power up to six power or some optics come with eight power like the night force right here that allows you to then reach out with the five five six now it's not quite as good as a red dot it's getting pretty close on the One X's we see over the one powers but as optic technology and glass has gotten better these become increasingly more popular simply due to the fact that they just really allow the ar-15 the five five six to really kind of stretch its legs and many other optics use out look and many other guns use the power variable optics but the they call us okay one six I has been around for a while and it's something that I've been meaning to review and everyone's been asking me but they're kind of hard to get your hands on as far as my relationship with Cullis goes no relationship with that particular company this was sent to me by Ally outdoors they sent me a couple other firearms in the past so I'll be doing more reviews so thank them for allowing us to send us this there's no exchange of money or ammunition all that was provided by lax ammunition for this particular review so with uh without kind of further ado let's go ahead and let's talk a little bit of the kalus k-16 ID how it stacks up to other low-power variable optics like the vortex razor HD gen2 and the loop hold mark six which up until now has been well it's still one of my favorite low-power variable optics but the Cullis is in is a phenomenal optic I've been incredibly impressed with it so let's talk about it first off Cullis is one of the world's oldest optic manufacturers they're based out in Vienna this is a second focal plane optic what that means is is when i zoom in with this bad boy I have a constant reticle size so it's not like i zoom in on it like you do with some other reticles I kind of go back and forth on which I prefer and generally I kind of do like zooming on the reticle itself at the same time I do see the merit and what a lot of people say that a second focal plane is more beneficial for such a small magnification range or you know up to six herbs you know eight power where the first focal plane really isn't needed so I do understand that I I'm not gonna kind of take a stance on whether one is better than the other because I find that I shoot equally well with both other than to say that I think it's more optic dependent I don't think the second or first focal plane is kind of a deal breaker for an optic I think a variety of other factors come into play that make an optic good or bad so start off with let's get into weight weight is something that I kind of always like to get into when it comes to optics because these optics can weigh a lot colles is one of the lighter optics that I've used it is in fact lighter than the Leupold mark six which came in at seventeen ounces this particular optic comes in at 16.9 ounces a pretty freakin lightweight especially compared to like the vortex which is wayne somewhere north of 20 ounces and something like the night force which is a little bit plus over that so when you mount the call ace to your rifle it is incredibly lightweight and it's very balanced depending on where you place on your rifle so I can definitely appreciate having a lighter optic of course you do pay for that quality it is not a cheap optic the cabling 6i typically comes in at around 1900 or so sometimes a little bit less if you can get like a demo model I've seen these being sold for like 1500 at times it's definitely a pricey optic and that's kind of a hard pill to swallow especially way especially when you could you compare it to something like the vortex razor HD to just such a great optic at such a great price now is the qaule is better yeah it is undoubtedly better but it's diminishing returns once you spending it once you start kind of spending over that so it's kind of more of a question of do you want the absolute best yeah you can spend that extra grand over like the vortex it's not gonna be like you know double better than the vortex though you know spending extra thousand it's definitely it's undoubtedly gonna be better but you have to understand that you do have kind of a diminishing return range when it comes to optics at this level because the vortex is very good that being said do I recommend it of course let's get more into it okay length as far as length goes it's a little bit longer than some of the other optics we've talked about ten point five inches compared to ten point three on the loop hold and ten point one on the vortex so a little bit longer but there's a little couple things that come into play that I think make it worth it I relief I relief is a huge factor in I box when it comes to low power variable optics I relief is the ability to how close I can be to the optic and still see through and get sight picture so as far as where I'm getting a complete sight picture I have a complete sight picture all the way from here all the way back to about right there so I have a pretty generous range of kind of where I can get my cheek weld and still get is a good sight picture also being off axis off of it it's very generous it's on par with the loopholed mark six but it has a couple other things that make it even better the vortex in comparison is as a really generous eye box as well as something that have talked about a lot but not quite as good as a colleague's I consider the colleagues one of the most forgiving eye boxes I've used to date so pretty phenomenal optic field of view is probably the area where the colleagues really shines the field of view on the k-16 eye is out of control it's larger than the vortex razor HD Gen 2 which I've constantly noted has a massive field of view and makes for very easy to bring onto target all the type stuff the k-16 eye has a larger so at one power you have a hundred and thirty-four feet of visibility compare that to the mark six from leupold you have a hundred five feet at one power and compare that to the vortex HD Gen 2 which is 115 you're seeing quite the increase over the other optics now the mark six at six power has nineteen point three feet the vortex has twenty point five at six power and then the Collies has twenty one point six at six power so in all fields it definitely is an improvement over the vortex and the mark six and again like I said before diminishing returns is it huge no it's not except that the one power that's fairly significant but it's definitely better and it definitely makes for an easier shooting process now along with just field of view and a couple other things something that's kind of harder to substantiate is what does it look like to actually look through the optic and this is something that cameras struggle with it's it's very hard to kind of make the camera see precisely what your eye is seen when I look through the optic for a variety of reasons so the qaule is I know it's a really you know kind of cliched term but has really good edge to edge clarity and what I mean by that is a lot of Cheaper will power very low optics or even the vortex have a little bit of bending or in some cases a lot of bending at the edges where the light is kind of bending around so you don't have a very flat image the k-16 eye has a very clear image of clarity around the entirety of the ring of what you're looking through in addition to that the image is very flat what I mean by flat is low variable optics can tend to sometimes fisheye as you're looking through them and you're scanning through depending how close something is the k16 eye is one of the flattest images that I've seen definitely on par with the mark 6 or a little bit better so I've been very impressed with that the light transmission is pretty phenomenal it's on par with the mark 6 which is on par that Nightforce better than the vortex but again it's not you know massively better it is just simply better so don't expect to be able to use this thing in the dead of night you definitely are gonna need a good illumination source when you get into dust just like with any other low-power variable optic it is kind of a limiter when it comes to these types of optics now that we've talked a little bit about that let's talk a little bit about the adjustments moving down the k-16 eye so we have end of the optic going over to our adjustments so first off I am a big fan of the adjustments right here each click equals one point one M R at very precise definitely something I want to see I like it when the when the adjustments are more precise just so I can get that Brown precisely where I want to instead of being kind of between two clicks it's right on there so I've been very happy with that the clicks are very positive they feel good definitely a fan of the adjustments on the k16 eye what's really cool about this is the illumination so I'm a guy who really harps on illumination and making sure that it looks good and all that type of stuff and with the k16 eye not only is it a very bright reticle but it also has very good battery life and on top of that was kind of cool is instead of having like little settings that you click through it's just kind of a continuous range or it goes from dim all the way to as bright as a ghost now if you're expecting like ain't bright like burning out your retina like you get from the vortex HD Gen 2 that's not what you're getting with with the k-16 eye and in fact that's not something that I want from a low-power variable optic what I want from a low-power variable optic is a reticle that gets bright enough to be used in daylight conditions to make sure when I'm you know panning through shadowed areas that I don't lose that reticle and that's definitely the case with this it is plenty bright much brighter the EOTech voodoo and definitely brighter than the Leupold mark 6 which I think has a really bright done in the night force too so definitely excels compared to those optics and a combination of other factors like edge to edge clarity and light transmission make for an optic that is really nice a shoot through and coupled with you know the eye relief and the generous eye box just a phenomenal optic so speaking of radicals we have the sm one reticle on this particular optic I am a huge fan of this reticle so realize that depending on what reticle you choose kind of is gonna dictate kind of what you're getting yourself into the SM one I think is one of the more popular reticles at least it's what I usually see the reviews on and the best way to describe it is a half-eaten doughnut of death with giant lines pointing to it so it's like an EOTech on steroids and I'm a big fan of that the circle in the center is eaten out at the bottom and then that portion of the circle is illuminated and you have an illuminated Center dot and I don't know if I've said it before all I have but that reticle gets plenty bright for a variety of situations so I'm a huge fan of that now once you go from there you have your elevation holds going all the way down now there's not so much in the way of windage there's some argument about whether or not that is needed on a optic of this capability as far as you know 1/6 power 8 power sometimes I like it I definitely use windage holds in the past especially shooting out to 700 with an AR but if that's something that kind of you're more into where you're kind of worried about that you can get a different type reticle for what I've been using this for you know how to about 450 this reticle has been plenty fine and speaking of this I have pushed this particular optic out to around 500 very easy to get hits with due in large part to the reticle the brightness and the eye box the edge clarity the light transmission everything makes for a very pleasurable shooting experience when using the k-16 I another thing to note as well is that the adjustable lever to go from one power up to 6 power back is very very smooth that was a problem I really had at the vortex razor HD Gen 2 where it was very stiff actually and you really needed a giant scope ring to be able to you know turn that back and forth I know there are tricks and tips to make that work a little bit better but I like that this comes from the factory you just very smooth it feels like quality and when you're rotating it now I wish they would have done something similar to night force when it comes to this little scope lever right here so on the night force they have a simple little knurled ring that you can screw in kind of change the position needed or add an extended one I think that was a really good choice that being said this night force is super stiff compared to the k1 6i so I wish there's something that you wear it's something that you can more easily swap out but you know that's kind of my only concern it comes to this because it is so smooth to run back and forth and that is something that I've definitely had a problem with with a lot of optics now with something like this it's it's very lightweight has great transmission a lot of people question the durability of the k16 I as far as whether these have been used overseas they have as far as the durability versus you know things like the tank you know the vortex razor HD or the mark 6 it seems to be on par with them the only information I've seen contrary to that it seems to be some information of individuals who have had these dint easily I haven't personally seen that I've been I've treated this optic very terribly because I'm awful with my stuff and I definitely have gouges just like any my other optics but I don't think it's a fragile optic in any case and even from individuals who have had these getting messed up or dented they say that the optics still performs fine so I think it is a perfectly robust optic I'll be doing a giant optic torture test in the future maybe I'll throw this honest car and like throw it off a cliff or something who knows but our you eat it off the cliff but I think this is plenty durable for what its intended purposes now the only thing I want to talk about past that is a little bit about the actual mount they use for the optics so the mount really matters make sure that you get a good mount you guys know that I recommend the scaler works mount which is what I have this in because it has an auto level in there to get it level and it's a very robust very lightweight mount I love the locking mechanism that sticking out where I can bust up my hand on their other good mounds for things like guys Lee American defense makes some great ones as well that I definitely recommend scalar works I know that they're more expensive that against immense quality costs and if you're buying a really expensive optic you should probably put it in a good mount so where does the k-16 I fall compared to other optics it's better than the vortex and definitely on par with the mark six and the one way it beats the March six hands down is going to be in the field of view other things it's pretty neck-and-neck and it's a little bit more situational what do you need it for what are you using it for because there are some great things about the mark six like its reticle that I appreciate a little bit more that being said the k-16 eye is a very fast very intuitive reticle to use so find what works for you just like anything else I can't say if something's gonna work for you and what you do whether that be you know competitive shooting or you know do to use for military use or LARPing what-have-you so get out there and find what it's gonna work for but I can without a doubt recommend the k1 6i for almost anything that you could possibly need it for yes it costs money yes it's a diminishing return over the vortex razor I'm being honest but it is definitely one of the best optics monies it can currently buy so get out there and get the k16 eye now as with everything that's cool this optic is it's not gonna make you a better shooter in fact if you're a terrible shooter you're still gonna suck with it so make sure you get training car works bare solutions Hayley strategic who is maybe my dad esoteric Tonique out and all these great instructors out there willing to give you their knowledge so that you can become a better shooter any better advocate four to eight so before we leave I know you guys aren't ask a little bit about the setup so first off we have a BCM QRF railed upper the QRF rail is B CMS normal little lock-up system which I love along with a quad rail very well made they're the BCM comp in the end arasaka mount with their offset Picatinny mount that puts it right up against my PEC 15 we have a surefire dual pressure pad front one is for the light back one runs the PEC 15 we have ABC M CAG which is a kinesthetic angled grip moving back there of course we have k16 i yea enhance performance magazines we have this all on a daniel defensive lower with one of the BCM grips don't like the safety so much because I hate dual safeties but have that on there running the Jaypee trigger giving us a shot right now trying it out some of their stuff and I love it so far running the b5 stock and the BCM charging handle giving that a shot because BC on has yelled at me for only ease and radiant stuff so I need to give everybody a fair shot so we're working with that right now and that is this particular rifle gentlemen ladies thank you for watching take care of yourself and I got nothing else for you last thing that I have for you is invest your time and your efforts into people who are not toxic and what I mean by that is there are people who just create drama and make your life more difficult and continue to do so maybe get better at times with this continue to do so I realize that you have a finite time on earth your time is very valuable and I don't mean to cut everybody out and anybody that ever makes you mad I don't mean that at all but just to say that there are some people who will drag you down and to understand when to leave good enough alone and just kind of get away from those situations because ultimately you need to make yourself happy a little bit of you know self love a little bit of a Iran there so get out there guys thank you for watching love you guys take care yourselves", "Kjv1fAoGTOE": "well done everybody welcome back and I've been wanting an LP vo for some time so there's a low-power variable optic where I can go from like 1 to 6 1 to 8 or even 1 to 10 of course I was looking around some of the names out there you got vortex you know you have loophole you have night force you've got all kinds of different companies that make these things and they range from you know two three hundred four hundred dollars all the way up to like three four thousand dollars depending on the brand that you want to go with and how many contracts that company has with the military so here's the thing when it comes to magnified optics lpv owes or hunting Scotian like that you can really quickly spend twice as much on your optic as you did on your rifle quick fast in a hurry so at this past shot show in 2020 I got ahold of the guys over at Swamp Fox optics now Jonathan from Steel City Arsenal introduced me to those guys over there I just check their stuff out liked what they had to say liked how they were standing on their product I was really curious after looking through him there I've get anyone in for testing and checking it out since I haven't had an LP vo in probably seven or eight years I kind of handled them for a couple months and they were nice enough to actually send out this Arrowhead which is a 1 by 10 by 24 so I have to say I am fairly impressed with this even though I haven't had an LP vo for a while a ton of my friends have liked vortexes strike fires and the strike eagles and a couple friends have the razor HD gentoos and now the threes and some of those things can get really expensive and I was really wanting to stay in that kind of 350 to 550 range because it's not something that I'm gonna use a whole lot but I really wanted to have something where I could reach out a little further and touch something just in case I needed to so this one comes in right at about that 450 dollar mark and that was a price point that I could live with because it came with some pretty good stuff that some of the others didn't even though I did have to get a different mount for it which they did provide as well there are a couple of things that generally plagued lower-priced optics and this is class and that is generally going to be the clarity of glass clarity the reticle eye relief and kind of the hewing so as you're looking through this and you take a good look downrange depend on your eye relief kind of the clouding around the edges and how quickly that occurs at what distance your eye is from that now when you get into those really high-priced optics it is super clear super crisp and everything is great once you start getting into kind of these more budget-friendly ones the glass can suffer so I have found the suave Fox glass is actually pretty tank clear for the cost more so than some of the other ones in the price point that it's at at that 450 mark for a 1 by 10 so the one that I got in for testing like I said is there 1 to 10 gorilla BDC reticle now what that is is it's their own kind of mix on a reticle in there it's actually a pretty cool looking kind of a chevron design and that just seemed to fit my eye a little bit better I've never really been a huge fan of all those lines and all that stuff on reticles especially mil-dot stuff it just screws with my eyes and have a really tough time down ring and using those things the BDC reticle on this Arrowhead is set at that 5200 for 556 and 308 they have a couple of graphics on their website which I'll throw up here throughout the video that show you how to use it for not only ranging but your drop compensation depending on your distance and depending on what caliber you're using now the scope is set at a hundred yard parallax setting so parallax can get a little bit interesting basically what it is is is that reticle moving in relation to your target as your eye kind of moves through the scope so if you're looking through your scope and you're on your target and as you kind of move slightly or your head up and down if that reticle is moving all over the place that means you needed to fix your parallax this one is set at a constant for 100 yards so in all it's very nicely laid out you have your elevation on top of course your windage on the side and then your brightness settings for your illuminated reticle on the left you do have 12 settings on there - night vision and then in between each setting is an off station so you can nearly go from 0 to 12 instantaneously if you know you're gonna be operating in the daytime you don't have to flip it all the way forward or all the way backwards that may or may not be something you're interested in but I thought it was definitely a nice option it also comes with a switch through a lever so you can quickly get to that maximum magnification and some don't the choice of scope rings is going to be up to you they sent me out there ha styling gaygent rings and this is the tall set reason I got the tall because I'm a little longer and as I'm behind this I want to be able to quickly come up and be in position without having to move my head anywhere if I'm in an engagement scenario so of course once I got it on here set it up torqued it locked tighter that had to head out to the range for that zero [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now generally on an optic that's of a quality name the zeroing process is gonna be pretty easy now 50 yards I was pretty much right on needed very minimal adjustments to get me where I was happy with being that I was trying to zero at an extreme angle laying in the bed of my pickup truck once I was all zeroed on the magnification setting of 10 because you want to you want a zero on the highest power setting I went ahead and did a quick confirmation on this kingslayer made a quick adjustment and then of course I wanted to run some of those transitions now definitely wasn't perfect on those like I said it's been a long time since I've used an LP vo and the one thing I will say about this even though I do like the fact that you can't put the Kingslayer on here it's a little bit different than some of the nicer mounts where you can just tilt it to the side you do have to come off and above the optic a little bit to get on target if you are doing a transition with that Kingslayer and RMR or whatever arm our footprint optic you have on there as a backup we're gonna go ahead and get into this thing so you can check the specs out see it up close and see if it's maybe something you are interested in make sure you guys are subscribed to the channel bust your LP vo out and send one down range for that Bell icon down there like the video of course and if you are interested in anything you see here today you can check those links out below we're gonna go ahead and get into this thing right now all right let's go ahead and get into this arrow head by Swan Fox here and I'll go ahead and show you the box and what comes in it and then we'll get this thing out of the way general box I know you don't care you get a nice little cloth in there it's a pretty large one I wanna say it's like 8 by 10 almost get your manual in there which explains everything about the optic and the reticle you get their tool which is actually pretty dang nice you will get a small allen head and screws for the throw lever which is included which is nice because some don't come with that and then you put that in whatever place you so desire on that magnification ring right there so let's go ahead and get into the specs here on this bad boy I'm gonna read these directly from the website and just give you the ones you're probably going to be most interested in so 50,000 around warranty which I guess effectively is pretty much a lifetime with warranty when you think about it could send can withstand 1,100 G's ipx7 rated weight on this bad boy without the Rings or the small flocks kingslayer's twenty point three six ounces not terrible overall length is ten point nine one and this is a one to ten by twenty four so the the obviously the twenty four is your objective tube and then one to ten is your power rating on this with via help by the throw lever you can go from one to ten very very quickly you got a push-pull locking turrets on this one so you just pull up you can make an adjustment push back down and they do lock in place a little bit of movement on them but that's going to be normal not overly loose or anything like that max ten you have a BDC reticle on this one so they call it the Barilla BDC that is gorilla BDC it's pretty cool I like the look of it I went with that over the moa so as far as our brightness setting knob here on the left hand side you can see there are a couple of night vision settings and then you have one to twelve so those total of twelve to night vision and then in between you'll see a blank dot right there now which what that effectively lets you do is go between the setting and off so if you want to be you know you know you're going to be in daylight and you want to go from zero to twelve you can set that that way for you so it's just one click and you don't have to spin that dial all the way up does take one twenty thirty two battery in there and this is your cap right here for that battery it does come with it from the factory not bad those batteries are fairly cheap the lenses are fully multi-coated anti-fog hydrophobic coating all that good stuff comes with the lens caps here they're okay they're pretty loose they've already loosened up on me because I left this thing out in the Sun and it pretty much killed those lens caps on day one but it does come that I'll probably just take them off from now on get a max windage and elevation adjustment of a hundred MOA and it's a half MOA adjustment per click so some optics are gonna have a quarter some half and that that's what this one is so field of view at a hundred yards about 115 115 points six so that's not bad for an optic in this class and then of course so what a lot of people are going to be concerned about is that eye relief so where does your eye have to be in the backside of this so that is going to be three point four six to three point five four I can say it's pretty generous being behind here and I will kind of show that up in the chair so those are the basic specs of it kind of lets get down to now my feelings on it it's nice it's a little bit heavy but for an optic in this price point we're not going to get the lightest and most durable thing in the world not a huge fan of those caps like I said you can see just how loose that that rear one there is it's nice that we do get that thrill lever on there very very nice adjustment here it's not overly stiff and it's not loose it's right in that firm position that we need to quickly move this and adjust so the hospital engagement rings I wanted to try those out they're a little taller and I like that because I'm a little bit of a taller guy and I don't want to have to duck my head down when trying to use an LP vo on transitions or anything so they are good they do have mounting points both forward and the rear set both sides doesn't matter how you put these on for an RM r-type optic I will say in comparison to some other mounts that you can mount across the pic rail either forward or wherever it's a little bit off so you have to kind of reposition your head you know if you're looking down this and you're looking through the optic you can't just do that straight kind of transition you have to lift your head off so it's not like some of the other mounts where you can be looking through like this and then just turn your weapon to the side and you got a straight view of it that's just not how these work but they are good they're solid and it saves you having to buy two different mounts you can just have it on there just takes a little bit of training one thing I did notice when doing this zero you can see right there you either red dot that to focus on a little bit for you and then you see the white dot on there so the turret it's just a tiny bit off so it's not perfectly in line I did notice that and I couldn't get the cap on perfectly not the biggest thing in the world but it was something that I noticed so you use that tool you unscrew the cap right here and you can make your adjustments take this off really okay loosen that up real quick and I'll show you guys what we got so basically what you do is you unscrew that you can make your adjustments in there there's a little ring in there which you can lose this very easily trust me I had to dig it out of the dirt so you go ahead you make your adjustments you zero it in you pull this all the way off and then you return that to zero and there you can actually see the little arrow on the turret right there and you want to get that right back down as close to that zero mark as possible and that's what's going to insure that you are on point and like I said it doesn't go perfectly in line so it's just a tiny bit off okay then you throw this back on and just put this a little bit over finger tight into his water sealed but you know a little bit more than that so you can see just doesn't quite line up a hundred percent perfectly but not bad at all I'm going to try and give you a few of the actual reticle here and this is always a pain in the butt I will do my best for you guys I have to kind of hit it in the corner of the screen so I know I'm doing this by hand this might be a pain in the butt for you guys to see but you can see the clarity of the reticle right there so I'll do the best I can to get you guys a good view of this in here so you can kind of see the reticle right there and it's very clear it actually is quite clear for what it is I know on camera this does not show up the best but you could just go one click in between you can turn off the actual illumination lowens Aaron now it was too much of a pain in the butt to try and show that to you on the tenth power so overall pretty solid optic here for what we are paying for it let's go ahead and talk about some of the good some of the bad when I think of running drills for this and what else I think could be in store for this optic so in all I think this is a pretty dang good optic for the price point it's zero it easy the glass is good the reticle is good brightness settings are great and I kind of prefer sometimes that second focal plane so if you don't know the difference between second and first focal plane second is basically what I call simple it's the same at all times simple same and first focal plane is that fancy one where it gets bigger with with magnification some people like one over the other and there are places to use one over the other me for something like this I kind of prefer that second focal plane I found it to have a really generous eye relief so the eye relief if you don't know is basically as you bring the rifle up where your head and eye needs to be in correlation to that scope to get the best field of view so I found for me being right here it's got a really good relief you can see how far I can move my head in and out and still get really good visual clarity through that optic there is an optimal place you really want to be in that comes with just training doing it ready up drills but there's a pretty good amount of varying distance in there that I found it was very usable out there on the range and I found that hundred yards setting of parallax to be on point I didn't have any issues once I laid down put it in a little turret there I didn't see any problems with parallax setting I wasn't able to go too far out with this based on the range that I was at the first couple times getting to use this I will try to get this out to a longer range and try to engage further out to really judge that BDC reticle and what it is capable of so I really think this is in kind of that vortex maybe that lower price loop hold market and then some of the others that are right in there it's got a good warranty the glass is good and like I said that reticle as clear as well I think they'll probably be a player in the game here but Swamp Fox is a very new company when it comes to optics I've only known about them for a couple years and they keep coming out with more and more stuff which is pretty much what companies do when they start they try and get a little slice of all of the market so what are the positives and negatives when it comes to this swamp fox Arrowhead because not everything is always gonna be all good like I said new company we don't know what to expect from them although I am fairly impressed for the price point of this Arrowhead at the time my one buzzkill on this one is these caps just aren't very good especially in the Arizona heat out here the rear one pretty much just doesn't work at all it barely stays closed and I didn't know how to expect a whole lot more than that being that they're free they came with it and kind of the price where this is at generally I probably wouldn't even leave them on there unless I was transporting this thing or doing something with it but they're definitely not the highest quality caps that turret market in they're being a little bit off kind of bugged me and it was only on the elevation so the windage adjustment was dead-on I even had my buddy check it and he was like nope it's just off so a little bit of a buzzkill there but not the biggest thing in the world either those o-rings I know it's really tough to kind of a fix those in there but those things were super easy to lose it's almost like there wasn't enough bike kind of around the depression they were in to keep them in there without them coming off no in that positive side you have generous eye relief generous field of view the price point is there the warranty is there and overall I think it's probably going to turn out to be a durable optic for what people like me and you are gonna use it for now this is really marketed towards kind of duty law enforcement use and I would like to see it kind of make a mark there I know where I work we bring in some vortex optics and we're probably going to be looking at a couple of these two for that designated marksman program and that's becoming more and more popular everywhere along with these variable power optics which is really why I wanted to get into one and start playing with them a little bit we are definitely gonna revisit this one several hundreds more rounds from now just to see how it's doing and then of course get it out on a longer range and do some distance you guys are interested anything you saw here today go ahead and check

at supporting me in any way you can check any of those links down below or you can go to that subscribe star page and we can take this channel to the next level together you guys get out there play with the little optic if you've got one Faro one from a buddy if you don't own one I will see you guys on the next one [Music]", "ibrJXucPQuQ": "hi there and welcome to the salted\npepper where we cook for real life using real food and we keep it real simple and\ntoday's video is a little bit different because we are gonna compare the six and\na half quart ninja foodi to the 8 quart ninja foodi I was lucky enough to get\nthe 8 quart on a huge Amazon deal so I went ahead and purchased it and I just\nthought it would be fun to compare them side-by-side we will be doing a little\nbit of cooking in both of them we're gonna do some hard-boiled eggs and we're\nalso gonna do some french fries so we can see the difference in the time it\ntakes to get to pressure and the time it takes to air fry and so on and so forth\nbecause I thought it was important to show you guys them actually working and\nand and if one is quicker than the other or anything like that I have not used\nthe 8 quart so I have no idea so we're gonna learn together but first before we\nget started with that let me just go over what comes with the 8 quart versus\nthe six and a half quart now this is also a new purchase for me another six\nand a half quarts so yes I have three ninja foodi now but anyway I put them\nto good use because I'm always creating new recipes so this is pretty exciting\nfor me so I wanted to just go over what comes with it now this is the six and a\nhalf quart and I got it from Sam's Club and it came with this nifty extra rack\nnow this is not customary usually the six and a half quart does not come with\nthis rack but the Sam's Club model does so that was pretty cool to me then I was\nalso very surprised I ordered this one from Amazon and it also came with this\nlittle rack now you can purchase these on the shark ninja website with the\naccessories I think I'm trying to remember what it's called I cannot\nremember I'm sorry about that guys but I will link to it below but if you don't\nwant to do that because I didn't think about I think they're about twenty\ndollars and then there's shipping charges so if you're an Amazon Prime\nmember you can also order this rack which effectively does the same thing\nnow you don't have handles so these are going to be easier to get in and out of\nthe basket however like this one because you have a flat\nsurface so if you're doing like a pizza like deep-dish pizza which I just did in\nthe Ninja foodi and I will link to that recipe right up there this works\nreally well for that so basically what these do is turn your basket into a\ndouble layer steamer or fry basket so let's look at the baskets I'm gonna show\nthe 8 quart now so I'm gonna move this rack here a little bit so I can get both\nof these side-by-side so you can see the difference because the difference\nbetween the 6 and a half quart in the 8 quart is only in the height the\ncircumference is exactly the same but the height is different so the six and a\nhalf is a little bit shorter than the 8 quart so let me get these two baskets\nside by side so you can see them okay so these this is the basket that comes with\nthe six and a half quart and this is the basket that comes with the 8 quart I'm\ngonna cover my face a little bit here just so I can show you the difference so\nthere is about an inch and a half difference in height and the racks are\nalso a little bit different in height that go inside so you can see the 8\nquarts oh just a little bit taller but they fit right in these baskets just\nlike that to turn them into a double-layer schemer and then of course\nif you decided to go with the Amazon one if yours didn't come with us the same\nthing you just don't have the handles but they do fit right in now sometimes\nthe little bottoms here will go through those holes but I find that you just\nmove it around and that's perfect so there you go so either one will work\noh let's try that so let's table the 8 fit so it does fit but I'm not sure\nlet's give it a whirl let's see if it'll go in here cuz I know a lot of people\nhave the 8 quart and the 6 and 1/2 quart but nope\nsee not gonna work alright so the 8 quart there now there's also a\ndifference let me I'm going to move this basket out\nthere's also a difference in the inner pot and I'll forgive me because this\none's backward so it's gonna be a little bit awkward this is an 18 cup Max\ncup capacity and actually I think it's about 17 cups for the pressure line \nthere's a little line on the inside that says pressure max means you don't want\nto go above that if your pressure cooking but this is an 18 cup and this\nis pull it out I'm gonna close the lid just and this one is 24 cups so you can\nsee there is a difference it's about probably about a inch and a half to two\ninches difference between these two pots so the other difference between the 6\nand a half quart in the 8 quart is the wattage the wattage on the 8 quart is\n1760 so 1760 watts and this one is 14 60 so one thousand four hundred and sixty\nwatts for this so it's gonna be really interesting to see does this one come to\npressure quicker does this one heat up faster because it's a higher watt\nwattage some people have said that the 8 quart cooks quicker now I have a hard\ntime wrapping my head around that because if I'm setting a degree a\ntemperature degree to 390 degrees then it should be 390 degrees and it should\ncook the same exact time as the six and a half quart even with the higher\nwattage of the 8 quart so it's gonna be interesting to see when we do the front\ntries in a little bit the other thing is people say is that the time to pressure\ncan be different and that pressure cooking times are a little bit different\nin the 8 quart I also have a hard time understanding that and I look forward to\ntesting recipes out in both sizes so that I can give you guys some advice on\nswitching up my recipes if you have the 8 quart instead of the six and a half\nquart the PSI on both of these are the same that's the important number when it\ncomes to pressure cooking and they are the same I verified that through Shark\nninja so really it seems to me that they should be cooking at about the same\ntemperature so it'll be interesting to see so before we get started with\npressure cooking our eggs I just want to finish going over what comes with the\nsix and a half quart and the eight quarts so let me grab these other racks\nhere if you already have a ninja foodie or you want to see a complete unboxing\nor actually take everything out of the box I'll link to that video up there\nbecause is full of information as well this is\nmore of a comparison but these racks come with every ninja foodie as far as I\nknow and they are pretty much identical except one is just a little higher than\nthe other so the 8 quart again is a little different so if you're ordering\naccessories on the ninja website make sure you check that what you're ordering\nwill fit your size pot they have different sizes for the different size\npots that they have alright so I think what we're gonna do first is start to\npressure-cook so we're gonna do some hard-boiled eggs before I do that I just\nwant to go over the pressure lid now they are identical for both models let's\nsee as a matter of fact let's see if they'll fit that's I didn't I haven't\ntested these out so we're doing this together here now I'm backwards but\nlet's just say see if I can get this lined up okay everything's backwards\nthough it's rip yeah so they fit okay so the lids are identical so if you needed\nto get an extra lid they're just one size when you unbox or open up your\nninja foody for the first time you definitely want to check the sealing\nring both of mine were not completely pressed down they look like they are but\nthey're not and that will create problems when you do your pressure test\nnow I'm not gonna do the pressure test today because in fact I'm gonna do like\na pressure test when I do the hard-boiled eggs but if you want to\nwatch the video on how to do the pressure test I can link to that right\nover there as well so just make sure that this sealing ring is pushed way\ndown and sits in the little groove and you'll feel it come into place the other\nthing that people talk about is this knob here I've heard a lot of people are\nhaving problems with it falling off it does come off okay so you can pull it\noff now ninja does not recommend that you routinely take this off but if for\nsome reason it does fall off you just put it right back in the other\nthing I wanted to go over because this another thing that I hear quite a bit\nit's people having trouble with the valve so the valve is loose it sort of\nfloats so when it's in the seal position it floats around when it is vented it\nclicks and it sits into a little piece here I'm gonna hopefully you can see it\nthere's a little Ridge that this fits into when it's on the vent and you'll\nfeel it click a little bit and it lifts up so some people I think are just\nturning it but they're not actually pushing it over so make sure you do that\nwhen you're venting push it all the way over and it'll lift and click a little\nbit okay last thing about the lid is the part that you clean is the silicone ring\nwhich you can run under hot soapy water you can put in the top rack of the\ndishwasher just make sure it's not gonna drop down and get into the element\nbecause it would burn and then it would be not usable anymore but this little\npiece here does pop off and they do recommend that you clean this so this\none comes off fairly easily but if you have trouble getting it off just stick\nyour fingernail underneath and then it will pull right off for you okay so\nthat's a little trick there and you just clean that out making sure it's the anti\nclogged valve and you just want to make sure that that doesn't have any residue\nor anything in there that could create some problems this red button you don't\ndo anything with it will move up and down but you do not remove it at all all\nright so why don't we get started and see the pressure function on both of\nthese and we're gonna do it we're gonna do some hard-boiled eggs and we'll see\nhow long each one takes to come to pressure so let me just gather a few\nthings and then we'll get started with that all right now make sure you stick\naround till the end of this video because I am gonna show you some of the\ncoolest ways that you can stack pans for pot and pot cooking whether you have the\nsix and a half quart or the 8 quart and you'll get the most room out of your\nninja foodie so definitely stick around to the end of this video so I have two\nlarge eggs that I took out of the refrigerator probably about an hour ago\nso there are the same temperature they're from the same batch because that\ndoes make a difference to fresher eggs sometimes take a little bit longer I\nhere so these are identical and they're free from cracks going in I put two cups\nof just tap water into the ninja foodie and I'm gonna set these on the basket so\nI have the basket in now I'm only doing two because this is just a practice but\nyou can layer them up people do a couple dozen at a time and the same thing here\nare two cups of water the basket is in and I'm gonna put these eggs on the\nbasket carefully one thing I do recommend when you're doing hard-boiled\neggs just don't put the eggs right on the bottom of the inner pot either use\nthe rack or the basket to raise them above I found that if I do them right on\nthe bottom they get brown spots on them the other thing I found for me is that\npressure cooking time of four minutes with a natural release of six minutes\nworks better than the 5-5-5 method so that's what we're gonna do here we're\ngonna do four minutes of high pressure on both the six-and-a-half and the 8\nquart and we're going to do six minutes of natural release which means I don't\ntouch this for six minutes then I will immediately release the rest of the\npressure and we'll get them into an ice bath for about 10 minutes or so all\nright so I'm gonna put the lid on here this is brand new so again I haven't\neven done the pressure test so everything will go fine all right so now\nlet's get them set up here turn them into food aeon see everything's\nbackwards from what I'm used to we're gonna go on high pressure we gotta\nfind the button and for four minutes and we're gonna do the same thing here all right so four minutes here and then\nlet me get my fingers and my husband is gonna turn on the timer we're gonna try\nto do this simultaneously so we really find out okay ready\ngo and then put your valves to seal which mine are alright let's see this is\ngonna be cool okay so the 8 quart took about six six\nminutes I'm looking at my notes here six and a half minutes for the red button to\npop up but then it took an additional minute or so for the countdown to start\nso the time to pressure was seven minutes and 15 seconds for the 8 quart\nnow the six and a half quart was a lot slower so the six and a half quart took\neight minutes and 26 seconds for the red button to pop up and then it took\nanother 45 seconds or so before the countdown started so definitely this 8\nquart came to pressure quicker the other thing that happened is there was a\nlittle more steam released after the button popped up which is totally normal\nthat happens it doesn't usually continue throughout the whole pressure cooking\ntime but sometimes a little of the steam is released and that happened on the six\nand a half quart but not on the 8 quart so that's all I know right now and so\nwe'll let these finish cooking and then we'll get them into the ice baths and\nsee what the centers look like so the difference in time has been about two\nminutes so these eggs have been in the ice bath for ten minutes now and so I'm\ngonna go ahead and peel them and we're gonna see what the centers look like and\nthen these have about two more minutes to go so that'll just give us just the\nright amount of time now if you have not made eggs in a pressure cooker or ninja\nfoody oh my gosh are you in for a treat I have never had eggs peel as easy as\nthey do after their pressure cooked it is just amazing I mean look at that\nthere's not one bit of ripped egg white it's perfect I was so impressed the\nfirst time I will never make eggs any other\nway so I'm just gonna rinse off any extra shells there and go ahead and do\nthe same thing here and I just kind of gently roll them until it starts to\ncrack what you could it's a harder eggshell you could knock it down on a\ncutting board or something all right so it looks like now I just coughs at with\nmy finger that's not that's not because the peel was attached or anything it's\njust coming off beautifully all right so let's get that off okay so let me put\nthese over here real quick and then let's cut into these now interestingly\nenough because this cooked faster it came up to pressure two minutes quicker\nwhich means actually that that cut time to pressure is cook time so I won't be\nsurprised if these eggs are a little less cooked than the ones from the six\nand a half quart all right let's cut this one straight down the middle here\nwell they look pretty good and then I'm gonna cut this one like if you were\ngonna make deviled eggs they look pretty good\nthat's a nice it's a nice hard-boiled egg the center is definitely soft but\nfor me perfect so I like the way this egg looks so now let's check these and\nthere are absolutely no brown spots on any of the egg whites from the 8 quart\nI've had that happened a couple times with my six and a half look at that not\njust amazing now a lot of people do the five five five methods so that means\nfive minutes of high pressure cooking time followed by five minutes of natural\nrelease then immediately release the pressure and then a five minute ice bath\nbut I found that the four six ten works for me and if you are at elevation you\nare going to need to change your times too because altitude does affect\npressure cooking so the first time you go to make hard-boiled eggs don't do\nlike 24 of them do one or two and get the timing right\nbefore you do a whole bunch I don't know this is gonna be hard they look about\nthe same guys they really do all right so let's see if I can tell the\ndifference in texture at all it's perfect I'll tell you that mm-hmm very\ngood let's see now this was a little crumbly\ner that's interesting no real difference though none whatsoever all right\nso oh one thing let me show you this I just noticed this I didn't see it before\nso the six and a half quart this was an eggshell from the six and a half quart\nthe brown spot was starting but it didn't transfer to the egg but sometimes\nyou'll find that from heat I didn't notice that on any of the shells from\nthe 8 quart so maybe it's just that few that few seconds less of time to\npressure a few minutes less but anyway they're cooked perfectly both did a\ngreat job so as of now the 8 quart and the six and a half quart are pretty much\nequal in my book as far as pressure cooking hard-boiled eggs now let's do\nsome air frying okay so I have 4 ounces of french fries measured out I weighed\nthem so they are identical and I have preheated both the ninja foodies this is\nthe six and a half quart this is the 8 quart for 10 minutes on broil now I do\nrecommend preheating on broil when you're doing anything that's breaded so\nthese are like little breaded french fries they're just from the freezer\nsection of the grocery store or fried fish or breaded chicken you're gonna do\nfor fried chicken because you want that extra heat and the broil function gets\nto about 425 degrees versus 400 on the other air crisp or bake roast functions\nso if you pre heat on the broil you get a little bit hotter of a pot and\nthat's gonna help to sear on the breading for you then you can bump it\ndown as you're cooking it you're gonna decrease the temperature\nbut to preheat do it on the broil I also have the baskets in both of these so\nwhat I wanted to do is turn the 8 quart on first and let you hear the difference\nbecause I have heard that the 8 quart is a lot louder now I'm not noticing that\non the two models that I have here at the six and a half quart in the 8 quart\nI'm not noticing a huge difference but let's turn this one on just for a minute\nso you can hear the difference oops I gotta get to the right oair crisp\nwill go to 400 and hit start so let's let that run for just a minute while it was preheating I did notice\nthat it started off kind of soft and then maybe at about the five minute mark\nit got a little bit louder but then it it kind of quieted down again too so\nthat is what the 8 quart sounds like and I'm gonna turn this off and now we're\ngonna turn on the six and a half quart and see if we can notice a difference now it started out kind of loud it\ndidn't do that the first time or when I was on broil it did not do that let's\nturn it off and turn it back on again cuz I am hearing a like a little\nrattling now and if that did not do that before I'm gonna turn it back off and\nlet it totally quiet down I don't want to lift the lid cuz I don't want to let\nmy heat out so I'm gonna leave the lid closed so I'm not gonna check the fan or\nanything and let's just try it again see if it does it again nope all right\nthe 8-quart might be a little bit louder but it's not super loud so everything\nseems to be working just fine all right I'll go ahead and leave this one on\nwe're on air crisp at 400 and so that defaults to 20 minutes and that's fine\nthis isn't gonna take 20 minutes but we're gonna throw in the French fries\nnow and we'll get this one on to you heard him sizzling as soon as they\nwent in all right so now we'll let these cook and probably\nin about three to five minutes I'm gonna flip them around and we'll see how long\nthe 8 quart versus the six and a half quart take to make the perfect crunchy\nfrozen french fry okay so it's been about eight minutes and I think that\nthey're both done now like I said I have moved them around a little bit and they\nseem like they've both gotten really nice and crunchy here you can hear that\nthey are crunchy oh my so eight minutes for both this is\na little bit more awkward for me so yeah they they feel good too then we're gonna\ndo a taste test and see all right there we go ahead and turn\nthis off okay let me just let these cool down\njust a minute now these look a little darker\nalthough 400 degrees should be 400 degrees mmm very good very good all right let's try one of\nthese very good very good I don't see a\ndifference the perfect like I said these have a little more browning to them but\nthey both taste the same they're both done perfectly so again it's a toss-up\nthey both do a great job I don't see any huge advantage in the eight court over\nthe six and a half Court except for the added volume that you can get in there\nso with the six and a half court you know you're limited like I'll show you\nthis the steamer basket that I absolutely love to use I can only fit it\non without the lid so in just a minute when this cools down I'm gonna see I bet\nI can fit this whole thing in with the lid and this is a great steamer basket\nso when I'm cooking with my steamer basket I'm gonna probably use the 8\nquart and when I'm cooking other things I'm gonna use the six and a half quart\nso I'm excited with both of them one other tip that I wanted to give you that\nactually somebody in my group ninja foodie 101 let me know the other day\nwhich I thought was an awesome tip is there is a sticker on the back that you\ncan scan with your phone you can just take a picture of it with your phone\nit's called a QR code and then you can register it online at the shark ninja\nwebsite so it makes it super easy to register your product and you want to do\nthat so that you can take advantage of all the warranties all right so let's\njust let this cool down just a minute and then I'm gonna do some configuring\nwith a few different accessories so that you can decide based on your cooking\nhabits whether you think you need the 8 quart or the six and a half quart so I\nhaven't opened these yet but I took a peek you know inside the wrapper and the\nsix and a half quart comes with the owner's manual that has the 300 series\nso it's for all of the models that are in the 300 numbers the which are all the\nsix and a half quart the 8 quart are for series and it looks like it says 400\nseries I haven't read them so I don't know if there's any major differences\nI'm expecting not to see too many and the recipes are exactly the same from\nwhat I can tell now that's in the United States I do understand that in other\ncountries you get different recipe books but for the United States they are\nidentical for both models so you don't get you know a different book with the 8\nquart or anything okay so now let me show you some ways that you can\nconfigure the six and a half quart ninja foodie for layered cooking or pot\nand pot cooking so I'm going to open up a lid here what I have is the rack that\ncomes with the ninja food II this is a six and a half quart rack now you could\ncook something underneath in the inner pot and you could use a cake pan these\nare two inch deep this is two by six and this is two by eight the two inches is\nthe ones that I have you might have a little bit taller and then this\nconfiguration would not work so you can put the six inch by two on top here with\nlike let's say rice so let's say you're gonna do chicken in the bottom when\ndidyou rice on top and the pressure cooker lid will fit on no problems now\nunfortunately the 8 inch won't work because of the design of the rack you\ncan't get it to sit right in there but it will go underneath so now let's say\nyou want to do potatoes in the bottom then maybe your chicken and then maybe\nat the very end you want to throw and your vegetable to steam or pressure cook\nor something like that you can do that by this setup so you're gonna want to\npick up graffiti bands from Amazon and I will link to those below they come in\nassorted sizes and I recommend getting the pack that has a bunch of different\nsizes because depending on how you set this up will depend on the size you want\nto use and I think this is going to be a good size for us here so what you want\nto do is take the band and this could be like a little cumbersome at first\nI'm gonna take that off for right now lift your pan on take the graffiti man\naround pan in the rack and kind of spread it out a little bit like that now\nwhat that's doing is it's holding up the pan so now you still have another layer\nfor your potatoes underneath that pan and you can pop this on top the\ntender-crisp lid will not close with this configuration this is for pressure\ncooking or steaming then you can put your lid on and start cooking so I\nthought that was pretty awesome the other day I did red beans red beans like\noccasion red bean in the bottom I did cornbread underneath and then I did the\nrice on top and it was perfect so so that was just a cool little tip there\nbut you can use the smaller size on the bottom as well so it doesn't have to be\nthe eighth inch you can use the six inch which is what I did for the cornbread\nokay so now let's see what we can do with the 8 quart let's see if we can\neven do more and I'm not sure but let's say so we've got a little bit taller of\na rack here so I'm wondering if we could do three now I don't think so see those\naren't gonna fit down now you could probably do it if you don't want to use\nthe rack you can probably use this guy which is another Amazon item that I like\nbut the 8 inch doesn't fit you could probably push it in there but it really\ndoesn't so 6 inch there 8 inch actually I don't use 6 6 and then 8 now\nI would ban these together probably but I just want to see if they're gonna fit and they do that's pretty cool so I'm\npretty excited about that oh isn't that awesome okay so I'm\nexcited about that so that is an advantage there of the 8 quart is you do\nhave a little more space lift that out there's no way you can get three pans in\nhere and the pressure lid go on I've tried I've tried all kinds of\nconfigurations and I can never get that to work so that's pretty awesome the\nother thing is I mentioned earlier my steaming basket so I love to use this\nwhen I'm steaming or pressure cooking and it just won't fit you know won't\nneither lid will go down when it's in the six and a half quart so I mean I\nmodify it I just take the lid off and it works fine but I'm excited to see is it\ngonna fit in the 8 quart now I wouldn't bake roast or anything with this it's\nbamboo it's it's meant for steaming so it's good in a water environment and\nit's gonna fit guys I'm excited about this perfect absolutely perfect so\nthat's that's wonderful so that's the big difference between the 8 quart and a\nsix and a half quart you get a little bit more room for stacking things so we\ncould probably do a little more pot and pot cooking have a few more\nconfigurations however you know I'm cooking with the six and a half quart\nall of my recipes are made with the six and a half quarts so I will not be\nreally taking advantage of that with the recipes that I create for you guys\nbecause I want everybody to be able to replicate them so I'm not gonna do\nspecific 8 quart ninja foodie recipes at this\nanyway I might branch out into that as a little separate thing but for now all of\nmy recipes are still gonna be made in the six and a half quart so no matter\nwhich one you get you can make my recipes now I'm super excited to let you\nguys know that I have an Amazon store now and you can see these products and\nother products that I recommend on that store and all you have to do is go to\namazon.com slash shop slash the salt and pepper and I will link to that below for\nsure so check in on that store any items that I find that are just great for the\nninja foodie I'll add in I've got some pantry items with some of my favorite\nthings that I cook with and just some cool stuff so check that out for sure\nall right so we've compared the six and a half quart which is 1400 watts versus\nthe 8 quart which is 1700 watts and that's 1460 and 1760 to be exact and\nbasically you can't go wrong with either model I recommend them both I love the\nninja foodie and I know you will too", "tByXPGwvZ_I": "Hi. I'm Jennifer from Workroom Social. Now let's talk about how to use a seam guide\non your sewing machine. Whenever you're sewing, the goal is always\nto sew a straight line, right? You don't want to be kind of wavy and zigzaggy\nall over the place. On your sewing machine, on your throat plate,\nyou should have a seam guide. What that is is markings that tell you distance\nof your stitch, from the needle to wherever you're sewing. Generally, we work with our fabric on the\nleft and then we're going to use the gauges on the right. It's the same, the gauges on the left and\nright of the needle. Just to look here: this is 3/8\", 4/8\" or 1/2\",\n5/8\", and 6/8\". If for some reason you don't have a seam guide,\nI like to take a little bit of artist's tape, which is a low-tack tape. And you can use it to create your own seam\nguide. If I'm going to do 5/8\" seam allowance, I'll\njust put that right on there. You can use a ruler to measure from your needle\npoint to 5/8\" on your ruler and put your tape down. Now, you'll take your fabric, fabric to the\nleft, seam guide to the right. Lift your presser foot, and put your presser\nfoot back down so that the edge of your fabric is right along that seam guide right there. Then you can just start sewing. You can see, as I'm sewing, I'm letting the\nfeed dogs, which are the little, tiny teeth that are underneath your presser foot, I'm\nletting them kind of pull the fabric. But with my hands I'm keeping the fabric straight\nwith that seam guide. Now, we can see we have a nice, straight line\nthat's parallel from our raw edge. That's how you use a seam guide.", "1N0wdUdv_Pc": "which is greater we have two fractions one for two thirds the numerator of this fraction is 1 the denominator is 4 the numerator here is 2 the denominator is 3 in order to find which is greater you need to find the lowest common denominator or any common denominator at this point whatever is the same denominator 4 times 1 you need you from your multiplication table 4 times 1 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 4 times 3 is 12 4 times 4 is 16 let's look at this fraction now 3 times 1 is 3 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 3 is 9 3 times 4 is 12 let's stop there and see if we have a same number same here and here and we do we have 12 so we now know the common denominator is 12 now to see which fraction is greater let's work on the numerators on this fraction 4 times 1 gave us 4 4 times 2 gave us 8 4 times 3 gave us 12 4 times 3 is 12 what you did to the denominator you must do to the numerator so then that's 1 times 3 if we did 4 times 3 it's 1 times 3 which is 3 let's look at this fraction 3 times 1 is 3 3 times 2 is 6 3 times 3 is 9 and 3 times 4 gave us 12 3 times 4 gave us 12 what we do to the denominator we must do to the numerator also

gonna be making anything I'm gonna show you something so today I'll be showing you how to measure staff the proper measuring techniques the measuring stools and all the stuff needed basically when making where differs most is the amount of ingredients that you use if the amount of ingredients is not perfect the cake or the thing will not come out perfectly so many people have asked me in the comment box also what one cup is equals how many grams and many more stuff like that one more thing that I have to say is that when you type in Google and see one cup of flour is equals how many grams you'll get different opinions like 120 125 130 150 and all those kind of opinions but today I've shown it in life for you to measure and how much it weighs I've got 150 grams so let's get on to the sweet here I have all the tools that we use for measuring wet and dry ingredients for baking cooking etc first you're 1/2 cup cups are used for measuring wet and dry ingredients your F spoons sports the same way is used for measuring wet and dry ingredients here is a weighing scale it is not a much necessary tool buying baking and cooking but some recipes called for ground measurements so if you want to use it in France then it is a bit necessary so you can measure dry ingredients in this weighing scale we usually don't measure wet ingredients in a weighing scale and grams then here is another cup this is useful in wet ingredients in mills and litters so first let's get started with the cups here I have all the cup measurements this is one cup this is half cup this is 1/3 cup this is 1/4 cup and this is 1/8 cup so in-between 1 cup and 1/2 cup there are two measurements which is 3/4 cup and 2/3 cup I don't have them today so I'm not showing them so one cup is 16 tablespoons that is 48 teaspoons 3/4 cup is 12 tablespoons that is 36 teaspoons 2/3 cup is 11 tablespoons that is 32 teaspoons 1/2 cup is 8 tablespoons that is 20 40 spoons 1/3 Cup is 5 and 1/2 tablespoons which is 16 teaspoons 1/4 cup is 4 tablespoons which is 12 teaspoons 1/8 cup is 2 tablespoons which is 6 teaspoons so in between if you don't have a few cups it's fine for example I don't have 3/4 cup so 1/4 cup plus 1/2 cup gives me 3/4 cup I don't have 2/3 cup also so 1/3 cup plus 1/3 cup gives me 2/3 cup if you don't have 1 cup 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup gives me 1 cup then if you don't have 1/4 cup 1/8 cup plus 1/8 cup gives me 1 foot cup that's it so if you don't have a few measurements you can add up together and make that measurement so it might feel a little bit confusing when I say it like this so I leave everything in the description down below so that you can check it write it down in your notebook and refer it whenever you want so now I'm going to show you how to measure stuff in cups so right here I have some flour and I have 1 cup so now I'm going to show you how to measure ingredients in cups first thing that if the mixture is the cup should be totally dry second thing is that you should always use the spoon to scoop in your flour and whatever stuff into the cup you should not directly scoop into it or else the measurement will come wrong so let's take one day is teaspoon by teaspoon or a spoon by spoon and add it into the cup let's take it up or fill it as much as you can and then the third thing is that you should not press it down with a spoon if you do that there are chances of getting an extra flat which will make your recipe wrong so what you have to do is take a knife and just flatten it down like that this will make sure that you get the perfect amount and that's the ingredient and that's how you measure it in cups now let's go ahead and check how much this will weigh in my wing skin so right here I have my being scale let's start first there's a button right here colors on/off and tear press on that so the weighing scale will on then let's keep in the plate you're gonna use and in the same button you just press so the measurement of the bowl will get decreased then let's add in the flour so you can see you've got 145 grams so it's fine it's actually 150 grams so it will differ sometimes but that's fine five grams is not even half a tablespoon so it's just fine and this is a perfect amount of the flood another thing that most people get confused is that they think ingredients weigh the same in grams but they don't so I suppose I have one cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of sugar sugar would weigh 240 grams but the flour will weigh 150 grams that's because sugar is more heavier than the flat the same way powdered sugar brown sugar cake flour all-purpose flour bread flour baking powder baking soda cocoa powder everything differs so in case you get confused and leave everything in the description down below so that you can refer now let's move on to measuring wet ingredients in cups so this is a 1/2 cup and below that it is written 125 ml clearly in the same cup so most of the cups will have the middle measurement with the cup measurement also so you don't specifically have to take another cup and measure it in ml again and again another thing wet ingredients everything is the same in ml it's not like dry ingredients that this measure is different and the other one measure is different everything was your same for example I have half a cup of milk and half a cup of oil both measure 125 ml only they don't differ but but still I leave everything in the description so that you can again refer so here I have spoons this is one tablespoon this is half a tablespoon this is one teaspoon this is half a spoon and this is 1/4 teaspoon one tablespoon is three teaspoons and half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons for suppose you want to make 3/4 teaspoon then you can take 1/2 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon which gives you 3/4 teaspoon so it's just same like measuring dry ingredients and wet ingredients in cups so here I have supply this is a tablespoon I'm just gonna take it like that and flatten it so you have 1 tablespoon that's ready that's so simple that's it thank you so much for watching hope you liked it I hope this video is very useful to you thanks once again bye-bye", "bcM5J-wYHjE": "This video is provided as supplementary material for courses taught at Howard Community\nCollege and in this video I'm going to show how to convert between\ninches, feet, yards and miles. Now before we can\nactually do a problem, we have to understand how these four\nunits of measure relate to each other. So let's start with that. One foot is equal to 12 inches. Another way to say this would be that there are 12 inches in one foot. One yard is equal to 3 feet. Now very often yards are expressed in terms of inches. So we can find what  one yard equals\nin inches. We can do it this way: if one yard \nequals 3 feet and each of those 3 feet has 12 inches, if we multiply 3 times 12 inches, we should get the number ofinches in\na yard. So 3 times 12 is 36. That's going to be 36 inches. We've also got miles. One mile is equal to 5280 feet. So these are some facts\nthat you should have memorized. So when you get a chance, make sure\nyou commit them to memory. Now let's go on to a problem. Convert 4 yards to inches. \nHere's how I'm going to do this. I'll write 4 yards. I can abbreviate yards\nas yds, and just to make this clear, I'm go to\nmake that into a fraction has a one as its denominator. And now I'll multiply it by another\nfraction. What I'm going to multiply it by is the fraction 36 inches --\nand I'm going to keep that unit of measure -- 36 inches over one yard. Now this fraction equals one, \nbecause 36 inches is the same as one yard. When my numerator\nand denominator are the same, then the fraction equals one. So all I'm doing\nis taking 4 yards and multiplying it by one. Now when I do\nthis, the next step I'll do is cancel out anything I have in common in the\nnumerator and denominator, and both have yards. \nSo I'll cross our the yards the numerator, cross it out from the\ndenominator, and now my denominators are just ones, which means I can just multiply the\nnumerators. That's going to be 4 times 36 inches.\n4 times 36 is 144, and the unit of measure was inches. Now let's do this is second way. Let's convert the yards first into feet\nand then the feet into inches. Let's see if we come up with the same answer. So once again, I'll write 4 yards as a fraction. \nIt's not absolutely necessary. And now I want to convert this into feet. So the unit I want to convert into its\ngoing to be unit I put in the numerator. So let's see: one yards is 3 feet. So I'll have three feet as the numerator.\nI'm converting out of yards, so I'll have one yard in the\ndenominator. So I'm multiplying 4 yards times\ntimes feet over one yard. 3 feet is the same as one yard, some I'm just multiplying by one. \nBut after I do that I'll want to convert feet to inches. Now there are 12 inches in every foot. So 12 inches equals one foot. So 12 inches over\none foot is a fraction equal to one. Now I've got my multiplication\nproblem. I can cross out things that I have in\ncommon. So I've got yards in the numerator and yards in the denominator,\nfeet in the numerator, feet in the denominator. \nAll of my denominators are now one, so I just have to multiply the numerators.\nI've got 4 times 3, that's 12, times 12 again is 144, and the unit of measure is inches.\nSo that's 144 inches. it's the same thing I got the first time. Let's do one more. Let's convert 48\ninches into miles. So I'll start out with 48 inches. I'll make that into a fraction and I don't know how many inches are in a\nmile, so I'll have to convert 48 inches first into feet. So let's see. One foot is the equivalent of 12 inches. So I'll make a fraction with one\nfoot as the numerator, because that's what I want to turn \nmy number into, into feet, and 12 inches is the\ndenominator, that's what I want to cancel out,\nthe inches, and that fraction, again, equals one because\none foot is the same as 12 inches. So it's a\nfraction with the numerator and denominator the same.  Once I get the number feet, I'm going to want to convert\nthat into miles. So one mile -- I'll make that the numerator -- is equivalent to 5280 feet, and  that'll be the\ndenominator. Now let's get rid of inches, which I have\nin both the numerator and denominator. So I can cancel them out. \nWe'll get rid of feet, which I have in the numerator and denominator. We can simplify this a bit more. I've got 48\nas a numerator and 12 as a denominator. So I can divide both of those numbers by 12.\n48 divided by 12 is 4, and 12 divided by 12 is one. And now when I multiply this, I get 4 times one times one mile. Let's put that\ndown here. So that's 4. Mile is the unit of measure I have left. And that's going to be divided by one\ntimes one times 5,280. So I've got 4 over 5,280 with miles as the unit of measure. \nSo let's see if we can simplify this. I can divide 4 by 4, and I know I can\ndivide 5,280 by 4. Let's see what I get. 4 divided by 4 is 1. Dividing 4 into 5280... 4 goes into 5 one time with a one remainder. \n4 goes into 12 3 times with no remainder, it goes into 8\n2 times, and it goes into zero zero times. So I'm going to have one over 1320. I'll have that faction of a mile. Okay, so that's basically how this works. As I said, you have to know\nthe conversion facts before you can do this. Once you know those facts, it's a fairly simple and straightforward process. Okay, take care.

My name is John with pewpewtactical.com, your definitive source for gun reviews, gear guides and all things that go bang. Low-power variable optics\nare a great middle ground between the close-up functionality and quick target\nacquisition that you'd find in red dots and holographic sites while also affording you the ability to get eyes on distant targets and get a 6X zoom, if needs\nbe, via a rotating turret.

And, both are generally within 10 or $15 of one another at any\ngiven time on Amazon. So how does the Primary Arms stack up? For starters, one of\nthe biggest differences between the two optics is\ngoing to be the reticle style. While the Strike Eagle's\nreticle is totally serviceable, one of our primary gripes was the lack of any central reference point\ninside of the circular halo. Primary Arms' advanced\ncombat siting system is admittedly an incredibly\ngeneric string of words but the reticle itself is\na pretty big improvement. The ACSS includes a central chevron that makes accurate shots\nat distance fairly easy. Especially when your\ntarget is relatively small. You've also got numbered bullet drop, wind hold and moving target\nlead indicators to boot. I'm a pretty visually-oriented person. So having the numbered\nrange reference points inside of the ACSS makes getting on target that much quicker. Especially as compared to the relatively blank reticle found\ninside the Strike Eagle. Although we only tested the optic at 556 Primary Arms advertises that\nthe ACSS should be accurate with the AK74's 545 by 39,\nas well as standard 308. Which is interesting, given the different ballistic characteristics\nof each of those rounds. The Primary Arms optic\nalso slightly edges out the Strike Eagle in terms\nof reticle illumination. Although the Strike Eagle's\nillumination was decent, it wasn't much use during the day. Whereas, the highest setting on the ACSS was reasonably visible during\nthe very bright conditions we experienced in the\ndesert while filming. For size comparison, the\nPrimary Arms 1-6 ACSS is approximately the same\nsize as this kielbasa that's been imprisoned\nwithin a scope mount. As mentioned, this is a 1-6X optic, and it really shines during situations in which you might need\nto engage multiple targets at several different ranges. We quite like that the zoom dial feels a little bit more fluid\nand takes less force to operate than the Strike Eagle's. Though it definitely doesn't feel loose. You can also upgrade the zoomy wheel with the addition of a throw lever that'll give you a little bit\nmore of a mechanical advantage when you're adjusting the zoom on the fly. One of our bigger complaints\nwith the Strike Eagle was the fact that the\nouter edge of the glass starts to distort a bit past 4X or so. But we're happy to report\nthat the Primary Arms ACSS is crystal clear all the way up to 6X. Weight between the two models isn't really a consideration as they're within half\nan ounce of one another. Although if weight is a concern we definitely recommend snagging an Aero Precision Ultralight mount as 30 millimeter scope mounts can add quite a bit of noticeable heft. So, does the Primary Arms 1-6 ACSS beat the Strike Eagle in terms of the best bang for your buck with the low-power variable optic? In our opinion, definitely. The Strike Eagle, again,\nis not a bad optic by any means but with the Primary Arms you're getting a better reticle, slightly better illumination and crystal clear magnification\nall the way out to 6X. Especially considering the fact that there is a negligible\nprice difference between the two our vote\ngoes to Primary Arms. The ACSS is a great foot in\nthe door of the LPVO world. And at $300 at the time of this filming it offers a damn good value for those who are not looking to run a red dot in a magnifier set up or who aren't ready to\nshell out the six to $800 that the next step up\nin LPVOs generally cost.

over and we decided we would try one ounce federal maximum high shot slug it's a two and three-quarter inch one-out slug smoothbore slug so we're going to try it in this ballistics gel out of chad's browning bps Wow holy smokes all right go ahead Chad okay I know this block is small but is what we have we just figured we try it out we'll do this again problem with a bigger block but anyone trying to cut into it and see what happened think put the wall up on it edit turn the block upside down flipped it over good dude now this is just mainly for comparative purposes to the waxwings Michelle to it the other day oh man then look at that cavity man slug in turd right here and it looks like it you know it expand a little bit and then it took a downward path and it actually got stuck in between the block and the wood it's probably flipped it over there's one little piece we can't seem to find the rest of it but I mean just that little bit right there I may penetrate the hole depth of the block you know 13 1/4 inch but that's a pretty massive cavity right there if we would had a bit of block a bigger block it probably would have expanded a little bit more couple more enough to try this again with the larger block and a little bit deeper yeah I mean that's saying a lot that's insane and that's a section of the slug that we could actually find right there yeah and they extended all the way dude impressive", "NBzqxRIa9BY": "hey this is Julie with Mahalo comm and today we're going to learn how to convert a fraction into a decimal one of the first things to note is that it's easier if you no longer see three-eighths as a fraction but instead look at it as a division problem so instead of seeing three-eighths we're going to look at 3/8 so let's turn this into a long division problem so I have 3/8 now it can't go into 3 so we're going to need to add some substance to our number we want to add some zeros but you can't just add a zero without you know turning it into a decimal because that 3 would become a 30 so you need to make sure you put a decimal and now you can add as many zeros as necessary before you start the long division problem I recommend that you move the decimal up to your answer so that you don't forget it later 8 goes into 30 3 times 8 times 3 is 24 30 minus 24 is 6 you can add another 0 so become 68 goes into 67 times and 7 times 8 is 56 subtract that and we have 4 add yet another 0 8 goes into 40 5 times 5 times 8 is 40 and this time when we subtract we have nothing left over so converting 3/8 to a decimal is 0.375 and that's how you convert a fraction to a decimal thanks for learning with me today if you'd like to learn more about this topic or anything else having to do with math please feel free to click the links on the screen

s packs and that will make a 6 s pack if you run him in series so how do you do it when you've only got one connector coming out use ESC well you can only get a while aid but I don't like them because it's more connectors and it's more stuff to go wrong and the other way is is to put two connectors on here so you would cut one lead off put another connector in series so you go from for example negative there to positive there join that to that and then that one back into this so basically you just cut one off put that onto the negative of the other one and then just link the other two together [Music] [Music] [Music] hi guys it's all done so basically this is what it looks like and to keep things simple basically if you're positive red wire coming out you're a SC go into the positive terminal of one connector then on your other connector black wire negative into the negative and then you destroyed the last two together we just positive to negative [Music] there you go success baby and he's still running on a single battery like a free cell you just got to make yourself up one of these little jumper leads and all you got to do is just hold it a positive to the negative plug there onto one of the ESC wires and then you other lead on to a normal battery because basically what that's doing look a lot of guys think it's gonna short things out but it is exactly the same as it was before having these two wires join two onto there so now turn it on or one is a free s alright guys if you need some soul drink tips I've got a video I made all about that a little

been shared with the claim that only a genius could solve it it has gone viral on Facebook and the internet generating millions of views as people have debated what the correct answer should be in this video I'm going to present what many people believe to be the correct answer can you figure it out give it a try before watching the rest of the video so most people believe the correct answer is 36 this is found by taking the product of the sum of the digits in each multiplication when multiplying two numbers a a and a a you obtain the answer by taking the sum of the digits in each multiplication and then multiplying that together for example to do 11 times 11 we would take the quantity 1 plus 1 and multiply it by the quantity 1 plus 1 this equals 2 times 2 which gets to 4 as given in the puzzle similarly 22 times 22 the answer can be found by taking 2 plus 2 times the quantity 2 plus 2 this equals 4 times 4 which equals 16 as given in the puzzle this would mean 33 times 33 would equal 3 plus 3 times the quantity 3 plus 3 this equals 6 times 6 which is 36 so most people believe this is the correct answer however there are people who think the answer should be 18 they believe the procedure to get the answer is to take the sum of the digits in the product of the regular multiplication for example 11 times 11 is equal to 121 the answer can be obtained by taking one plus two plus one which is four similarly twenty-two times 22 is equal to 484 the answer can be found by taking the sum of the digits in the product which is 4 plus 8 plus 4 which is 16 this would mean 33 times 33 is equal to 1089 the answer can be found by taking the sum of the digits 1 0 8 and 9 which gets to the answer of 18 so we have two different answers we have 36 and 18 and both methods seem valid so is there any way to reconcile these two different approaches to the problem in fact there is a way to justify the answer of 36 under the sum of the digits in the product let's see how that works so we start out with 11 times 11 we can expand each term in the multiplication to write this as 10 plus 1 times 10 plus 1 if we expand out this product we get 1 times 100 plus 2 times 10 plus 1 times 1 this gets us to the familiar answer of 121 and if we take the sum of the digits we get 1 plus 2 plus 1 which is 4 there's an alternate way that we could visualize what's going on here we could do this by multiplying by lines let's do 11 times 11 for the first number 11 will draw one line and then we'll leave some space and we'll draw another line for the other 11 we'll draw lines in the other direction leaving spaces between the two ones we can now get to the answer by counting the number of vertically aligned intersections on the far right we have one intersection this will be one in the center we have two intersections this will be to finally on far left we have one intersection which makes for one so we can copy these numbers and we get to our familiar answer of 121 now we can add up the digits any answer to get 1 plus 2 plus 1 which equals 4 so there's another interpretation that we've just shown is valid when we're summing up the digits of the product what we're really doing is we're counting the number of dots in this diagram so here we have exactly 4 dots in our diagram and that corresponds to adding up 1 plus 2 plus 1 so let's continue this pattern so we'll start out algebraically with 22 times 22 we can rewrite this as 20 plus 2 times 20 plus 2 we can expand this out to get 4 times 100 plus 8 times 10 plus 4 times 1 this is equal to our answer of 484 and the sum of the digits is equal to 16 so now let's look at the same problem visually we'll do 22 times 22 by multiplying by lines so for the first 22 we draw two lines for the 20 we'll leave some space and draw two lines for the two for the other number we do the same thing but draw lines in the other direction well now get to the answer by Counting the number of intersections that are vertically aligned so we'll start with the group of intersections on the far right there are four intersections here in the center we have one group of four and another group of four this makes for a total of eight intersections on the far left we have four intersections so copying these numbers we get to our familiar answer of 484 and if we add up the digits in our answer 4 plus 8 plus 4 we get 16 which once again is the number of dots in our diagram so now let's apply the procedure to 33 times 33 well first consider an algebraic procedure we have 30 plus 3 times 30 plus 3 will expand this out we get 9 times 100 plus 18 times 10 plus 9 times 1 so we could write our answer as 918 tens and nine ones and if we were to add up the digits in this product we would get 9 plus 18 plus 9 which is 36 so this is not how we would typically write this answer if you put 33 times 33 in the calculator you would not get 9 18 and 9 although this is a valid representation of 33 times 33 what we do is in the decimal system we never have any value be more than 9 in our placeholders so the problem is this 18 times 10 we need to split that up into 10 times 10 plus 8 times 10 now 10 times 10 is equal to 100 so that adds one more into our hundreds place so we have 10 hundreds plus 8 tens and then nine ones now 10 hundreds is also equal to one thousand so our final answer is 1 times 1000 plus 0 hundreds plus 8 tens plus 9 ones so this is the more familiar way that we would write out 33 times 33 which is 1089 but if we were to ignore this carryover rule you could see this representation is a valid way to represent 33 times 33 and if we did add up to some of the digits in this product we would get to the answer of 36 one more way to illustrate this is by doing the visual multiplication so we'll draw three lines for the 30 we'll leave some space and draw three more lines for the units 3 for the other number we draw the lines in the other direction again leaving some space between the tens and the ones values so on the far right we count the number of intersections we have nine intersections here in the center we have two groups of nine this makes four total of 18 intersections and on the far left we have nine intersections so we have our answer of 9 18 9 and we know this represents 9 times 100 plus 18 times 10 plus 9 times 1 we could go ahead and do the carry over process and we would get to the answer of 1089 however if we just want to count the number of dots in this diagram we would get to the answer that there are 9 plus 18 plus 9 which is 36 dots in this diagram so that could be a valid way of counting the sum of the digits in the product if we don't take carryover and we just count the number of dots in each column so what this means is we'll go over our procedure so if we count the sum of the digits in the product for 11 times 11 and 22 times 22 we do get 4 and 16 as in the puzzle and finally we then need to figure out what 33 times 33 is we could validly write this as 9 18 + 9 as long as we don't have any carryover and we understand where the placeholders represent so this would get us to an answer of 36 and this would exactly match the procedure that we use to get the product of the sum of the digits if you go through a time a plus a times a plus a that's exactly what we're doing when we're doing the sum of the digits in the product with no carryover and it's the same procedure that we're using to count the number of the dots in our diagram for visual multiplication so it would seem that 36 is the answer to this puzzle did you

[Music]", "O6uCke0Cl_w": "all right so this video we're going to show you all of the ins and outs for installing a subfloor on wood substrate so here we go first step screw down your original substrate now in this particular case I am dealing with one hundred and forty year old inch and a quarter tongue and groove which is unique in the fact that it's already strong enough all by itself to meet the standard for installing tile on top of it however you can tell by the movement that is really not that well put together so what I've done is I actually open up the floor here so I get access to my crawlspace because we wanted to be able to insulate this bad boy and now that that's all done I've got to screw it down so that I can finish now the age of this home left me with a situation here where there's lots of gaps so I don't really want to be I don't really want to be trusting this alone to put my flooring on a its oldest ugly there's gaps there's cracks there's gonna be dust blowing continually every step susceptible to curling and heaving so we're just gonna screw it down all over again and you could use what I was just using that was a two and a half inch flooring screw or you can use a construction screw it doesn't really matter the point when you're done they're gonna install a finished piece of plywood no if you are in a regular house you're gonna have oh s B as a subfloor usually it's five eight sometimes three-quarter you're gonna have to measure the best thing to do is just take out your heat register and put a measuring tape there and double-check but you want to get to inch and a quarter inch and a quarter is really the standard for any tile if you're putting in any other kind of flooring the subfloor that comes with the house is fine but if you want to live in eight squeaks in your subfloor you can go and screw it down most Building Code construction does not require the use of screws to install subflooring doesn't even require adhesive now some best building practices out there they're gluing down their subfloor but in most cases that's not gonna be this way it is so if you want to get rid of squeaks in your floor just identify your nail lines the existing nails that are in the floor that's where your floor joists will be and you just come along with your screws and you screw right next to the nails and then you'll have a board that when you step on it isn't pushed down under weight and then lifting where the nail is because that's what happens it's called the flesh when you push down one side of the board it lifts at the joint so most squeaks happen where two pieces of plywood meet together on a joist they're nailed down someone will step beside it and it lifts the plywood and the squeak is actually the sound of the wood rubbing up and down on the nail as it slowly pulling it out of the floor it's dramatic the way to solve that problem grab a box of flooring screws screw down all your joists before you install your flooring and then you will avoid squeaks forever okay and I think a couple more here ought to be enough now in my situation I have extremely old floors and I'm not even gonna go in with ceramic but because I got a bit of an OCD and I like the clean workspace you're gonna go over there with 3/8 plywood just so I have a nice clean surface it just makes it easier for me to manage and to put down my flooring layers on top of that knowing I've got a nice level flat surface and to be honest with you this old floor here it's still got a little bit of a like an oil smell right I don't know what it was back in those days but they got tar and oil all over all of the flooring in this house probably from Cowboys and their boots I have no idea and and I know someone's gonna say well why don't you just restore the software like sand it down every finish the bottom line is is this is 140 year old softwood which makes it extremely soft all right it's not in the greatest condition it'll transfer load still but if I start sanding this down I'm gonna end up with they're just a big pile of dust and I'm gonna burn through most of this wood before I get a nice level surface the house itself even the foundation is a little bit all uneven so the more I try to repair what's existing the worse the situation's going to get so it's best for me to just try to put a new floor on overtop and move on with my life because in a lot of cases restoring the old product takes so much time and energy it's just not worth the investment all right we got any feet my first sheet of plywood right there so the room itself is just a little bit more than eight feet long of available floor space and it's about six-and-a-half feet wide so generally what I recommend is find out if you can put down a full sheet of plywood before you start in this case it comes in front of the toilet if it come off the wall so yes I can put down one sheet of plywood and that gives me two things it gives me a clean space to work from but it also gives me straight edges so all of my cuts I have a nice square reference point in order to measure from so that's the secret if you're doing subflooring and you have plumbing fixtures in their way try to get the one biggest piece that you can fit in that room to get started with that has factory edges and then it's really easy to measure and mark and go square off of that to fill in all the gaps so on this job I'm using a 3/8 plywood it's very important here to remember you're looking for inch and a quarter as a bare minimum ok so the way you can tell is regular plywood every one of these layers is 1/8 so you have three of them's 3/8 if you have five of them is 5/8 4 is a half it's simple math now the new metric plywood if you're in Canada be careful because they have a thin laminated layer on the top and bottom and then a sandwich thick layer in the middle and it comes in millimeters and it's not exact but if you're in the United States or you're buying you know standard dimensional lumber stain your plywood it'll all be 1/8 layers and that is the way we tell so if you lift off your heat vent and you look at your plywood you can count the layers that are there and that'll tell you how many eighths thick your plywood is and you'll know how many to add to get to one and a quarter which is ten eighths yes you need ten layers of this little plywood here before you were ready for tile like I said if you're not doing tile what you have now is probably fine one other thing you need to know here all these sheet goods are run off on a conveyor belt system and they're laminated together and they all have a bend they all have a curve you can see that when you're gonna go lay it down mark the top side okay which is you want to install it like a bowl so you want to have yeah you want to lay this down so that the curve goes up on the sides alright so when is laying there you have to step on the plywood to set it down so now I'm going to explain to you why you want to install it with the bowl like a happy face when you're screwing this down you want to create a plywood so that you're screwing down the edges if you lay it this way then you're compressing that wood when you screw it down because the the the actual measurement on the top side of the plywood is larger than the bottom side so if you're like this and you screw it down now you're putting your plywood under compression and if you get into a season of expansion you get moisture humidity or more temperature the wood will expand and now there's an upwards pressure on all of your screws and your what you're gonna cause there is you're gonna cause a failure on the screw because the softwood can actually pop off the screw or to lift the screw right out of the floor and that upward pressure can create cracks around all your joints so what you want to do when you're putting down your plywood is you start right in the middle okay and this is a lot like a lot like baking imagine you have a you're making bread and you've got your amount of dough and what you're doing is you're rolling it out okay it's the same thing with your plywood you want to start screws in the middle and roll it out so you screw towards the edge back and you work left to right middle to the outside and that's how you lay it all out if you start on do all your edges first and then you do the middle again you run the same risk of creating an impression in the middle so roll out all your plywood screw down the entire sheet before you go get another one because if you just throw a few screws in and grab the next sheet you haven't rolled it out properly and you're going to create compression I know it doesn't sound like a big deal but when we're putting their plywood down we want to have all the joints relatively tight we're not looking for big gaps for expansion and contraction so you really want to make sure that if you do this you do it the right way that way you aren't gonna get these crack lines in your grout in your tile just because the plywood went and grew on you so the proper way to install your screws first of all so this is a flooring screw and the thread is alternating tight and coarse thread okay it's an alternating fine and coarse thread all up and down that shaft and the idea is it's compressing each layer of that plywood on the screw to the piece of wood that's underneath it so you'd want to put these every eight inches on in the body of the plywood and I know this is gonna sound ridiculous every two to three inches along the perimeter and you want that head to just be underneath the surface you don't want to go too deep we're only compressing the two layers and the plywood not the three this is what I was talking about when you're rolling out the plywood okay you're starting in the middle and it doesn't take a lot of screws to hold this plywood in place when you get to the edges that's where the rolling it out really comes into effect and so we're actually stitching this down the next piece of ply was gonna have a screw every two inches as well right up against the edge and that's what's gonna guarantee that the edges aren't gonna pop up over time really it's all about a little bit of overkill here because most homes that have wooden sub floors have a central heating system which means you're in a three or four four season climate so you're gonna get hot and cold weather and naturally your house is gonna have expansion contraction most situations the transition from one season to the next there's some humidity issues some temperature issues your foot isn't gonna change that much but the reason we go through all this dramatic situation that's for those days where the heat fails and you go twenty-four hours because of a power failure and your house gets really really cold everything wants to shrink up on you this kind of scenario we're doing this for those events we're not doing it for everyday wear and tear we're installing this plywood to make sure that in the extreme situations which will happen over the lifespan of any floor that it's not going to fail on you so don't cut corners on this this is one of the most common things you'll see in the marketplace guys look cut corners installing their plywood because of course it's gonna work four to six months two years five years but it's not going to make it fifty nay don't care cuz they are long gone by then now if you're planning on doing a lot of this fluorine you can actually buy a stand up screw gun and the screws come on a strip and you can stand there and just pound them through the floor and you can do this a lot faster but what I found is on this channel if I show you the most basic approach then you're able to have confidence in doing it it's easy to take the next step and buy rent a tool that makes life easier but not everybody can afford to rent tools that make it easier so I'd rather show you a way that anybody can do there you go that's it so when in doubt six inches maybe hate this the width of your hand is usually around the right size okay every two inches on the edge install like a bowl roll it out start in the middle work towards your edge and you're gonna be just fine installing your plywood high remember always make sure everything's clean underneath before you start or you will get that nasty crunching sound when you're walking on your floor later [Music] so this is what it's supposed to look like if you're prepping retire right six to eight inches in the middle two inches all around the outside high however I'm not putting tile in here I'm just putting this down so that I can have a nice clean floor without all the gaps and cracks so I can control my dirt and just makes me feel better as a human being I think so I'm gonna be going over top of this with a floating floor we're going to put in a heated flooring system with a laminate vinyl plank right so make sure you check out the link for that video in the description below and if you're watching this when it's first released no the video comes out in a few days so yeah so what we're doing is we're just gonna go every eight inches okay we're not gonna do the stitching along the outside edge cuz I'm not worried about movements on a floating floor I'm not going to get gaps and cracks appearing on a floating floor overtop of plywood so I don't have expansion contraction worries I'm just trying to tighten this down so when I eliminate excessive movements when I'm more walking okay so we're gonna to go through the measuring and cutting techniques now for installing this on your floor and then after we're done this we're just gonna go through a real quick recap and a few other little notes that I've got for you for things that people do that they make mistakes and they cause problems just so that you're aware okay so stay with us here usually I just use a pencil but for the purpose of the camera I'm going to use my black marker so that you can see what's going on now the idea basic rule of law with any sheet good that's going anywhere in a house you want to stagger your joints right so it'd be really easy for me to measure from this corner going this way for the detail around the tub but I'm gonna go to the outside wall so what I need to do is I need to take this measurement okay I want to just make any no time at eleven and a quarter inches away from this corner what I'm gonna do is I'm going to subtract that quarter inch from my measurement because nothing in a room is ever square this will give me the freedom to cut and install and not worry about going right up to the drywall because we're still gonna be adding all of our skirt or baseball or door trim board what as you'd call it okay so I'm gonna take my Raptor Square and I'm going to just draw that line so I can extend the line of my plywood and now I'm going some measure to the wall and that again is nineteen and three-eighths I'm gonna just go with nineteen okay I always give yourself up to a half an inch of extra space when you're going near the edge of a floor no one's ever gonna put all of their weight on a sixteenth of an inch of flooring just before the baseboard it caused a problem okay so give yourself that mercy are you gonna find it very uncomfortable working the other end actually is 19 and a half so this piece is gonna go in relatively square yay 19 inches now because the plywood comes the outside corners are square we're gonna assume that this corner here is gonna be square that'll be a factory edge that because the factory edge that'll be the square so when we're going to be measuring we're gonna be cutting based on the square of the plywood okay so always measure from the square corner all of your numbers it's just like grade five math right now here's where we get our tricks and tips now what this does here is this gives me the ability to run up and down my edge all right and I have a straight edge now that I can follow oh here we go so I need to measure from the outside edge of the plywood to where the toilet flange comes alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to draw a map on the plywood here on my floor I'm gonna put my toilet flange here I'm gonna put the hole for the water supply on there and I'm gonna take all my dimensions draw it on this clean plywood take a picture and I'm gonna take that information over with me it's where the plywood is and then translate that information at the saw station so I'm going to take from here I'm gonna take 11 inches so I'm measuring from the plywood having 11 when I'm done I don't know if this makes sense this square runs against the plywood I run this one against the t-square I get up close to the toilet very important here let me just draw this out this is basically the average toilet base average toilet base will come around a toilet like that okay and if your plywood doesn't come inside that edge when you put the toilet on it if your plywood comes to here and you put the toilet on your Fleury is gonna buckle it's gonna be under compression you're not going to get a good seal and every time somebody uses the facility it's going to be wiggling and loosening and cracking and there's gonna end up having a problem with water getting out of the wax ring so make sure you get your plywood as tight to this ring as you can and this is how you do it right up there's my exact measurement so I'm gonna use this court point here to measure I'm coming out exactly 45 inches I'm adding the 11 because I'm going to start from that wall so 45 and 11 I'm going 55 inches for the toilet flange okay do the same thing on the other side we'll use the inside of the number this time 52 and a quarter plus 11 gonna draw this line here fifty to sixty three and a quarter okay I'm going exact and then I'm gonna do the same thing here for the water line that's fifty seven and a half and that here sixty eight and a half let's take your exact measurement adding this number here that way all this information will be translated onto our plywood and installed from this point here okay and I'll just drop in place now the only other numbers we need are the distance from the factory edge into these three locations and that is actually as simple here now because we have centerline on the on the flange we can actually measure this way so in the front that doesn't matter remember toilet is gonna have a base that goes up like this okay so it's not as crucial here or about this area but for OCD sake we're gonna go at two-and-a-half so I'm gonna cut my plywood around here on the other side I'm gonna go at ten and a quarter okay and that'll cut it just about here which is well inside the line of a toilets we're gonna have a compression so let me just check that again ten - quarter to ten so here we go let's get on the armor turning the corner and what I'm gonna do with this pipe here is I'm actually just gonna measure the center line area so it's about 12 and 3/4 of an inch and I know that this is the water supply 12 and 3/4 and so when I go to cut that I just take my saw and I make about a 1 by 1 inch square and that'll be fine there we go so then I got all my information okay and whoops missing one piece of information I didn't get the measurement to the hole I did but it didn't translate it 19 that's 19 this is 96 so here we go we've got the thickness to the wall so full sheet of plywood all my dimensions for my cuts I'm gonna take my picture now here we are and that's what I'm going to take to the saw station so I only have to get up once make all my cuts come back and install it perfect every time okay so here we go I'm just going to translate all this information so we're just transferring all the information and then we'll cut it out here's my toilet so that's my centerline I'm marking the center of the toilet I'm gonna put my pinky weren't there I'm a marker and I'm just gonna draw a circle now use your hand like a protractor doesn't have to be perfect but it'll get you close all right and then just like drywall you can use your marker there we go now we got our cutting edge so remember I was talking about the shape of a toilet how it sits over and around the flange generally speaking when you're installing subfloor you're looking for a simple process with one tool that's your circular saw the joke is a circular saw doesn't cut in a circular motion so what we have to do is cut it a little bit differently with the idea of not extending past where the toilet goes so I'm going to show you my system and it's just a plunge cut in multiple angles and you don't want to get too too picky here all right [Music] [Applause] now you'll see I'm well inside the shape of a toilet I'm outside the circle that I drew so I'm going to go over top of the flange and if I don't it's a real easy fix now I just got to cut the water line out this is very much the simpler the same thing there's nothing worse when you're doing something like subflooring than running back and forth and trying to be perfect this is not finished carpentry it's like I say when I'm putting up the walls just drywall get a cut get it in worry about the details later but it is important to understand the mistakes that you could make and how to avoid that there we go get over that water line in there beautiful and Pam no I am going to try to keep the sides as close as I can because that is the most crucial part of the toilet there we go that is gonna work awesome okay so here we go now remember what I said we're gonna go back to a joint to factory joint all right we're going every eight inches now because this is around the toilet I am gonna get this nice and tight I hate movement around the toilet because when we install the toilet we're using a wax ring and the wax ring should be installed and toilet should be tightened under compression and then it should never move again the biggest problem people have with toilets is they don't have everything around the toilet nice and tight so that when you sit on the toilet it moves so you're gonna have the best compression in the world but if you don't have everything in your substrate installed properly over time it's gonna move and then you're gonna break the seal of the wax water's gonna get through and then all your work is gonna get destroyed so take the extra minute right now I remember when I did all the plunge cuts have a bunch of pieces of plywood where the cut lines go past the wood so here's what I do I actually put a screw on each section of this cut plywood and I stitch the entire circle now I don't see everybody I might be a little bit crazy here all right but I'm gonna stitch and part of this plywood together with the floor underneath because I don't want anything moving around on it all right and this is one of the ways that I avoid having plumbing problems down the road now I know that whole area is about as tight as it's ever did I get after that it's really simple every inch is finished laminating this bad boys and then we'll just use the same technique what kind of little piece there a little piece of the other end voila we have a floor if I'm on tile then this is a problem so I do the same thing okay so I mentioned earlier in the video we are going to talk about the mistakes that people make number one they put a cut edge up against a factory edge as soon as you start doing that you've lost how tight your seam is and you're gonna mess up your contraction and your expansion and a lot of the materials are going to put on here yeah trust me you can't measure it install plywood unless you're going factory edge to factory edge try to keep that factory edge of mine when you're cutting a round fixtures give yourself a little bit of room okay it's okay to over cut so that you have flexibility but tighten everything up when you're going up against tubs and showers leave 3/8 of an inch from the plywood to the acrylic base you do not want them coming in contact together that is one of the largest reasons for call backs on tile jobs is because people put the plywood up against the acrylic and then when you're good in your tub or you fill it with water or you walk in your shower the pan moves and it rubs against the plywood makes that squeaking sound and everybody starts going crazy why is there a squeak why it's just because of that it's cosmetic so leave the gap and fill up that area not with grout at the end use the nice bit of silicone to finish that edge later one of the other mistakes people make is they don't use enough all right let's be honest the biggest problem with tile failure and sub installing subfloor is people put on one inch or one an 1/8 inch of subfloor and they don't go all in if you have 5/8 sub floor which is really standard a new home construction you need to add another 5/8 don't go cheap and add 3/8 don't try to save money and go with 1/2 inch you've got to get the right amount of substrate or there's gonna be too much deflection in your floor and your whole job will fail I'll guarantee it I don't care what anybody says don't let anybody do that to your home ok there's a minimum standard for a reason stick to it other than that the only other thing people do wrong with their subfloor is they don't keep it clean big mistake all right nice to put this in near the end of a job if you're like me and you're right in the middle of a project and you're getting it done because you're waiting for things to dry make sure that you keep it covered a tarp or when you're all done and you're ready to tile or put on your finish flooring wash it all down get rid of all of that organics and muds and stuff like that so that everything will bond well if you want to see how this project turns them and you're interested about that heated flooring with the vinyl then

1/8 plus 1/8 equals 3/8 your child will write this as an equation these are called unit fractions he will also decompose 3/8 as two eighths plus 1 eighths decomposing fractions into different parts helps your child to understand that one whole can be expressed in more than one way sometimes your child will work with improper fractions ten fourths is an improper fraction because the numerator is greater than the denominator your child will decompose an improper fraction by considering the denominator and pulling out one whole four fourths equals one whole after pulling out four fourths 6/4 remain but wait he can pull out another whole your child knows one whole equals one so he can now see ten fourths equals one plus one plus two fourths practice decomposing fractions with your child so he will be ready for mixed numbers and performing operations with fractions and that's good to know [Music]", "VgYsgiJHfUg": "the question is should I use should I buy an 8 gallon or 5 gallon and what is will I use more soap with an 8 gallon a minute versus a 5 gallon man so we're going to go down the road of should I use a 5 gallon of pump or an 8 gallon minute pump do I need this big 8 gallon pump so my first question is is 8 gallon will make a house wash and concrete go faster it'll make your house wash it'll probably cut off anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes of them cutting off time versus a 5 and a half gallon minute pump so it will make your time a little bit quicker so my first question is how many house washes are you doing today all right if you're doing three house washes a day for house washing of the day and you're booked out all week then I would probably go with an 8 gallon a minute if you're just starting out and you're not getting much yet you know you can start out with a five and a half gallon and a pump and start from there my suggestion is what if you have the budget what are you spending in marketing are you not spending anything in marketing it are you spending a lot of marketing are you are you how much do you have is the thing I would rather you spend $5,000 on a unit and 5,000 if you had $10,000 just start a pressure washing business I'd rather you start with a five and a half gallon and spend $5,000 on a nice nice you know like a small trailer like this nothing I can't think nothing crazy and I then I would rather you spend $5,000 in marketing because here's the reason why you $10,000 machine does not sell any work at all and I know I'll get some flack about this but I I just know too many people that have went out of business because they could not market and if you can't market that does you no good to have this gigantic so a five gallon vs. 8 gallon is really you know you can buy the 5 gallon that I got for 1500 to 2000 dollars an 8 gallon a minute you're looking at almost four thousand dollars so you're looking at a lot of costs for an 8 gallon a minute so you're looking at two thousand dollars worth of marketing stuff that I can be putting in for an 8 gallon a minute versus the 5 gallon a minute so my thing is is make sure I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to grow a business you know later on we can always go with a bigger unit you know two three years down the road we can go with a bigger unit you know with concrete cleaning and a five with the gallon versus a gown yeah there's a little bit of there's quite a bit of a good difference right there so you know if you're planning on doing a lot of concrete cleaning then maybe if you have the funds go with 8 with the with the thing about do you use more SH if you with the 5 vs. 8 not really because you're able to soap a little bit faster you're able to move a little bit faster and so you're just you're not gonna put much more soap up versus an 8 vs 5 so if you'd like to learn more about downstream injectors go check out this video playlists up here I go over all my downstream injectors and how to keep them lasting longer and everything

I'm going to get a pie same size pie and I'm gonna cut it into 3/3 they're supposed to be equal but I guess certainly if it's my kids they'd be fighting about one or other piece there's a third I'm gonna do another one which is cut into 4 bits 1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4 and this is where my artistic ability gets stretched to the limit I'm going to cut it into 5 2 3 4 5 mmm not particularly equal but I'm gonna write it on anyway 1/5 1/5 1/5 1/5 1/5 okay so I'm sure you've all seen that but doesn't know it start basic we'll do some more complicated stuff in a bit let's just say that I come along and grab and grab this section of pie here here we go well I've got a fifth which is this piece here plus another fifth which is that piece there and it equals 2/5 so here you've got 2 over 5 and you called this one the numerator numerator and this one the din nom in a tall long complicated words for the top and the bottom of the equation of the fraction okay so this bit is how many pieces how many pieces you cut the pie in to cut the pie in two and this one is how many pieces you get you get so you've got these two numbers 2/5 meaning you get two pieces of pie when you cut the pie into five pretty pretty straightforward stuff okay and if I come along and grab this bit here then we've cut the pie into two bits and I get one of them okay that's quite nice into it just do one more example I'm gonna get oh I'm gonna get my pie and I'm gonna cut it again into five 150 may as well write it out I want to tell you I've been a professional mathematician for a long time now 20 years maybe nearly 20 years now even now when I see fractions and I fool around with fractions this picture here is what I think of this picture here and I'm just going to eat the lot I'm just going to scoff the lot of pie I'm just gonna grab it I'm gonna cross it all out because I've eaten it and so I've cut the pie into five bits and I've got five at the top so I've got 5 5 s equals five fifths equals one whole okay and in general if you get any number a divided by a over a equals one so 3/3 let's have a look at three thirds of a pie there you go there's pie I'm gonna scoffed a lot there you

done boom oh look merch", "KSYAqQ4xyJI": "in this video we're gonna talk about why your size wire gauge amperage diameter and other things related to this topic perhaps you've seen this abbreviation AWG this stands for American wire gauge and it tells us the size of the wire and how much current it can safely handle so the picture on the left represents a wire gauge of 10 the one on the right represents a wide age of 20 now we need to understand is that the higher number corresponds to a smaller wire a wire gauge of 10 has a diameter size of about 2.5 8 8 millimeters whereas a wire with a gauge of 20 has a diameter of 0.8 1/2 millimeters so as you can see as the wire gauge increases in number the diameter or the size of the wire decreases so these two are inversely related a wire gauge of 10 can handle a current of 30 amps whereas a wire with a gauge of 20 can handle a current of 5 amps so as the gauge number increases the amount of current that it can handle decreases now the other thing we need to talk about is the resistance per unit length the resistance per unit length of a wire with the size of 10 is 1 milli ohm per foot whereas the resistance per unit length for a wire with a size of 20 is 10 milli ohms per foot so as the wire gauge increases in value the resistance per unit of life increases as well so these are some things you want to keep in mind so as the gauge number increases the diameter size decreases the amount of current that it can handle decreases but the resistance increases so here we have a table that lists the wire gauge the resistance per unit length the diameter size nem hasit e or the maximum current that the wire can handle at 60 degrees Celsius now the first thing that we can focus on is the relationship between the wire gauge and the resistance as was mentioned before as the wire gauge as the number increases the resistance per unit length increases but notice that when it increases by 3 the resistance doubles in this case as it goes from 4 to 7 the resistance per unit length goes from point 25 2.50 and as it goes from 17 to 20 we can see that the resistance doubles from 5 to 10 so every time the wire gauge increases by 3 the resistance per unit length increases by a factor of 2 now the second thing to notice is as the wire gauge increases by 10 the resistance increases by a factor of 10 so as we go from 20 to 30 the resistance increases from 10 to 100 so an increase of 10 in a wire gauge leads to an increase of a factor of 10 by the resistance so those are some things that I caught looking at this table now the next thing that we can see in a table is that as the wire gauge increases from zero to 40 we can see the diameter size decrease in progressively and finally as the gauge number increases you can see that the amp acity the amount of current that the wire can handle decreases so this just confirms what we talked about earlier in this video it turns out that there's a formula that you could use to calculate the diameter size if you know the wire gauge number and here it is d sub n is equal to 0.12 seven millimeters time is 92 raised to the 36 minus n over 39 so let's plug in 20 so and it's going to be 20 so this is gonna be point 1 to 7 times 92 raised to the 36 minus 20 over 39 36 minus 20 is 16 and 16 divided by 39 that is along decimal numbers I'm gonna leave it like this go ahead and type that in into your calculator so 0.127 times 92 raised to the 16 over 39 you should get this point 8 1 1 8 millimeters so that is the diameter size given a wire gauge of 20 which corresponds to the data that we see here in the table so that's the formula that you could use if you want to calculate the diameter size in millimeters if you know the gauge number now let me erase a few things let's work on a problem that we have on the top of the screen a variable power source is connected to a 14 gauge wire that has a length of 9000 feet what is the maximum voltage that can be safely handled by this wire at 60 degrees Celsius let's begin with a picture let's say this is the wire let's call this points a and B what is the maximum voltage that can be applied across this wire now this wire has a length of 9,000 feet it's a very long wire how can we determine the maximum voltage that can be applied well we could use Ohm's law V is equal to IR the wire has a certain amount of resistance and there's a maximum current that it can handle so this is a 14 gauge wire using the table we can see that the maximum current that it can handle at 60 degrees Celsius is 15 amps so we have the maximum current so we're going to replace I with 15 amps now the only thing that we're missing in order to calculate the voltage is the resistance of the wire how can we determine that well for a 14 gauge wire we can determine the resistance per unit length which is in milli ohms per foot and that's going to be 2.5 but let's convert that to ohms so we have 2.5 millions per foot and there's a thousand milliohms per 1 ohm so this is going to be point zero to five ohms per foot the resistance is going to be the resistance per unit length times the length of the wire because those are going to cancel out the resistance per unit left is point zero zero two five ohms per foot and so we're going to multiply that by nine thousand feet so we can see the unit feet will cancel and so it's point zero zero two five times nine thousand and the resistance of this wire is going to be twenty two point five ohms so we can plug that in into this formula and that's going to give us the maximum voltage so let's multiply 15 by twenty two point five and that's going to give us a maximum voltage of three hundred thirty seven point five volts anything higher will exceed the maximum current rating of fifteen amps for the 14 gauge wire and so that's it for this video so now you know the relationship between wire size resistance per unit length diameter size and the maximum current that it can handle so thanks again for watching and don't forget to subscribe to this channel", "uW8VpRGQj6s": "In this video we will do a side by side diamond\nsize comparison on the finger and hand as well as give you different price comparisons\nat each size. All along giving you different tips and tricks\nto help you save on diamond shopping. We will compare all the diamond sizes in this\nvideo to this 1 Carat Diamond on a hand with a size 6 finger. This 1 carat diamond at Kay Jewelers like\nmost Brick and Mortar jewelry stores is about $19,600 and that is because it is very high\nquality. In fact all the diamonds on the hands in this\nvideo are all an ideal cut and very high quality. Now we also take those diamonds and compare\nthem to the exact same quality diamond from a link I will put in the description below\nthis video. This 1 carat is $9,150 so you'd save over\n$10,000 from my link below this video. First lets start with a .25 or 1/4 carat diamond\non the hand. Compared to a 1 carat diamond it is very unimpressive\nand normally people don't go this low for a center stone diamond. Its main appeal only $580 from the link I\nhave below. Next we look at a .33 or 1/3 carat diamond. Usually this is the lowest people go for a\ncenter stone diamond. Carat is actually just the weight of the diamond\nso remember just because it is a higher Carat doesn't necessarily mean it is visually bigger. A .4 carat diamond is starting to look a little\nmore substantial than the others. Something to look out for: You can actually\nincrease the carat size of the stone without it looking bigger. However since these diamonds are ideally cut\nyou can be sure this is not the case. A .5 carat or 1/2 carat diamond is a more\ncommon size of a diamonds. If you would've bought this diamond at Jared\nyou would have paid 1000 more than from my recommended online store. The first 4 diamonds we looked at compared\nto each other you can see a gradual increase in size. To make sure you get a good diamond that looks\nits carat size check the GIA diamond certificate for an excellent or ideal cut before buying\na diamond in a store otherwise the diamond store will have the diamond cut so that it\ndoesn't look as big as the carat. Watch my other diamond videos if you want\nmore information on that. This is a .66 or 2/3 carat diamond. While it is getting closer to 1 carat it still\nlooks a bit smaller. Online you'd save over 4 thousand on a ideal\ndiamond this size. A .7 or 3/4 carat diamond is starting to get\nclose to a 1 carat diamond. Kay Jewelers has this diamond at 10,400 but\nonly 3,900 from the link you can find below this video. This is a .85 carat diamond. Another way diamond stores trick you is by\nadvertising the total carat diamond weight of a ring as opposed to just the center stones\ncarat weight. If this had little diamonds all around it\nthey could say it's 1.5 Carat TW or Total Weight and hope you didn't know. .95 Carat Diamonds and above are Interesting\ndiamonds. Most people like buying slightly below 1 carat\nbecause the difference in size is so minute. But the cost jumps a lot as soon as you hit\nthe one carat. Plus most people still just call it a 1 carat\ndiamond because it is so close. So you are getting the best of both worlds. I really recommend sticking slightly below\n1 carat unless you are looking to go way above 1 carat. And once again all these diamonds have an\nideal cut if they didn't the jewelers could play with the angles of the diamonds to make\nthe carat weight go up without the appearance of it going up. Here is a 1.25 or a 1 1/4 carat diamond on\nthe finger. On this you'd save $17000 buying it from the\nlink below this video. A 1 1/3 carat diamond for some reason to me\nis where diamonds start really looking big. Maybe it's just me but when I see this diamond\nI think \"Wow\" Rarely people buy diamonds this big. But now you know where to get a deal so that\nmaybe you can get one this big. This is a 1 1/2 or 1.5 carat diamond comparison. And in my opinion this size on the hand is\nwhen you start looking like a high roller. This diamond is close to a $20,000 dollar\nsavings. This is a 2 carat diamond on the finger. I decided to show you the price for this diamond\nat Helzberg Diamond Store which is over $84,000. I just want to show you it doesn't matter\nwhich Brick and Mortar jewelry store you go to, They are all over priced. My number tip to buying a diamond is to have\nyou significant other go diamond shopping at the mall with you or her best friend. Making note of the diamond specs that she\nchose and come buy the same quality diamond from the link in this video and you'll save\nmoney or you can spend the same amount you would have spent and get an even bigger diamond. Then just take it to the diamond store and\nset it in their favorite band. This is a 2 1/2 carat diamond. Its price is less expensive than the 2 carat\ndiamond we just looked at. The savings come from lower clarity which\nisn't even that bad of a clarity but you need to know what to look out for. Here is a 2 3/4 near a 3 carat diamond on\nthe hand. It is huge!

That\u2019s a liner. Birthday carp, bosh! Got him! Yes! Heads I\u2019m in the best swim,\ntails you\u2019re in the worst swim, yeah? It\u2019s got to be a better one,\npulling like that. These German carp are just so cool. And the biggest one so far,\nreally accurate, minimal disturbance. Ooh, just seen one out there,\nlong and... Yes, get in! I love it when a plan comes together. The heavier baiting\nis definitely working. Absolutely nailed\non that size 4 Long Shank X. Get in there! I\u2019m absolutely blown away. We\u2019ve been very fortunate to be invited\nto Bj\u00f6rn Brockmann\u2019s syndicate up in the north of Germany,\nabout an hour north of Hamburg. And we picked this place\nbecause it\u2019s very representative of what you would fish in England, what you would fish in France\nif you were going on holiday and loads of other club and syndicate\nlakes right the way through Europe. It\u2019s about 20-25 acres in size. Average sort of depth,\nsort of 3-10 foot and a stock of about 160 fish. The biggest of those,\nthere\u2019s definitely one 25-kilo fish which is a 55-pounder. And probably 8-10 fish over 20 kilos\nat the right time of year, which in English money\nare 44-pounders. And loads of other 30s. I\u2019ve seen from filming that\u2019s been done\nhere before, they\u2019re stunning fish. Everyone loves the German carp,\nmyself and Darrell included in that. Whether they\u2019re 22lbs or 44lbs, I\u2019m sure\nwe\u2019re going to love catching them. Right, heads I\u2019m in the best swim,\ntails you\u2019re in the worst swim, yeah? - Go on, you call it, bruv.\n- Heads. Tails. I\u2019m going to be good to you\nand I\u2019m going to go in here because I know you really want\nto go down there, don\u2019t you? Honestly, I was like, I thought\u2026 - You really\u2026\n- No, no\u2026 Come on, you really want to go\ndown there, I know you do. Be honest. I\u2019ve got a bait boat, I could probably do better in there than\nyou could without a bait boat. - Only because of the pylons.\n- Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean. There\u2019s pylons going over the lake.\nI fished here before. I think this swim is a very good option\nfor the long\u2026 Obviously, there\u2019s fish here now\nbut you\u2019re always in the middle. And I think that\u2019s a great option\nfor the week. - Whereas I think that\u2019s a great option\n- Now. five minutes after I drop my bait, and the wind is going to blow there\nfor a day or so so it should be\u2026\nYeah, I think I\u2019ll catch there and then we will see what happens. Go on then,\ngo and get your little black swan. Got my puppy feet. Swim choice wise\u2026 Oh, just seen one out there\nlong in front of where I\u2019ve chosen. That\u2019s nice. Swim choice wise, I knew Darrell\nwanted to fish down the other end. There are so many fish down there,\na big pack of them. You can tell because he gets all jittery\nand starts looking and he gets the fire in his eyes. So I knew he wanted down there and I get first choice a lot of the time\non these things. So it\u2019s obvious\nthat a big pack of fish are there, but there\u2019s a big pack of fish in front\nof where I\u2019ve chosen as well. And they say all your battle plans all\nchange on first contact with the enemy and I was planning to fish longer and fish lead clips if I could,\nfish wafters. The fish are here\nand they\u2019re really close in. So I\u2019ve got rods that I had tackled up\nfrom Embryo Norton Disney on a shoot last week. They\u2019ve got helicopter rigs on,\nlittle pop-ups. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to flick out\nto start off with and see how it goes. That\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve got three rods out. The left-hand one has gone out\nto my left-hand margin. There\u2019s bush there,\nsaw a couple of fish top and on the echo sound on the bait boat\nit looked really clear. I\u2019d also plumbed it with a marker rod. It\u2019s a difficult cast,\nthat\u2019s why I\u2019ve used the bait boat because the wires over the top\nwere a little bit much, but I\u2019m on it. It\u2019s gone down with a solid bag and it\u2019s absolutely bomped down\non the bottom really well. I\u2019ve got quite a bit of bait around it. The middle rod is really long\nwhere this morning\u2019s activity was. There was loads of fizzing,\nloads of topping going on out there and it just looked like the place to be and the right-hand rod\nis down my right-hand margin. Again, there\u2019s a little bit of bubbling\nthere this morning. One fish topped and I\u2019ve just cast out\nwith a light lead and Spinner Rig, kept casting till I got a good drop and then just sprayed\na few boilies over the top. They\u2019re in the water, I\u2019ve done the best\nthat I can and there were fish about. It's just a case of whether\nthey\u2019re still there or not. Well, the first day\u2019s\ndrawing to a close. I\u2019ve been racing against the light as is always the case\non the first day on a new lake. It doesn\u2019t help\nthat it\u2019s weedy out there. The left-hand area where the fish were\nshowing this morning is really weedy and I tried to get rods out\nwith minimum disturbance. To be honest, the chance for a bite\nwas gone at that point. It was ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nthe sun was higher in the sky, they\u2019ve stopped showing. But I put three rods out close in\njust to see if I could nick a bite, which I did a few hours later,\nbut the fish charged off sort of to the right\nand the line went through the weed and as I was trying to steer the fish\nback around the weed bed towards me, the hook popped out. That was a size 2 Kurv,\nfished as a pop-up, Spinner style. So I moved over\nto a size 4 Wide Gape X, which is a much stronger hook. So hopefully when that rod goes again,\nthat will be a fish in the net. So, the good thing is\nI know that spot produces fish. I\u2019ve actually had a cast round now later\nin the day and it didn\u2019t look like a bite was going\nto happen and found a better area just about a rod length further out,\nso I\u2019m just over 16 rod lengths. I also got caught up in a snag\nout there, so I know that\u2019s there now. I had to go out in the boat\nunfortunately, to get the line out. I don\u2019t know what it was,\nit felt like either rocks or a tree or something like that. So I\u2019ve kept away from that\non a spot with a little bit of weed, spodded about ten Spombs over the top,\njust a mixture of boilies and maize. There\u2019s not any small fish in here, so you don\u2019t need to worry about\nhaving little bits of particle on and the fish do love it\nin here as well. So when you\u2019re starting an area off, it\u2019s nice to have\na combination of baits. You never know\nwhat they\u2019re going to like. I\u2019ve throwing-sticked quite a few baits\nover the top of that as well, just spread it out right around\nthe area, just to get them picking. Hopefully finding the bait,\nfinding the bait, honing into the baited area\nand then producing the take. So there\u2019s a little tiny Isotonic pop-up\non that rod on a Spinner Rig with one of those size 4\nWide Gape Xs. And then a long area, I used Darrell\u2019s\ninformation from his last session, put the line around the sticks,\njust on the marker rod just with a lead on the end,\nno float at all so you can feel more on the bottom.\nThat\u2019s really, really important. I\u2019m using the Marker Braid\nand 30lb Arma-Kord as a leader so it absolutely\nflies off the marker rod. And I cast repeatedly\nout at 26 rod lengths, and sure enough, Darrell was right,\nthere\u2019s a lovely gravelly area out there just sort of in-between the two pylons. And I just kept casting, casting,\njust feeling what it was like, dragging the lead back. Sometimes it would tap along,\nsometimes it was smooth. That\u2019s a lovely area. If you find something\nwhere there\u2019s broken ground, where you\u2019ve got bits of gravel and then\nbits of soft silt or smooth silt and the lead just slides along,\nand in another bit it taps, I like that. I like having that sort of variance\nof substrate out there. So I\u2019ve got two rods at 26. Both on helicopter rigs\nto cast the distance and not tangle. Both on Spinner Rigs, but both\nwith wafters rather than with pop-ups, because it\u2019s nice and clean out there. I\u2019ve probably put about 30 Spombs out.\nI\u2019ve only just finished. My swim looks like absolute carnage.\nI haven\u2019t even got my bivvy up yet. We all know what it\u2019s like\non the first day on a new lake, especially when you\u2019ve travelled\na long way to get there. You\u2019re pretty knackered, you\u2019re not\nmaking decisions the best you could. You get frap-ups, things go wrong\nand it happens to all of us. So I wouldn\u2019t say\nthat I\u2019m massively confident. I know the rigs and baits\nwill definitely work, but not knowing the lake and not knowing how the fish are going\nto respond to all this commotion, I don\u2019t know\nif there\u2019s going to be action. But I guess tomorrow morning, we\u2019re\ngoing to see some more fish showing and if they get on that bait,\nI\u2019m confident I\u2019ll get bites. Much earlier than I was expecting\na bite, it\u2019s only about 10.30. I think it\u2019s just down here.\nIt is, just under my feet, I think. Get in the net, get in the net... Oh, yes! Got him. Okay, what does he go? It is 32.12. Beautiful. Well, check out the little tiny fins\non this guy. These German carp\nare just so cool, so, so cool. 32.12, this one. And he\u2019s angry still, he\u2019s angry. Up you come. Yeah, man, look at that. That is like a little baby Arfur\nfrom the Car Park Lake back in the day. Absolutely awesome. A lovely way to start. Now what I\u2019ve got to do is basically\nget the rod back out on the money. I was using 20lb Touchdown, but I\u2019m going to go down\nto 15lb Touchdown now just to make it that bit easier. It\u2019s 26 wraps out there and in the dark\nit is harder for all of us to get it accurate,\nso a slightly lighter line. I had no problems with weed\nor anything bringing that fish in. Just came in lovely on the surface,\nall the way in. Didn\u2019t touch any weed at all. So don\u2019t need the heavy line,\nand getting back out accurate and getting another probably\n10 Spombs over the top is the way to get another bite. But for now, I am really chuffed. Middle of the night, I think,\nI\u2019ve got no idea what time it is, but the long rod, where all the activity\nwas yesterday morning, has absolutely fizzed off. Okay, he\u2019s in there\u2026 He\u2019s in there. Chuffed with that, hey? It\u2019s 2.50. The road is still going,\nbut it\u2019s the same rod as before. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because\nthe fish have come in from the right-hand side\ndown from where Darrell\u2019s fishing, or it\u2019s just a better spot out there. Have to go down here. Big old common, long one. Get in that net. Bosh, got him. Well, the first one is always the most\nimportant and it came on the long rod, under the pylons at 36 wraps, where all the bubbling\nand all the jumping was going on yesterday morning\nand, yeah, it\u2019s the first-ever fish that I\u2019ve caught dropping a rig from\na bait boat so I\u2019m pleased about that. I\u2019m not sure how good it\u2019s looking\nfor the rest of the morning. It fizzled off, all the casting\nand getting the rods out yesterday seems to have scared the fish off. I\u2019ve not seen much this morning so\nmaybe a little move. We\u2019ll have to see. Yeah, man. Check that out. What a proper fighting machine and the first carp I\u2019ve caught\non my birthday for a very long time. 34.08lbs, absolutely pristine. This one was taken\non a little 15mm IB Wafter soaked in Isotonic Goo and that was on a size 4\nLong Shank X Spinner Rig style and a helicopter rig\nover loads of Link and loads of maize. Awesome result\nand looks good for more. I don\u2019t know about during the day,\nthe sun\u2019s coming up pretty rapid now and it\u2019s warming up straight away. So we don\u2019t know what daytime action\nis going to be like, but if I get a couple of these every\nnight, I should be more than happy. Right-hand rod again. The fish must be\ncoming from where Darrell is, probably somewhere in-between us,\nI would guess. Oh no, I\u2019m through my other line. Underneath\u2026 that other rod. I\u2019ve just got to keep the rod low now. There\u2019s weed out there. I thought that had come off then. Feel it rolling on the line,\nit\u2019s horrible. A leathery one. Come on, get in that net,\nget in that net, birthday carp! Bosh! Got him! Yes! That is awesome. What a day. 29lb on the button, this one.\nAnother proper old scaly warrior. A character fish, this one. He\u2019s got\na little tiny black spot on him. Looks quite old,\nso I\u2019m sure he\u2019s known to the locals. But I made sure I got four\nor five Spombs back out in the swim before the recast, wrapped it up,\nfresh hook on, fresh hookbait on, and I think I got it out there\nsecond cast. But it doesn\u2019t matter.\nIf you put the Spombs out first, you\u2019re going to scare the fish away\nwith bait rather than with a rig and I think that always means\nthey come back sooner. So another result and who knows,\nyou might get more later on today. So yesterday when we started looking, we saw the fish at the far end\nof the lake, loads of activity, loads of jumping, loads of bubbling and just that angling pressure\nthat we put on the fish, this morning\nit just looked desolate up there. I\u2019d caught one in the night, and maybe I could have caught one\nagain this coming night, but to be honest,\nit just didn\u2019t look right and this corner I know,\nwith the wind coming and with these trees here, it\u2019s just\nlike a little bit of a carp nest. It looks really, really carpy. We\u2019ve seen the odd one cruising around,\na little bit of bubbling and I think there\u2019s a really good chance\nof a few takes over here over the next few days. Well, I\u2019ve had a fair few casts\nabout out there and there\u2019s really not a lot of choice. The bottom is covered in weed,\na lot of debris on there, but so, sort of\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\nit\u2019s about 35 yards out, about six, seven foot off of the trees\nthere\u2019s a silty bit. It\u2019s not really hard, but it\u2019s clean,\nthe light lead slides through and it\u2019s far enough off the trees\nto give me a good chance. So it\u2019s going to be proper snag fishing. I\u2019m going to have to fish locked up, rods\non a little bit of an angle, sort of taking the take and be on\nthe rod straight away to the right. That left-hand tree line\nwas an absolute carp nest. It was a simple case\nof one pouchful of boilies, get the rig over the top and it wasn\u2019t going to be long\nbefore one of them found it. Move out of the way!\nMove out of the way! Sorry. You were in the way. Well, what an absolute battle that was. It\u2019s not a big fish, but it was really\ntrying to get in those trees. But I\u2019m fishing really, really heavy,\nlocked up. I\u2019ve got a size 4 Wide Gape X on\non a Spinner Rig. Crimped 20lb Hybrid, and that\u2019s breaking\nmuch, much heavier than that. Dropped the lead, 45lb leadcore\nand then obviously, 20lb Carp Line. He was obviously hooked\npretty good because I was pulling his head off\nat the start. Bosh! Well, the little move into the snaggy\ncorner has proved a good one. There\u2019s a few fish about. After getting the rods out,\nthere\u2019s a lot of bubbling going on and a few fish bow-waving around\nso it looked good for a bite, and this one hadn\u2019t been out too long,\nmaybe a couple of hours, and a proper, proper hairy battle. But I was rigged up heavy and that\u2019s\ngot this one into the net. Lovely. Because I now run a lot of fisheries, I know that the time the fish really\nwhack the weight on is these months, July, August, September,\nand the more bait you give them, the more they will eat\nat this time of the year. So, it\u2019s different from the spring where you\u2019re normally\nflinging bits of yellow and not putting a lot of bait out, and really, I think that\u2019s the key,\nis learning when to put bait in, how much to put in, so you don\u2019t put it in on feeding spells\nand ruin that feeding spell. You get everything sorted in advance,\nand then working out on your lake, how much do you put in after each fish,\nand by what method? Are you Spombing it,\nare you throwing sticking it? So it\u2019s very much about food\nat this time of the year. Yeah\u2026 Keeping your bait fresh\nin the height of summer, when it\u2019s 29 degrees, which it is today,\nis of absolute paramount importance. If your bait goes off, you put out\ncarpets of it into your swim, it can actually turn the fish off\nrather than bring them in. So you do need to pay attention to it. It does take a bit of effort\nbut it\u2019s not impossible to do. So first of all, my maize. This stuff here\nis three days old already and to keep that nice and fresh, all I\u2019ve done\nis just kept changing the water. So if the water goes a bit cloudy,\nor a little bit milky on the top, then I\u2019ll pour that water away and I\u2019ll just put fresh lake water\nover the top of it, flush it out and then do it again. If you do that every day\nor every couple of days, it will keep it nice and fresh and the best way to know\nis just to eat a bit of it. I know it might seem minging\nbut that maize is fine. I can still taste\nthe corny taste to it. A little bit of salt in there as well. You know,\nif I can eat it, the fish can eat it. This stuff basically\nhas literally been cooked today and all the particles\nthat you take with you, obviously, you can take dry and then\nif you soak them for two or three days before you boil them, they don\u2019t need\nanything like as much boiling. So this has probably been soaked\nfor a couple of days. All I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve brought it\nto the boil, simmered it for 10 minutes, turned it off, put it into a bucket, like red-hot, put the lid on,\nand then it\u2019s carried on cooking it for the next few hours\nand that\u2019s perfect. And this stuff\u2026 You can tell the difference\nbetween the stuff that\u2019s three days old and this stuff.\nThis has got a really rich corn taste, really salty because I put quite a lot\nof salt in the water. That is lovely. Now if in doubt,\nwith any kind of particle, just throw it away\nand cook another batch. And then my actual mix\nthis particular week is the Link boilie, which is my favourite boilie\nfor the summer. It\u2019s Mainline\u2019s new one\ncome out about a year ago now, and basically\neverywhere that I\u2019ve used it, it\u2019s caught fish\nabsolutely straight away. It\u2019s never been in this lake before\nand the fish have been crapping it out. It\u2019s been in the sling. That\u2019s my number one choice of boilie\nfor the summer and I\u2019ve just mixed it with the maize and put a load of water\nin the bucket as well. So basically,\nthe boilies soak up the maize juice, and it sort of makes them\nswell up a little bit. They go a bit softer,\nand then basically, that means that they can\u2019t take any of\nthe crap out on the lake bed into them. If they go out bone dry, they can\nsuck up the silt and smell very silty. So by doing that,\nif you do it in hemp juice, tiger juice, the maize juice that I\u2019ve got here,\nit just adds something extra to it. And then moving onto the boilies. I\u2019ve got my 15 and 18mm Link in there. This is one way to keep them fresh\nduring your session. Just transfer them into air dry bags,\nand what I do, I pour them out of the freezer bags into\na bucket and then pour them\ninto the open air dry bag and it just stops them going everywhere,\nall over the floor. Obviously, you want to keep them\nup off the floor if you can. If they\u2019re lying at the back\nof your bivvy, rats can get to them and eat through the bags. So I\u2019ve got them hung up in the trees. Again, out of the sun as well,\nand when they first go into the bags, if you fill them right up to the top,\nyou need to keep moving them around for the first couple of days because little bits of moisture\nget stuck in-between them and that\u2019s where the bait\ncan start to go off. And then you can look into the bag and all the stuff in the middle\nhas started to go white. So just keep moving them around\nthe whole time. These have been in there\nthree or four days now. They're going harder and harder\nall the time. Good if you putting them out\nwith a throwing stick, but really I want to be putting them\ninto that water and letting the maize juice\nsoak into them for at least 24 hours before I put them out. And another way\nto keep your boilies fresh. I\u2019ve got a great big cool box\nin the back of my van, it\u2019s one of the Coleman variety and if you put them in there\nand pack it in tight and keep that lid sealed down,\nthey will stay frozen for two or three days and the bait is now even four days in,\nthey\u2019re still cool to the touch. And I\u2019m probably not going to use\nall those baits. They\u2019re going to come home with me,\ngo back in the freezer and they\u2019ll be absolutely fine. And as a last resort, I always bring\nsome shelf life boilies with me. The High Impact range,\nnormally the Banoffees. Me and Darrell have used those\non loads of different sessions all around Europe, on the Dutch canal, the big lake that we fished in Belgium,\nand they work brilliantly. So if you\u2019ve got some of those in\nreserve, if you do run out of boilies, you\u2019re not going to stop getting bites. So this afternoon I\ndecided to move out of the snag swim. The clear spot\nwhere I caught the fish from. It\u2019s not the sort of spot\nyou want to be fishing while you\u2019re asleep\nin your sleeping bag. You have to be on the rods quick and the thought of sitting behind\na rod in there, fishing right up against those trees,\nnot getting onto it quick enough and then ending up in the trees,\nthat\u2019s bad angling. So the island\nto the right of the snag line as such, there\u2019s been a few fish bow-waving\naround behind that today and the next swim down to the right\nof the snag swim fishes out towards that island. I can\u2019t get exactly where they are\nbow-waving around because they\u2019re in a no man\u2019s land and that\u2019s why they\u2019re there,\nhappy and nice and safe. But this swim is the nearest to that\nand after throwing a bare lead around out there a few times,\nI found a really nice gravel patch. It\u2019s short of the island, so it\u2019s safe\nfor night fishing as such. If I get a take in the night,\nit won\u2019t be able to get to the snag because I\u2019ll be on the rod in time\nand it\u2019s fairly open water. So I want two\non that really nice gravel patch, and it isn\u2019t far for those fish swimming\naround behind the island to come and find that bait. I used the marker float,\nclipped up after finding the spot, put the float out onto the spot and then used the bait boat\nto take the bait out there. It\u2019s sort of lazy spodding, really.\nI\u2019ve been rushing around all day. I wanted to put quite an amount\nof bait out there and the bait boat\nseemed like the fastest way to do that. So that\u2019s why I\u2019ve done that and the right-hand rod\nis maybe 40 yards to the right of it, to a corner of an island out there\non the sort of marginal slope of it. It\u2019s a small spot, takes a few casts\nto get it in there but I\u2019ve got a really nice drop on it. All of them are fished on Spinner Rigs\nwith pineapple pop-ups, and I would say I\u2019ve probably got\ntwo kilos of boilies and a kilo of nuts on both spots. So it\u2019s quite a bit of bait, but there\u2019s\nquite a few fish in here and I\u2019m pretty confident\ngoing into the night ahead and for the rest of the session. The wind has been blowing down\nto the original swim that I started in and the fish were there to start with but there was definitely less there\nwhen I woke up this morning. I have since\nseen the odd fish down there but for the remainder of this session,\nthe wind is going to push this way and I\u2019m in this swim, got nice spots. If I get some takes tonight,\nI\u2019ll be really rubbing my hands for the rest of the session. In the early hours\nI was dragged from my pit and I wasn\u2019t surprised to see\nit was the left-hand spot and as it came into the net,\nI could see it was a really good one, a really good common. In the early hours of the morning\nmy right-hand rod was away. It had kited, as they often do at range, and I could feel the line grating\nalmost from the word go. Eventually, the fish stopped moving as I guess I had pulled it back into\nthe weed bed it had kited around. It\u2019s really easy to panic at this point\nand pull too hard. I\u2019ve made that mistake before,\nso now I tell myself to calm down, take my time\nand let the fish change its direction and pull itself out of the weed. It doesn\u2019t always work, but on this\noccasion, the spool started turning, which means the fish has worked\nits way free, and once it\u2019s moving, steady pressure on the rod\nkeeps it inching back towards me. It\u2019s a tense time,\nbut if you stay calm and patient, you can often win the battle. I never said a word because\nI thought I was going to lose it. Another mid-30, 34-pounder\nfrom in the night, and the most interesting thing about\nthis capture is what is in the sling. And with it resting for a few hours, it has passed loads and loads of maize\ninto the sling, like loads. And that is a great indicator\nof what the fish is eating. There\u2019s a bit of boilie\nin there as well. So it\u2019s definitely been eating that, but maize seems to be\nthe dominant food source. So tonight, I\u2019ll definitely be putting\none rod on a stack of maize, keeping the other one on a boilie and\nwe\u2019ll see if we can get two rods going because at the moment, all the action\nis coming to one rod. And on a long session like this where I\u2019m plotted up\nin the middle of the lake, I need to think about\nthe tactics I\u2019m using, when I\u2019m baiting up,\nhow much I\u2019m putting in, what I\u2019ve got actually on the rig, in\norder to make the most of the situation. Darrell\u2019s being Darrell\nand dotted around everywhere, fishing loads of different swims\nand getting bites and with me staying put, there\u2019s nowhere\nfor me to move to, really, so I need to think about\nhow I\u2019m fishing and making the most\nof these shorter feeding spells. Well, here\u2019s last night\u2019s result. 37lbs of German common carp\nand the biggest one so far. Came over the heavily-baited area\nwith the Link boilies and the tiger nuts from the bait boat, really accurate,\nminimal disturbance and then casting\nthose pineapple pop-ups on the Spinner Rigs over the top. Lethal. Right, we\u2019ve had hardly any action,\nwell, no action in the day, really. I just think it\u2019s non-beneficial\nto have the lines in the water. Sometimes you\u2019re fishing and you\u2019re trying to maximise\nthe most of the time you\u2019ve got, I understand that. But I think it\u2019s probably better\nto have the lines out of the swim, put some bait out, let it do its thing,\nsmell in the water without the lines in, and put them out again in the evening\nonce there\u2019s a chance of a bite. It gives me a chance\nto nip to the hotel, have a quick shower, freshen up, and, yeah, I think that\u2019s going to be\nthe winning formula. Lovely. Well, I\u2019m only two nights\ninto a session on a brand-new lake. Obviously the learning curve\nat this point is very, very steep. And with that fish I had\nin the early hours of the morning, the best bit about it\nother than obviously, the fish itself, was seeing the sling, when I got it out\nof the water this morning, it was full of maize, there was boilie\nin there, but not much. So I\u2019m going to swap one rod\ndefinitely onto maize tonight, but what I\u2019ve decided to do now\nis to bait up heavily now. I\u2019ve already wound the rods in. It\u2019s just about 10 o\u2019clock. As you can see, weather-wise,\nthere\u2019s not a cloud in the sky today. Perfect sunbathing weather,\nbut not perfect fishing weather. And you see a lot of people on a week\u2019s\nholiday out in France and stuff. They\u2019ve got to have rods out, you know?\nThey\u2019ve got to fish like 24 hours a day. They\u2019ve paid for their week,\nthey\u2019re going to fish no matter what. And you can end up, what I call,\ndrowning the swim by having your lines out all the time. So now I\u2019m a couple of days in, it\u2019s\nobvious the bites are coming at night and sometimes\nfirst thing in the morning. The wind has now changed\nto an easterly and they say wind from the east\ncatch the least and with it being hot and sunny, an open-water area\nin six or seven feet of water is almost certainly not going to produce\nin the middle of the day. So by bringing the rods in,\nyou\u2019re not missing anything and what you\u2019re actually doing\nis giving those fish an opportunity to find the bait, come across it.\nThere\u2019s no line in the water. That\u2019s 100% the scariest thing\nin fishing is the line. Much more than the rig or anything else,\nor even the sound of the Spomb, lines out all the time,\nthey know they\u2019re being fished for, they start avoiding the area. So bait for a few hours,\nsitting there with no lines in it is only going to help the action\nwhen it is feeding time. I\u2019m casting slightly upwind\nbecause when the spod hits the clip, the bow in the line is going to pull it\nin the windward direction. So I\u2019m aiming slightly right and\nquite a few of these are going more\u2026 Well, they\u2019re landing on what is going\nto be the middle rod tonight that\u2019s going to have the maize on it. So I need to aim even more right to get\nthem to land over the right-hand rod which has been doing all the bites. But now the wind\u2019s changed direction,\nI\u2019ve already seen a couple of fish ahead of me on the far bank and it looks like some fish\nare moving down the lake. So it might be tonight that\nthe middle rod is the one that goes, but, you know, doing this now means\nthere\u2019s no commotion later on. That\u2019s better. And I can get the rods out\nsort of late afternoon, early evening, and hopefully get an earlier bite. By baiting earlier in the day,\nI\u2019m going to leave the rods out all day. If you\u2019re at a holiday venue in France, then sort of after breakfast has been\ndelivered to your swim, you know, if it looks like this and it looks\nrubbish and you\u2019re in deeper water, out in open water, bait up, go and see\nyour pals, have a beer in their swim. If someone\u2019s doing\nlike what Darrell\u2019s doing, where he\u2019s snag-fishing in the day,\nyou know, go and sit with him, or go and do that sort of fishing\nyourself once you\u2019ve done this. And just know it\u2019s sitting out there\nworking for you. So when you come back and\nthe fish are in your part of the lake, they\u2019ve been feeding a little bit during\nthe day because there\u2019s no line, building confidence, hopefully,\nyou\u2019ll get more. Perfect. So a lovely 37lb common last night,\nreally pleased with that. It\u2019s a lovely spot,\nsort of a gravel bar and I\u2019m fishing on the near side of it and they\u2019re obviously feeding\nquite well at night. I could spod it out there\nas accurately as need be. I could get it on the size\nof the clear spots very easily, but the fact is\nI had the bait boat with me, I wanted to get a lot of bait out there\nand I wanted it really tight and I can do that with a bait boat\nin no time at all and it minimalises the amount\nof the disturbance on the water. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\nI\u2019m happy with the spots. I\u2019ve changed hookbait,\nthat\u2019s one thing that I have done. I caught the first fish\non a Banoffee wafter and I\u2019ve had the other one since\non Pineapple pop-ups, but having seen that common\nreally passing the bait, they\u2019re obviously eating it. I\u2019ve gone with a normal,\nlike a match to hatch colour, but I\u2019ve still gone with the pop-up. That\u2019s mainly to keep the hook\nin tip-top condition. I\u2019m using sharpened hooks\nand when they\u2019re on the bottom, they do have a tendency to sort of\ncorrode and lose their edge. So those pop-ups are sat just like\u2026\non a Spinner Rig, they\u2019re only sat maybe an inch or two\noff the bottom, very, very close to the bottom feed. So when they come in on that,\nhopefully they hone in on that smell, and, yeah, I feel really confident. It\u2019s just a case of are they here,\nbecause I haven\u2019t seen them and I\u2019m just hoping\nthis wind means they are. Get in the net\u2026 Yes! Got him! On lakes like this it\u2019s so important\nto resist the temptation to recast at first light\nif two rods are still left on the spot. This is the best time\nfor a bite in summer and even one recast\ncan spook feeding fish off the area and ruin the chances of another take. The less fish in your lake,\nthe better it is to adopt this tactic. On heavier stocked lakes,\nI\u2019d often rebait and recast straight away at any time,\neven at first light, as more bait can prolong feeding. But on this lake\nand many others like it, the fish appear to spook off baiting\nin the dark and bites can dry up. It\u2019s a case of trying both tactics and then switching to the one that works\non your lake at that time of year. Yes, got him. Another absolutely pristine\nGerman mirror. This is the one that came in the dark and I chose not to recast that rod\nin the hope that the other rod would go, and sure enough, it did. So I\u2019ve got that one to show you\nin a minute as well, but two bites in a night,\nI\u2019m well chuffed. I found out Darrell\u2019s\nnot had anything last night and I really thought\nhe was going to catch. I thought he was in the best spot\nand the wind was hacking in there. He reckons he may have put\na little bit too much bait in. But I\u2019m surprised\nI got two bites last night, but it certainly shows that the heavier\nbaiting is definitely working. Yeah, man, proper pretty one. This is one of the stockies\ninto the lake in recent years. Imagine this when it\u2019s 40 or 50lbs. 21 and a half, it went, and most\nimportantly, another bite off that spot. So the middle rod this time. It\u2019s about probably half a rod length to the left\nof where all the action\u2019s been coming. And I didn\u2019t redo the rod\nthat I caught the 25-pounder on, left it out the water and\nthen at first light this one roared off and it\u2019s the first bite I\u2019ve had on\ntwo grains of maize and a bit of plastic and that was based\non that fish yesterday that was crapping out all the maize\ninto the sling. So the plan has definitely worked. I still feel I can get more\nin a night out there. So maybe tonight, I\u2019m going to group\nall three rods together really tight\u2026 Oh, all right, mate, all right. Let\u2019s give you a dunk. There we go. I\u2019m going to put all three rods together\nreally tight and then if they go, don\u2019t recast them and\nsee if I can get three bites in a night and then later in the session I may\neven move right over to the far side just for the day, because\nI\u2019ve seen fish showing over there, but I know if I do it,\nI\u2019ll probably cut that other area off. So, for now, the plan is working. I\u2019ve got him. I\u2019ve got him. I\u2019ve got him. It\u2019s a little fully scaled. Bosh! Well, a bit of a quiet night\nfor me last night. Put a lot of bait out yesterday\nand I think a few fish visited the spot. One of the rods was sort of dragged\ndown the gravel shelf in the night. It\u2019s quite a bit of wind\nand weed on the line and the tension built up on those\nlittle two and a half ounce leads, and either a fish bumped into it,\nor it just gave way and I think that was\nmy chance gone as such. But this morning,\ncome back into the snag swim. I lost one\nreally quick after getting out. I wasn\u2019t positive enough on the rod, but the second one,\nI was straight on it. Really pulled from the off, got him away\nfrom the trees and this is the result. Lovely fish, probably an upper double. Looks really good for some more bites\nout there, and again, for this evening, I\u2019ll move back to the other swim and I\u2019m confident\nof some more action there, too. Right-hand rod again. Surprised it\u2019s happened so late,\nto be honest. It\u2019s kiting well right, which is good,\nkeep it away from the other line. Sun\u2019s pretty high in the sky now. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s sort of 9.30ish,\nsomething like that. It\u2019s not a big \u2018un\nbut it\u2019s an angry one. Tipping over its dorsal there. A lovely scaly one. There we go. Come on, you. Come on\u2026 into that net. Bosh, got him. Come here, mate, there we go. What an absolute stunner that is. Just over 17lbs,\nfought like an absolute demon and I wonder\nif putting in more bait yesterday has brought in a pack\nof the smaller fish. I\u2019ve had a 25, 22 and now a 17,\nbut I\u2019m going to keep going. Going to put a lot more bait in\nat lunchtime today, put all the rods out early\nand see if I can get an earlier bite because doing it yesterday seemed to\nsort of delay when the first bite came. So especially in the summertime\nwhen you\u2019re feeding a lot, you need to think about when it\u2019s\ngoing in, how much you\u2019re putting in, when the bites are coming, and basically, just honing everything\nto suit the conditions when you\u2019re at that lake at that time. I\u2019m going to\nkeep changing things slightly until I find the winning formula. I am using\nuncharacteristically tight lines. You see, if I pull that down, that\u2019s banging up against the rod there\nbecause it\u2019s so tight. And the reason for that is\nthere\u2019s a lot of weed out there and the first fish I hooked into\non the very first day took a load of line, went through\nthe weed beds at an angle and I ended up\npulling out of the fish. So I learned from that, and basically,\ntightened everything up from then on. I\u2019m fishing out\nat a reasonable distance, 104 yards. The water\u2019s only shallow,\nabout seven foot deep, so some of the line is going to be\non the bottom near the rig anyway and I\u2019ve got a very, very few liners. Maybe just the odd bleep\nhere and there, but generally,\nI just get a take out of the blue which means the fish haven\u2019t been\ncoming into contact with the line. So even though it\u2019s tight,\nit\u2019s not prohibitive and it\u2019s not stopping fish\ncoming into the swim. The added advantage of having a tight\nline if the fish kites left or right, when I get it closer in, I\u2019m playing it\nunderneath the other lines and there haven\u2019t been big weed beds left and right\nof where I\u2019ve been fishing, which I didn\u2019t know at the time, so I\u2019ve not really been getting fish\ncaught up in the weed. Occasionally, they\u2019ve moved into weed\nthat I didn\u2019t know about and I\u2019ve managed to pull them free,\nbut having those tight lines just allows me\nto guide the fish underneath when they get really close in. And you want to be thinking\nat the start of a session, where am I going to land my fish? Are they going to come into contact\nwith the other lines? And if I was fishing much slacker,\nwhen the fish came in close, you\u2019ve seen me passing the rod\nunderneath the others at the end of a battle. If the lines were slack there,\nI\u2019d be in real trouble. There\u2019s no point using back leads\nin this situation because the weed is up and down\nlike an egg box out there. So the line\u2019s not going\nto be on the bottom and if the fish ends up going through\na line that is back leaded, you\u2019re really in trouble. So in this sort of situation\nwhere there\u2019s a lot of weed around, I think a tight line is much better. I\u2019m using the Stow bobbins\nwhich are my absolute favourite. I know there\u2019s a fashion for using ones\nlike the Black & Whites now, but I can\u2019t see any advantage the Black &\nWhites have got over a Stow. I love the fact\nthat it\u2019s semi-fixed to the line. Any movement forwards at all,\nbasically, is just straight away, is registered on that bobbin. There\u2019s no line running through it\nbecause it\u2019s semi-fixed. And I love the way they look, I love\nthe way that they ping off the line when the fish\ndoes start to take some line and I can\u2019t see myself changing\nfrom anything else. So the line I\u2019ve got on\nis 15lb Touchdown. That\u2019s sailing out there.\nI\u2019m fishing really tight now. I\u2019ve got all three rods\nfacing out towards those pylons. They\u2019re probably\nonly three or four foot apart and it\u2019s important\nto have a line that casts really well and you can feel the lead down with to get those sort of distances\nwith pinpoint accuracy. It\u2019s all well and good saying, oh, yeah,\nI can cast 100 yards or 120 yards, but if you can\u2019t drop it\non a dustbin lid, then it is definitely\ngoing to work against you. They\u2019re on the Basia reels,\nthe brand-new ones. The matt black versions,\nabsolutely beautiful reels, an absolute Rolls-Royce,\ncan\u2019t recommend these highly enough. Obviously, they are a lot of money, but\nthey are absolutely top of the range. And the most important part of fishing\nat long distance is the rod and these are\n12 foot 3\u00be Infinity DF X45s. Really, really good recovery,\nwhich means they snap back straight after you\u2019ve finished the cast\nreally quickly. The line flies through them\nand absolutely sails out there and these for me\nare sort of multi-range rods. You might be scared\nby the 3\u00be test curve, but you\u2019ve seen how much they bend\nwhen I\u2019m playing the fish and if I was fishing\n20 yards further than this I would really struggle with a 3\u00bc. So the 3\u00be for me, when you are big fish fishing\nwith heavy lines at long distance, that\u2019s what you want to have on. And if I had to go further,\nI would scale up to the 13 foot 3\u00be because it casts that much further. When you\u2019re playing the fish\nwith these sort of stiff rods, you want to let the tip of the rod\ndo the work, especially when the fish come in close. If it\u2019s bending right through\nto the mid-section, you\u2019re putting too much pressure\non the fish and that\u2019s where\nyou can pop hooks out. So you\u2019ll see a lot of the time\nI\u2019m holding the rod above the reel and just absorbing the lunges of the\nfish in the latter stages of the fight and then you won\u2019t pop hooks out. And the whole lot is sitting\non my favourite Singlez System. This is the Stainless version. You can\nsee that is absolutely rock solid there. I\u2019ve got the Solar backrest\nwhich really grip the rods. They\u2019re not getting pulled forwards\nat all, and you can see there, I\u2019m using the new digital Delkims,\njust out this year. I\u2019ve got them set\non medium sensitivity. So you can see\neven if no line is being pulled through because they work on vibration\nI\u2019m getting really good indication and pretty much every bite\nis just pulled up tight and that bobbin\u2019s\ntried to get into the buzzer. The rod\u2019s bucking around in the rest. Off it screams\nand you get a roaring take. So that\u2019s the hardware I\u2019m using\non this particular session. It\u2019s no surprise that Darrell\nis using a virtually identical set up. It\u2019s our first choice for this\nsort of multi-range fishing. I think it\u2019s out to the left. Another small one. We\u2019re good. Well, you might have just seen how that\nfight started, and these snag battles, they\u2019re all won or lost\nin the very first few seconds. If you can get that first few yards\nback on them and turn them and get them away from the snags,\nthen you\u2019re onto a winner. This isn\u2019t a very big fish, to be fair,\nit\u2019s a really small one. The smallest one so far,\nbut even little ones can pull hard and you\u2019ve still got to get back\nfrom the water\u2019s edge rather than try and wind and crank and\nit\u2019s worked perfectly again this time. Absolutely nailed. Bosh. Come on. Well, not the biggest fish in the lake,\nbut they all count. It\u2019s proper hit and hold fishing\nin this swim and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some more fish to\ncome, much bigger than this, hopefully. But I\u2019m really keen\nto get the rod back out. The wind is just trickling in\nin this corner. Lovely, it just looks perfect. So, yeah, fingers crossed,\nthe next one might be a bit bigger. Just getting the rods sorted again\nfor the night ahead and you\u2019ll see me and Darrell\nusing the Distance Sticks technique pretty much in all of our fishing. Once we\u2019ve found the spot and\nespecially once we\u2019ve had a bite off it, we want to get back on there again\nand again and again. Using the Korda Distance Sticks\nwhich have got the grooves in, which means the line\ndoesn\u2019t come off too quickly and you don\u2019t end up\nwith a massive bird\u2019s nest. It\u2019s a great idea.\nWe didn\u2019t think of it. It was Jim at JAG that did it. And you\u2019ll notice\nwhen I\u2019m going around the sticks, I\u2019m going around\nin a figure of eight direction, rather than just round and round, and that again, stops the line\nfrom slipping off the sticks. If that happens, you just get a massive\nloop of line, it\u2019s impossible to undo. You have to cut it all off\nand start again. And when I\u2019m winding back off,\nI\u2019m using a little tiny bit of sponge, just an old dish sponge\nand this one\u2019s really worn down so it\u2019s gone really soft. And as I\u2019m winding the line on,\nit\u2019s going on tight and it\u2019s going on wet\nand it\u2019s going on clean. So obviously it doesn\u2019t show up\nso much in the water because all the grit sticking to it\nmakes it more visible and it casts like an absolute dream. You can come back off the distance\nsticks, through that bit of sponge with it nice and wet\nand whack it immediately without having to pay the line out first\nand get it wet and get it straight before you really whack it. So that\u2019s a major, major edge\nhaving one of those. Nick it off your missus out the kitchen and basically put it in a cup\nlike I\u2019ve got there. Just a bit of lake water in it and that\nwill mean that you never frap up again. So I\u2019ve caught a couple of nice fish\nfrom the snag swim today but it\u2019s time to move,\nto get back into the open water, get onto those gravel spots. I\u2019m going to make a rig change. I have been catching on pop-ups\nbut the water\u2019s coloured. We\u2019re catching at night. So if you take away\na pop-up\u2019s greatest asset, you might as well\nbe fishing on the bottom. And for me, I\u2019ve caught loads of fish on\nBanoffee wafters. In Masterclass 2 in Belgium,\ncaught some absolutely massive fish. It\u2019s a really simple rig, we\u2019re talking\nvery, very basic, but it just works. There\u2019s nothing on it\nand I think the reason it really works is because there\u2019s nothing on it,\nthere\u2019s nothing for them to feel and there\u2019s nothing for them to eject. They take that bait, they move away, they hit the lead with that ultra-sharp\nhook and that\u2019s them done. I\u2019m only going to fish two rods tonight and the reason for that is\nI think I\u2019m compromising. When you\u2019ve got two rods on one spot, you end up not putting it on\nat exactly the right part of that spot. So one rod exactly where I caught\nthat 37lb common, be really happy with that,\none on the right-hand spot as well. I think it\u2019s highly likely there\u2019s still\nquite a lot of bait out there on the bottom, but you never know. I could have been cleared out. For that reason, I am going to put\neight spods per rod out, just enough to get them sniffing around, but not enough to overdo it\nif there is still some down there, and hopefully,\nwe\u2019ll get another one tonight. The three lines are going out\nbeautifully off the tips there. Tram-lining out to the spot and I\u2019ve decided to fish all three rods\non that area tonight. The left-hand spot\ndidn\u2019t produce anything. I hung it out to about midday. Although I saw a fish show there, what\nit means is I can put a rod back there. If one of these goes tonight,\nI can cast that rod onto that spot. I know it\u2019s 16 and a third wraps. I haven\u2019t put any more bait\ninto that area. The ducks have still been diving on it\nfrom time to time. If I am lucky enough to get bites\noff of that right-hand area, rather than the rod\nsitting up against the bivvy, I can put it out in the dark there,\nleave the other two on the spot and hopefully,\nthat will produce more bites. So what I\u2019ve basically done\nwith the baiting, it went up to 29 degrees again today, so it would not have been fun\nSpombing in that. I would have done it if I had to, and I did Spomb earlier on\nin the session for two reasons. One, I didn\u2019t want to go out\nin the boat, the water\u2019s quite shallow, didn\u2019t want to potentially spook\nany fish that are in the area away and the second reason is\npeople that fish these sort of venues all around Europe\noften can\u2019t use the boat and they have to fish from the bank, so I wanted to show\nthat it could be done from the bank. Now that\u2019s been working and I can use\nthe boat, I thought I\u2019d go out there, just one trip,\nput the marker float out first, go around the sticks 26 times,\nput the float out, let it up in the middle of the spot, so I knew how much right and left\nI had to go from the float, go out in the boat, edge up to the spot,\nspread the bait all around it, so I knew\nit would be over all three rods and then the wind would push me away\nand then I\u2019d move back up again and spread it again. And I find it\u2019s better to throw the bait\nfrom a little bit further away, so it\u2019s spreads out a little bit. The tendency when you\u2019re out in the\nboat is to put everything in one spot because you can do it so accurately\nand then your rods are splayed out and there\u2019s only really bait\nover one of them. I did about half, maybe two thirds\nof one of those 11 litre buckets. Again, maize and boilies\nthat had soaked up the maize juice and I did throw some further\nwhich I\u2019ve not done with the Spombing. I threw some further behind the spot\nto try and draw fish off that far bank. But for tonight, I\u2019m pretty confident\nthat at least one of these rods is going to go, if not more, but the one that was on the left has now\nleap-frogged over the top of the rod that I\u2019ve been getting the bites on. So it\u2019s further right\nand I\u2019ve just dropped it back and I\u2019ve gone around\nthe distance sticks, I\u2019ve dropped it back by about six foot,\nso it\u2019s not cutting the other rod off. So if those fish\nare coming from the right-hand side, I\u2019m hoping\nthat any of the rods could go. The left-hand rod\nis fished six foot slightly further out. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s got the two grains\nof maize and a bit of plastic on that I had that lovely scaly 20-pounder\nthis morning on, and the right-hand rod,\nI\u2019ve put a match the hatch wafter on it. So I\u2019ve got a Link wafter\nthat\u2019s got cork dust in it to give it some buoyancy. That\u2019s been soaked in Garlic Goo,\nwhich I\u2019ve had loads of fish on pretty much on every lake\nthat I\u2019ve fished and it\u2019s more matching\nwhat I\u2019ve been feeding the whole week. You think the fish that have been coming\ninto the swim and not getting caught, have been eating that bait,\neating that Link, eating it, eating it, and not getting caught on it and maybe they\u2019ve avoided\nthe high attraction of the Isotonics\nand the corn sticking up off the bottom. Maybe they\u2019ve just been eating\nthe bottom baits and maybe I\u2019ll snare\none of those fish on that rig. If that rod doesn\u2019t go at all tonight\nand the other two do, then tomorrow night,\nI definitely won\u2019t have it on there. But when you\u2019re learning a new lake, it\u2019s good to change things\nup a little bit and it might be that rod goes first. I\u2019ll have put it out on the other spot\nand it goes on the other spot as well, then I know the fish are really\nswitched on to having the Link. So it\u2019s really interesting\nwhen you get into a new lake, working out how to unlock the code, what\u2019s really working\nat that time of the year. Everything I learn is going\nto get written down on the phone because I\u2019ll definitely\nbe coming back here, then I can employ them same tactics\nagain another summer. Well, I do love it\nwhen a plan comes together. It\u2019s not even dark yet and we\u2019ve had our\nfirst bite over that heavier baiting. And it\u2019s the middle rod which is in the same spot\nas the right-hand rod\u2019s been in, still on the Isotonic\nand that has gone first. It\u2019s well clear of the other lines but I have got a big weed bed out here. So try and steer him\u2026 Yeah, if I keep the rod low, hopefully, he\u2019ll just keep moving. He\u2019s going more over there. There he is on the top. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s above the weed bed\nand there is a tree out there. That\u2019s why I\u2019m playing it so hard. There he is on the surface. Just keeping the rod low, trying\nto keep the fish up in the water. If you put the rod high,\nthey tend to dive down deep. Come on, mate, come on. Death circles, as Darrell calls it. Get in that net. Bosh! Got him! Yeah, man. A good start. Hopefully, the shape of things to come and it looks like a 30 as well. Well, did I or did I not say\nit looked really carpy? And it doesn\u2019t get much carpier\nthan this. 32.08lbs on the middle rod\nwhich used to be the right-hand rod. That Isotonic wafter\ndoing the business again. Absolutely nailed\non that size 4 Long Shank X, fished D-Rig style with a D-Rig Kicker. Spinner-style as well on a helicopter\nrig over loads and loads of bait. And that seems to be the key now,\ngetting the bait in earlier, not baiting up again before I cast out,\njust putting the rods straight out and it took a few casts\nto do it as well, and I\u2019ve got to be honest, I am surprised it has happened\nas quickly as this, but what a pleasant surprise. So it\u2019s the left-hand rod again\nand I\u2019m not surprised, really. The fish are coming\nto that gravel patch, been cruising around\nbehind the island there and just working their way onto it. Obviously, a change\nto the Banoffee wafter rig and it certainly\nhasn\u2019t hindered things. It\u2019s so hard to tell where they are. It\u2019s just chugging through the weed\na little bit I can feel there. Picking up another rod\nis sometimes completely unavoidable when fishing three rods\nso close together at range, especially with weed around. Over the years, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best\nto slacken off the rod on the rest, loosen the clutch,\nor even open the bail arm, to allow the fish to come slowly in,\ndragging the offending line above him. It\u2019s very tense,\nit\u2019s caught around the other line. So horrible, you\u2019ve got no real contact\nwith the fish. Hopefully, the second line doesn\u2019t slide\ndown far enough to pop the hook out and if you take your time\nand don\u2019t panic, you can often land more than you lose. What a palaver, but it\u2019s in the net,\nthank God, and the road is awake. A proper character, this one.\nLook at him, or her probably. Big old distended belly,\nproper Italian looking strain. 34lbs taken on the left-hand rod. Two grains of maize\nand a grain of plastic, just to give it a little bit of buoyancy\non a size 4 Long Shank X and I waited all night\nfor another bite. I thought I was going to get\nloads last night. Getting that bite really early\nwas a really good sign. Got the cast back out there,\nsort of after a couple of goes and nothing happened\nall the way through the night. And this one\u2019s come at first light\nwhich is a fantastic time. It\u2019s getting really warm already\nand I reckon my chance of a bite, I\u2019ve probably got another hour or two\nout in open water and then if I want\nto get a bite after that, I\u2019m going to have to move the rods\nover to that far side. But for now, I\u2019m absolutely chuffed\nwith this proper character. The first consideration of any rig\nwhen you\u2019re constructing it is is it going to be anti-tangle? The second one\nis will it suit the substrate it\u2019s going to end up landing on? Then from then on, you can start looking\nat hooking arrangements and how effective is it going to be\nat hooking the fish. But if it goes out there\ntangled in the first place, or it doesn\u2019t match the lake bed,\nthen the rest of it doesn\u2019t matter. So I thought I was going to be fishing\nwith Lead Clips here. I\u2019ve moved over to helicopter rigs,\nwhich I\u2019ve used a lot in recent years, and the main reason for that\nis because they cast brilliantly and they are also very,\nvery good at anti-tangle, especially if you\u2019re going to use\na small hookbait. And because there are\nno nuisance fish in here, we\u2019ve been able to get away\nwith much smaller hookbaits. I\u2019ve brought everything with me. So I\u2019ve got them up to 24mm\nand down to 10mm and I\u2019ve settled on a 15mm wafter and that sometimes on a lead clip\ncan be problematic when you\u2019re casting it a long way. There\u2019s not enough weight\nin the hookbait to keep it away from the tubing\nand sometimes you can get tangles. So that\u2019s why\nI went over to a helicopter rig. I\u2019m using a leadcore leader\nthat I\u2019ve made myself. They\u2019re just about three feet long. The other thing about the helicopter\nis when I\u2019m casting it into weed, I can move the top bead\nup that bit of leadcore and by moving that up\nthe hooklink can slide up on the cast, the lead can go down into the weed, then the hooklink\njust finds its natural position and if it is really hard on the bottom,\nlike I\u2019ve got out on that spot, it will probably come down\nand rest next to the lead again. And I\u2019m using very tight lines, so the fish is hooking itself\nas much against the tight line as it is that 4oz Distance Lead. I\u2019ve cut the swivel off the lead\nand that\u2019s fished on a Heli-Safe so that basically\nthe lead comes off when I get the bite. And the reason for that is there\u2019s loads\nand loads of weed in here. If you\u2019ve got the lead on\nthe whole time, it keeps the fish lower in the water and it can end up going into a weed bed\nand you can end up losing it. So I don\u2019t dump the lead all the time. If there was no weed at all, I\u2019d be putting the little collar in the\nHeli-Safe and I wouldn\u2019t be dumping it. But here, if you\u2019re going to get\nsnagged up in the weed and end up losing everything, I\u2019d rather\nlose the lead than lose the fish and lose the lead and the leadcore\nand everything else. So the hooklink itself\nis made from Boom material. It\u2019s what I use for probably 90%\nof my fishing now and just with the 25, or in this case,\nthe 35lb Boom on, I just know it\u2019s not going to tangle. And I\u2019ve scaled up to 35\nbecause we\u2019re fishing for bigger fish. We don\u2019t know what snags\nand stuff are out there and it\u2019s just that bit stiffer. And with big fish and great big mouths\nand using bigger hooks, you can get away\nwith a stiffer material. So that\u2019s sliding up and down\nthat leadcore leader. I\u2019ve got a size 11 Ring Swivel\ncrimped onto one end of it and then I\u2019ve got one of the Spinner\nSwivels crimped on to the other end. Now you can cut the ring off\nof the Spinner Swivel, or now we actually do them\njust the swivel itself for clipping the hook onto. And fishing with wafters, it\u2019s probably\nbetter not to have that ring there. It hasn\u2019t really got in the way\nof me getting bites in this session, but if I knew I was going to be\ndoing that at the very start, then I probably\nwould have cut the ring off, just so there\u2019s a little bit less weight\naround the eye of the hook. I\u2019m using a size 4 Long Shank X and\neven the guys that are working with us, some of the crew are like,\noh, you\u2019re using a new pattern of hook. It\u2019s gone so out of favour,\nthe Long Shank X, that they thought it was a new hook,\nthey\u2019d never seen it before. And I basically used the Gamakatsu\nLong Shank to design this hook, whatever it was,\nprobably 15 years ago now, and the thing I didn\u2019t like about\nthe Gamakatsu, the barb was really big. So, we\u2019ve made the barb much smaller and the eye wasn\u2019t inturned,\nso we\u2019ve inturned the eye a little bit. But on this particular setup,\nI\u2019ve inturned the eye even more. So, I\u2019m just putting it\ninside the Krimp Tool and then just applying pressure\nto the back of the shank and just bending the eye in more and that just helps it to flip over\neven faster and catch hold. And I\u2019m using one of the new\nD-Rig Kickers on that. On a normal hooklink, you would keep\nthe taper on the bottom of that Kicker, but I\u2019ve just snipped it off to make it\neasier to get over that Spinner Swivel. So what you do\nwhen you\u2019re threading it on, the large end goes on first,\nthen the thin end. I\u2019ve already put a Micro Ring Swivel\nonto it before I do that and I do push that on\nbefore I cut the taper off. It just makes it easier to get the ring\nof that ring swivel onto there. So, once it\u2019s onto the hook, I\u2019ll clip\nthe hook onto the Spinner Swivel and then I\u2019m basically using my T-shirt\nand the Krimp Tool to pull it down\nover the top of the Spinner Swivel to make sure that the hook can\u2019t get off\nduring the battle. And that is probably the hardest bit\nof the whole rig. I\u2019ll wet normally the Spinner Swivel\njust with a bit of saliva, clamp down on the pliers\nreally, really tight and then just use the friction\nof my T-shirt to pull it down onto it. And once you\u2019ve done it once,\nyou can make the hook barbless once you\u2019ve got the fish in,\nslide everything off and slide it back onto another hook. And these D-Rigs will last\n10 fish, 20 fish, if you want. They\u2019re really robust bits of kit\nand I don\u2019t like throwing anything away. If there\u2019s nothing wrong with it,\nuse it again. Obviously, if the hooks have gone blunt,\nthen I\u2019ll be changing them and I\u2019m not sharpening my hooks\nat all here. Straight pointed hooks\nlike this Long Shank X are very, very difficult\nto sharpen effectively. And when we\u2019ve got gravel\nand stuff out there, I don\u2019t really want to sharpen it. I don\u2019t want to take the point down too\nfine, my hook holds have been brilliant. I\u2019ve landed virtually\nevery single fish on this and I\u2019m convinced that that kind\nof setup with a stiff hooklink, a Spinner Swivel and a Long Shank\nstraight pointed hook, it just turns so quickly. I think the first time they suck it in,\nyou just nail them. And the bait is a 15mm,\nit\u2019s an IB wafter, which is a brilliant bait on its own, but I\u2019ve just soaked it\nin the Isotonic Goo and that has been by far\nthe best hookbait. If you\u2019ve forgotten\nabout the Long Shank Xs, put them back into your fishing because\nthey are super, super efficient. Got to love a John Wilson strike,\nhaven\u2019t you, in the morning? Carp number two of a good night, really. The gravel spot, the quite slopey one, the change to the flat leads and\nto the wafters has proven a good one. Two fish.\nThis is obviously the smallest one and another one\nin the retainer to show you. Well, the first carp from last night,\nan absolute pearler, a lovely fish. Probably another stocky. Again, taken on the Banoffee wafter\non the very simple Dark Matter rig and a size 6 Wide Gape X. This is a rig that I\u2019ve used so much\nin the past, but I\u2019ve come away from it. Everyone is using Spinner Rigs\nand they are super, super effective. But if you think the fish are really on\nthe bait and especially in the summer, when you are summer fishing,\nthe fish are really eating. In the spring, single pop-ups catch you\nloads of fish, but in the summer, when they are eating bait,\nit seems silly sometimes not to fish on the bottom. And this rig, loads of people, the first thing they\u2019re going\nto look at it and go, that\u2019s brave, that\u2019s going to tangle. And I\u2019m going to talk you through\nthe components that make sure that it doesn\u2019t tangle. So first of all, Dark Matter tubing. Tubing is more anti-tangle\nthan leadcore. You can use this rig on leadcore and if you\u2019re really sort of meticulous\nwith your casting and smooth and hit the clip\nat just the right sort of force, then it shouldn\u2019t tangle. But Dark Matter tubing is thicker. It fills out the tail rubber\nthat much better and you don\u2019t end up with that sort of, that little edge\nthat the braid can catch on. That goes onto a Hybrid Lead Clip and I\u2019ve got a 3.5oz\nFlat Pear on there and the reason I\u2019ve got\nthe 3.5oz Flat Pear is one night,\nfishing to that gravel slope, the tension of the wind\nand the weed on my line meant that it sort of\ncame trundling back towards me. This 3.5oz Flat Pear\nsince then has stopped that altogether. Really important for a braided hooklink when you\u2019re going to be casting out\nis this Ring Swivel. A lot of people do quick change systems\nthese days and they\u2019re putting bits of rubber\nand all sorts on there. Now I can\u2019t guarantee\nif that won\u2019t cause tangles, but what I can guarantee\nis if you use it like this, with a Ring Swivel tied directly to it and the rig is roughly\nseven to eight inches long. This is Dark Matter in 20lb. And the next most important thing\nis the size of the boilie. If you\u2019re going to use this rig, you can\u2019t just put a 15mm boilie\non there and expect it not to tangle. It won\u2019t tangle sometimes,\nbut it will tangle sometimes. So it\u2019s a bit inconsistent and when\nyou\u2019re sitting behind rods all night, you really, really don\u2019t want that. So if you\u2019re going to use it,\n18-20mm bait or a snowman rig. It\u2019s just important to have that weight and that wind resistance\nduring the cast that keeps it away from the lead\nduring the cast. I always use this rig\nwith a size 6 Wide Gape. A Wide Gape X in this case, because I\u2019m fishing in quite weedy\nsituations for big fish, but the single most important part\nof that is the knotless knot and how many turns you do. I\u2019m using the boilie,\njust brushing the bend. You might have two,\nthree mil clearance on the bend, and then I\u2019ve whipped down past\nthe point, down level with the barb, so that when I tighten it,\nit ends up still level with the point. And it may be a fraction closer\nto the barb than the point. You don\u2019t want it to be the other way. If you haven\u2019t done enough turns, you\u2019ll have what I call\na hair tangle occasionally and in that situation, when the boilie\nwraps around the shank like that, I have lost a lot of fish\nwhen that happens. So make sure you wrap\ndown the shank far enough and the finished rig,\nthe boilie is exiting somewhere between the point and the barb, closer\nto the point, but not closer to the eye. So there you have it. A very, very,\nvery simple rig, but trust me, I\u2019ve caught fish from some of the UK\u2019s\nmost difficult venues on this and all over Europe. It\u2019s just an absolute winner\nwhen you want to fish a wafter or a bottom bait on the clear bottom. We got this one. I think this might be all right. It\u2019s getting bigger. It\u2019s getting bigger. That\u2019s all right, that is.\nThat\u2019s what I wanted. One of the mirrors, the nice old ones. On the old back wind. Yeah, yeah, get in there. Come on! That\u2019s more like it! Well, finally, a better fish out of the\nsnaggy corner, it came this afternoon. Again, simple tactics.\nA little yellow pop-up on a little\u2026 a little pop-up rig that I sort of\nconcocted after losing a few fish. One thing that I sort of changed\nwas I stopped using sharpened hooks. I\u2019m using them straight from the packet because I was thinking\nthat the sharpened hooks were sort of cutting out under heavy\npressure and this is the result. An absolutely perfect\ncrusty old German 35-pounder. If ever there\u2019s a time\nto be using fishmeal baits, it\u2019s in the warmer weather and in the summer and for this session\nI\u2019ve been using exclusively Link. I have used a few tiger nuts\nbut not many, really. I think these fish in here\nreally do like boilies. The water\u2019s really warm and that\u2019s when\nfishmeals come into their own. It is prime time to be feeding that sort\nof bait and it\u2019s really worked well. One tip that I could give you, rather than just catapulting\nstraight out of the bag, which obviously works,\nbut to pre-soak them. I like to put my bait into a bucket,\nadd some lake water or the liquid from the tiger nuts,\nthat\u2019s a really good thing to do. I like them to be\nsort of semi-saturated. So they\u2019ve taken on the water\nand you\u2019ll see the attractors, they come out into the water\nin the bucket and they become saturated in that. And what that means is\nwhen they go in the lake, they don\u2019t suck up\nthe bottom smells as much, and also, they\u2019re much easier to eat for\nthe carp when they come across them. It is absolutely roasting today. They\u2019ve given it 31 degrees\nthis afternoon and it seems like an ideal opportunity\nto talk about sun protection and basically\nwhat you need to be wearing and what you need to be doing\nto make sure you don\u2019t burn. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware, but I got diagnosed with skin cancer\na couple of years ago and anyone will tell you whenever\nthey get diagnosed with the big C the first thing you think\nis how long am I going to live? Is this thing going to take me? And it is proper scary and skin cancer\nbasically has only come about through me over-exposing myself to the\nsun, so basically burning in my youth. If my missus hadn\u2019t seen the mole on the\nback of my arm and we caught it early, it could have been the death of me. It\u2019s the reason\nwhy we\u2019ve brought these clothes out. This long-sleeved top\nyou can see me in now is the second generation\nof these kind of tops and I wanted something\nlike the sea anglers wear when they go out on the boats and obviously there\u2019s no shade there\nat all for the whole day, but in a more carpy sort of colour. So this top is basically, you can see,\nit\u2019s got a zip up, a very high zip up neck on it,\nalmost like a roll neck which I know you don\u2019t want to be\nwearing when it\u2019s red hot, but if I was cast back 20 years and\nsort of have a word with myself, I would wear this non-stop\nwhen I was fishing. Really long sleeves, goes right up\nto the edge of your wrists. This will give you that protection\nthat you need. And couple it with a hat\nand we do boonie hats as well now and the boonie hat and the tops, all the proceeds\nthat come from these products that would normally\ngo into Korda\u2019s coffers, go to a children\u2019s charity\nto help kids and their families. Kids that are diagnosed with cancer,\nhelp them get through it more easily, help them have trips\nwith their families, help their families\nbe able to stay with them in hospital. And I think\nthe first year these were out and it was just the buff that we do\nand the original long-sleeved top, I think it raised \u00a315,000\nfor that charity and I\u2019m sure\nas the range of these things grow, we\u2019ll be donating more and more money\nto that Lennox Children\u2019s charity. So the other thing, obviously,\nis to wear sun tan lotion and I don\u2019t like wearing it\nwhen I\u2019m fishing. It\u2019s hot anyway, you\u2019re normally dirty, you\u2019re rubbing that into your skin.\nit feels oily and sticky, it is not ideal, but you need to do it. If you\u2019re going to be out in the sun\nfor long periods, one bad burn can set you off\non the road to skin cancer. So I normally use the kid\u2019s stuff,\nthe factor 50 that I smother my little girl in\nwhen we go on holiday. Any of those ones from any company are all really good protection\nfrom the sun. And I just take skin wipes with me,\nlike the deep cleansing skin wipes and just wipe it off\nat the end of the day. When we\u2019re fishing\nour normal syndicate lakes, there\u2019s no access to showers\nand that sort of thing. We\u2019re all roughing it\nfor two or three days and it can get pretty\nsort of sticky and uncomfortable, but it\u2019s just so, so important to do. And you\u2019ll see most of the time\non this session I\u2019ve been wearing long trousers. The combats are very, very lightweight. They were made to be worn\nall summer long and whilst\nthey\u2019re not as cool as shorts - I\u2019ve sort of\ndefaulted to the shorts today. I\u2019ve put a bit of factor 50\non the old pins because they\u2019re going to be\nout in the sun, but I\u2019ve kept in long trousers\nas long as I can, because it\u2019s just that much\nbetter protection. And then finally, the sunglasses,\nyou\u2019ll see me in Polaroids all the time. Whether you\u2019re spending \u00a315 on a pair\nor \u00a350 on a pair, I wholeheartedly recommend them. Not just for spotting fish in the water, but for watching your rigs\ngo out in the air when it\u2019s sunny, so, you\u2019re not squinting, for picking out the marker float\nwhen you\u2019re Spombing, making sure you\u2019re accurate. You haven\u2019t got to spend the earth and\nif you think about sun protection, especially if you\u2019re younger, all you lads that are fishing that are\nteenagers and in your early 20s, that is the time\nthat you can get skin cancer and it will stay in your body\nuntil you get to my age, sort of late 40s, into your 50s and it\ncan really give you some problems. So I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t enjoy it. Having a sun tan is absolutely fine,\nbut just do not burn. Dan to Darrell. Come in, Darrell. Hello, mate. Are you all right? Yeah, mate, good. Been a bit of a sort of uneventful day\nover here, but I saw the pictures of that one you\nhad, that was an absolute stunner, mate. Yeah, it\u2019s been quite quiet\naround there, really. They were in there bubbling literally\nfirst cast I made this morning. A massive sheet of bubbles\ncome up straight away and the first chance\nsort of went begging. I think the rod hadn\u2019t gone down, must have been sitting badly\nor something, but that take came this afternoon, but it\u2019s the only bit of action\nI\u2019ve seen. Yeah, I put all three out long\nsort of late morning, early afternoon and as you probably saw, and I don\u2019t think I dropped them\nclose enough to the far side. I was worried about going over\nthat really shallow bit where all the rocks are\nand being too close to the trees with it being\na couple of hundred yards away, I just thought they\u2019d be in the trees.\nBut the fish that we saw, we sent the drone up to get some\ngeneral shots later on, and of course, we had a look as well\nwhile it was up there and the fish\nwere sort of milling around, just odd fish\nmilling around in the weed, sort of quite close to the trees\non the far side. Yeah, that\u2019s very\u2026 It\u2019s just like\nthe likely safe zone, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the furthest point\nfrom all the swims. That\u2019s where they\u2019re going to be,\nisn\u2019t it? Yeah, but where I\u2019ve seen them\nshowing before, they were definitely the other side\nof that really shallow bit, which is only about a foot,\n18 inches deep, with big rocks on it. And I was just worried\nif I got a bite beyond it, the fish would kite left or right\nand cut me off on one of the rocks or do me in the trees, you know? So I was only, I don\u2019t know,\ntwo rod-lengths away from where we saw this fish, just as it was sort of\nsloping back down towards me. Nice spots, and then the right-hand rod\nwas even closer to the trees, as I found a nice bit close to it\nand still nothing happened. But we did notice some further up\nthe lake, back up near where you started but sort of around the corner from it\non the far margin, there appears to be\na carp nest up there. There was quite\na few hanging around it. So this evening\nI\u2019ve gone back up there and I had a little donk around\nwith the Pronged Marker Lead to see if there\u2019s any weed there\nand it\u2019s lovely and clear and like really firm sand. So I\u2019m going to fish it probably\na couple of rod lengths off the trees tomorrow with the hope\nof getting a bite on the last day. But how are you feeling\nfor tonight, mate? Do you reckon\nyou\u2019re going to get any more? I baited up pretty early on.\nI used the bait boat again, got it nice and sort of tight around\nthe float, just cast back over it. One cast each spot\ngone down with mega drops. If they\u2019re not tangled and the fish\nare there, they\u2019re in trouble. Mate, give us a shout if you get\na big \u2018un and I\u2019ll do the same. We\u2019ll have a little chat\nin the morning, yeah? Roger that, mate.\nGood luck for tonight. Cheers, bruv. Over and out. That\u2019s a liner. That\u2019s a liner. It\u2019s the final day and you\u2019ve seen me\nand Danny doing different tactics. Danny\u2019s sort of static\nin a central swim, changing it up, sort of trying to get\nas many bites from one swim. And you\u2019ve seen me being ultra-mobile\nand trying to do what I do - find the fish\nand catch as many as possible. Loads of different tactics employed,\nall sort of based around summer fishing and I\u2019m sure if you add these tactics\nto your own there\u2019s definitely something\nanyone can take from this session, apply in their own angling in their\nsummer fishing and catch more carp. Get in there. Here he is, another scaly little banger\nfrom the German snag swim, taken fishing across to the trees and hopefully, there might be\nanother one to come yet. Well, the carp nest\nhas produced a bite. Just inching it back\naway from any weed. Done the hard bit,\nit\u2019s away from the snags. Just walk myself back down\nto the fish. This is the area\nthat we called the carp nest. Out sort of on the right-hand side\nunderneath the pylons, an inaccessible bit\nfrom pretty much every swim, unless you do what I\u2019ve done\nand boated out a long way. I\u2019ve changed the leads over\nfrom a 4oz Distance to a 5oz Flat Pear\nbecause obviously I\u2019m not casting it, and the rig has stayed the same. I\u2019ve put a size 2 hook on\nwith a curved point, just to help it stay in a bit better and\njust threw a little bit of bait around. I baited up yesterday evening as well,\nbecause we saw fish over there, I just sprinkled a little bit\nof that same mix in and I\u2019ve done the same thing\nagain today, just a handful, and I\u2019ve dropped the rigs probably\n10 yards from where the trees are. No point getting a bite at that range\nunless you\u2019re going to get it in and it\u2019s 250 yards to over there. I\u2019ve got a range finder\nthat the golfers use. Fish is still on,\nI can feel it kicking. And these reels,\nthey only take 270 yards of 15lb. It\u2019s right on the surface, the fish,\na long way out, though. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t surprised that this\nwas the first rod to go, to be honest. Just got to keep it moving,\nsuch a long battle. If it weeds me up, I could go out\nin the boat, obviously, and get it, but I didn\u2019t really want to do that\nbecause of the other lines out there. But he\u2019s obviously got weed around\nhis head and he\u2019s just coming in, just slowly, slowly on the surface. The best thing you can do, really, if you\u2019ve got a little sort of blanket\nover his eyes and he can\u2019t see anything,\nthen you just sort of wind him in, which is what\u2019s happening\nat the moment. Lead\u2019s obviously come off\nbecause it\u2019s right up in the water. Going to go down and put the net in\nat the last moment, so, hopefully, the fish doesn\u2019t know\nthe net\u2019s there until it\u2019s too late. If I can get that bit of weed\naround his face, then it\u2019s going to make the whole thing\na lot easier. He\u2019s quite a long way\nbehind that weed bed. See if I can\u2026 Yes! Get in! That was hairy! Only just in the net\nbecause of all that weed. I love it when a plan comes together. Yeah, man, check that out. A very, very angry 27lb male mirror. Look at them lovely scales\non the flank there, absolutely gorgeous, and the best bit about this, the bite\ncame at 1.30 in the afternoon. Sun\u2019s high in the sky, 30 degrees, and it just shows you,\nif you change the spot to somewhere where the fish want to be\nduring the day, you can continue the action\nday and night. So if you pick a swim\nthat\u2019s got a lovely margin to it and some open water,\nyou\u2019re absolutely laughing. I\u2019ve really enjoyed staying put\nand working the swim and it shows if you go onto a lake\nwhere you go into a draw, a lot of these holiday commercial venues\nin France are like that, and you get a swim and you can\u2019t move, you have to make the absolute best\nof that swim. And I\u2019m really pleased that I\u2019ve done\nthat with the way I\u2019ve baited up and how I\u2019ve fished out in open water. I\u2019ve had bites virtually every single\nnight, or the next morning, right the way through the session. What I would do differently here, when Darrell moved away from that swim\nat the far end, I would have gone around there\nduring the day when I didn\u2019t want to fish in my swim,\nmarkered up, found an area that I could cast down to because there was a lot of fish\non that far margin that weren\u2019t being fished for at all. So by baiting up that other swim, I could have gone down there\nfor a few hours in the day, been on all of my clips,\njust baited every single day again to train the fish to feed there\nduring the day, put two rods out for five or six hours and I might have caught more fish\nthat way. I\u2019m out by the nest again. This tactic of walking back\njust keeps it up closer to the surface because I\u2019m going so high up the bank and just keeps it moving\nat a steady pace, rather than pumping and keep slackening off slightly\nand pumping back in. As usual, the fish is about\ntwo feet behind the weed, maybe three feet behind the weed. There he is. Not a great situation, this,\nbut not a lot else we can do. Just hang on\nand hope it tires itself out. It\u2019s come in a long way already. Got to be able to see the fish. It\u2019s sort of down in the water. I\u2019ve only got it! Oh, mate, how about that? Netted it under the water\nlike a match angler. Get in! Touch, and it\u2019s a good fish as well.\nA nice 30. All right, mate, calm down, calm down. Yeah, there we go. I\u2019m so chuffed that the effort of moving\nthe spots and going out super long, taking advantage of the boat,\nhas paid off. Look at this amazing 31-pounder. Well chuffed with this one, and thank\nGod for Delkims working on vibration. No lines getting taken whatsoever. I\u2019ve got them all locked up because\nI\u2019ve got about 20 yards of line left and there\u2019s loads of snags out there and anything more than one bleep\non the Delkims is a fish on the end and, yeah, it just went off\ntwo or three times, felt the line, it was bow-string tight and that was when I wound down\nas much slack as I possibly could and then just started walking back\nto get him away from them snags. Result, yes. In this summer\u2019s Masterclass\nwe\u2019ve caught some really nice fish but there\u2019s always certain things\nthat you can take away from a session and location,\nit\u2019s always the number one thing. We turned up, we found the fish\nand I did catch one on that first night. And to be honest, I probably\ncould have stayed in that swim and I probably would have caught, but I did notice that the bulk\nof the fish that had been there were no longer there. And having been there before, I knew they\u2019re very likely\nto go to that snaggy corner and like I said in the film, I could\neasily have fished that swim at night and I would have definitely lost more\nfish and that\u2019s not good angling. So I\u2019ve been able to hop\nbetween the two swims, keep bait in both of them. It enabled me to keep\nthose bites coming and if you find yourself\nin a snag swim like I was and you use the tactics that I did, then you\u2019ll be able to land those fish\nfrom those really snaggy areas and I\u2019ll tell you what,\nwhen that buzzer goes, you will know that excitement. What a fight. It doesn\u2019t look that big,\nbut it\u2019s absolutely having it. It\u2019s got to be a better one,\npulling like that. It\u2019s a common it\u2019s on the top, thrashing. Wow! We\u2019ve got him, we\u2019ve got him. What a fight. What a battle! Went off and I got it away\nfrom the trees fairly easily and then it decided, once it was sort of\nsafe and I had eased off a bit, to really go for it. But held on tight, and he\u2019s still on. It\u2019s not really ready, but I reckon\nhe\u2019s going to go in. Bosh! Get in there! Yes! Yes... Oh, yeah, it\u2019s a good fish, that is. It\u2019s a tiny bit under 20 kilos. So it\u2019s 43\u2026 43.12! Check that out. I\u2019m absolutely blown away. 43lbs and probably the very last carp\nof this year\u2019s summer Masterclass. Danny has employed tactics,\nsort of staying stationary, but changing spots, and I\u2019ve been\nreally mobile, moving around. Obviously, I\u2019ve fished the snag swim. A few little tweaks here and there\nto help me land the fish, and again, fishing in the open water\non the gravel spots. So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s loads of tactics\nand loads of tips for everyone and something that will help\nput more fish in your landing net.", "boSGRDYm92E": "  IN COLUMBUS, OHIO, BYRON HAS BEEN SERVING UP TRIMS FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS FOLKS FROM ALL OVER COME FOR THE BEST CUTS AND CONVERSATION IN  TOWN >> HE'S A GREAT BARBER AS FAR AS COMING HERE, IT'S AN EXCELLENT COMMUNITY. >> Reporter: BUSINESS WAS BOOM,  BUT THEN CAME THE PANDEMIC >> WHEN COVID HIT, I WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE MY LANDLORD WAS ASKING FOR THE MONEY I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HELP WAS GOING TO COME FROM I HAD TO BE HONEST I LOST FAITH >> Reporter: CLOSING YOUR DOORS  FOR TWO MONTHS BECAUSE THEY WERE DEEMED NONESSENTIAL, HE'S  GETTING BACK ON HIS FEET WITH  FEWER CUSTOMERS. >> THE REALITY OF OUR BUSINESS IS DOES MORE THAN JUST CUT HAIR.

THIS MORNING FIRED MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE OFFICER DEREK CHAUVIN IS  PREPARING FOR HIS FIRST COURT  APPEARANCE FACING CHARGES OF  SECOND-DEGREE MURDER AND  MANSLAUGHTER AFTER THE DEATH OF  GEORGE FLOYD. CHAUVIN STILL DECLINING TO  COMMENT. ONE DAY AFTER THE MAYOR WAS  BOOED FOR SUPPORTING THE POLICE. MANY OF THE CITY COUNCIL TALKED  ABOUT DEFUNDING THE DEPARTMENT. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENGAGING  A PLAN TO CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. >> Reporter: WHETHER IT'S  DISMANTLING DEPARTMENTS OR  REINVESTING IN OTHER PARTS OF  DEPARTMENTS, DEMANDS ARE GROWING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN NEW YORK CITY, BILL de BLASIO IS MOVING SOME RESOURCES. >> WE ARE COMMITTED TO SHIFTING  RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE FOCUS IS ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. >> Reporter: ERIC GARCETTI IS  PLEDGING TO CUT $150 MILLION  FROM THE POLICE BUDGET. CRITICS OF DEFUNDING SAY IT  WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. >> IT'S A CATCH PHRASE BUT  YOU'RE DEFUNDING POLICE  ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOR THE MOST  PART ARE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY  UNDERFUNDED. >> Reporter: ALL THIS AS MORE  DISTURBING VIDEOS EMERGE OF  POLICE ARRESTING BLACK MEN. IN FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA, A  MAN IS SEEN BEING HIT WITH A  STUN GUN AND HIT ON THE HEAD. IN CALIFORNIA, POLICE RELEASED  THIS VIDEO OF AN ARREST LAST  MONTH WHICH IS ALSO UNDER  INVESTIGATION.

EARL GREY REPRESENTS THOMAS LANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN A COP FOR FOUR DAYS. >> HE WAS DOING WHAT HE THOUGHT  WAS RIGHT. >> Reporter: LANE IS NOW ACCUSED OF AIDING AND ABETTING  SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE YOUR CLIENT  STOOD BY AND WATCHED FOR NEARLY  NINE MINUTES? >> HE DID NOT STAND BY AND  WATCH. HE WAS HOLDING THE LEGS BECAUSE  THE GUY WAS RESISTING AT FIRST. NOW, WHEN HE'S HOLDING HIS LEGS, HE SAYS TO CHAUVIN, SHOULD WE  ROLL HIM OVER BECAUSE HE SAYS HE CAN'T BREATHE, HE SAYS NO. >> GABE, ABOUT THIS DISBANDING  THE POLICE AND THAT'S THE VOTE  OF THE CITY COUNCIL, WHAT WOULD  THAT LOOK LIKE? WHAT WOULD THE NEXT STEPS BE? >> Reporter: THAT IS A MAJOR  QUESTION RIGHT NOW. AND THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY THEY WANT INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC  AND IT COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR  TO FIGURE HOW THIS WOULD WORK. THE MAYOR HERE WANTS TO REFORM  THE DEPARTMENT, NOT ABOLISH IS. ONE IDEA BEING TOSSED AROUND IS  PERHAPS HIRE MORE COUNSELORS TO  DEAL WITH MENTAL HEAH CALLS  INSTEAD OF SOLELY RELYING ON  POLICE. >> GABE GUTIERREZ, THANK YOU. >>> THE WEEKEND SAW SOME OF THE  LARGEST PEACEFUL PROTESTS YET  ALL ACROSS THE NATION.

NEW YORK CITY, THE NATION'S  EPICENTER OF THE PANDEMIC, IS  TAKING ITS FIRST STEPS FORWARD  TODAY. A SURGE IN CASES IN OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE EASED RESTRICTIONS AND THOSE MASS PROTESTS WE'VE SEEN  FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE  OUTBREAK? MORGAN RADFORD IS IN TIMES  SQUARE WITH THE LATEST. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. IT'S BEEN A HUNDRED DAYS SINCE  THAT FIRST CONFIRMED CASE OF  CORONAVIRUS IN NEW YORK CITY. AND SINCE THEN ALL THE DRAMATIC  STEPS WE'VE TAKEN HAVE WORKED. BUT THE REALITY IS WITH PROTESTS NOW LEADING TO POSSIBLE CONCERNS ABOUT A RESURGENCE, THESE ARE  ALSO TENTATIVE. THIS MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME  IN THREE MONTHS, NEW YORK CITY  IS CAUTIOUSLY OPENING BACK UP. >> WE BENT THE CURVE. >> Reporter: THE CITY HIT  HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC IS  ENTERING THE FIRST PHASE OF  REOPENING TODAY.

WITH HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED AND  MORE THAN 16,000 CONFIRMED  CORONAVIRUS DEATHS IN NEW YORK  CITY ALONE. BUT AFTER A STRICT SHUTDOWN,  WIDELY AVAILABLE FREE TESTING,  AND INCREASED CONTACT TRACING.  THE CITY HAS MET THE CRITERIA  NEEDED FOR REOPENING. PHASE ONE MAY BE AS MANY AS  400,000 PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IN  THE BIG APPLE. COUNTRIES REOPENING MUST LIMIT  CAPACITY. FREQUENTLY CLEAN SHARED  SURFACES, SCREEN WORKERS FOR  SYMPTOMS, AND CREATE SOCIAL  DISTANCE MARKERS TO HELP  CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES STAY SIX FEET APART. >> IT'S BEEN SOUL CRUSHING. >> Reporter: MACKENZIE FARKWAY  SHUT DOWN HER FIVE SHOPS IN  MARCH. THIS MORNING SHE'S BACK OPEN FOR BUSINESS. WITH ITEMS UP FRONT SO CUSTOMERS CAN SHOP FROM THE SIDEWALK. >> I HOPE IT WILL BE SUPER BUSY. >> Reporter: BUT NATIONWIDE,  LOOSENED RESTRICTIONS MAY HAVE  CONTRIBUTED TO A SPIKE IN 18  STATES. AND REOPENING EFFORTS ARE  COMPLICATED BY THE SWEEPING  PROTESTS FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF  GEORGE FLOYD. >> WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO SEE  TRANSMISSION COMING OUT OF THESE GATHERINGS. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. >> Reporter: IN NEW YORK, THERE  WILL BE 15 SPECIFIC TESTING  SITES FOR PROTESTERS. >> IF WERE AT A PROTEST, ACT  RESPONSIBLY. GET A TEST. >> Reporter: A CITY WORKING HARD TO MOVE FORWARD AND FIND ITS NEW NORMAL. SO SOME GOOD NEWS. THE GOVERNOR SAYS THAT SCHOOL  GRADUATIONS OF UP TO 150 PEOPLE  WILL BE ALLOWED AS EARLY AS JUNE 26th. BUT THE BAD NEWS, ONE OF THE  BIGGEST CHALLENGES THE CITY IS  STILL FACING IS MASS TRANSIT. IT'S STILL REALLY DIFFICULT TO  SOCIALLY DISTANCE IN NEW YORK  CITY'S CLOSE BUSES AND TRAINS.  >> IT SURE IS. THANK YOU. >>> CRAIG JOINS THE TABLE NOW  WITH ANOTHER STORY TIED TO THOSE PROTESTS WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING. >> GOOD MORNING.

HEY, KRISTEN. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING TO  YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL MEET WITH  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS LATER  TODAY WITH HIS RESPONSE TO THE  CRISIS SURROUNDING GEORGE  FLOYD'S DEATH COMING UNDER NEW  SCRUTINY. IT COMES AS HE IS LOCKED IN AN  INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE RACE  WITH THE PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC  NOMINEE JOE BIDEN. THIS MORNING PRESIDENT TRUMP IS  FACING A GROWING CHORUS OF  CRITICISM FROM FORMER MILITARY  LEADERS. >> WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT  CONSTITUTION. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS DRIFTED  AWAY FROM IT. >> Reporter: OVER THE WEEKEND,  COLIN POWELL JOINING THAT LIST  AND BLASTING THE PRESIDENT. >> HE LIES. HE LIES ABOUT THINGS. AND HE GETS AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL NOT HOLD HIM  ACCOUNTABLE. >> Reporter: POWELL A FREQUENT  TRUMP CRITIC WHO SERVED FOUR  PRESIDENTS, THREE REPUBLICAN AND ONE DEMOCRAT, AND WHO VOTED FOR  HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016 ENDORSED JOE BIDEN OVER THE WEEKEND  GETTING EMOTIONAL TALKING ABOUT  WHAT HE SAYS HOW THE WORLD VIEWS THE UNITED STATES.  >> ARE WE INSULTING EVERYBODY? ARE WE GOING AFTER IMMIGRANTS? THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. I'M THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS. I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF MY FAMILY  COULDN'T COME HERE IN BANANA  BOATS IN THE 1920s. THIS IS AMERICA. THIS IS WHO WE ARE. AND THE WORLD DOESN'T  UNDERSTAND. >> Reporter: MR. TRUMP FIRED  BACK CALLING POWELL HIGHLY  OVERRATED. AS FOR THE 2020 RACE, IN OUR  LATEST NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET  JOURNAL\" POLL, BIDEN LEADS TRUMP NATIONALLY 49% TO 42%. THAT'S UNCHANGED FROM APRIL'S  POLL. WHILE BIDEN IS UP EIGHT POINTS  AMONG VOTERS IN THE TOP BATTLE  GROUND STATES 50% TO 42%.

BILL BARR OUT FRONT OVER THE  WEEKEND DEFENDING THE USE OF  FORCE TO CLEAR LAFAYETTE PARK  LAST MONDAY NIGHT WHICH SET THE  STAGE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  PHOTO OP IN FRONT OF ST.

AS THE SYSTEM PUSHES TO THE  NORTH, WE ARE GOING TO BE  WATCHING THIS MAKE ITS WAY -- IN FACT, IT'S THE SECOND EARLIEST  LANDFALL ON RECORD. THE RECORD WAS ARLENE BACK IN  1959. NOW, THIS SYSTEM WILL PUSH TO  THE NORTH BRINGING SOAKING RAINS TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY  MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH WISCONSIN AND ON INTO THE U.P. OF  MICHIGAN. THERE'S ONLY TWICE BEFORE BEEN A TROPICAL REMNANT LOW PASS ACROSS WISCONSIN. AND ONLY ONCE BEFORE OVER  MICHIGAN. SO THIS IS A RARE SITUATION,  INDEED. HEAVY RAIN AS YOU GET INTO THE  MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. LOCALLY 5 INCHES OF RAIN. LOOK AT THIS AS YOU GET INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST, WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING 2 TO 3 INCHES AND LOCALLY THEY COULD HAVE 5 INCHES AS  WELL.

IN THE MEANTIME, NINE MEMBERS OF THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL  AGREED YESTERDAY TO DISMANTLE  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND  REPLACE IT WITH A COMMUNITY  BASED PUBLIC SAFETY MODEL. >>> A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR NEW  ZEALAND THIS MORNING. OFFICIALS SAY THE COUNTRY HAS  ELIMINATED THE CORONAVIRUS AND  IS LIFTING ALL DOMESTIC  RESTRICTIONS. PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN  SAID SHE DID A LITTLE DANCE UPON HEARING THAT. THE COUNTRY HAD NO ACTIVE CASES. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EVENTS CAN  RESUME WITHOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. STRICT BORDER CONTROLS WILL  REMAIN IN PLACE THOUGH. >>> BREAKING OVERNIGHT. HUNDREDS OF FIREFIGHTERS BATTLED A MASSIVE STRUCTURE FIRE IN  DOWNTOWN PHOENIX. YOU COULD SEE A BALL OF FLAMES,  A HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE FROM  SEVERAL MILES AWAY. OFFICIALS SAY THE FOUR-STORY  APARTMENT COMPLEX WAS STILL  UNDER CONSTRUCTION, SO IT'S  UNLIKELY THERE WAS ANYBODY  INSIDE.

THE MOVE FOLLOWING A CALL FROM  PROMINENT PLAYERS TO TAKE A  STANCE. STEPHANIE GOSK JOINS US WITH THE LATEST ON THIS ONE. HEY, GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. WELL, ROGER GOODELL IS  APOLOGIZING FOR HOW THE LEAGUE  FAILED TO SUPPORT PLAYERS WHO  WERE PROTESTING POLICE BRUTALITY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE DURING THE  NATIONAL ANTHEM. FOR MANY THIS IS AN ABOUT FACE  THAT WAS A LONG TIME COMING, BUT IT HAS ALSO CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF KNEELING'S FIERCEST AND MOST  CRITICAL OPPOSITIONER. ROGER GOODELL RELEASED THIS  STATEMENT. >> WE THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL  LEAGUE CONDEMN RACISM AND THE  OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE. WE THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE  ADMIT WE WERE WRONG FOR NOT  LISTENING TO NFL PLAYERS EARLIER AND ENCOURAGE ALL TO SPEAK OUT  AND PEACEFULLY PROTEST. >> Reporter: THE EXACT SAME  LANGUAGE STAR NFL PLAYERS ASKED  THE LEAGUE TO USE THE DAY  BEFORE. >> WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. >> IT SHOULDN'T TAKE THIS LONG  TO ADMIT. >> Reporter: GOODELL'S MESSAGE  OF UNITY COMES AFTER ONE OF THE  NFL'S BIGGEST STARS EXPOSED THE  LEAGUE'S DEEP DECISIONS. >> I WILL NEVER AGREE WITH  ANYBODY DISRESPECTING THE FLAG  OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. >> Reporter: DREW BREES  APOLOGIZED TWICE AFTER HE SAID  PLAYERS SHOULDN'T PROTEST POLICE BRUTALITY AND INJUSTICE DURING  THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. >> I AM SORRY. ANDLY DO BETTER. >> Reporter: THE NEW ORLEANS  SAINTS QUARTERBACK ALSO  PROMISING TO DO BETTER AND BE  PART OF THE SOLUTION. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW GOING AFTER  GOODELL OVERNIGHT TWEETING,  COULD IT BE REMOTELY POSSIBLE  THAT GOODELL WAS INTIMATING IT  WILL BE OKAY FOR PLAYERS TO  KNEEL? AND SAYING BREES SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN BACK HIS ORIGINAL STANCE. BREES HITTING BACK. TO DONALD TRUMP, THROUGH MY  ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH  FRIENDS, TEAMMATES, AND LEADERS  IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, I  REALIZE THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE  ABOUT THE AMERICAN FLAG. THE PRESIDENT ECHOING HIS  COMMENTS IN 2016 WHEN COLIN  KAEPERNICK TOOK A KNEE  PROTESTING POLICE BRUTALITY. KAEPERNICK NEVER PLAYED IN THE  NFL AGAIN AFTER THAT SEASON. >> USUALLY TAKEN OUT OF  REVERENCE. >> Reporter: NATE BOYER IS THE  PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR  SUGGESTING KNEELING AS A PROTEST TO KAEPERNICK.  >> KNEELING WAS BORN OUT OF A  MIDDLE GROUND, YOU KNOW? TWO PEOPLE THAT DISAGREED ON A  LOT, BUT TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE  WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION  AND LISTEN. >> SO STEPH, GOODELL DIDN'T  ADDRESS THE KNEELING DURING THE  ANTHEM, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE  UPCOMING SEASON AND THOSE  PROTESTS? WHAT WILL WE SEE? >> Reporter: YEAH, HODA. HIS STATEMENT IS VAGUE ALTHOUGH  A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE INTERPRETED IT AS A GREEN LIGHT FOR  KNEELING. YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN A  HANDFUL OF PLAYERS WHO SAY WHEN  THEY COME BACK, THAT'S EXACTLY  WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO  INCLUDING RUNNING BACK ADRIAN  PETERSON. HE THINKS THAT KNEELING COULD  POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES AND >>> WE ARE BACK. 7:40 NOW WITH IN-DEPTH TODAY. >> THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  IS APPLYING NEW PRESSURE ON  PRINCE ANDREW THIS MORNING TO  TESTIFY AS PART OF ITS CRIMINAL  INVESTIGATION. \"TODAY'S\" KEIR SIMMONS IS IN  LONDON WITH THE BREAKING  DETAILS. HI, KEIR. GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: HEY, SAVANNAH. GOOD MORNING. A SENSATIONAL FRONT PAGE TO THE  SUN NEWSPAPER HERE THIS MORNING. YANKS HAND ANDY OVER. PERHAPS INEVITABLY BEING A  BRITISH TABLOID, THAT HEADLINE  IS A LITTLE EXAGGERATED BUT U.S. INVESTIGATORS ARE FORMALLY  ASKING TO SPEAK TO PRINCE  ANDREW. FOR SUCH A HIGH PROFILE FIGURE,  MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ROYAL  FAMILY, THAT IS RARE. THIS MORNING PRINCE ANDREW  FACING A FORMAL REQUEST TO SPEAK WITH NEW YORK FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS AS PART OF THEIR  INVESTIGATION INTO SEXUAL ABUSE  BY HIS LATE FRONT JEFFREY  EPSTEIN. THE QUEEN'S SON WILL BE  INTERVIEWED AS A WITNESS. HE STAYED WITH EPSTEIN IN NEW  YORK AND THE U.S. VIRGIN  ISLANDS. A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE  MATTER TELLS NBC NEWS THE  APPLICATION HAS BEEN MADE UNDER  A U.S./UK TREATY. SARAH FERGUSON POSTED THIS  SAYING, SO PROUD OF OUR LOVING  FAMILY. BUT IN AN INTERVIEW IN DECEMBER, VIRGINIA CLAIMED SHE WAS  TRAFFICKED BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN  AND ABUSED BY PRINCE ANDREW WHEN SHE WAS 17 JUST DAYS AFTER THIS  PICTURE WAS TAKEN. >> IT WAS REALLY A SCARY TIME IN MY LIFE. I HAD JUST BEEN ABUSED BY A  MEMBER OF A ROYAL FAMILY. >> Reporter: PRINCE ANDREW SAYS  HE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF  MEETING HER. HIS OWN INTERVIEW LAST YEAR WAS  WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT EPSTEIN. >> HE HAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY  CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN A MANNER  UNBECOMING, YES. >> UNBECOMING? HE WAS A SEX OFFENDER.  >> YES. I'M SORRY, I'M BEING POLITE. >> Reporter: AND HE WOULD ONLY  SAY HE MIGHT TALK TO  AUTHORITIES. >> IF PUSH CAME TO SHOVE AND THE LEGAL ADVICE WAS TO DO SO, THEN  I WOULD BE DUTY BOUND TO DO SO. >> Reporter: A SOURCE CLOSE TO  HIS LEGAL TEAM TELLING NBC NEWS  LEGAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DOJ  ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT  CONFIDENTIALITY RULES WHICH IS  WHY WE'VE MADE NO COMMENT. AND THIS MORNING, NO WORD FROM  BUCKINGHAM PALACE WHICH NO  LONGER REPRESENTS PRINCE ANDREW  SINCE HE STEPPED DOWN AS A  WORKING ROYAL. >> KEIR, IF PRINCE ANDREW  DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE,  WHY NOT JUST AGREE TO THE  INTERVIEW WITH AUTHORITIES? >> Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT  QUESTION. HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO GIVE  EVIDENCE UNDER OATH, BUT THAT  SAID YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT  YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHEN  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGAL  CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING  PLACE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,  PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS. WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS. THAT SAID, THE OPTICS ARE  TERRIBLE FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY,  AREN'T THEY? ONE FINAL NOTE. PRINCE ANDREW'S TELEVISION  INTERVIEW LAST YEAR, WIDELY  BELIEVED TO HAVE GONE REALLY,  REALLY BADLY. PERHAPS HIS LEGAL ADVISERS ARE  CONCERNED ABOUT HOW IT WOULD GO  IF 7:49 WITH \"TODAY\" CELEBRATES THE CLASS OF 2020. CARSON'S GOT THE HIGHLIGHTS  FROM, I THINK, ONE OF THE  LARGEST CEREMONIES OF THE YEAR. HEY, CARSON. MORNING. >> GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

EXPRESSING THEIR SUPPORT FOR  GRADUATING SENIORS AS THEY TAKE  THEIR NEXT BIG STUFF. >> YOU ALL HAVE DONE SOMETHING  GREAT. HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH AND  CELEBRATE. >> AND GO AHEAD AND DO A LITTLE  DANCE. A COOL DANCE. >> YOU'VE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN PURSUIT OF YOUR DREAMS AND  NOTHING, NOT EVEN A GLOBAL  PANDEMIC IS GOING TO KEEP YOU  FROM THE FUTURES YOU'VE IMAGINED FOR YOURSELF. >> EVERY OBSTACLE IS REALLY AN  OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN, TO GROW,  AND TO CHANGE. >> PERFORMANCES INCLUDED A  RENDITION OF U2'S \"BEAUTIFUL  DAY.\" AND A ZOOM BOMB BY MARIAH CAREY  AS THE CAST OF \"SCHITT'S CREEK\"  PERFORMED. SOCIAL MEDIA LIT UP WITH PRAISES OF THE EVENT. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE SPEECHES  WERE RECORDED BEFORE THE DEATH  OF GEORGE FLOYD, SEVERAL  ADDRESSED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF  THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT  AND ENCOURAGED GRADUATES TO RISE UP FOR CHANGE. >> WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR  COLLECTIVE HEARTS WHEN PUT TO  POSITIVE ACTION CAN START  CHANGE. REAL CHANGE HAS STARTED WITH  YOU. >> YOU ARE THE SEEDS THAT WILL  GROW INTO A NEW AND DIFFERENT  FOREST THAT IS FAR MORE  BEAUTIFUL AND LOVING THAN THE  ONE WE LIVE IN TODAY. >> OUR OWN JENNA BUSH HAGER HAD  THESE WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT. >> AND WHEN THE WORLD OPENS UP  AGAIN, WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE  BETTER THAN BEFORE. THE WORLD WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE OF YOU. >> Reporter: WHILE ALICIA KEYS  URGED THE GRADS TO STRIVE FOR  GREATNESS. >> YOU ARE GRADUATES IN THE MOST POWERFUL TIME TO BE COMING OF  AGE. AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN  STOP YOU FROM CHANGING THE  WORLD. >> GUYS, ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE DEAR CLASS OF 2020 IS THAT  WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SOCIAL  MEDIA PRETTY MUCH UNANIMOUSLY  ALL AGREED SOMETHING WAS  AMAZING? IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. SO THAT'S JUST SMALL PROOF OF  HOW IMPRESSIVE THIS OVER  FOUR-HOUR PRODUCTION WAS. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A SENIOR, IT  IS WORTH GOING BACK TO YOUTUBE  TO REVISIT AS THE MESSAGES OF  HOPE AND CAMARADERIE AND  INSPIRATION WERE ABUNDANT AND IT WAS POWERFUL. VERY WELL DONE. >> THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. I FEEL LIKE >>> IT'S 8:00 ON \"TODAY.\" COMING UP, DAY IN COURT. THE OFFICER CHARGED WITH GEORGE  FLOYD'S MURDER SET TO FACE A  JUDGE TODAY AS CALLS TO DEFUND  THE POLICE GROW ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. WE BREAK IT ALL DOWN THIS  MORNING. >>> PLUS, TOMORROW'S LEADERS. HODA'S CANDID CONVERSATION WITH  YOUNG CHILDREN ABOUT RACISM. >> THE MOMENT WE'RE LIVING IN IS KIND OF FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT  FEELS AS THOUGH IT'S AN ATTACK  ON PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME. >> JUST AHEAD, THEIR POWERFUL  MESSAGE AND THE HOPE THEY'LL  GIVE YOU FOR THE FUTURE. >>> AND ONE MAN'S TREASURE. AFTER YEAR'S SEARCHING FOR A  REAL LIFE MILLION-DOLLAR  MYSTERY, THE HUNT MAY BE OVER. WE'LL TAKE YOU INSIDE THE  OVERNIGHT DEVELOPMENTS ON THE  FAMOUS SEARCH.

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOUR  CLIENT STOOD BY AND WATCHED FOR  NEARLY NINE MINUTES? >> HE DID NOT STAND BY AND  WATCH. HE WAS HOLDING THE LEGS BECAUSE  THE GUY WAS RESISTING AT FIRST. NOW, WHEN HE'S HOLDING HIS LEGS, HE SAYS TO CHAUVIN SHOULD WE  ROLL HIM OVER BECAUSE HE SAYS HE CAN'T BREATHE. CHAUVIN SAYS NO. >> Reporter: THE TENSIONS  FUELING PEACEFUL PROTESTS OVER  THE WEEKEND. >> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP MARCHING  AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO. >> Reporter: FROM NEW YORK  SQUARE TO THE STREETS OF  HOLLYWOOD TO WASHINGTON, D.C.'S  NEWLY DUBBED BLACK LIVES MATTER  PLAZA TO PHILADELPHIA WHERE AMID THE DEMONSTRATIONS, ANOTHER KIND OF UNITY. AND THAT WAS QUITE AN EMOTIONAL  SCENE. BACK HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS, THERE  ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT  HOW DEFUNDING THE POLICE WILL  WORK. THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS IT IS  ASKING FOR INPUT FROM THE  PUBLIC, BUT IT COULD TAKE UP TO  A YEAR BEFORE THEY COULD FIGURE  OUT HOW THAT WOULD WORK. >> ALL RIGHT. GABE GUTIERREZ IN MINNEAPOLIS. >>> LET'S GO TO THE PANDEMIC. THE OVERALL NEW NUMBERS OF  COVID-19 CASES HAS DROPPED IN  THE U.S., BUT AT LEAST 20 STATES HAVE SEEN AN ALARMING UPTICK IN  RECENT WEEKS. SAM BROCK IS IN MIAMI BEACH WITH MORE ON THAT. HEY, SAM, GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: HODA, GOOD MORNING. THERE'S BEEN MORE TESTING. THAT COULD PARTLY EXPLAIN THE  HIGHER NUMBERS, BUT BUSINESSES  HAVE BEEN REOPENING. EVER SINCE MEMORIAL DAY, WE'VE  SEEN LARGE GATHERINGS OF CROWDS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING  MASSIVE PROTESTS FOR GEORGE  FLOYD. HERE IN FLORIDA, THE LAST FIVE  DAYS HAVE BROUGHT THE BIGGEST  SPIKE IN CASES SINCE MID-APRIL. AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING TO BEAT  BACK CORONAVIRUS --  >> I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS. >> Reporter: -- A WAVE OF  BUSINESSES REOPENING, BEACHES  BUZZING, AND PROTESTS ERUPTING  ARE TAKING A TOLL. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI SAYING THE  LARGE GATHERINGS POSE A  SIGNIFICANT THREAT. >> IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE  BECAUSE THE REASONS FOR  DEMONSTRATING ARE VALID. AND YET THE DEMONSTRATION ITSELF PUTS ONE AT ADDITIONAL RISK. >> Reporter: THIS MORNING 20  STATES SHOWING AN UPWARD SWING  IN CASE OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. TEXAS, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, AND  MISSOURI AMONG THEM. A RISE STRETCHING BACK TO A VERY SOCIAL MEMORIAL HOLIDAY.  >> WHETHER IS NICE OUTSIDE,  PEOPLE START TO GO BACK OUTSIDE. WE DID RELAX A LOT OF OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING IN THOSE STATES AND  HERE WE GO. STATES START TO PICK UP. >> NO JUSTICE! >> NO PEACE! >> Reporter: MASSIVE  DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH  OF GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH ONLY  HEIGHTENING CONCERNS. A NEW NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET  JOURNAL\" POLL SHOWS 66% OF  RESPONDENTS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE  ATTENDING A PUBLIC GATHERING OR  AN EVENT WITH A LARGE GROUP. EVEN AS SOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS STEP OUT INTO THE STREETS TO  PROTEST INJUSTICE. >> I DON'T KNOW THAT COVID IS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND OUT THERE. IT'S THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED AND  NOTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN. >> Reporter: A POWERFUL MOVE  SWEEPING THE NATION AS NEW YORK  CITY REOPENS ITS ECONOMY FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY. >> WE ARE GOING TO OPEN 15 SITES THAT ARE DEDICATED JUS TO  PROTESTERS TO GET A TEST ON AN  EXPEDITIOUS BASIS. BUT PLEASE GET A TEST. >> Reporter: TESTING IN COLLEGE  SPORTS ALSO RAISING RED FLAGS AS ATHLETES RETURN FOR PRESEASON  TRAINING. ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE REPORTS,  SEVERAL UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAVE THE VIRUS  AND AUBURN UNIVERSITY  ACKNOWLEDGES THREE OF ITS  PLAYERS TESTED POSITIVE TOO. AN OKLAHOMA STATE LINEBACKER  TWEETING AFTER ATTENDING A  PROTEST AND BEING WELL  PROTECTIVE OF MYSELF, HE HAS  COVID-19. AND THAT PLAYER ALSO TWEETING HE WAS COMPLETELY ASYMPTOMATIC. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IS  ARGUABLY THE MOST PROMINENT  FOOTBALL PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVE NOT CONFIRMED YET  THOSE CASES OF CORONAVIRUS BUT  HAVE SAID HEALTH AND SAFETY OF  STUDENT ATHLETES IS THEIR TOP  PRIORITY AND THEY'RE ENSURING  THOSE ATHLETES GET THE BEST  POSSIBLE MEDICAL CARE WHEN THEY  RETURN TO CAMPUS. >> SAM BROCK IN MIAMI. THANK YOU. >>> THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE  DEVELOPMENT IN THE SEARCH FOR A  HIDDEN TREASURE THAT WE'VE BEEN  TELLING YOU ABOUT FOR YEARS. SOMEONE HAS APPARENTLY CLAIMED  THE FORREST FENN TREASURE WORTH  MILLIONS. GADI SCHWARTZ HAD SPENT TIME  LOOKING FOR IT AS WELL. CLEARLY IT WASN'T GADI THAT  FOUND THE TREASURE BECAUSE HE  JOINS US THIS MORNING WITH THE  LATEST. HEY, GADI. >> Reporter: HEY, CRAIG. THANKS FOR RUBBING IT IN. WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEONE  WAS ABLE TO SOLVE ALL NINE CLUES IN THAT CRYPTIC POEM THAT  FORREST FENN WROTE. BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO FORREST FENN OVER THE PHONE, HE SAID HE WAS  PARTLY RELIEVED, PARTLY SADDENED BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN HIS  MIND THAT HIS TREASURE HAS BEEN  FOUND. SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS  NORTH OF SANTA FE, AN 11th  CENTURY TREASURE BOX FILLED WITH MILLIONS WORTH OF GOLD AND  ANTIQUITIES HAS BEEN FOUND. ONLINE A COMMUNITY IS GOING  WILD. FORREST FENN IS AN 89-YEAR-OLD  ART COLLECTOR WHO STASHED THE  TREASURE TEN YEARS AGO IN AN  EFFORT TO GET PEOPLE OFF THEIR  COUCHES INTO THE GREAT OUTDOORS. NOW TELLING ME BY PHONE A MAN  FROM BACK EAST DECIPHERED THE  CLUES. >> THE END IS EVER DRAWING NEAR. >> Reporter: BUT SO FAR FORREST  HAS BEEN MUM ON THE IDENTITY  SAYING IT'S OVER WHEN THE  PICTURE WAS SENT TO HIM OF THE  TREASURE. AND IT WAS UNDER A CANOPY OF  STARS IN THE LUSH FOREST OF THE  VEGETATION OF THE ROCKY  MOUNTAINS. IT COMES AFTER YEARS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND THE CHEST. WHICH FOR ME STARTED IN SANTA FE AS ONE OF THE FIRST TO COVER THE MODERN DAY TREASURE HUNT. SINCE THEN, THOUSANDS HAVE  SHARED THEIR OWN QUESTS LIKE RAY AND CHLOE HARP WHO SAY IT'S  BROUGHT THEM CLOSER AS A FAMILY. >> IT'S BROUGHT US TOGETHER OUT  IN NATURE, OUT IN SUNSHINE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT FORREST  WANTED. IT GAVE US A PERSPECTIVE OF THE  WORLD THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL  NEVER FORGET. >> Reporter: TODAY HEARING THE  NEWS IS BITTERSWEET. >> IT FEELS LIKE THE LAST PAGE  OF OUR FAVORITE BOOK. >> Reporter: BUT THE STORY  HASN'T BEEN WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT  DANGER. THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS  RESCUES AND AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE HAVE DIED WHILE SEARCHING IN  TREACHEROUS TERRAIN. AUTHORITIES LONG EARLY MORNING  FENN TO CALL OFF THE SEARCH  DESPITE FENN'S INSISTENCE THAT  IT WAS IN A SPOT A 70-YEAR-OLD  MAN COULD REACH. BUT TODAY THAT EXACT LOCATION  STILL A MYSTERY. THE FINDER HAS WISHED TO REMAIN  ANONYMOUS. I GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS WHOLE  TREASURE HUNT WAS VERY CLOSE TO  MY HEART. IN TEN YEARS I SPENT A LOT OF  TIME LOOKING FROM NEW MEXICO TO  YELLOWSTONE. I WAS CONVINCED IT WOULD BE OUT  THERE FOR CENTURIES EVEN THOUGH  ONE TIME FORREST TOLD ME I CAME  WITHIN A COUPLE MILES OF THE  BOX. I THOUGHT I COULD TAKE MY GRAND  KIDS OUT THERE. BUT NOW THE MYSTERY HAS SHIFTED  TO WHO FOUND IT AND HOW THEY  SOLVED ALL THOSE CLUES. SAVANNAH? >> GADI, I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T  GET YOUR POT OF GOLD. BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, WE GET TO  KEEP YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. >> Reporter: THAT'S TRUE. VERY TRUE. >> YEAH. SILVER LINING FOR US. >>> ALSO THIS MORNING, WE'RE  KEEPING AN EYE ON THE STORM  CRISTOBAL WHICH MADE LANDFALL AS A TROPICAL STORM IN LOUISIANA  YESTERDAY. 50 MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS. THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER  HAS NOW DOWNGRADED THE STORM TO  A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE  HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING AS FAR  NORTH AS WISCONSIN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. >>> 12 MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR,  ONLY ONE THING TO DO NOW. A COUPLE OF MORNING BOOSTS,  HODA. >> LET'S DO IT. A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT NAMED  JARED WAS NOT GOING TO LET THE  CORONAVIRUS RUIN THE HIGHLIGHT  OF HIS SENIOR YEAR WHICH IS, OF  COURSE, GRADUATION. SO WHEN IT WAS CANCELED, HE  DECIDED TO HOLD A LITTLE  CEREMONY OF HIS OWN. CHECK IT OUT. GO, GO, GO. NEIGHBORS WERE HONKING THEIR  HORNS. HE HAD A RED CARPET ROLLED OUT. THAT LITTLE STAGE ON THE FRONT  LAWN, HE PUT ON A GOOD SHOW. HE EARNED THAT CAP AND GOWN AND  HE'S NOT GOING TO LET ANYBODY  FORGET THAT. >> NO. HE KNOWS HOW TO PUT ON A MOMENT. >>> ALL RIGHT, CRAIG. YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS ONE. IT'S A DAD STORY. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOUR KID  GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO CREATE A  LIFETIME MEMORY AND YOU JUST  HAVE TO GO WITH IT NO MATTER HOW MESSY. TAKE A LOOK. >> COME HERE. HOLD MY HAND. >> HOW CUTE IS THAT? THE SHOES ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE  SOGGY AND THE PANTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LAUNDRY,  LIKE, TWICE. BUT ONE DAY ALL THAT LITTLE GIRL .  GOING TO >> AND THAT'S YOUR LATEST  WEATHER. GUYS? >> ALL RIGHT, AL. THANK YOU. >>> NOW TO THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF OUR SERIES ACROSS THE  PLATFORMS OF NBC NEWS FOCUSING  ON INEQUALITY IN AMERICA. >> MORE THAN 50 MILLION KIDS GO  TO PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THIS  COUNTRY, BUT THE EDUCATION THEY  RECEIVE, IT VARIES WIDELY. SOMETIMES FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND  OFTEN FOR THE WRONG REASONS. >> NBC'S LEGAL CORRESPONDENT  CYNTHIA McFADDEN HAS OUR REPORT  THIS MORNING. HEY, CYNTHIA. GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. WELL, PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE USED TO MAKING DO AS ONE SUPERINTENDENT  WROTE RECENTLY HE'D NEVER SEEN A BAKE SALE FOR A BANK OR AN  AIRLINE AND YET SCHOOLS OFTEN  OPERATE ON JUST FUMES. YOU KNOW, IN WAYNE COUNTY,  MICHIGAN, WHEN THE CORONAVIRUS  HIT, ONCE AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS  CAME INTO SHARP VIEW. WAYNE COUNTY, THE SIXTH HARDEST  HIT COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. IT BECAME CLEAR SOME STUDENTS  HAD COMPUTERS. MANY DID NOT. KENNEDY CAIN IS A FIGHTER. AND THAT'S LUCKY BECAUSE AT 16,  SHE'S NOT ONLY A STRAIGHT-A.  STUDENT AT ONE OF THE THE BEST  SCHOOLS IN DETROIT, SHE'S  RUNNING A SCHOOL ON A SINGLE  COMPUTER FOR SIX SIBLINGS. NEARLY A MONTH WITHOUT ANY  ASSIGNMENTS, HER SCHOOL LAUNCHED AN ONLINE PLATFORM. BUT KENNEDY SAYS THAT HASN'T  MADE IT EASIER. >> NOT ONLY IS THIS NEW TO US,  BUT IT'S NEW TO THE TEACHERS AS  WELL. AND SOMETIMES THE TEACHERS HAVE  DIFFICULTIES WHEN THEY ARE  TRYING TO PROGRAM IT. AND THEN THEY ASSIGN IT AS IF  THEY KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS  AVAILABILITY OR THE OPPORTUNITY  TO HAVE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR HOME WHEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SO IT'S KIND OF FRUSTRATING. >> Reporter: WHEN SCHOOLS  CLOSED, ONLY 10% OF DETROIT  PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS HAD  ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AND THE  INTERNET. WHICH IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO DR. NIKOLAI VITI. HE BECAME SUPERINTENDENT  INHERITING A SYSTEM LONG ON  PROMISE AND SHORT ON RESOURCES. SO DR. VITI, WHAT WAS THE STATE  OF THE DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOL  SYSTEM BEFORE CORONAVIRUS? >> ENROLLMENT WAS UP FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT DEFINED BY  STATE AND NATIONAL TEST SCORES  SHOWED IMPROVEMENT. >> Reporter: EQUALLY IMPORTANT,  THE TEACHER VACANCY RATE WHICH  HAD DOGGED THE CITY HAD IMPROVED BY 75%.  >> GOD PUT ME ON THIS EARTH TO  KEECH. I LOVE IT. >> Reporter: CASEY EDGAR TEACHES 11th GRADE MATH AT KING HIGH. SHE SAYS MOST OF HER NEARLY 150  STUDENTS ARE LESS AND LESS  COMMITTED TO SCHOOL. >> HOW COME YOUR CAMERA'S NOT  ON? THE FIRST WEEK I WAS IN TOUCH  WITH 50% TO 60%. NOW IT'S RUNNING AT ABOUT 20%. >> Reporter: WHAT PERCENTAGE OF  YOUR STUDENTS DO YOU THINK ARE  ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK? LIKE, RIGHT ABOUT 10%. >> Reporter: THAT'S NOT VERY  MANY.  >> NO. NOT VERY MANY AT ALL. >> Reporter: LIKE MANY PLACES  AROUND THE COUNTRY, LITTLE  LEARNING HAS TAKEN PLACE FOR  DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS  SINCE MARCH. >> INSTEAD OF ADDING OR  SUBTRACTING, WE'RE GOING TO BE  MULTIPLYING. >> Reporter: THERE'S NO DENYING  THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE IN  AMERICA. JUST SEVEN MILES FROM DOWNTOWN  DETROIT, THE GROSSE POINTE SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL HAD A COMPUTER IN  EVERY KIDS' HANDS WHO NEEDED ONE IMMEDIATELY AFFECT SHUTDOWN. >> I WAS ISSUED A LAPTOP RIGHT  AFTER SCHOOL ENDED. >> Reporter: XAVIER PRATER IS A  DEDICATED STUDENT. >> WE JUST LOG IN AND GO TO OUR  REMOTE LEARNING RESOURCES. >> Reporter: XAVIER WILL BE A  SENIOR NEXT YEAR AND DREAMS OF  GOING TO UCLA. HE IS WELL ON HIS WAY WITH LOTS  OF SUPPORT. LITTLE SURPRISE, PARTICIPATION  IN ONLINE CLASSES IN GROSSE  POINTE IS 95%. MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS JUST A  ZIP CODE AWAY IN DETROIT WHERE  IT'S ONLY 50%. A REFLECTION SOME SAY OF DEEPLY  ROOTED SYSTEMIC RACISM. THE NUMBERS TELL AT LEAST PART  OF THE STORY. IN DETROIT, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD  INCOME IS ABOUT $30,000. THE POPULATION IS NEARLY 80%  BLACK. IN GROSSE POINTE, MEDIAN INCOME  IS JUST OVER $100,000 WITH A  BLACK POPULATION OF 2%. SO IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN  DETROIT A RACIAL DIVIDE AS WELL? >> ABSOLUTELY. THE HAVES ARE RECEIVING MORE  THAN THE HAVE NOTS. WE ALREADY KNOW CHILDREN ARE  COMING IN AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH FEWER RESOURCES THAN MIDDLE  CLASS, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS  STUDENTS. BUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  SHOULD BE THE EQUALIZER IN  GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  CHILDREN. BUT INSTEAD IT EXACERBATES THE  DIVIDE THAT ALREADY EXISTS. >> Reporter: DETROIT IS GETTING  A BIG BOOST WITH A $23 MILLION  GIFT FROM LOCAL BUSINESSES TO  GIVE EVERY STUDENT A LAPTOP. BUT THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL  SUMMER LONG AFTER THE SCHOOL  YEAR ENDS. >> WE CAN ANTICIPATE MOST  STUDENTS LOSING SIX MONTHS OF  WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD  WE BEEN IN SCHOOL. >> Reporter: SIX MONTHS BEHIND  CAN BE A KNOCKOUT PUNCH FOR KIDS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH AN  ACHIEVEMENT GAP. NOT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS  SMART, NOT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T  WILLING TO WORK AS HARD. JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE. >> GROSSE POINTE IS RIGHT NEXT  TO US AND THEY HAVE -- THEY GOT  RESOURCES THE SECOND THIS  PANDEMIC STARTED. THIS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ISN'T  LACKING AS MUCH AS WE ARE. AND IT'S LIKE, WOW. WHY CAN'T WE BE LIKE THAT OR WHY CAN'T WE STEP IN AND GIVE TO OUR STUDENTS LIKE THEY ARE? BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS ARE NO  DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS. >> Reporter: SO I ASKED KENNEDY  WHERE HER INCREDIBLE COURAGE AND HER WISDOM CAME FROM. SHE SAYS HER WORKING MOTHER WHO  SHE CALLS A SUPERHERO. AND ONE FINAL POINT, BROWN AND  HARVARD DID A STUDY AFTER THE  CORONAVIRUS HIT OF MATH AROUND  THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT JUST  UNDER A MILLION STUDENTS. HERE'S WHAT THEY FOUND. IN THE POORER ZIP CODES, THE  MATH LEARNING HAD BEEN REDUCED  BY ABOUT 50%. AND IN THE WEALTHIEST ZIP CODES, NO LEARNING LOSS. >> EVEN IF THE KIDS GET THESE  LAPTOPS, WHAT ABOUT THE DIGITAL  DIVIDE AS IT PERTAINS TO DIGITAL ACCESS AS WELL? >> Reporter: THAT'S PART OF IT. THESE LAPTOPS ARE GOING TO COME  WITH INTERNET ACCESS BECAUSE  THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A PROBLEM. >> I REMEMBER WE DID THAT STORY  OF THAT FAMILY THAT ACTUALLY GOT IN THEIR CAR AND DROVE TO WHERE  THERE WAS INTERNET ACCESS. BUT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT  PEOPLE LIVE BLOCKS APART AND  HAVE THAT DISPARITY. THAT WAS FASCINATING, CYNTHIA. THANK YOU. >>> 8:30 NOW ON A MONDAY  MORNING. IT IS THE EIGHTH DAY OF JUNE  2020. AND JUST AHEAD IN THIS HALF  HOUR, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WISE  BEYOND THEIR YEARS HAD A  CONVERSATION WITH SOME  REMARKABLE KIDS ON RACE IN  AMERICA. AND MAKING SENSE OF EVERYTHING  THAT'S HAPPENING. THESE KIDS ARE AGING 10, 11, 12, ALL THE WAY UP TO 15. YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR HOW THEY'RE  PUTTING THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE. >> I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME STUFF  TO LEARN FROM THEM FOR SURE. I CANNOT WAIT TO SPEAK TO THE  FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO BE ELECTED  TO NEW JERSEY'S SUPREME COURT. SHE HAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO  TELL. >>> WE'VE GOT AN INSPIRATIONAL  HALF HOUR LINED UP. BUT BEFORE THAT, MR. ROKER, HOW  ABOUT A FINAL CHECK OF THAT  WEATHER, FINE SIR. >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT THE WEEK AHEAD. WE'RE STARTING OFF TODAY WITH  WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGH THE  LOWER GULF WITH CRISTOBAL AS IT  MAKES ITS WAY TOWARDS THE WEST. SUNNY AND PLEASANT IN THE  NORTHEAST. THEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE  MID-WEEK PERIOD, SEVERE STORMS  MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE EASTERN  GREAT LAKES. WET WEATHER ALL THE WAY DOWN  INTO FLORIDA. NICE AND DRY THROUGH THE PLAINS. THE WARMTH CONTINUES ON THE WEST COAST. THEN AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE END  OF THE WEEK, COASTAL STORMS  DEVELOP DOWN ALONG THE ATLANTIC  COAST. HOT AND HUMID FROM TEXAS ALL THE WAY INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI  RIVER VALLEY. COOL AND DAMP INTO THE PACIFIC  NORTHEAST. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND  THE COUNTRY. HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR  NECK OF THE WOODS. >> AND THAT'S YOUR LATEST  WEATHER. HODA? >> ALL RIGHT, AL. THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP NEXT, THE NEW  VOICES JOIN THE CONVERSATION ON  RACE IN AMERICA. >> WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT  IT'S OKAY TO BE BLACK. IT'S OKAY TO BE WHITE. IT'S OKAY TO BE PACIFIC  ISLANDER. ALL OF THESE THINGS IS WHAT  MAKES THE COUNTY BEAUTIFUL AND  AMAZING AND THE PEOPLE WE ARE. >> HOW IMPRESSIVE IS MARLEY? WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO AWESOME  YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GIVE US HOPE  FOR THE FUTURE. BUT FIRST, THIS IS \"TODAY\" ON  NBC. >>> WELCOME BACK ON THIS MONDAY  MORNING. HODA, YOU'VE HAD INTERESTING  PERSPECTIVE ON ALL THE SCENES  WE'VE SEEN IN OUR COUNTRY. >> I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY THE  IMAGES OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE  PROTESTING AND CALLING FOR  CHANGE. A LOT OF ADULTS LOSE SIGHT OF  THE BIG PICTURE SO WE LIKE TO  TAKE LESSONS FROM KIDS WHO HAVE  A WAY OF SEEING THINGS MORE  CLEARLY. >> NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE! >> I CAN'T BREATHE! >> Reporter: ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AMERICANS ARE RISING UP TAKING A STAND DEMANDING CHANGE. >> NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE! >> Reporter: NEW VOICES. KIDS WHO UNDERSTAND THE SIMPLE  TRUTHS THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN  ARE CREATED EQUAL. TO BETTER HEAR THOSE VOICES, I  ASKED A FEW OF TOMORROW'S  LEADERS TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP FIX THINGS  TODAY. HI, GUYS. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK  YOU. YOU ARE SMART PEOPLE, SMART  KIDS. AND WE NEED SMART KIDS RIGHT  NOW. WE NEED Y'ALL TO HELP US OUT OF  THIS MESS WE'RE IN. OKAY? CAN Y'ALL HELP US? >> YES. >> Reporter: FIRST THERE'S  11-YEAR-OLD ROSALIE WHOSE  FAVORITE SWEATSHIRT SAYS IT ALL. SEVENTH GRADE BUDDIES LOGAN,  JOSH, AND AIDAN HAVE A  RELATIONSHIP THAT'S COLOR BLIND. AND THEN THERE'S MARLEY, A  15-YEAR-OLD ACTIVIST WHO  CAMPAIGNED TO GET THOUSANDS OF  BOOKS ABOUT BLACK GIRLS INTO  SCHOOLS. OKAY, MARLEY, I'M GOING TO START WITH YOU. GIVE ME YOUR REACTION TO WHAT  YOU SEE GOING ON OUTSIDE RIGHT  NOW. >> WELL, THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE  LIVING IN IS KIND OF FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT FEELS AS THOUGH IT'S  AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE THAT LOOK  LIKE ME, WHICH IS REALLY SCARY  AND DISAPPOINTING. >> Reporter: AIDAN, WHEN YOU  LOOK OUT AT WHAT'S GOING ON ON  THE STREETS, HOW DOES IT MAKE  YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF? >> I FEEL IN DANGER LIKE I'M  BEING HUNTED BECAUSE I'M  DIFFERENT. AND I FIND THAT JUST  UNACCEPTABLE. >> Reporter: WHY DO YOU FEEL  THAT WAY, HONEY? >> BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BEING  BRUTALLY MURDERED FOR NO REASON. >> Reporter: AIDAN, DO YOUR  PARENTS EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT  THE WAY YOU SHOULD ACT WHEN  YOU'RE IN PUBLIC? >> THEY ALWAYS SAY BE CAREFUL,  KNOW YOUR RIGHTS, AND NEVER  DISRESPECT A POLICE OFFICER. >> Reporter: BE CAREFUL, KNOW  YOUR RIGHTS, NEVER DISRESPECT A  POLICE OFFICER. HAVE YOU EVER FELT INTIMIDATED  WHEN YOU WERE WALKING AROUND? >> YEAH. >> Reporter: LIKE, GIVE ME AN  EXAMPLE. >> LIKE, WHEN I WAS WALKING MY  DOG PHINEAS, IT WAS NIGHT SO I  DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO COME UP  TO ME THINKING THAT'S AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOY AT NIGHT. >> Reporter: DOESN'T THAT MAKE  YOU SICK? >> EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE, WHY? WE'RE ALL THE SAME. >> Reporter: LOGAN, WHEN YOU  LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING  ON, DO YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY'S FIGHTING ABOUT? >> I THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING  ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY. ALSO YESTERDAY MY DAD SAID YOU  DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE  BLACK UNTIL YOU WALK A MILE IN  MY SHOES. AND HE SAID IT BECAUSE I REALLY  DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT IS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE CLENCHING THEIR BAGS WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET. HE SAYS IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. >> ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I  PERSONALLY SAW OR WITNESSED  INEQUITY WAS WITH MY OWN HAIR  WHEN I GOT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. A LOT OF THE KIDS AT SCHOOL  WOULD SAY IT WAS TAKING UP TOO  MUCH SPACE AND THEY WANTED ME TO SIT IN THE BACK OR THAT IT WAS  DIRTY. AND THESE THINGS WERE, LIKE,  SUPER FRUSTRATING. BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT WAS  COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL. >> Reporter: WELL, YOUR HAIR IS  GORGEOUS. >> I LOVE YOUR HAIR. >> Reporter: ROSALIE, DID  SOMETHING HAPPEN AT CAMP? >> YES. >> Reporter: TELL ME ABOUT THAT. >> I SAW SOME PEOPLE FROM A  DIFFERENT CABIN, THEY WERE  TALKING -- THEY WERE SAYING HOW  THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STAY WITH  KIDS BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. AND AT THE TIME I DIDN'T REALLY  SAY ANYTHING TO THEM AT THE TIME BUT I TALKED TO MY COUNSELORS. AND SOMETIMES -- LIKE, I KIND OF REGRET NOT SAYING ANYTHING, BUT  I ALSO AT THE SAME TIME DON'T  BECAUSE I COULD HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE. >> Reporter: SO MARLEY, IF  PEOPLE ARE -- AREN'T SURE  WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD SPEAK OUT, WHAT'S YOUR BEST ADVICE TO  THEM? >> I THINK THE BEST THING YOU  CAN SAY IS HOW MUCH DO I KNOW  ABOUT THE SITUATION? I THINK ROSALIE DID A GREAT JOB  IN KNOWING THAT, OH, I DON'T  KNOW 100% ENOUGH TO GO IN AND  TRY TO STOP SOMETHING. BUT I CAN ASK AN ADULT WHO MAY  KNOW MORE. I THINK SHE DID A GREAT JOB. >> THANK YOU. >> Reporter: JOSH, TELL ME WHAT  WE SHOULD DO TO END RACISM. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? >> I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE ALL  THE SAME. WE'RE ALL PEOPLE. I THINK IT WILL BE OKAY AND  WE'LL BE FRIENDS AND IT'LL ALL  BE OVER. >> Reporter: DO YOU THINK WE  NEED TO HAVE OUR CIRCLES BIGGER  TO HAVE PEOPLE DIFFERENT AROUND  US? >> I 100% AGREE WITH THAT. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT  RACISM EXISTS AND THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE BLACK, OKAY TO BE WHITE,  OKAY TO BE PACIFIC ISLANDER. AND ALL THESE DIFFERENCES IS  WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY  BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING AND MAKES  US THE PEOPLE WE ARE. >> WOW. >> OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES. >> RIGHT? MARLEY, SHE'S THE OLDER ONE IN  THE GROUP, SHE SAID SHE LOVED  HEARING EVERYBODY. ALL THE KIDS SAID WE'RE THE  SAME, WE'RE THE SAME. SHE SAID, THEY'RE SO YOUNG, THEY DON'T SEE EVERYTHING YET BUT  THEY WILL. I FELT SO MUCH BETTER AFTER THE  INTERVIEW. I FELT LIKE THOSE ARE THE GUYS  THAT ARE GOING TO KIND OF BE IN  CHARGE EVENTUALLY. I SORT OF LIKED HEARING THEM. >> WE ARE IN A BIT OF A MESS  RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT  IF THOSE FIVE VOI 8:42 NOW WITH AN INSPIRING  GROUND BREAKER, SAVANNAH. >> YES, SHE IS. FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS. SHE'S A FORMER PROSECUTOR, A  MOTHER, AND ONCE CONFIRMED  SHE'LL BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN  TO SERVE ON NEW JERSEY'S SUPREME COURT. FIRST HER STORY. 39-YEAR-OLD FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS WASN'T ALWAYS SURE SHE WANTED TO BE A LAWYER, BUT NOW SHE'S A  JUDICIAL TRAIL BLAZER. >> IT IS EXTREMELY HUMBLING TO  BE NOMINATED AND I AM I DON'T  ENTHUSIASTIC. >> Reporter: GOVERNOR PHIL  MURPHY NOMINATING PIERRE-LOUIS  TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW  JERSEY. THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN IN ITS  HISTORY. >> THERE IS NO BETTER MEETING OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE TIMES. >> Reporter: THE LIEUTENANT  GOVERNOR, THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN  TO HOLD STATEWIDE OFFICE IN NEW  JERSEY SINGING HER PRAISES. >> SHE IS PROOF OF WHAT IS  POSSIBLE WHEN ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THEMSELVES TO WHAT OTHERS THINK  THEY CAN DO BECAUSE OF THEIR  STATION IN LIFE. >> Reporter: PIERRE-LOUIS HAS  TRAVELED A LONG ROAD TO REACH  THE STATE'S HIGHEST BENCH. HER PARENTS JOSEPH AND CLAIRE  EMIGRATED FROM HAITI. HE WORKED AS A CAB DRIVER. SHE WORKED IN A HOSPITAL. PIERRE-LOUIS STARTED LIFE IN A  CRAMPED BROOKLYN APARTMENT  SHARED WITH SEVEN RELATIVES  BEFORE HER FAMILY MOVED TO NEW  JERSEY. THERE SHE GRADUATED RUTGERS LAW  SCHOOL AND BECAME AN ASSISTANT  U.S. ATTORNEY HEADING UP OFFICES IN TRENTON AND CAMDEN. AND ON FRIDAY, SHE WALKED INTO  HISTORY. >> STANDING HERE TODAY, I KNOW  THAT I HAVE TRULY LIVED AND  CONTINUE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN  DREAM THAT MY PARENTS CAME TO  THIS COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF. >> AND FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS  JOINS US NOW. GOOD MORNING. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD CALL YOU  MADAM JUSTICE. BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT AND  GET CONFIRMED FIRST.  >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO GET THAT  CALL FROM GOVERNOR MURPHY AND  WHEN IT REALLY SOAKED IN, WHAT  THIS MEANS TO BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SERVE ON NEW JERSEY'S  SUPREME COURT? >> WELL, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO  BE NOMINATED TO THE STATE'S  HIGHEST COURT. I FEEL INCREDIBLY BLESSED AND I  AM FORTUNATE THAT GOVERNOR  MURPHY SAW IN ME THE EXPERIENCE  AND HAD THE FAITH IN ME TO  NOMINATE ME TO THE COURT. I PRACTICED PRIVATE PRACTICE,  PUBLIC SERVICE. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S SUCH A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY TO  SERVE THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. I BEGAN MY CAREER WITH THE  SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY AS A LAW CLERK TO JUSTICE JOHN  WALLACE JR. AND THE IDEA THAT I MAY ONE DAY  SIT IN THE SAME SEAT IS  UNBELIEVABLE. >> I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. I WONDER IN YOUR LAW CLERK DAY  IFS YOU EVEN LET YOURSELF DREAM  ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS? AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS? IMMIGRANTS FROM HAITI, THEY  EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM. WHAT DID THEY THINK WHEN YOU  TOLD THEM THE NEWS? >> MY PARENTS WERE SPEECHLESS. THEY'RE SO OVERJOYED AND SO  HAPPY AND SO PROUD. AND I THINK THERE WERE JUST SO  MANY EMOTIONS THAT THEY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE AFTER REALIZING  THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS  NOMINATION. SO THEY'RE JUST EXTREMELY PROUD  AND HAPPY. >> YOU KNOW, THIS NOMINATION WAS IN THE WORKS LONG BEFORE THIS  PARTICULAR CULTURAL MOMENT THAT  WE'RE IN. BUT YOU ARE AS THE GOVERNOR SAID SO WELL SUITED TO IT. YOU WORKED AS A FEDERAL  PROSECUTOR AND IN CHARGE OF THE  CRIMINAL DIVISION IN SOME OF THE TOUGHEST CITIES IN NEW JERSEY. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MOVEMENT  WILL MEAN TO THE SYSTEM? >> SO AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IT'S  INCREDIBLY HUMBLING AND AN HONOR TO BE NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME  COURT. IF CONFIRMED, IF I DO BREAK THAT BARRIER AND BECOME THE FIRST  BLACK WOMAN TO SIT ON THE COURT, I HOPE TO BE AN INSPIRATION TO  FUTURE GENERATIONS. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR  YOUNG PEOPLE TO SEE PEOPLE WHO  LOOK LIKE THEM, WHO HAVE SIMILAR BACKGROUNDS AS THEM IN  LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. SO I JUST TRULY HOPE TO BE AN  INSPIRATION TO OTHERS. AND I LOOK TO BRING A DIVERSE  PERSPECTIVE TO THE COURT. >> WELL, WE KNOW YOU'RE A HARD  WORKER. YOU'RE A MOM OF TWO YOUNG SONS. AS I SAID, YOU'VE BEEN  PRACTICING LAW ALL THESE YEARS. WHAT DO YOUR KIDS THINK ABOUT  MOM BECOMING A SUPREME COURT  JUSTICE? >> SO MY SONS ROBBIE AND MARK,  THEY'RE 7 AND 4 SO THEY DON'T  QUITE UNDERSTAND THE PARTICULARS OF THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM, BUT  THEY WERE THRILLED TO MEET THE  GOVERNOR ON FRIDAY AND THEY  THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY COOL TO  SEE THEMSELVES. AND THEY HAVE CONCEPT OF WHAT A  JUDGE IS, SO THEY THINK IT'S  PRETTY EXCITING. >> IT IS. FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS, THANK YOU  SO MUCH. I WAS GOING TO SAY MAYBE -- I  KNOW I'M A MOM OF LITTLE KIDS,  IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT  GAVEL AT HOME. SOMETIMES MOMS NEED TO LAY DOWN  THE LAW TOO. >> THAT'S FUNNY. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF  FOAM GAVELS AT HOME. SO THEY OFTEN JOKE AND BANG THE  FOAM GAVELS AND SAY ORDER IN THE COURT. THAT'S HOW I EXPLAIN TO THEM I  MIGHT BE BECOMING A JUDGE. >> OH, PERFECT. PERFECT. WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CONGRATULATIONS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW YOUR  INCREDIBLE STORY. WE REA   >>> GOOD MORNING. FACING JUSTICE. DEREK CHAUVIN, THE OFFICER IN  COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY. THIS MORNING WHAT THE CASE  AGAINST HIM MAY LOOK LIKE.

CHAUVIN STILL DECLINING TO  COMMENT. ONE DAY AFTER THE MAYOR WAS  BOOED FOR SUPPORTING THE POLICE. MANY OF THE CITY COUNCIL TALKED  ABOUT DEFUNDING THE DEPARTMENT. >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENGAGING  A PLAN TO CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. >> Reporter: WHETHER IT'S  DISMANTLING DEPARTMENTS OR  REINVESTING IN OTHER PARTS OF  DEPARTMENTS, DEMANDS ARE GROWING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

AND THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY THEY WANT INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC  AND IT COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR  TO FIGURE HOW THIS WOULD WORK. THE MAYOR HERE WANTS TO REFORM  THE DEPARTMENT, NOT ABOLISH IS. ONE IDEA BEING TOSSED AROUND IS  PERHAPS HIRE MORE COUNSELORS TO  DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH CALLS  INSTEAD OF SOLELY RELYING ON  POLICE. >> GABE GUTIERREZ, THANK YOU. >>> THE WEEKEND SAW SOME OF THE  LARGEST PEACEFUL PROTESTS YET  ALL ACROSS THE NATION.

WITH HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED AND  MORE THAN 16,000 CONFIRMED  CORONAVIRUS DEATHS IN NEW YORK  CITY ALONE. BUT AFTER A STRICT SHUTDOWN,  WIDELY AVAILABLE FREE TESTING,  AND INCREASED CONTACT TRACING.  THE CITY HAS MET THE CRITERIA  NEEDED FOR REOPENING. PHASE ONE MAY BE AS MANY AS  400,000 PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IN  THE BIG APPLE. COUNTRIES REOPENING MUST LIMIT  CAPACITY. FREQUENTLY CLEAN SHARED  SURFACES, SCREEN WORKERS FOR  SYMPTOMS, AND CREATE SOCIAL  DISTANCE MARKERS TO HELP  CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES STAY SIX FEET APART. >> IT'S BEEN SOUL CRUSHING. >> Reporter: MACKENZIE FARKWAY  SHUT DOWN HER FIVE SHOPS IN  MARCH. THIS MORNING SHE'S BACK OPEN FOR BUSINESS. WITH ITEMS UP FRONT SO CUSTOMERS CAN SHOP FROM THE SIDEWALK. >> I HOPE IT WILL BE SUPER BUSY. >> Reporter: BUT NATIONWIDE,  LOOSENED RESTRICTIONS MAY HAVE  CONTRIBUTED TO A SPIKE IN 18  STATES. AND REOPENING EFFORTS ARE  COMPLICATED BY THE SWEEPING  PROTESTS FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF  GEORGE FLOYD. >> WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO SEE  TRANSMISSION COMING OUT OF THESE GATHERINGS. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. >> Reporter: IN NEW YORK, THERE  WILL BE 15 SPECIFIC TESTING  SITES FOR PROTESTERS. >> IF WERE AT A PROTEST, ACT  RESPONSIBLY.

HEY, KRISTEN. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING TO  YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL MEET WITH  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS LATER  TODAY WITH HIS RESPONSE TO THE  CRISIS SURROUNDING GEORGE  FLOYD'S DEATH COMING UNDER NEW  SCRUTINY. IT COMES AS HE IS LOCKED IN AN  INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE RACE  WITH THE PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC  NOMINEE JOE BIDEN. THIS MORNING PRESIDENT TRUMP IS  FACING A GROWING CHORUS OF  CRITICISM FROM FORMER MILITARY  LEADERS. >> WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT  CONSTITUTION. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS DRIFTED  AWAY FROM IT. >> Reporter: OVER THE WEEKEND,  COLIN POWELL JOINING THAT LIST  AND BLASTING THE PRESIDENT. >> HE LIES. HE LIES ABOUT THINGS. AND HE GETS AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL NOT HOLD HIM  ACCOUNTABLE. >> Reporter: POWELL A FREQUENT  TRUMP CRITIC WHO SERVED FOUR  PRESIDENTS, THREE REPUBLICAN AND ONE DEMOCRAT, AND WHO VOTED FOR  HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016 ENDORSED JOE BIDEN OVER THE WEEKEND  GETTING EMOTIONAL TALKING ABOUT  WHAT HE SAYS HOW THE WORLD VIEWS THE UNITED STATES.  >> ARE WE INSULTING EVERYBODY?

THIS IS WHO WE ARE. AND THE WORLD DOESN'T  UNDERSTAND. >> Reporter: MR. TRUMP FIRED  BACK CALLING POWELL HIGHLY  OVERRATED. AS FOR THE 2020 RACE, IN OUR  LATEST NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET  JOURNAL\" POLL, BIDEN LEADS TRUMP NATIONALLY 49% TO 42%. THAT'S UNCHANGED FROM APRIL'S  POLL.

AS THE SYSTEM PUSHES TO THE  NORTH, WE ARE GOING TO BE  WATCHING THIS MAKE ITS WAY -- IN FACT, IT'S THE SECOND EARLIEST  LANDFALL ON RECORD. THE RECORD WAS ARLENE BACK IN  1959. NOW, THIS SYSTEM WILL PUSH TO  THE NORTH BRINGING SOAKING RAINS TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY  MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH WISCONSIN AND ON INTO THE U.P. OF  MICHIGAN. THERE'S ONLY TWICE BEFORE BEEN A TROPICAL REMNANT LOW PASS ACROSS WISCONSIN. AND ONLY ONCE BEFORE OVER  MICHIGAN. SO THIS IS A RARE SITUATION,  INDEED. HEAVY RAIN AS YOU GET INTO THE  MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. LOCALLY 5 INCHES OF RAIN.

IN THE MEANTIME, NINE MEMBERS OF THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL  AGREED YESTERDAY TO DISMANTLE  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND  REPLACE IT WITH A COMMUNITY  BASED PUBLIC SAFETY MODEL. >>> A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR NEW  ZEALAND THIS MORNING. OFFICIALS SAY THE COUNTRY HAS  ELIMINATED THE CORONAVIRUS AND  IS LIFTING ALL DOMESTIC  RESTRICTIONS. PRIME MINISTER JACINDA ARDERN  SAID SHE DID A LITTLE DANCE UPON HEARING THAT. THE COUNTRY HAD NO ACTIVE CASES. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EVENTS CAN  RESUME WITHOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS. STRICT BORDER CONTROLS WILL  REMAIN IN PLACE THOUGH. >>> BREAKING OVERNIGHT.

ROGER GOODELL RELEASED THIS  STATEMENT. >> WE THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL  LEAGUE CONDEMN RACISM AND THE  OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE. WE THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE  ADMIT WE WERE WRONG FOR NOT  LISTENING TO NFL PLAYERS EARLIER AND ENCOURAGE ALL TO SPEAK OUT  AND PEACEFULLY PROTEST. >> Reporter: THE EXACT SAME  LANGUAGE STAR NFL PLAYERS ASKED  THE LEAGUE TO USE THE DAY  BEFORE. >> WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. >> IT SHOULDN'T TAKE THIS LONG  TO ADMIT. >> Reporter: GOODELL'S MESSAGE  OF UNITY COMES AFTER ONE OF THE  NFL'S BIGGEST STARS EXPOSED THE  LEAGUE'S DEEP DECISIONS. >> I WILL NEVER AGREE WITH  ANYBODY DISRESPECTING THE FLAG  OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. >> Reporter: DREW BREES  APOLOGIZED TWICE AFTER HE SAID  PLAYERS SHOULDN'T PROTEST POLICE BRUTALITY AND INJUSTICE DURING  THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. >> I AM SORRY. ANDLY DO BETTER. >> Reporter: THE NEW ORLEANS  SAINTS QUARTERBACK ALSO  PROMISING TO DO BETTER AND BE  PART OF THE SOLUTION. PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW GOING AFTER  GOODELL OVERNIGHT TWEETING,  COULD IT BE REMOTELY POSSIBLE  THAT GOODELL WAS INTIMATING IT  WILL BE OKAY FOR PLAYERS TO  KNEEL? AND SAYING BREES SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN BACK HIS ORIGINAL STANCE. BREES HITTING BACK. TO DONALD TRUMP, THROUGH MY  ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH  FRIENDS, TEAMMATES, AND LEADERS  IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, I  REALIZE THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE  ABOUT THE AMERICAN FLAG. THE PRESIDENT ECHOING HIS  COMMENTS IN 2016 WHEN COLIN  KAEPERNICK TOOK A KNEE  PROTESTING POLICE BRUTALITY. KAEPERNICK NEVER PLAYED IN THE  NFL AGAIN AFTER THAT SEASON. >> USUALLY TAKEN OUT OF  REVERENCE. >> Reporter: NATE BOYER IS THE  PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR  SUGGESTING KNEELING AS A PROTEST TO KAEPERNICK.  >> KNEELING WAS BORN OUT OF A  MIDDLE GROUND, YOU KNOW? TWO PEOPLE THAT DISAGREED ON A  LOT, BUT TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE  WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION  AND LISTEN. >> SO STEPH, GOODELL DIDN'T  ADDRESS THE KNEELING DURING THE  ANTHEM, BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE  UPCOMING SEASON AND THOSE  PROTESTS? WHAT WILL WE SEE? >> Reporter: YEAH, HODA. HIS STATEMENT IS VAGUE ALTHOUGH  A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE INTERPRETED IT AS A GREEN LIGHT FOR  KNEELING. YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN A  HANDFUL OF PLAYERS WHO SAY WHEN  THEY COME BACK, THAT'S EXACTLY  WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO  INCLUDING RUNNING BACK ADRIAN  PETERSON. HE THINKS THAT KNEELING COULD  POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES AND >>> WE ARE BACK. 7:40 NOW WITH IN-DEPTH TODAY. >> THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  IS APPLYING NEW PRESSURE ON  PRINCE ANDREW THIS MORNING TO  TESTIFY AS PART OF ITS CRIMINAL  INVESTIGATION. \"TODAY'S\" KEIR SIMMONS IS IN  LONDON WITH THE BREAKING  DETAILS. HI, KEIR. GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: HEY, SAVANNAH. GOOD MORNING. A SENSATIONAL FRONT PAGE TO THE  SUN NEWSPAPER HERE THIS MORNING. YANKS HAND ANDY OVER. PERHAPS INEVITABLY BEING A  BRITISH TABLOID, THAT HEADLINE  IS A LITTLE EXAGGERATED BUT U.S. INVESTIGATORS ARE FORMALLY  ASKING TO SPEAK TO PRINCE  ANDREW. FOR SUCH A HIGH PROFILE FIGURE,  MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ROYAL  FAMILY, THAT IS RARE. THIS MORNING PRINCE ANDREW  FACING A FORMAL REQUEST TO SPEAK WITH NEW YORK FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS AS PART OF THEIR  INVESTIGATION INTO SEXUAL ABUSE  BY HIS LATE FRONT JEFFREY  EPSTEIN. THE QUEEN'S SON WILL BE  INTERVIEWED AS A WITNESS. HE STAYED WITH EPSTEIN IN NEW  YORK AND THE U.S. VIRGIN  ISLANDS. A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE  MATTER TELLS NBC NEWS THE  APPLICATION HAS BEEN MADE UNDER  A U.S./UK TREATY. SARAH FERGUSON POSTED THIS  SAYING, SO PROUD OF OUR LOVING  FAMILY. BUT IN AN INTERVIEW IN DECEMBER, VIRGINIA CLAIMED SHE WAS  TRAFFICKED BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN  AND ABUSED BY PRINCE ANDREW WHEN SHE WAS 17 JUST DAYS AFTER THIS  PICTURE WAS TAKEN. >> IT WAS REALLY A SCARY TIME IN MY LIFE. I HAD JUST BEEN ABUSED BY A  MEMBER OF A ROYAL FAMILY. >> Reporter: PRINCE ANDREW SAYS  HE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF  MEETING HER. HIS OWN INTERVIEW LAST YEAR WAS  WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT EPSTEIN. >> HE HAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY  CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN A MANNER  UNBECOMING, YES. >> UNBECOMING? HE WAS A SEX OFFENDER.  >> YES. I'M SORRY, I'M BEING POLITE. >> Reporter: AND HE WOULD ONLY  SAY HE MIGHT TALK TO  AUTHORITIES. >> IF PUSH CAME TO SHOVE AND THE LEGAL ADVICE WAS TO DO SO, THEN  I WOULD BE DUTY BOUND TO DO SO. >> Reporter: A SOURCE CLOSE TO  HIS LEGAL TEAM TELLING NBC NEWS  LEGAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DOJ  ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT  CONFIDENTIALITY RULES WHICH IS  WHY WE'VE MADE NO COMMENT. AND THIS MORNING, NO WORD FROM  BUCKINGHAM PALACE WHICH NO  LONGER REPRESENTS PRINCE ANDREW  SINCE HE STEPPED DOWN AS A  WORKING ROYAL. >> KEIR, IF PRINCE ANDREW  DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE,  WHY NOT JUST AGREE TO THE  INTERVIEW WITH AUTHORITIES? >> Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT  QUESTION. HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO GIVE  EVIDENCE UNDER OATH, BUT THAT  SAID YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT  YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHEN  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGAL  CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TAKING  PLACE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS,  PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS. WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS. THAT SAID, THE OPTICS ARE  TERRIBLE FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY,  AREN'T THEY? ONE FINAL NOTE. PRINCE ANDREW'S TELEVISION  INTERVIEW LAST YEAR, WIDELY  BELIEVED TO HAVE GONE REALLY,  REALLY BADLY. PERHAPS HIS LEGAL ADVISERS ARE  CONCERNED ABOUT HOW IT WOULD GO  IF 7:49 WITH \"TODAY\" CELEBRATES THE CLASS OF 2020.

A COOL DANCE. >> YOU'VE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN PURSUIT OF YOUR DREAMS AND  NOTHING, NOT EVEN A GLOBAL  PANDEMIC IS GOING TO KEEP YOU  FROM THE FUTURES YOU'VE IMAGINED FOR YOURSELF. >> EVERY OBSTACLE IS REALLY AN  OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN, TO GROW,  AND TO CHANGE. >> PERFORMANCES INCLUDED A  RENDITION OF U2'S \"BEAUTIFUL  DAY.\" AND A ZOOM BOMB BY MARIAH CAREY  AS THE CAST OF \"SCHITT'S CREEK\"  PERFORMED. SOCIAL MEDIA LIT UP WITH PRAISES OF THE EVENT. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE SPEECHES  WERE RECORDED BEFORE THE DEATH  OF GEORGE FLOYD, SEVERAL  ADDRESSED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF  THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT  AND ENCOURAGED GRADUATES TO RISE UP FOR CHANGE. >> WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR  COLLECTIVE HEARTS WHEN PUT TO  POSITIVE ACTION CAN START  CHANGE. REAL CHANGE HAS STARTED WITH  YOU. >> YOU ARE THE SEEDS THAT WILL  GROW INTO A NEW AND DIFFERENT  FOREST THAT IS FAR MORE  BEAUTIFUL AND LOVING THAN THE  ONE WE LIVE IN TODAY. >> OUR OWN JENNA BUSH HAGER HAD  THESE WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT. >> AND WHEN THE WORLD OPENS UP  AGAIN, WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE  BETTER THAN BEFORE. THE WORLD WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE OF YOU. >> Reporter: WHILE ALICIA KEYS  URGED THE GRADS TO STRIVE FOR  GREATNESS. >> YOU ARE GRADUATES IN THE MOST POWERFUL TIME TO BE COMING OF  AGE. AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN  STOP YOU FROM CHANGING THE  WORLD. >> GUYS, ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE DEAR CLASS OF 2020 IS THAT  WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SOCIAL  MEDIA PRETTY MUCH UNANIMOUSLY  ALL AGREED SOMETHING WAS  AMAZING? IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. SO THAT'S JUST SMALL PROOF OF  HOW IMPRESSIVE THIS OVER  FOUR-HOUR PRODUCTION WAS. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A SENIOR, IT  IS WORTH GOING BACK TO YOUTUBE  TO REVISIT AS THE MESSAGES OF  HOPE AND CAMARADERIE AND  INSPIRATION WERE ABUNDANT AND IT WAS POWERFUL. VERY WELL DONE. >> THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. I FEEL LIKE >>> IT'S 8:00 ON \"TODAY.\" COMING UP, DAY IN COURT.

THEY PLEDGED TO DISBAND THE  DEPARTMENT. >> WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT  HITTING THE EJECT BUTTON ON THE  POLICE TOMORROW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENGAGING A  PLAN TO CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY  SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. >> Reporter: WHETHER IT'S  DISMANTLING DEPARTMENTS OR  REINVESTING IN OTHER TYPES OF  PROGRAMS, GROWING CALLS ARE  BEING HEARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN NEW YORK CITY, MAYOR BILL de  BLASIO IS MOVING SOME FUNDS FROM POLICE TO YOUTH AND SOCIAL  SERVICES. >> WE ARE COMMITTED TO SHIFTING  RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THE  FOCUS IS ON OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. >> Reporter: IN LOS ANGELES,  MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IS PLEDGING  TO CUT AS MUCH AS $150 MILLION  FROM THE POLICE BUDGET. CRITICS OF DEFUNDING SAY LESS  MONEY WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. >> DEFUNDING IS A NICE CATCH  PHRASE. BUT IN REALITY YOU'RE DEFUNDING  POLICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOR  THE MOST PART ARE ALREADY  SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED. >> Reporter: BACK IN  MINNEAPOLIS, A LAWYER FOR  ANOTHER OFFICER INVOLVED SAID  FLOYD RESISTED ARREST. EARL GREY REPRESENTS THOMAS LANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN A COP FOR FOUR DAYS. >> HE WAS DOING WHAT HE THOUGHT  WAS RIGHT. >> Reporter: LANE IS NOW ACCUSED OF AIDING AND ABETTING  SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOUR  CLIENT STOOD BY AND WATCHED FOR  NEARLY NINE MINUTES? >> HE DID NOT STAND BY AND  WATCH. HE WAS HOLDING THE LEGS BECAUSE  THE GUY WAS RESISTING AT FIRST. NOW, WHEN HE'S HOLDING HIS LEGS, HE SAYS TO CHAUVIN SHOULD WE  ROLL HIM OVER BECAUSE HE SAYS HE CAN'T BREATHE. CHAUVIN SAYS NO. >> Reporter: THE TENSIONS  FUELING PEACEFUL PROTESTS OVER  THE WEEKEND. >> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP MARCHING  AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO. >> Reporter: FROM NEW YORK  SQUARE TO THE STREETS OF  HOLLYWOOD TO WASHINGTON, D.C.'S  NEWLY DUBBED BLACK LIVES MATTER  PLAZA TO PHILADELPHIA WHERE AMID THE DEMONSTRATIONS, ANOTHER KIND OF UNITY. AND THAT WAS QUITE AN EMOTIONAL  SCENE. BACK HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS, THERE  ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT  HOW DEFUNDING THE POLICE WILL  WORK. THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS IT IS  ASKING FOR INPUT FROM THE  PUBLIC, BUT IT COULD TAKE UP TO  A YEAR BEFORE THEY COULD FIGURE  OUT HOW THAT WOULD WORK. >> ALL RIGHT. GABE GUTIERREZ IN MINNEAPOLIS. >>> LET'S GO TO THE PANDEMIC. THE OVERALL NEW NUMBERS OF  COVID-19 CASES HAS DROPPED IN  THE U.S., BUT AT LEAST 20 STATES HAVE SEEN AN ALARMING UPTICK IN  RECENT WEEKS. SAM BROCK IS IN MIAMI BEACH WITH MORE ON THAT. HEY, SAM, GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: HODA, GOOD MORNING. THERE'S BEEN MORE TESTING. THAT COULD PARTLY EXPLAIN THE  HIGHER NUMBERS, BUT BUSINESSES  HAVE BEEN REOPENING. EVER SINCE MEMORIAL DAY, WE'VE  SEEN LARGE GATHERINGS OF CROWDS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING  MASSIVE PROTESTS FOR GEORGE  FLOYD. HERE IN FLORIDA, THE LAST FIVE  DAYS HAVE BROUGHT THE BIGGEST  SPIKE IN CASES SINCE MID-APRIL. AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING TO BEAT  BACK CORONAVIRUS --  >> I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS. >> Reporter: -- A WAVE OF  BUSINESSES REOPENING, BEACHES  BUZZING, AND PROTESTS ERUPTING  ARE TAKING A TOLL. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI SAYING THE  LARGE GATHERINGS POSE A  SIGNIFICANT THREAT. >> IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE  BECAUSE THE REASONS FOR  DEMONSTRATING ARE VALID. AND YET THE DEMONSTRATION ITSELF PUTS ONE AT ADDITIONAL RISK. >> Reporter: THIS MORNING 20  STATES SHOWING AN UPWARD SWING  IN CASE OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. TEXAS, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, AND  MISSOURI AMONG THEM. A RISE STRETCHING BACK TO A VERY SOCIAL MEMORIAL HOLIDAY.  >> WHETHER IS NICE OUTSIDE,  PEOPLE START TO GO BACK OUTSIDE. WE DID RELAX A LOT OF OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING IN THOSE STATES AND  HERE WE GO. STATES START TO PICK UP. >> NO JUSTICE! >> NO PEACE! >> Reporter: MASSIVE  DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH  OF GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH ONLY  HEIGHTENING CONCERNS. A NEW NBC NEWS/\"WALL STREET  JOURNAL\" POLL SHOWS 66% OF  RESPONDENTS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE  ATTENDING A PUBLIC GATHERING OR  AN EVENT WITH A LARGE GROUP. EVEN AS SOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS STEP OUT INTO THE STREETS TO  PROTEST INJUSTICE. >> I DON'T KNOW THAT COVID IS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND OUT THERE. IT'S THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED AND  NOTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN. >> Reporter: A POWERFUL MOVE  SWEEPING THE NATION AS NEW YORK  CITY REOPENS ITS ECONOMY FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY. >> WE ARE GOING TO OPEN 15 SITES THAT ARE DEDICATED JUST TO  PROTESTERS TO GET A TEST ON AN  EXPEDITIOUS BASIS. BUT PLEASE GET A TEST. >> Reporter: TESTING IN COLLEGE  SPORTS ALSO RAISING RED FLAGS AS ATHLETES RETURN FOR PRESEASON  TRAINING. ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE REPORTS,  SEVERAL UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA  FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAVE THE VIRUS  AND AUBURN UNIVERSITY  ACKNOWLEDGES THREE OF ITS  PLAYERS TESTED POSITIVE TOO. AN OKLAHOMA STATE LINEBACKER  TWEETING AFTER ATTENDING A  PROTEST AND BEING WELL  PROTECTIVE OF MYSELF, HE HAS  COVID-19. AND THAT PLAYER ALSO TWEETING HE WAS COMPLETELY ASYMPTOMATIC. THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IS  ARGUABLY THE MOST PROMINENT  FOOTBALL PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVE NOT CONFIRMED YET  THOSE CASES OF CORONAVIRUS BUT  HAVE SAID HEALTH AND SAFETY OF  STUDENT ATHLETES IS THEIR TOP  PRIORITY AND THEY'RE ENSURING  THOSE ATHLETES GET THE BEST  POSSIBLE MEDICAL CARE WHEN THEY  RETURN TO CAMPUS. >> SAM BROCK IN MIAMI. THANK YOU. >>> THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE  DEVELOPMENT IN THE SEARCH FOR A  HIDDEN TREASURE THAT WE'VE BEEN  TELLING YOU ABOUT FOR YEARS. SOMEONE HAS APPARENTLY CLAIMED  THE FORREST FENN TREASURE WORTH  MILLIONS. GADI SCHWARTZ HAD SPENT TIME  LOOKING FOR IT AS WELL. CLEARLY IT WASN'T GADI THAT  FOUND THE TREASURE BECAUSE HE  JOINS US THIS MORNING WITH THE  LATEST. HEY, GADI. >> Reporter: HEY, CRAIG. THANKS FOR RUBBING IT IN. WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEONE  WAS ABLE TO SOLVE ALL NINE CLUES IN THAT CRYPTIC POEM THAT  FORREST FENN WROTE. BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO FORREST FENN OVER THE PHONE, HE SAID HE WAS  PARTLY RELIEVED, PARTLY SADDENED BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN HIS  MIND THAT HIS TREASURE HAS BEEN  FOUND. SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS  NORTH OF SANTA FE, AN 11th  CENTURY TREASURE BOX FILLED WITH MILLIONS WORTH OF GOLD AND  ANTIQUITIES HAS BEEN FOUND. ONLINE A COMMUNITY IS GOING  WILD. FORREST FENN IS AN 89-YEAR-OLD  ART COLLECTOR WHO STASHED THE  TREASURE TEN YEARS AGO IN AN  EFFORT TO GET PEOPLE OFF THEIR  COUCHES INTO THE GREAT OUTDOORS. NOW TELLING ME BY PHONE A MAN  FROM BACK EAST DECIPHERED THE  CLUES. >> THE END IS EVER DRAWING NEAR. >> Reporter: BUT SO FAR FORREST  HAS BEEN MUM ON THE IDENTITY  SAYING IT'S OVER WHEN THE  PICTURE WAS SENT TO HIM OF THE  TREASURE. AND IT WAS UNDER A CANOPY OF  STARS IN THE LUSH FOREST OF THE  VEGETATION OF THE ROCKY  MOUNTAINS. IT COMES AFTER YEARS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND THE CHEST. WHICH FOR ME STARTED IN SANTA FE AS ONE OF THE FIRST TO COVER THE MODERN DAY TREASURE HUNT. SINCE THEN, THOUSANDS HAVE  SHARED THEIR OWN QUESTS LIKE RAY AND CHLOE HARP WHO SAY IT'S  BROUGHT THEM CLOSER AS A FAMILY. >> IT'S BROUGHT US TOGETHER OUT  IN NATURE, OUT IN SUNSHINE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT FORREST  WANTED. IT GAVE US A PERSPECTIVE OF THE  WORLD THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL  NEVER FORGET. >> Reporter: TODAY HEARING THE  NEWS IS BITTERSWEET. >> IT FEELS LIKE THE LAST PAGE  OF OUR FAVORITE BOOK. >> Reporter: BUT THE STORY  HASN'T BEEN WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT  DANGER. THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS  RESCUES AND AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE HAVE DIED WHILE SEARCHING IN  TREACHEROUS TERRAIN. AUTHORITIES LONG EARLY MORNING  FENN TO CALL OFF THE SEARCH  DESPITE FENN'S INSISTENCE THAT  IT WAS IN A SPOT A 70-YEAR-OLD  MAN COULD REACH. BUT TODAY THAT EXACT LOCATION  STILL A MYSTERY. THE FINDER HAS WISHED TO REMAIN  ANONYMOUS. I GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS WHOLE  TREASURE HUNT WAS VERY CLOSE TO  MY HEART. IN TEN YEARS I SPENT A LOT OF  TIME LOOKING FROM NEW MEXICO TO  YELLOWSTONE. I WAS CONVINCED IT WOULD BE OUT  THERE FOR CENTURIES EVEN THOUGH  ONE TIME FORREST TOLD ME I CAME  WITHIN A COUPLE MILES OF THE  BOX. I THOUGHT I COULD TAKE MY GRAND  KIDS OUT THERE. BUT NOW THE MYSTERY HAS SHIFTED  TO WHO FOUND IT AND HOW THEY  SOLVED ALL THOSE CLUES. SAVANNAH? >> GADI, I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T  GET YOUR POT OF GOLD. BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, WE GET TO  KEEP YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. >> Reporter: THAT'S TRUE. VERY TRUE. >> YEAH. SILVER LINING FOR US. >>> ALSO THIS MORNING, WE'RE  KEEPING AN EYE ON THE STORM  CRISTOBAL WHICH MADE LANDFALL AS A TROPICAL STORM IN LOUISIANA  YESTERDAY. 50 MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS. THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER  HAS NOW DOWNGRADED THE STORM TO  A TROPICAL DEPRESSION. THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE  HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING AS FAR  NORTH AS WISCONSIN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. >>> 12 MINUTES AFTER THE HOUR,  ONLY ONE THING TO DO NOW. A COUPLE OF MORNING BOOSTS,  HODA. >> LET'S DO IT. A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT NAMED  JARED WAS NOT GOING TO LET THE  CORONAVIRUS RUIN THE HIGHLIGHT  OF HIS SENIOR YEAR WHICH IS, OF  COURSE, GRADUATION. SO WHEN IT WAS CANCELED, HE  DECIDED TO HOLD A LITTLE  CEREMONY OF HIS OWN. CHECK IT OUT. GO, GO, GO. NEIGHBORS WERE HONKING THEIR  HORNS. HE HAD A RED CARPET ROLLED OUT. THAT LITTLE STAGE ON THE FRONT  LAWN, HE PUT ON A GOOD SHOW. HE EARNED THAT CAP AND GOWN AND  HE'S NOT GOING TO LET ANYBODY  FORGET THAT. >> NO. HE KNOWS HOW TO PUT ON A MOMENT. >>> ALL RIGHT, CRAIG. YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS ONE. IT'S A DAD STORY. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOUR KID  GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO CREATE A  LIFETIME MEMORY AND YOU JUST  HAVE TO GO WITH IT NO MATTER HOW MESSY. TAKE A LOOK. >> COME HERE. HOLD MY HAND. >> HOW CUTE IS THAT? THE SHOES ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE  SOGGY AND THE PANTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LAUNDRY,  LIKE, TWICE. BUT ONE DAY ALL THAT LITTLE GIRL .  GOING TO >> AND THAT'S YOUR LATEST  WEATHER. GUYS? >> ALL RIGHT, AL. THANK YOU. >>> NOW TO THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF OUR SERIES ACROSS THE  PLATFORMS OF NBC NEWS FOCUSING  ON INEQUALITY IN AMERICA. >> MORE THAN 50 MILLION KIDS GO  TO PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THIS  COUNTRY, BUT THE EDUCATION THEY  RECEIVE, IT VARIES WIDELY. SOMETIMES FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND  OFTEN FOR THE WRONG REASONS. >> NBC'S LEGAL CORRESPONDENT  CYNTHIA McFADDEN HAS OUR REPORT  THIS MORNING. HEY, CYNTHIA. GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. WELL, PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE USED TO MAKING DO AS ONE SUPERINTENDENT  WROTE RECENTLY HE'D NEVER SEEN A BAKE SALE FOR A BANK OR AN  AIRLINE AND YET SCHOOLS OFTEN  OPERATE ON JUST FUMES. YOU KNOW, IN WAYNE COUNTY,  MICHIGAN, WHEN THE CORONAVIRUS  HIT, ONCE AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS  CAME INTO SHARP VIEW. WAYNE COUNTY, THE SIXTH HARDEST  HIT COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. IT BECAME CLEAR SOME STUDENTS  HAD COMPUTERS. MANY DID NOT. KENNEDY CAIN IS A FIGHTER. AND THAT'S LUCKY BECAUSE AT 16,  SHE'S NOT ONLY A STRAIGHT-A.  STUDENT AT ONE OF THE THE BEST  SCHOOLS IN DETROIT, SHE'S  RUNNING A SCHOOL ON A SINGLE  COMPUTER FOR SIX SIBLINGS. NEARLY A MONTH WITHOUT ANY  ASSIGNMENTS, HER SCHOOL LAUNCHED AN ONLINE PLATFORM. BUT KENNEDY SAYS THAT HASN'T  MADE IT EASIER. >> NOT ONLY IS THIS NEW TO US,  BUT IT'S NEW TO THE TEACHERS AS  WELL. AND SOMETIMES THE TEACHERS HAVE  DIFFICULTIES WHEN THEY ARE  TRYING TO PROGRAM IT. AND THEN THEY ASSIGN IT AS IF  THEY KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS  AVAILABILITY OR THE OPPORTUNITY  TO HAVE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR HOME WHEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SO IT'S KIND OF FRUSTRATING. >> Reporter: WHEN SCHOOLS  CLOSED, ONLY 10% OF DETROIT  PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS HAD  ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AND THE  INTERNET. WHICH IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO DR. NIKOLAI VITI. HE BECAME SUPERINTENDENT  INHERITING A SYSTEM LONG ON  PROMISE AND SHORT ON RESOURCES. SO DR. VITI, WHAT WAS THE STATE  OF THE DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOL  SYSTEM BEFORE CORONAVIRUS? >> ENROLLMENT WAS UP FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT DEFINED BY  STATE AND NATIONAL TEST SCORES  SHOWED IMPROVEMENT. >> Reporter: EQUALLY IMPORTANT,  THE TEACHER VACANCY RATE WHICH  HAD DOGGED THE CITY HAD IMPROVED BY 75%.  >> GOD PUT ME ON THIS EARTH TO  KEECH. I LOVE IT. >> Reporter: CASEY EDGAR TEACHES 11th GRADE MATH AT KING HIGH. SHE SAYS MOST OF HER NEARLY 150  STUDENTS ARE LESS AND LESS  COMMITTED TO SCHOOL. >> HOW COME YOUR CAMERA'S NOT  ON? THE FIRST WEEK I WAS IN TOUCH  WITH 50% TO 60%. NOW IT'S RUNNING AT ABOUT 20%. >> Reporter: WHAT PERCENTAGE OF  YOUR STUDENTS DO YOU THINK ARE  ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK? LIKE, RIGHT ABOUT 10%. >> Reporter: THAT'S NOT VERY  MANY.  >> NO. NOT VERY MANY AT ALL. >> Reporter: LIKE MANY PLACES  AROUND THE COUNTRY, LITTLE  LEARNING HAS TAKEN PLACE FOR  DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS  SINCE MARCH. >> INSTEAD OF ADDING OR  SUBTRACTING, WE'RE GOING TO BE  MULTIPLYING. >> Reporter: THERE'S NO DENYING  THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE IN  AMERICA. JUST SEVEN MILES FROM DOWNTOWN  DETROIT, THE GROSSE POINTE SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL HAD A COMPUTER IN  EVERY KIDS' HANDS WHO NEEDED ONE IMMEDIATELY AFFECT SHUTDOWN. >> I WAS ISSUED A LAPTOP RIGHT  AFTER SCHOOL ENDED. >> Reporter: XAVIER PRATER IS A  DEDICATED STUDENT. >> WE JUST LOG IN AND GO TO OUR  REMOTE LEARNING RESOURCES. >> Reporter: XAVIER WILL BE A  SENIOR NEXT YEAR AND DREAMS OF  GOING TO UCLA. HE IS WELL ON HIS WAY WITH LOTS  OF SUPPORT. LITTLE SURPRISE, PARTICIPATION  IN ONLINE CLASSES IN GROSSE  POINTE IS 95%. MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS JUST A  ZIP CODE AWAY IN DETROIT WHERE  IT'S ONLY 50%. A REFLECTION SOME SAY OF DEEPLY  ROOTED SYSTEMIC RACISM. THE NUMBERS TELL AT LEAST PART  OF THE STORY. IN DETROIT, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD  INCOME IS ABOUT $30,000. THE POPULATION IS NEARLY 80%  BLACK. IN GROSSE POINTE, MEDIAN INCOME  IS JUST OVER $100,000 WITH A  BLACK POPULATION OF 2%. SO IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN  DETROIT A RACIAL DIVIDE AS WELL? >> ABSOLUTELY. THE HAVES ARE RECEIVING MORE  THAN THE HAVE NOTS. WE ALREADY KNOW CHILDREN ARE  COMING IN AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH FEWER RESOURCES THAN MIDDLE  CLASS, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS  STUDENTS. BUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  SHOULD BE THE EQUALIZER IN  GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  CHILDREN. BUT INSTEAD IT EXACERBATES THE  DIVIDE THAT ALREADY EXISTS. >> Reporter: DETROIT IS GETTING  A BIG BOOST WITH A $23 MILLION  GIFT FROM LOCAL BUSINESSES TO  GIVE EVERY STUDENT A LAPTOP. BUT THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL  SUMMER LONG AFTER THE SCHOOL  YEAR ENDS. >> WE CAN ANTICIPATE MOST  STUDENTS LOSING SIX MONTHS OF  WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD  WE BEEN IN SCHOOL. >> Reporter: SIX MONTHS BEHIND  CAN BE A KNOCKOUT PUNCH FOR KIDS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH AN  ACHIEVEMENT GAP. NOT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS  SMART, NOT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T  WILLING TO WORK AS HARD. JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE. >> GROSSE POINTE IS RIGHT NEXT  TO US AND THEY HAVE -- THEY GOT  RESOURCES THE SECOND THIS  PANDEMIC STARTED. THIS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM ISN'T  LACKING AS MUCH AS WE ARE. AND IT'S LIKE, WOW. WHY CAN'T WE BE LIKE THAT OR WHY CAN'T WE STEP IN AND GIVE TO OUR STUDENTS LIKE THEY ARE? BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS ARE NO  DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS. >> Reporter: SO I ASKED KENNEDY  WHERE HER INCREDIBLE COURAGE AND HER WISDOM CAME FROM. SHE SAYS HER WORKING MOTHER WHO  SHE CALLS A SUPERHERO. AND ONE FINAL POINT, BROWN AND  HARVARD DID A STUDY AFTER THE  CORONAVIRUS HIT OF MATH AROUND  THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT JUST  UNDER A MILLION STUDENTS. HERE'S WHAT THEY FOUND. IN THE POORER ZIP CODES, THE  MATH LEARNING HAD BEEN REDUCED  BY ABOUT 50%. AND IN THE WEALTHIEST ZIP CODES, NO LEARNING LOSS. >> EVEN IF THE KIDS GET THESE  LAPTOPS, WHAT ABOUT THE DIGITAL  DIVIDE AS IT PERTAINS TO DIGITAL ACCESS AS WELL? >> Reporter: THAT'S PART OF IT. THESE LAPTOPS ARE GOING TO COME  WITH INTERNET ACCESS BECAUSE  THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A PROBLEM. >> I REMEMBER WE DID THAT STORY  OF THAT FAMILY THAT ACTUALLY GOT IN THEIR CAR AND DROVE TO WHERE  THERE WAS INTERNET ACCESS. BUT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT  PEOPLE LIVE BLOCKS APART AND  HAVE THAT DISPARITY. THAT WAS FASCINATING, CYNTHIA. THANK YOU. >>> 8:30 NOW ON A MONDAY  MORNING. IT IS THE EIGHTH DAY OF JUNE  2020. AND JUST AHEAD IN THIS HALF  HOUR, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WISE  BEYOND THEIR YEARS HAD A  CONVERSATION WITH SOME  REMARKABLE KIDS ON RACE IN  AMERICA. AND MAKING SENSE OF EVERYTHING  THAT'S HAPPENING. THESE KIDS ARE AGING 10, 11, 12, ALL THE WAY UP TO 15. YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR HOW THEY'RE  PUTTING THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE. >> I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME STUFF  TO LEARN FROM THEM FOR SURE. I CANNOT WAIT TO SPEAK TO THE  FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO BE ELECTED  TO NEW JERSEY'S SUPREME COURT. SHE HAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO  TELL. >>> WE'VE GOT AN INSPIRATIONAL  HALF HOUR LINED UP. BUT BEFORE THAT, MR. ROKER, HOW  ABOUT A FINAL CHECK OF THAT  WEATHER, FINE SIR. >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT THE WEEK AHEAD. WE'RE STARTING OFF TODAY WITH  WHAT'S GOING ON THROUGH THE  LOWER GULF WITH CRISTOBAL AS IT  MAKES ITS WAY TOWARDS THE WEST. SUNNY AND PLEASANT IN THE  NORTHEAST. THEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE  MID-WEEK PERIOD, SEVERE STORMS  MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE EASTERN  GREAT LAKES. WET WEATHER ALL THE WAY DOWN  INTO FLORIDA. NICE AND DRY THROUGH THE PLAINS. THE WARMTH CONTINUES ON THE WEST COAST. THEN AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE END  OF THE WEEK, COASTAL STORMS  DEVELOP DOWN ALONG THE ATLANTIC  COAST. HOT AND HUMID FROM TEXAS ALL THE WAY INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI  RIVER VALLEY. COOL AND DAMP INTO THE PACIFIC  NORTHEAST. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND  THE COUNTRY. HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR  NECK OF THE WOODS. >> AND THAT'S YOUR LATEST  WEATHER. HODA? >> ALL RIGHT, AL. THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP NEXT, THE NEW  VOICES JOIN THE CONVERSATION ON  RACE IN AMERICA. >> WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT  IT'S OKAY TO BE BLACK. IT'S OKAY TO BE WHITE. IT'S OKAY TO BE PACIFIC  ISLANDER. ALL OF THESE THINGS IS WHAT  MAKES THE COUNTY BEAUTIFUL AND  AMAZING AND THE PEOPLE WE ARE. >> HOW IMPRESSIVE IS MARLEY? WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO AWESOME  YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GIVE US HOPE  FOR THE FUTURE. BUT FIRST, THIS IS \"TODAY\" ON  NBC. >>> WELCOME BACK ON THIS MONDAY  MORNING. HODA, YOU'VE HAD INTERESTING  PERSPECTIVE ON ALL THE SCENES  WE'VE SEEN IN OUR COUNTRY. >> I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY THE  IMAGES OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE  PROTESTING AND CALLING FOR  CHANGE. A LOT OF ADULTS LOSE SIGHT OF  THE BIG PICTURE SO WE LIKE TO  TAKE LESSONS FROM KIDS WHO HAVE  A WAY OF SEEING THINGS MORE  CLEARLY. >> NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE! >> I CAN'T BREATHE! >> Reporter: ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AMERICANS ARE RISING UP TAKING A STAND DEMANDING CHANGE. >> NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE! >> Reporter: NEW VOICES. KIDS WHO UNDERSTAND THE SIMPLE  TRUTHS THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN  ARE CREATED EQUAL. TO BETTER HEAR THOSE VOICES, I  ASKED A FEW OF TOMORROW'S  LEADERS TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP FIX THINGS  TODAY. HI, GUYS. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK  YOU. YOU ARE SMART PEOPLE, SMART  KIDS. AND WE NEED SMART KIDS RIGHT  NOW. WE NEED Y'ALL TO HELP US OUT OF  THIS MESS WE'RE IN. OKAY? CAN Y'ALL HELP US? >> YES. >> Reporter: FIRST THERE'S  11-YEAR-OLD ROSALIE WHOSE  FAVORITE SWEATSHIRT SAYS IT ALL. SEVENTH GRADE BUDDIES LOGAN,  JOSH, AND AIDAN HAVE A  RELATIONSHIP THAT'S COLOR BLIND. AND THEN THERE'S MARLEY, A  15-YEAR-OLD ACTIVIST WHO  CAMPAIGNED TO GET THOUSANDS OF  BOOKS ABOUT BLACK GIRLS INTO  SCHOOLS. OKAY, MARLEY, I'M GOING TO START WITH YOU. GIVE ME YOUR REACTION TO WHAT  YOU SEE GOING ON OUTSIDE RIGHT  NOW. >> WELL, THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE  LIVING IN IS KIND OF FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT FEELS AS THOUGH IT'S  AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE THAT LOOK  LIKE ME, WHICH IS REALLY SCARY  AND DISAPPOINTING. >> Reporter: AIDAN, WHEN YOU  LOOK OUT AT WHAT'S GOING ON ON  THE STREETS, HOW DOES IT MAKE  YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF? >> I FEEL IN DANGER LIKE I'M  BEING HUNTED BECAUSE I'M  DIFFERENT. AND I FIND THAT JUST  UNACCEPTABLE. >> Reporter: WHY DO YOU FEEL  THAT WAY, HONEY? >> BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BEING  BRUTALLY MURDERED FOR NO REASON. >> Reporter: AIDAN, DO YOUR  PARENTS EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT  THE WAY YOU SHOULD ACT WHEN  YOU'RE IN PUBLIC? >> THEY ALWAYS SAY BE CAREFUL,  KNOW YOUR RIGHTS, AND NEVER  DISRESPECT A POLICE OFFICER. >> Reporter: BE CAREFUL, KNOW  YOUR RIGHTS, NEVER DISRESPECT A  POLICE OFFICER. HAVE YOU EVER FELT INTIMIDATED  WHEN YOU WERE WALKING AROUND? >> YEAH. >> Reporter: LIKE, GIVE ME AN  EXAMPLE. >> LIKE, WHEN I WAS WALKING MY  DOG PHINEAS, IT WAS NIGHT SO I  DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO COME UP  TO ME THINKING THAT'S AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOY AT NIGHT. >> Reporter: DOESN'T THAT MAKE  YOU SICK? >> EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE, WHY? WE'RE ALL THE SAME. >> Reporter: LOGAN, WHEN YOU  LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING  ON, DO YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYBODY'S FIGHTING ABOUT? >> I THINK THEY'RE FIGHTING  ABOUT POLICE BRUTALITY. ALSO YESTERDAY MY DAD SAID YOU  DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE  BLACK UNTIL YOU WALK A MILE IN  MY SHOES. AND HE SAID IT BECAUSE I REALLY  DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT IS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE CLENCHING THEIR BAGS WHEN YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET. HE SAYS IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. >> ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I  PERSONALLY SAW OR WITNESSED  INEQUITY WAS WITH MY OWN HAIR  WHEN I GOT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. A LOT OF THE KIDS AT SCHOOL  WOULD SAY IT WAS TAKING UP TOO  MUCH SPACE AND THEY WANTED ME TO SIT IN THE BACK OR THAT IT WAS  DIRTY. AND THESE THINGS WERE, LIKE,  SUPER FRUSTRATING. BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IT WAS  COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL. >> Reporter: WELL, YOUR HAIR IS  GORGEOUS. >> I LOVE YOUR HAIR. >> Reporter: ROSALIE, DID  SOMETHING HAPPEN AT CAMP? >> YES. >> Reporter: TELL ME ABOUT THAT. >> I SAW SOME PEOPLE FROM A  DIFFERENT CABIN, THEY WERE  TALKING -- THEY WERE SAYING HOW  THEY DIDN'T WANT TO STAY WITH  KIDS BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. AND AT THE TIME I DIDN'T REALLY  SAY ANYTHING TO THEM AT THE TIME BUT I TALKED TO MY COUNSELORS. AND SOMETIMES -- LIKE, I KIND OF REGRET NOT SAYING ANYTHING, BUT  I ALSO AT THE SAME TIME DON'T  BECAUSE I COULD HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE. >> Reporter: SO MARLEY, IF  PEOPLE ARE -- AREN'T SURE  WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD SPEAK OUT, WHAT'S YOUR BEST ADVICE TO  THEM? >> I THINK THE BEST THING YOU  CAN SAY IS HOW MUCH DO I KNOW  ABOUT THE SITUATION? I THINK ROSALIE DID A GREAT JOB  IN KNOWING THAT, OH, I DON'T  KNOW 100% ENOUGH TO GO IN AND  TRY TO STOP SOMETHING. BUT I CAN ASK AN ADULT WHO MAY  KNOW MORE. I THINK SHE DID A GREAT JOB. >> THANK YOU. >> Reporter: JOSH, TELL ME WHAT  WE SHOULD DO TO END RACISM. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? >> I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE ALL  THE SAME. WE'RE ALL PEOPLE. I THINK IT WILL BE OKAY AND  WE'LL BE FRIENDS AND IT'LL ALL  BE OVER. >> Reporter: DO YOU THINK WE  NEED TO HAVE OUR CIRCLES BIGGER  TO HAVE PEOPLE DIFFERENT AROUND  US? >> I 100% AGREE WITH THAT. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT  RACISM EXISTS AND THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE BLACK, OKAY TO BE WHITE,  OKAY TO BE PACIFIC ISLANDER. AND ALL THESE DIFFERENCES IS  WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY  BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING AND MAKES  US THE PEOPLE WE ARE. >> WOW. >> OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES. >> RIGHT? MARLEY, SHE'S THE OLDER ONE IN  THE GROUP, SHE SAID SHE LOVED  HEARING EVERYBODY. ALL THE KIDS SAID WE'RE THE  SAME, WE'RE THE SAME. SHE SAID, THEY'RE SO YOUNG, THEY DON'T SEE EVERYTHING YET BUT  THEY WILL. I FELT SO MUCH BETTER AFTER THE  INTERVIEW. I FELT LIKE THOSE ARE THE GUYS  THAT ARE GOING TO KIND OF BE IN  CHARGE EVENTUALLY. I SORT OF LIKED HEARING THEM. >> WE ARE IN A BIT OF A MESS  RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT  IF THOSE FIVE VOI 8:42 NOW WITH AN INSPIRING  GROUND BREAKER, SAVANNAH. >> YES, SHE IS. FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS. SHE'S A FORMER PROSECUTOR, A  MOTHER, AND ONCE CONFIRMED  SHE'LL BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN  TO SERVE ON NEW JERSEY'S SUPREME COURT. FIRST HER STORY. 39-YEAR-OLD FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS WASN'T ALWAYS SURE SHE WANTED TO BE A LAWYER, BUT NOW SHE'S A  JUDICIAL TRAIL BLAZER. >> IT IS EXTREMELY HUMBLING TO  BE NOMINATED AND I AM I DON'T  ENTHUSIASTIC. >> Reporter: GOVERNOR PHIL  MURPHY NOMINATING PIERRE-LOUIS  TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW  JERSEY. THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN IN ITS  HISTORY. >> THERE IS NO BETTER MEETING OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE TIMES. >> Reporter: THE LIEUTENANT  GOVERNOR, THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN  TO HOLD STATEWIDE OFFICE IN NEW  JERSEY SINGING HER PRAISES. >> SHE IS PROOF OF WHAT IS  POSSIBLE WHEN ONE DOES NOT LIMIT THEMSELVES TO WHAT OTHERS THINK  THEY CAN DO BECAUSE OF THEIR  STATION IN LIFE. >> Reporter: PIERRE-LOUIS HAS  TRAVELED A LONG ROAD TO REACH  THE STATE'S HIGHEST BENCH. HER PARENTS JOSEPH AND CLAIRE  EMIGRATED FROM HAITI. HE WORKED AS A CAB DRIVER. SHE WORKED IN A HOSPITAL. PIERRE-LOUIS STARTED LIFE IN A  CRAMPED BROOKLYN APARTMENT  SHARED WITH SEVEN RELATIVES  BEFORE HER FAMILY MOVED TO NEW  JERSEY. THERE SHE GRADUATED RUTGERS LAW  SCHOOL AND BECAME AN ASSISTANT  U.S. ATTORNEY HEADING UP OFFICES IN TRENTON AND CAMDEN. AND ON FRIDAY, SHE WALKED INTO  HISTORY. >> STANDING HERE TODAY, I KNOW  THAT I HAVE TRULY LIVED AND  CONTINUE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN  DREAM THAT MY PARENTS CAME TO  THIS COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF. >> AND FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS  JOINS US NOW. GOOD MORNING. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD CALL YOU  MADAM JUSTICE. BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT AND  GET CONFIRMED FIRST.  >> YES, ABSOLUTELY. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO GET THAT  CALL FROM GOVERNOR MURPHY AND  WHEN IT REALLY SOAKED IN, WHAT  THIS MEANS TO BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SERVE ON NEW JERSEY'S  SUPREME COURT? >> WELL, IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO  BE NOMINATED TO THE STATE'S  HIGHEST COURT. I FEEL INCREDIBLY BLESSED AND I  AM FORTUNATE THAT GOVERNOR  MURPHY SAW IN ME THE EXPERIENCE  AND HAD THE FAITH IN ME TO  NOMINATE ME TO THE COURT. I PRACTICED PRIVATE PRACTICE,  PUBLIC SERVICE. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S SUCH A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY TO  SERVE THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. I BEGAN MY CAREER WITH THE  SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY AS A LAW CLERK TO JUSTICE JOHN  WALLACE JR. AND THE IDEA THAT I MAY ONE DAY  SIT IN THE SAME SEAT IS  UNBELIEVABLE. >> I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. I WONDER IN YOUR LAW CLERK DAY  IFS YOU EVEN LET YOURSELF DREAM  ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS? AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS? IMMIGRANTS FROM HAITI, THEY  EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM. YOU EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM. WHAT DID THEY THINK WHEN YOU  TOLD THEM THE NEWS? >> MY PARENTS WERE SPEECHLESS. THEY'RE SO OVERJOYED AND SO  HAPPY >>> THANK YOU SPEAKER PELOSI  AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE JOINED  BY SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES,  SENATORS BOOKER AND HARRIS,  REPRESENTATIVES --, NADLER AND  JEFFRIES, JOINING US AND  SPEAKING THIS MORNING AND FOR  ALL THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE  FROM SO MANY WONDERFUL PEOPLE  BEHIND US.  OVER THE PAST WEEK HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAVE  ENGAGED IN PEACEFUL  DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST POLICE  VIOLENCE AND SYSTEMIC RACISM.  THIS LARGE DIVERSE GROUP, SO  MANY OF THEM YOUNG, GIVES US  HOPE THAT AMERICANS ARE  APPEARED TO, ARE PREPARED TO  MARCH AND MAKE THIS A MORE  PERFECT UNION ONCE AND FOR ALL.  SO TODAY WE ARE TAKING THE  FIRST OF MANY STEPS, ANY  NECESSARY STEPS TO RESPOND TO  THIS NATIONAL PAIN WITH BOLD  ACTION.  AS MY COLLEAGUES WILL EXPLAIN  THE JUSTICE AND POLICING ACT  POSES CRUCIAL REFORMS TO COMBAT  RACIAL VIOLENCE AND EXCESSIVE  FORCE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A  STRONG TRANSPARENCY MEASURES,  IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS TO  POLICE TRAINING AND PRACTICE.  THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE  AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.  IN THE SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE  GOING TO FIGHT LIKE TO MAKE  THIS A REALITY.   AMERICANS WHO TOOK THE STREETS  THIS WEEK HAVE DEMANDED CHANGE.  WITH THIS LEGISLATION DEMOCRATS  ARE HEEDING THEIR CALL.  NOW WE MUST COLLECTIVELY, ALL  AMERICANS, RAISE OUR VOICES AND  CALL ON LEADER McCONNELL TO PUT  THIS REFORM BILL ON THE FLOOR  OF THE SENATE BEFORE JULY.  TO BE DEBATED AND VOTED ON.  AS SOME SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE  ACKNOWLEDGED EGREGIOUS WRONGS,  A FEW HAVE EXPRESSED A NEED FOR  FLOOR ACTION.  TOO MANY HAVE REMAINED SILENT.  THEY BE THEY ARE HOPING THE  ISSUE GOES AWAY, I PROMISE THEM  IT WILL NOT.  DEMOCRATS WILL NOT LET THIS GO  AWAY AND WE WILL NOT REST UNTIL  WE ACHIEVE REAL REFORM.  LEADER McCONNELL LET'S HAVE THE  DEBATE, NOT JUST ON TV AND  TWITTER BUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE  UNITED STATES SENATE.  A DIVIDED NATION CANNOT WAIT  FOR HEALING.  THE POISON OF RACISM AFFECTS  MORE THAN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE  SYSTEM, IT RUNS MUCH DEEPER  THAN THAT, THERE ARE RACIAL  DISPARITIES SEEDS IN HOUSING,  INCOME, WEALTH, AND COVID HAS  ONLY PLACED A MAGNIFYING GLASS  ON THEM.  IT IS OUR JOB, OUR JOB AS  REPRESENTATIVES OF AN IMPERFECT  UNION TO WRITE THOSE WRONGS,  RING THE REALITY AND PROMISE OF  AMERICA INTO CLOSER ALIGNMENT,  EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW IS ONE  SUCH PROMISE.  THAT'S WHAT THIS MORNING AND  THE JUSTICE AND POLICING ACT IS  ALL ABOUT, THE CENTURIES LONG  STRUGGLE TO MAKE THOSE WORDS  ACTUALLY TRUE.  FOR BLACK AMERICANS, AND EVERY  AMERICAN.  CONGRESSMAN HOYER? >>> THESE ARE SERIOUS TIMES. I HAVE WALKED ACROSS THE  INDEPENDENCE BRIDGE 15 TIMES  HAND-IN-HAND WITH MY BROTHER.  MY GRANDCHILDREN HAVE BEEN  THERE AND MY DAUGHTERS HAVE  BEEN THERE.  IN SELMA IN 2015 PRES.  OBAMA ASKED US THIS.  WHAT GREATER FORM OF PATRIOTISM  IS THERE THEN THE BELIEF THAT  AMERICA IS NOT YET FINISHED?  THAT WE ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO BE  SELF-CRITICAL, THAT EACH  SUCCESSIVE GENERATION CAN LOOK  UPON OUR IMPERFECTIONS AND  DECIDE THAT IS IN OUR POWER, TO  REMAKE THIS NATION TO MORE  CLOSELY ALIGN WITH OUR HIGHEST  IDEALS.  THAT IS WHAT THE BOSTON  TEA PARTY WAS ABOUT, A  DEMONSTRATION, SOME BRITONS  WOULD SAY A VIOLATION OF LAW.  TO ADDRESS RIGHTS.  WE REMAIN A NATION OF  IMPERFECTIONS CALLING OUT TO US  TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THE  SERIOUSNESS AND DETERMINATION  TO MAKE GOOD ON THE PROMISE.  THE PROMISE THAT ALL ARE  CREATED EQUAL.  ALL ENTITLED TO LIFE, LIBERTY  AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  AND THE RIGHT TO BREATHE.  THE RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR LIVES  MATTER.  WE'VE HEARD OUR PEOPLE CRY OUT,  I CAN'T BREATHE.  WE'VE HEARD OUR PEOPLE SPEAK  OUT, BLACK LIVES MATTER.  BLACK LIVES MATTER.  THE PROTESTS WE'VE SEEN IN  RECENT DAYS ARE AN EXPRESSION  OF RAGE BORN OF DESPAIR.  TODAY, DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE  AND SENATE ARE SAYING WE SEE  YOU.  WE HEAR YOU.  WE ARE ACTING -- THANK YOU LEADER PELOSI AND  LEADER SCHUMER, THANK YOU BLACK  CAUCUS, THE KILLING MUST STOP.  THE CARTAGE MUST END.  THAT BEGINS WITH TRANSPARENCY  AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS THIS  BILL WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY  AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT NATIONWIDE BY A ONE  REQUIRING STATE AND LOCAL LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO COLLECT  AND REPORT DATA.  -- INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  STRUCTURES FOR POLICE INVOLVED  IN DEATHS.  IN CREATING BEST PRACTICE  RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S 21st  CENTURY POLICING TASK FORCE.  THIS LEGISLATION MAKES IT CLEAR, THAT POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE  SERVING AND ARE INTEGRAL TO ALL  THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR  COMMUNITIES INCLUDING AFRICAN- AMERICANS.  I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES  WHO HAVE BEEN LEADING THIS  EFFORT IN THE HOUSE, GENTLEMAN  BASS, CHAIRMAN NADLER, AND SEN.  HARRIS, WE KEEP IN OUR MINDS  TODAY THE WORD OF OUR DEAR  DEPARTED CAR LEAGUE ELIJAH  CUMMINGS.  WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS.  AND NOW, IT'S MY PRIVILEGE TO  INTRODUCE A FORMER MAYOR OF A  GREAT CITY IN OUR COUNTRY, A  REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF  NEW JERSEY AND A LEADER IN THIS  EFFORT, SEN.  CORY BOOKER.  WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. >>> WE IN AMERICA ARE ONE  PRECIOUS NATION BUT WE HAVE A  WILDLY DIFFERENT SET OF  EXPERIENCES WITH POLICE.  WHERE BLACK AMERICANS LIVE IN  FEAR OF POLICE INTERACTION  DISPROPORTIONATELY HAVING OUR  COMMON IDEALS OF FAIRNESS  TRAMPLED.  BLACK AMERICANS  DISPROPORTIONATELY HAVE OUR  RIGHTS VIOLATED.  THE BLACK AMERICANS  DISPROPORTIONATELY AND  UNJUSTIFIABLY HAVE VIOLENCE,  EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AT HANDS OF  THE POLICE.  WE ARE BLACK AMERICANS, UNARMED, AND WE ARE KILLED BY POLICE IN  GRIEVOUS AND WRETCHED -- AND  THIS MOMENT IN AMERICA  KNOWLEDGE OF THIS AND  ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THIS IS  NECESSARY BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH.  EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY AND WORDS  OF CARING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE  DIED AND SUFFERED ARE NECESSARY  BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.  HAVING A NATION THAT IN ALL 50  STATES, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS  HAVE, OF ALL AGES, RELIGIOUS  AND RACIAL BACKGROUNDS, ARE  STANDING UP IN NONVIOLENT  PROTESTS, AND THEY'VE MADE THIS  MOMENT POSSIBLE.  BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.  WE MUST CHANGE LAWS.  AND SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY.  WE MUST PASS LEGISLATION THAT  MAKES OUR COMMON VALUES AND OUR  COMMON IDEALS REAL IN THE LAW  OF THE LAND.  THIS BILL FOCUSES ON  ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY  IN POLICING.  SPECIFICALLY THE FEDERAL  STATUTE THAT GOVERNS POLICE  MISCONDUCT, SECTION 242, THE  CHANGES, THE DIFFICULT  STATUTORY STANDARD OF  WILLFULNESS MAKING IT, THAT  MAKES HOLDING POLICE  ACCOUNTABLE TO DIFFICULT.  AND IT CHANGES THAT STANDARD  FOR BEING WILLFUL TO BEING  RECKLESS DISREGARD.  IT ALSO ESTABLISHES TRANSPARENCY MAKING CERTIFICATION  REQUIREMENTS THAT VARY BY  LOCATION WHERE CITIES AND TOWNS  DO NOT SHARE CRITICAL  INFORMATION WITH EACH OTHER  MAKING IT FAR TOO EASY FOR  PROBLEMATIC OFFICERS TO BE  FIRED IN ONE TOWN AND REHIRED  IN ANOTHER, THIS BILL WILL  CLOSE A DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE BY  CREATING THE FIRST EVER  NATIONAL REGISTRY OF POLICE  MISCONDUCT TO BETTER RECORD AND  TRACK POLICE ABUSES AND GIVE  TRANSPARENCY TO LOCAL CITIZENS  HELPING TO CREATE THE NECESSARY  ACCOUNTABILITY.  I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP  OF SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER  SCHUMER, I WANT TO THANK THE  HEAD OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK  COMPUT CAUCUS AND ALL THE  MEMBERS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS, I  WANT TO THANK MY PARTNER KAMALA  HARRIS AND HER LEADERSHIP  FOR  MAKING THIS LEGISLATION  SWEEPING AND HISTORIC AND NOW  WE MUST DEAL WITH THE WORK OF  MAKING IT THE LAW OF THE LAND,  TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY AND  POWER, THE EMPATHY AND LOVE OF  THIS MOMENT INTO ACTUAL CHANGES  IN AMERICAN FEDERAL LAW.  I'M HONORED TO BRING UP MY  COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND,  MY  SISTER AND PARTNER SEN.  KAMALA HARRIS.  >>> THANK YOU BROTHER COREY.  THANK YOU TO SPEAKER PELOSI AND  LEADER SCHUMER, CHAIR KAREN  BASS, MY BROTHER CORY BOOKER,  CHAIRMAN NADLER, CHAIRMAN  JEFFRIES AND EVERYONE.  FOR THE WORK THAT SO MANY OF  YOU HAVE BEEN DOING FOR  DECADES.  FOR DECADES.  SHOUTING, AND PASSING LEGISLATION OR WRITING  LEGISLATION AND REQUIRING THAT  AMERICA TAKES SERIOUSLY THIS  ISSUE OF POLICING AND TAKE  SERIOUSLY THE ISSUE THAT WHEN  PEOPLE ARE MARCHING IN THE  STREETS IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE  FULLY AWARE OF THE HISTORY OF  THIS ISSUE IN AMERICA AND  THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH.  SO I THANK ALL THE LEADERS HERE  FOR WHAT YOU DO AND WE ARE HERE  BECAUSE BLACK AMERICANS WANT TO  STOP BEING KILLED.  JUST LAST WEEK WE COULDN'T EVEN  PASS AN ANTILYNCHING BILL IN  THE U.S. SENATE.  SO, WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE WE  ARE NOW WITH THIS PIECE OF  LEGISLATION WE HAVE TO  UNDERSTAND YES, AS A COUNTRY WE  CELEBRATE PROGRESS BUT JUST  LAST WEEK IN THE YEAR OF OUR  LORD 2020 WE COULD NOT GET AN  ANTI-LYNCHING BILL PASSED.  IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.  BUT WE ARE HERE TODAY WITH  COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS.  AT LEAST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL  TO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE BUT  WE KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT  IS NOT JUST AT THE FEDERAL  LEVEL.  IT IS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL  LEVELS AS WELL BUT WE ARE HERE  TODAY TO SAY IN OUR POSITION AS  LEADERS, IN OUR FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT, THAT PERFORM AND  CHANGE, REFORM AND CHANGE MUST  HAPPEN AND IT MUST HAPPEN NOW  AND LET'S BE CLEAR, REFORMING  POLICING IS IN THE BEST  INTEREST OF ALL AMERICANS.  IT IS LITERALLY IN THE BEST  INTEREST OF ALL AMERICANS.  BECAUSE THIS IS A BASIC MATTER  OF JUSTICE.  BUT TO BE CLEAR ALSO, THERE IS  A BROADER ISSUE THAT IS NOT  BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL.  AND THAT IS WHAT WE MUST DO AS  A NATION TO TRULY ACHIEVE SAFE  AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES.  PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN UPSIDE  DOWN IN POLICING POLICY IN  AMERICA IS THAT WE HAVE CONFUSED HAVING SAFE COMMUNITIES WITH  HIRING MORE COPS ON THE STREET.  AS THOUGH THAT IS THE WAY TO  ACHIEVE SAFE COMMUNITIES.  WHEN IN FACT, THE REAL WAY TO  ACHIEVE SAFE AND HEALTHY  COMMUNITIES IS TO INVEST IN  THOSE COMMUNITIES.  AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IN THE  ABILITY OF HOMEOWNERSHIP, JOBS,  FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS TO CAPITAL  SO THEY CAN ROW SMALL  BUSINESSES THAT ARE PART OF THE  LEADERSHIP AND THE HEALTH OF  THESE COMMUNITIES.  SO A BILL THAT ADDRESSES A VERY  SPECIFIC MATTER, UNDER A LARGER  UMBRELLA OF ALL THAT MUST BE  ADDRESSED.  WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR  SAFETY SAFETY IN  COMMUNITIES, THIS IS  SPECIFICALLY A BILL ABOUT  ACCOUNTABILITY, FOR BAD  BEHAVIOR FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VESTED WITH SOCIETY AND THE  PEOPLE WITH THE ABILITY TO WEAR  A BADGE AND CARRY A GUN.  AND LET'S BE CLEAR, MANY IN  AMERICA RIGHT NOW ALREADY LIVE  IN PLACES WITH MINIMAL POLICE  PRESENCE.  GO TO ANY MIDDLE AND UPPER  CLASS SUBURB AND YOU WILL NOT  SEE THE KIND OF PRESENCE OF  POLICE THAT YOU  SEE IN OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS.  BUT YOU WILL ALSO SEE IN THOSE  COMMUNITIES THAT THOSE FAMILIES  HAVE JOBS, THAT ALLOW THEM TO  PAY THE BILLS AND KEEP A ROOF  OVER THERE HAD.  YOU WILL ALSO SEE IN THOSE  COMMUNITIES DRIVING SCHOOLS,  YOU WILL ALSO SEE IN THOSE  COMMUNITIES ACCESSIBLE  HEALTHCARE AND FAMILIES CAN  AFFORD ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SO  WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY IS  SAYING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE  CONSEQUENCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY  IN AMERICA FOR POLICING BUT WE  ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE  WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO  ACHIEVE HEALTHY AND SAFE  COMMUNITIES, IT IS BUT A PART  OF A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE THAT WE  STILL MUST ADDRESS.  IN CLOSING I WILL JUST MENTION  A FEW OF THE OTHER POINTS IN  THE BILL THAT ARE VERY  IMPORTANT AND I SAY THIS AS A  FORMER PROSECUTOR.  WE NEED NATIONAL SUPPORT AND  RIGHT NOW THE QUESTION ASKS IF  THERE IS MISCONDUCT, TO ASK  THAT YOU SUPPORT WHAT IS  REASONABLE FOR AS WE ALL KNOW  WE CAN REASON AWAY JUST ABOUT  ANYTHING.  THE APPROPRIATE QUESTION TO ASK  IS WAS IT NECESSARY.  SO PART OF WHAT I WILL ADDRESS  IS A NATIONAL USE OF FORCE  STANDARD, INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATIONS AND AGAIN AS A  FORMER PROSECUTOR I CAN SAY  THAT NO MATTER HOW WELL- INTENTIONED THE PROSECUTOR OF  THE DAS OFFICE, WHEN THEY ARE  CONFRONTED IN DEALING WITH  MISCONDUCT BY A POLICE OFFICER  WHO SERVED IN THE DEPARTMENT  THEY WORK WITH EVERY DAY, AT  THE VERY LEAST THERE WILL BE AN  APPEARANCE OF PROSECUTION EVEN  WHEN NONE IS ATTENDED.  IF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS GOING  TO BE ROBUST AND REAL IT MUST  NOT ONLY DO JUSTICE, THERE MUST  BE AN APPEARANCE OF JUSTICE.  AND CONFIDENCE BY THE PUBLIC  THAT JUSTICE IS BEING DONE IN  THAT PLACE SO AN INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATION IS THE LAST PIECE  THAT I WILL ADD, THE PATTERN  AND PRACTICE -- UNDER PRES.  OBAMA AND UNDER GENERAL HOLDER  THESE WERE ROBUST.  WHEN THERE WAS A FINDING OR AN  ACCUSATION THAT THERE WAS A  PATTERN IN PRACTICE WITHIN A  LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD DO AN  INVESTIGATION.  WHILE THOSE UNDER THIS  ADMINISTRATION HAVE PRACTICALLY  BEEN SHUT DOWN, THEY NEED TO BE  REINSTATED BUT ALSO WHAT WE ARE  SAYING IS IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S  BEEN DONE IN THE PAST WE WILL  GROW ON THAT PROGRESS BUT GIVEN  THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION OF  THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,  SUBPOENA POWER, SO POLICE  DEPARTMENTS WHO DO NOT COMPLY  WITH REQUESTS WILL BE REQUIRED  TO DO SO BY RESPONDING TO A  SUBPOENA.  SO MY FINAL POINT IS AGAIN THAT  IT IS TIME FOR THIS AND I AM SO  HEARTENED BY ALL OF THE  COLLEAGUES WE HAVE IN THE  UNITED STATES SENATE LIKE  LEADER SCHUMER WHO HAVE BANDED  TOGETHER IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND  THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE.  I WILL NOW INTRODUCE -- I WOULD  LIKE TO BRING UP MR. JIM CARVER. >>> THANK YOU MDM.  CHAIR, SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER  SCHUMER.  LEADER HOYER.  ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS.  THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY. FOR  LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.  WHEN I WAS A KID IN A LITTLE  TOWN IN CENTRAL SOUTH CAROLINA  WE SAID THE PLEDGE EVERY  MORNING.  -- ENVISIONED THE ALL NEW TOWN  BUT IT WAS SIMPLY A VISION.  WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO PUT  TOGETHER, OUR RESPONSE -- I  SAID ON THE TELEPHONE, THIS  GIVES US A TREMENDOUS  OPPORTUNITY TO RESTRUCTURE  THINGS TO THAT VISION.  -- I WAS ATTACKED FOR WANTING  LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.  BY VARIOUS MEDIA.  I'M GOING TO BACK AWAY FROM  THAT.  WE ARE HERE TODAY IN SEARCH OF  THAT VISION, LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.  -- IN THIS LEGISLATION, I WANT  TO SEE TO JUST -- I WANT TO SAY  TWO THINGS, FIRST THOSE WHO ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RIOTING AND  SECONDLY TO THOSE WHO ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR WRITING ABOUT IT LET ME SAY THIS.  WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS BLACK  PEOPLE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY  WILLINGLY.  IN SEARCH OF A NEW WORLD.  FULL OF LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE  FOR ALL.  THE FEW EXCEPTIONS, BLACK  PEOPLE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY  AGAINST THEIR WILL.  SHAMED, SHACKLED, THEY CAME TO  THIS SHORE ENSLAVED.  AND STAYED THAT WAY FOR 244  YEARS.  THINK ABOUT IT.  THINK ABOUT HOW LONG THAT IS.  HOW MANY GENERATIONS.  IT'S A LONG TIME, EIGHT MINUTES. THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE ON MY  KNEES.  BUT FOR 244 YEARS -- THERE WERE  PLENTY KNEES ON THE NEXT OF THE  BLACKS WHO CAME TO THIS  COUNTRY.  SO AS WE WRITE THIS LEGISLATION  AND AS YOU WRITE ABOUT THIS  LEGISLATION, PLEASE KEEP THOSE  TWO DIVERGENT SETS OF  EXPERIENCES IN MIND.  WE ARE STILL IN SEARCH OF A  MORE PERFECT UNION.  WE WILL ALWAYS BE IN SEARCH OF  A MORE PERFECT UNION, WE MUST  NOT ALLOW ANY FORCE IN WHATEVER  OFFICE SOMEONE HOLDS, TO TURN  THE CLOCK BACK.  ON THAT PURSUIT.  AND WITH THAT I AM PLEASED TO  INTRODUCE THE CHAIR THE  JUDICIARY, DURING NADLER.  JERRY NADLER. >>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING MY  DEAR FRIEND KAREN BASS THE  CHAIR OF THE BLACK CAUCUS AND  CHAIR OF THE CRIME SUBCOMMITTEE  ALONG WITH SENATORS BOOKER AND  HARRIS AND OUR DISTINGUISHED  LEADERSHIP FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS  PARTNERSHIP IN PRODUCING THIS  IMPORTANT LEGISLATION, IT HAS  BEEN INSPIRING TO WALK  ALONGSIDE OF ALL OF THEM  THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.  WE HAVE HEARD THE TERRIFYING  WORDS, I CAN'T BREATHE FROM  GEORGE FLOYD, FROM ERIC GARNER,  FROM THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS  IN THE STREETS CALLING OUT FOR  REVENGE FOR CHANGE.  OUR HEARTS ACHE FOR THE LOSS OF  GEORGE FLOYD, BREANNA TAYLOR,  ERIC GARNER, AND MANY OTHER  VICTIMS OF THE VIOLENCE OVER  THE YEARS.  EVERY INCIDENT OF EXCESSIVE  FORCE THAT MAKES HEADLINES, THE  UGLY TRUTH IS THAT THERE ARE  COUNTLESS OTHERS THAT WE NEVER  HEAR ABOUT.  WE VALUE AND RESPECT THE MANY  BRAVE AND HONORABLE POLICE  OFFICERS WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON  THE LINES EVERY DAY TO PROTECT  OUR COMMUNITY BUT WE CANNOT BE  LYING, FOR THEIR RACISM THAT  PERVADES FAR TOO MANY OF OUR  LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, THIS  IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT  REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE  SOLUTION.  IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO WORK  WITH THE CRITIC NATIONAL BLACK  CAUCUS AND THE -- THE  CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND  OTHERS FOR THIS POLICING ACT, A  HISTORIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION  THAT IS BOLD, TRANSFORMATIVE  AND RESPONSIBLE LEGISLATION TO  FINALLY AND CHOKEHOLD AT THE  FEDERAL LEVEL, HELP END RACIAL  PROFILING, GET WEAPONS OF WAR  OFF THE STREETS, HOLD POLICE  ACCOUNTABLE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY, INCREASE TRANSPARENCY, AND  REQUIRE AND ENCOURAGE GREATER  USE OF BODY CAMERAS.  BECAUSE ALL OF THIS IS ALSO  ADDRESSING ISSUES ON THE FRONT  END, BY ENSURING THAT LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ADHERE TO  THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN  TRAINING, HIRING AND DE- ESCALATION STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM AND BIAS AND TO  CHANGE THE CULTURE OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA AND  ULTIMATELY TO SAVE LIVES.  TO CREATE THE FIRST EVER  NATIONAL ACCREDITATION  STANDARDS FOR THE OPERATION OF  POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND IT  CREATES DEVELOPMENT AND  TRAINING PROGRAMS TO ESTABLISH  BEST PRACTICES BASED ON PRES.  OBAMA'S TASK FORCE AND 21ST- CENTURY POLICING.  IT ALSO REINVENTS OUR  COMMUNITIES AND EMPOWERS THEM  TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF POLICING  THROUGH GRANTS AND COMMUNITY- BASED ORGANIZATIONS, THROUGH  TASK FORCES AND POLICING  INNOVATION.  ON WEDNESDAY OF THIS WEEK THE  HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL  HOLD A HEARING ON THE CRISIS OF  RACIAL PROFILING, POLICE  BRUTALITY AND THE LOST TRUST  BETWEEN POLICE DEPARTMENT AND  THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.  I EXPECT THAT WHAT WE LEARNED  DURING THAT HEARING WILL ONLY  STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS  LEGISLATION WHICH WE HOPE TO  TAKE UP IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE  COMING WEEKS.  THE STREETS ARE FLOODED WITH  PROTESTERS ACROSS THE NATION  AND AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,  THEY ARE OUTRAGED, THEY OBSERVE  THE MOMENTS OF SILENCE AND TAKE  THE KNEE, THEY ARE TIRED OF  EMPTY PROMISES AND ARE  DEMANDING JUSTICE AND THEY ARE  DEMANDING ACTION AND I SAY TO  THEM WE HEAR YOU, WE ARE  INSPIRED BY YOU, WE ARE TAKING  ACTION WITH YOU.  AND TOGETHER WE WILL CHANGE THE  LAWS BECAUSE OF YOU AND WE WILL  MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  THANK YOU. I NOW HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE  OF INTRODUCING THE CHAIR OF THE  DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS REPRESENTED  BY KIM JEFFRIES. >>> THANK YOU TERRY, TO  CHAIRWOMAN BASS AND SPEAKER  PELOSI AND LEADER SCHUMER, ALL  OF MY COLLEAGUES IN GOVERNMENT,  I'M APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR  LEADERSHIP AND OF WHAT THIS  MOMENT REPRESENTS.  RACISM IS A CANCER THAT POISONS  OUR SOCIETY.  AND TODAY WE TAKE A STEP TOWARD  ADDRESSING IT, BY TRYING TO  ERADICATE THE MALIGNANT TUMOR  OF POLICE BRUTALITY.  FAR TOO OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATELY ARRESTED AND  UNARMED INNOCENT LAW-ABIDING  AFRICAN-AMERICANS, MEN AND WOMEN , THE CHOKEHOLD AND OTHER  POLICE TACTICS SUCH AS A KNEE  TO THE NECK WHICH CUT OFF  BREEDING AND RESULTED IN  ASPHYXIATION, IS A PROCEDURE  THAT IS UNNECESSARY,  UNACCEPTABLE, UNCIVILIZED,  UNCONSCIONABLE AND UN-AMERICAN.  THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE IT  UNLAWFUL.  UNDER OUR NATION'S CIVIL RIGHTS  LAWS.  A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF POLICE  DEPARTMENTS ALREADY PROHIBIT  THE USE OF THE CHOKEHOLD AND  TACTICS SUCH AS A KNEE TO THE  NECK AS A MATTER OF POLICY.  BUT IT STILL CONTINUES TO BE  DEPLOYED THROUGH THIS VERY  MOMENT.  AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO  ADDRESS IT PROHIBITIVELY,  OUTLAW IT, CRIMINALIZE IT, AS A  MATTER OF LAW.  LIKE ANY PROFESSION THERE ARE  VERY GOOD POLICE OFFICERS AND  THERE ARE BAD ONES.  WE EMBRACE THOSE POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITY TO  PROTECT AND SERVE.  BUT VIOLENT POLICE OFFICERS,  BRUTAL POLICE OFFICERS, ABUSIVE  POLICE OFFICERS, MUST BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE.  JUSTICE, THE JUSTICE AND  POLICING ACT WILL REFORM THE  DOCTRINE OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.  IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE  VICTIMS OF POLICE BRUTALITY CAN  VINDICATE THEIR FULL RIGHTS.  UNDER SECTION 1983 IN OUR  NATION'S CIVIL RIGHTS LAW.  UNLESS THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY  THERE WILL NEVER BE CHANGED.  UNLESS THERE IS CHANGE  BRUTALITY WILL CONTINUE.  AND THEN WE WILL BE TRAPPED IN  A VICIOUS CYCLE OF ANGUISH AND  DESPAIR.  LASTLY, AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE  BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE  BEFORE THERE WAS A COUNTRY.  WE ARRIVED ON THESE SHORES IN  1619 IN SHACKLES.  AS AN ADULT OUR BLOOD AND SWEAT  AND TEARS, OUR INTELLECT AND  INGENUITY, OUR HARD WORK, WE  HELPED TO BUILD THIS GREAT  COUNTRY.  AND ALL WE EVER WANTED IS TO BE  TREATED EQUALLY.  NOT BETTER, NOT WORSE, EQUALLY.  WHY HAS THAT BEEN SO DIFFICULT  TO ACHIEVE, THAT'S ALL WE EVER  WANTED.  PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE EQUAL  PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW,  LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.  TREATED WITH COURTESY,  PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT BY  LAW ENFORCEMENT.  ALL WE'VE EVER WANTED WAS TO BE  TREATED EQUALLY.  JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT  REPRESENTS A STRONG NECESSARY  BOLD STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND  I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR  LEADERSHIP.  AND I NOW HEALED TO THE  DISTINGUISHED CHAIRWOMAN OF THE  PROGRESSIVE BLACK CAUCUS KAREN BASS.  >>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN,  NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE 50th  ANNIVERSARY OF THE  CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, 50  YEARS AGO THERE WERE 13 MEMBERS  OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK  CAUCUS AND ONE OF THEM  REPRESENTATIVE THAT CALF, HE  WAS THE ONE THAT CAME UP WITH  POLICIES RELATED TO POLICE  ABUSE OVER ALMOST 50 YEARS AGO.  SO IT IS IN THEIR LEGACY THAT  WE STAND TODAY AND CONTINUE ON  AND I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF  MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY  BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN SESSION  TODAY AND YOU CAME IN  SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS.  I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR  BEING HERE AND STANDING IN  SOLIDARITY WITH THIS  LEGISLATION.  LET ME SAY ALSO THAT ONE OF THE  BEAUTIES OF THIS IS THAT MANY  MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL  BLACK CAUCUS HAVE LEGISLATION,  INDIVIDUAL BILLS PART OF A  LARGER BILL BECAUSE THEY BEEN  WORKING ON IT FOR SO LONG.  I WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION THEIR  NAMES AND OPEN FOR QUESTIONS.  REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON  LEE, REPRESENTATIVE CLAY, JOHN  LEWIS, -- AND WITH THAT I WOULD  LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR  QUESTIONS.  >> Reporter: -- I'M WONDERING  IF YOU COULD -- HOW MANY THAT  ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN  ACTUALLY CROSS THE FINISH LINE  --  >>> CAN I JUST SAY THAT ONE OF  THE THINGS THAT GIVES US  CONFIDENCE IS THE FACT THAT  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  AROUND THIS COUNTRY MARCHING,  THERE IS A MOVEMENT THAT HAS  CAUGHT FIRE THAT IS MULTIRACIAL  AND THAT HAS ALSO SPREAD AROUND  THE WORLD AND WE NEED TO THINK  ABOUT HOW THE UNITED STATES  APPEARS AROUND THE WORLD, WHEN  WE GO OUT AND PROMOTE HUMAN  RIGHTS THE WORLD IS LOOKING AT  US.  THAT'S GOING TO HELP US.  YES?  >>> TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, THE  PRESIDENT TWEETED LAW AND ORDER  NOT TO FUND AND ABOLISH THE  POLICE, THE LEFT DEMOCRATS HAVE  GONE CRAZY, CAN YOU RESPOND TO  THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET?  >> REALLY?  >> THAT IS THE NARRATIVE THAT  THE PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICANS  WILL LIKELY CREATE AROUND THIS  LEGISLATION SO HOW DO YOU  RESPOND TO THAT, AND CAN YOU  ALSO JUST ON CAMERA TELL US WHY  YOU ARE -- FOR THE SIGNIFICANCE  OF TODAY?  >> THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE  CLAUSE IS OUR AFRICAN HERITAGE  AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW  THAT HERITAGE AND ARE ACTING IN  SOLIDARITY, THAT IS THE NICK  VINCENT'S OF THE CLAUSE, AND  I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT IF  ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO.  I THINK FOR US, ESPECIALLY WHEN  IT COMES TO THIS LEGISLATION,  WE FEEL IT IS TRANSFORMATIVE  THAT IT WILL TRANSFORM THE  RELATIONSHIP THAT OUR  COMMUNITIES HAVE WITH THE  POLICE AND I THINK THAT IN  TERMS OF THE LAW AND ORDER  MESSAGE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS  SPEWING OUT THERE, THERE IS  NOTHING NEW ABOUT THAT MESSAGE  AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BE  SUCCESSFUL.  >> Reporter: -- >> WOULD SOMEBODY LIKE TO  RESPOND? >> MANY OF YOU HEARD ME GO  THROUGH A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT  MAKES THIS COUNTRY GREAT.  HE WROTE IN HIS BOOK DEMOCRACY  IN AMERICA THAT AMERICA IS NOT  GREAT BECAUSE IT IS MORE  ENLIGHTENED THAN ANY OTHER  NATION BUT RATHER BECAUSE IT  HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO REPAIR  ITS FAULTS.  THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY  GREAT.  AND MOST RIGHT-THINKING  AMERICANS KNOW THAT THE  GREATNESS OF THIS COUNTRY IS AT  STAKE.  WE HAVE UNVEILED FOR WHATEVER  REASON SOME FAULTS THAT NEED TO  BE REPAIRED.  FAULTS OF THE HEALTHCARE  SYSTEM, FAULTS IN OUR SYSTEM.  SO LET ME SAY TO MR. COTTON,  PICK UP ANY HISTORY BOOK OF  AMERICA, I WOULD ASK HIM TO  PLEASE JUST READ THE HISTORY OF  ISAAC WOULD, A BLACK MAN WHO  CAME HOME FROM WORLD WAR II ON  A BUS FROM GEORGIA TRYING TO  GET TO SOUTH CAROLINA.  AND HE WAS STOPPED, TAKEN OFF  THE BUS, IN SOUTH CAROLINA BY A  DEPUTY SHERIFF, HE WAS IN HIS  UNIFORM AND THAT DEPUTY SHERIFF  TOOK A STICK AND POKED HIS EYES  OUT.  IS THAT INSTITUTIONAL?  IN LAW ENFORCEMENT?  THAT HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION  UPON WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN  MANY PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY HAS  BEEN ESTABLISHED.  -- IS FROM ARKANSAS.  --  >>> I REPRESENT THE HEARTLAND  OF AMERICA.  MISSOURI IS JUST NORTH AND I AM  LACY CLAY FROM ST. LOUIS  MISSOURI, MISSOURI IS JUST  NORTH OF ARKANSAS AND I WOULD  SUGGEST THAT ANY LOCAL, STATE  OR FEDERAL OFFICIAL, SOMETIMES  WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE WILL AND  WISHES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  AND I'VE SEEN MILLIONS IN MY  STATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY IN  SMALL TOWNS IN MISSOURI AND  THROUGHOUT THIS NATION WHO KNOW  THAT THERE IS INJUSTICE  THROUGHOUT THIS NATION AND THAT  WE'VE BEEN TREATED UNEQUALLY SO  I SUGGEST TO SEN.  COTTON AND OTHERS THAT THEY  FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE PEOPLE,  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND GET ON  BOARD WITH THIS.  THANK YOU.  >> Reporter: -- >>> I'VE HEARD LEADER  McCARTHY'S COMMENT, WE ARE ALL  WORKING.  WE ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NOT JUST  AFRICAN-AMERICANS BUT THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE.  COMMITTEES ARE WORKING TODAY.  AND I SAID I'M GOING TO CALL  THE HOUSE BACK  AS SOON AS THIS LEGISLATION IS  READY TO HIT THE FLOOR.  AND WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON IT.  ON TOP OF THAT IT'S GOING TO  PASS THE HOUSE.  BUT SADLY I AM NOT CONFIDENT  THAT A BODY THAT HAS NOT BEEN  ABLE TO PASS THE EMMETT --  LYNCHING BILL WILL PASS THIS  BILL.  I ALSO HOPE THE PRESIDENT DOES  NOT ADOPT YOUR PREMISE.  I HOPE HE ADOPTS THE PREMISE OF  JUSTICE.  FOR ALL.  AND IF HE DOES, AMERICA WILL BE  BETTER.  >> Reporter: -- >>> I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT  HAPPENING IN A FEDERAL WAY BUT  LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT PART  OF THAT CRY IS A DESIRE FOR  THERE TO BE SIGNIFICANT HIGHER  INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITIES.  LOOKING AT WHY POLICE ARE  NEEDED, WHAT HAPPENS, WHAT ARE  THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS  IN COMMUNITIES AND A LOT OF  PEOPLE FEEL WHEN IT COMES TO  THE BUDGET THAT MAYBE THAT  MONEY COULD BE USED IN  DIFFERENT WAYS AND I THINK THAT  IS A SIMILAR ISSUE.  BUT THE PART ABOUT HAVING A  COMPREHENSIVE INVESTMENT IN  COMMUNITIES ON THE HALF OF THE  BLACK CAUCUS WOULD BE TO SAY  THAT OBVIOUSLY WE ARE FOCUSING  UPON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW BUT WE  DO HAVE OTHER LEGISLATION  COMING ALONG THE LINE IN THE  FORM OF JOBS AND JUSTICE WHICH  GETS A LOT OF ISSUES IN THE  COMMUNITY.  >> Reporter: -- DO YOU SUPPORT  THE DEFUNDED POLICE MOVEMENT WE  ARE SEEING ON THE GROUND?  >> I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR  QUESTION, I ANSWERED IT VERY  CLEARLY BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE  DO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF  LEGISLATION COMING DOWN THE  PIKE THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE  CONCERNS ABOUT COMMUNITIES  ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  ONE OF THEM THAT I WISH THE  SENATE WOULD PASS RIGHT AWAY AS  THE HEROES ACT, IN THE HEROES  ACT WE SUPPORT COMMUNITIES,  STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, WE  SUPPORT THE DISPARITY IN THE  CORONAVIRUS HOW IT HAS ATTACKED  COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WE  WOULD HOPE SENATE WOULD NOT  IGNORE THAT AND WOULD PASS THE  LEGISLATION, AND WE WOULD HOPE  THAT WE COULD PUT MORE MONEY  INTO THE POCKETS OF PEOPLE WHO  REALLY NEED THAT NOW.  SO, WE HAVE THAT AND FINALLY WE  HAVE ON SCHEDULE THAT THE  FOURTH OF JULY HOPEFULLY WE  WILL PASS THE AFFORDABLE CARE  ACT TO PROVIDE MORE FAIRNESS  AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE  HEALTHCARE IN OUR COUNTRY LIKE  WE MENTIONED EARLIER, THAT IS A  CHALLENGE AS WELL AS BUILDING  OUR INFRASTRUCTURE LEGISLATION  THAT WILL BUILD AMERICA IN A  GREEN WAY DIVIDING JOBS.  THAT'S WHAT WE SAID WHEN WE RAN  INTO THOUSAND 12, TO LOWER THE  COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND  KEEP THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITION  BENEFIT, WE WERE GOING TO LOWER  HEALTHCARE COSTS, BUILD  INFRASTRUCTURE IN A GREEN WAY  AND -- SO THESE ARE ALL KINDS  OF WAYS THAT WE'VE COME AT  THIS.  THE FACT THAT, THE THING THAT  THE CHAIRWOMAN MENTIONED, AND  AS OTHERS HAVE SAID, WE WANT TO  WORK WITH OUR POLICE  DEPARTMENTS, THERE ARE MANY WHO  TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR WORK.  AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE  SURE THAT THE FOCUS IS ON THEM.  THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE ASK  OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO DEAL  WITH, MENTAL HIT THE ISSUES AND  POLICING -- MENTAL HEALTH  ISSUES AND POLICING AND WE  SHOULD MAKE OUR FUNDING ADDRESS  THOSE ISSUES DIRECTLY.  THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE STORY --  LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.  AS LEADERSHIP OR HAS MENTIONED  AS WELL, AND AS LEADER HOYER IT  MENTIONED, IS TO MONITOR THE IN  HUMILITY AND PATRIOTISM SAYS WE  HAVE TO DO BETTER IN CERTAIN  RESPECTS.  SO LET'S FOCUS ON PUBLIC  SENTIMENT WHICH IS EVERYTHING,  YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH A MOST  EVERYTHING WITH IT AND WITHOUT  IT PRACTICALLY NOTHING.  THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT COULD NOT  BE CLEARER, WE NEED TO MAKE  SOME TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE.  NOT INCREMENTAL BUT  TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE AND AS WE  DO SO WE WILL CHANGE POLICY AS  WE DO IN THIS LEGISLATION, WE  WILL USE ALL THE TOOLS AT OUR  DISPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE  ARE MOVING TOWARD A MORE  PERFECT UNION WITH LIBERTY AND  JUSTICE FOR ALL AND HAVE THOSE  DEBATES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL,  THAT IS A LOCAL DECISION ON THE  LOCAL LEVEL, BUT TO DO SO DOES  NOT SAY WE ARE GOING TO PILE  MORE MONEY ON AND FURTHER  MILITARIZED POLICE, NO, WE ARE  GOING TO DEVELOP AND ADDRESS  MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND  EDUCATION ISSUES IN OUR  COMMUNITIES AND I DON'T WANT  ANYONE TO GET TO THE  IMPRESSION, -- NOT BE  PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY,  THEY WILL, WE JUST WANT TO MAKE  IT EASIER FOR THEM IN THE  COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO BE  TREATED EQUALLY.  AS MR. JEFFRIES MENTIONED.  AND OUR CHAIRMAN OF THE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- ON THESE  ISSUES AND I WANT TO THANK HIM  FOR THAT.  BUT EVERYONE HERE KNOWS WHAT  THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT  THEY ARE DOING.  AND THE SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE IS -- THAT WE TAKE TO  PROTECT AND DEFEND.  THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND  WE KNOW THAT THEIR SAFETY IS  IMPORTANT.  TO DO SO IN A CONSTITUTIONAL WAY AND NOT IN SOME SLOGAN THAT THE  PRESIDENT MADE BEFORE SO WE  FEEL VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE  PATH WE ARE ON AND THEY SHOULD  AS THE SENATE SAID WE HEAR YOU  AND WE SEE YOU AND YOUR  COMMUNITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO US  AS WE GO FORWARD.  IT'S A PRETTY EXCITING TIME,  THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL  PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THIS  IS AN IMPORTANT DAY.  THE MARTYRDOM OF GEORGE FLOYD,  AND BY TOMORROW MAY HE REST IN  PEACE, HAS MADE A CHANGE IN THE  WORLD SO LET'S NOT GET INTO  THESE QUESTIONS THAT MAY BE  FROM THE SMALL MINDS OF SOME AS  FAR AS SAFETY IS CONCERNED BUT  LOOK AT IT AT LARGE.  AND WITH THAT I TURNED IT OVER  TO --.  >>> TWO THINGS VERY QUICKLY,  WHEN THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE  ANY NEW MONEY FOR POLICING AND  TWO THERE IS A PROVISION IN THE  BILL FOR GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES  TO HAVE PROJECTS THAT BEGIN TO  RE-ENVISION WHAT POLICING MIGHT  BE LIKE IN A PARTICULAR  NEIGHBORHOOD AND LET ME ALSO  SAY AS THE SPEAKER SAID, PUBLIC  SENTIMENT IS 80% IN SUPPORT OF  PEACEFUL PROTESTS WHILE PEOPLE  NOW RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES IN  OUR POLICING SYSTEM.  LET ME BRING UP LISA BLUNT  ROCHESTER FROM --.  >>> THANK YOU MDM.  SPEAKER AND ALL OF THE  LEADERSHIP HERE, JOHN LEWIS IS  NOT HERE.  BUT HE IS OUR COLLEAGUE AND HE  HAS BEEN THE CONSCIENCE OF  CONSCIENCE OF THE CONGRESS.  AND WHAT HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY  IS KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE.  KEEP OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE,  EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY CAN  DO SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE  CAN DO.  WE -- WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE  TODAY IS OUR HOPE THAT THERE  WILL BE STATE AND LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS THAT WILL CALL FOR  THINGS IN THEIR AREAS.  BUT THERE WAS A QUESTION AT THE  BEGINNING WHERE WE WERE ASKED  TO RAISE OUR HAND ABOUT OUR  BELIEF AND WHETHER THIS COULD  HAPPEN OR NOT.  WELL I LOOKED AT SOME OF MY  COLLEAGUES, AND WHEN I STARTED  THREE YEARS AGO, 3 1/2 YEARS  AGO, I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED  THAT WE WOULD'VE HAD PAID  FAMILY LEAVE.  OR SICK TIME.  BUT THE TIMES CALLED FOR IT  BECAUSE OF COVID-19.  THIS IS THE TIME, THIS IS THE  TIME -- WE ARE SICK AND TIRED  OF BEING SICK AND TIRED -- IS  FLYING IN FROM ACROSS THE  COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE DOING  OUR JOB AND SO FOR ALL THE  DISTRACTORS OUT THERE, MASTERS  OF DESTRUCTION, WE ARE KEEPING  OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE.  WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYES ON THE  PRIZE AND WE NEED THAT TO BE  THE STORY.  STATE AND LOCAL WILL DO WHAT  STATE AND LOCAL NEEDS TO DO,  THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THOSE  OLD PEOPLE, THOSE BLACK AND  WHITE, -- IF YOU REALLY WANT TO  GO DEEP WE ARE TRYING TO  REBUILD THE FOUNDATION, THAT'S  ALL.  SO KEEP OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE.  [ APPLAUSE ] >>> WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S A  GREAT CLOSE AND LET ME JUST END  BY SAYING THAT AS WE ADDRESS  THE QUESTION OF POLICING WE  UNDERSTAND THAT IT IMPACTS MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES NOT  JUST THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN  COMMUNITY, THE LATINO COMMUNITY  IN THE ASIAN COMMUNITY, THE  NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND  WE ARE UNITED IN GETTING  JUSTICE FOR POLICING PAST.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

RETAIL STORES OPENED FOR  PICKUP, CONSTRUCTION AND  MANUFACTURING COULD RESUME.  AND SUBWAYS RETURN TO REGULAR  WEEKDAY SERVICE.  >> YOU DID THE HARD WORK TO  FIGHT BACK CORONAVIRUS SO WE  COULD GET TO PHASE 1.  >> JUST WEEKS AGO THE CITY WAS  AT A BREAKING POINT.  WITH HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED AND  MORE THAN 16,000 CONFIRMED  CORONAVIRUS DEATHS IN NEW YORK  CITY ALONE.  BUT AFTER A STRICT SHUT DOWN  WIDELY AVAILABLE FREE TESTING  AND INCREASED CONTACT TRACING  THE CITY HAS MET THE CRITERIA  NEEDED TO START REOPENING,  PHASE I COULD BRING AS MANY AS  400,000 PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IN  THE BIG APPLE.  COMPANIES REOPENING MUST LIMIT  CAPACITY, FREQUENTLY CLEAN  SHARED AREAS.  >> THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT COVID  RAVAGED WERE  THE ONES THAT HAD LESS  HEALTHCARE TO BEGIN WITH AND  THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.  THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE OF  THE INJUSTICE.  AND THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE  ADDRESSING ALONG WITH POLICING  ISSUES.  AND THERE IS A MOMENT TO DO  THIS.  IT'S A GLOBAL MOMENT AND  CERTAINLY A NATIONAL MOMENT.  FOR THAT CHANGE.  CARPE DIEM, CARPE MOMENTUM.  SEES THE MOMENT.  THERE'S A MOMENT, CHANGE COMES  IN  A MOMENT.  WHEN DID WE PASS GUN SAFETY?  RIGHT AFTER SANDY HOOK. WHY?  BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID ENOUGH IS  ENOUGH.  PEOPLE ARE SAYING ENOUGH IS  ENOUGH AGAIN.  SEES THE MOMENT AND END THE  SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE AND  INEQUALITY.  EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, HOUSING,  POLICING CRIMINAL JUSTICE.  REOPENING OF NEW YORK CITY, WE  DID IT ALL BASED ON DATA IN  FACT, THERE WAS NO POLITICAL  IDEOLOGY AT WORK HERE.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A VIRUS.  THE VIRUS DOESN'T DO DEMOCRAT  OR REPUBLICAN AND IT DOESN'T DO  LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE.  IT IS BASED ON FACTS AND WE  FOLLOW THE FACTS.  YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT  NOW WITH OUR TESTING RESULTS,  ON SUNDAY WE DID 58,000 TESTS  ACROSS THE STATE, WE ARE AT  1.2% POSITIVE, THE LOWEST LEVEL  IN THE STATE SINCE MARCH 16.  THAT'S A FACT.  OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS 58,000  TESTS WE DID ON SUNDAY, 1.2%  STATEWIDE, SATURDAY 60,000  TESTS, 1.3, SATURDAY --  THURSDAY 66,000 TESTS.  WHY ARE WE REOPENING?  BECAUSE THESE NUMBERS SAY WE  CAN.  NO GUESTS, NO IDEOLOGY, BASED  ON THE NUMBERS WE CAN REOPEN. WE ARE DOING MORE TESTS THAN  ANY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ARE DOING MORE TESTS THAN  ANY COUNTRY ON THE GLOBE PER  CAPITA AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE  CONFIDENCE THANKS TO 19 MILLION  PEOPLE THAT WE CAN DO THIS.  BASED ON YESTERDAY, 58,000  TESTS.  THAT  IS A LOT OF TESTS.  THAT IS A LARGE SAMPLE.  AND I FEEL CONFIDENT MAKING  THIS DECISION ON THESE NUMBERS.  NOW, WE CAN CHANGE THE NUMBERS  JUST LIKE WE CHANGED THE  NUMBERS THE FIRST TIME.  AND REDUCE THEM.  NEW YORKERS GET SLOPPY, YOU  WILL SEE THE NUMBERS GO BACK UP  BECAUSE IT IS PURELY A FUNCTION  OF BEHAVIOR.  YOU TELL ME WHAT NEW YORKERS DO  TODAY AND I'LL TELL YOU THE  NUMBER TOMORROW.  WE LITERALLY STUDY IT ON A DAY- TO-DAY BASIS.  IF YOU LOOK AT YESTERDAY'S  NUMBERS, JUST YESTERDAY'S,  ACROSS THE STATE NEW YORK CITY,  NINE WEEKS AGO 59% WERE TESTING  POSITIVE.  FOR WEEKS AGO 10%  WERE TESTING POSITIVE, TWO  WEEKS AGO 4% WERE TESTING  POSITIVE AND YESTERDAY 2%.  JUST YESTERDAY.  DO YOU SEE THE OTHER NUMBERS  FOR THE OTHER REGIONS?  LONG ISLAND 1%, WESTERN NEW  YORK 2%, CAPITAL REGION 1%,  THAT IS HOW WE ARE MAKING  DECISIONS.  ROCKLAND AND HUDSON VALLEY  INTERFACE TWO TOMORROW, LONG  ISLAND IS ON TRACK TO ENTER  PHASE 2 ON WEDNESDAY, WHAT DOES  PHASE I REOPENING MEAN?  IT MEANS COMPANIES AND  BUSINESSES CAN REOPEN PURSUANT  TO SPECIFIC GUIDELINES.  THIS IS NOT RECKLESS REOPENING,  WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND THAT  IS DONE.  THIS IS BY THE GUIDELINES,  CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING,  WEAR MASKS, NO CONGREGANT  MEETINGS ON BUSINESSES,  CURBSIDE PICKUP, HOW CURBSIDE  PICKUPS HAPPEN, IN-STORE PICKUP  ONLY IF CURBSIDE PICKUP IS NOT  PRACTICAL AND THAT HAS TO BE  WITH PREARRANGED ORDERS.  YOU ARE JUST GOING INTO THE  STORE TO PICK UP AN ORDER.  THAT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO  CURBSIDE AND THAT'S ALL THAT IS. CURBSIDE OBVIOUSLY IN NEW YORK  CITY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT OF A  PHENOMENON THEN CURBSIDE AND  OTHER MARKETS WITH LESS  TRAFFIC.  BUT THAT IS WHAT STORE SHOPPING  IS.  THESE GUIDELINES WORK, THEY  HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN EVERY  OTHER REGION IN THE STATE AND  THOSE OTHER REGIONS HAVE  ENTERED PHASE 1 AND FOLLOW  THESE GUIDELINES AND THEIR HAS  BEEN NO SPIKE.  WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS.  IF YOU FOLLOW IT.  SO THE SAME GUIDELINES APPLY IN  NEW YORK CITY AND IF WE FOLLOW  THOSE GUIDELINES IN NEW YORK  CITY THERE SHOULD NOT BE A SPIKE JUST LIKE THERE HASN'T BEEN A  SPIKE ACROSS THE REST OF THE  STATE.  WE ARE ALSO GOING TO KEEP A  SPECIAL EYE ON NEW YORK CITY TO  SEE WHAT HAPPENS, WE WILL DO  35,000 TESTS PER DAY IN NEW  YORK CITY.  TAKE A SNAPSHOT EVERY DAY.  IF YOU SEE ANY INCREASE IN THE  INFECTION RATE THEN REACT  IMMEDIATELY.  AND 35 TESTS, 35,000 TESTS PER  DAY IS A HEALTHY SNAPSHOT, A  HEALTHY SAMPLE AND THEN WATCH  IT LITERALLY EVERY DAY AND  CALIBRATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.  AGAIN, I AM ASKING ALL THE  PROTESTERS TO PLEASE -- THAT IS  A NEW QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN  DROPPED IN THE MIX.  WE HAD ALL THESE AT-HOME  MEASURES AND THEN WE HAD  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR  PROTESTS.  DID THAT AFFECT THE SPREAD OF  THE VIRUS?  WE DON'T KNOW.  WE DON'T KNOW.  SO, I AM ASKING THE PROTESTERS,  PLEASE GO GET A TEST.  IT'S FREE AND AVAILABLE BUT  THERE IS A CHANCE THAT YOU WERE  IN PROXIMITY TO PEOPLE AND  AGAIN WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS,  WHAT THEY CALL A SUPER  SPREADER.  ONE PERSON IN A CROWD OF 100  PEOPLE CAN IN FACT DOZENS.  WE'VE SEEN IT.  SO PLEASE, WE HAVE TESTING  SITES IN THE NEW YORK CITY AREA  THAT ARE PRIORITIZED JUST FOR  PROTESTERS.  WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON HOTSPOT  NEIGHBORHOODS IN NEW YORK,  THESE ARE ZIP CODES WHERE WE  KNOW THERE IS A MUCH HIGHER  INFECTION RATE THAN IN OTHER  PARTS OF THE CITY AND IT IS  DRAMATICALLY HIGH, OVERALL IN  NEW YORK CITY IT'S ABOUT 19%  BUT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES  ARE  OVER 50% SO WE ARE TARGETING  THE HOTSPOTS, MORE TESTING AND  MORE TREATMENT IN THESE  HOTSPOTS AND MORE AWARENESS.  WE ARE ALSO SETTING UP  ADDITIONAL TESTING, THANK YOU  VERY MUCH NORTH WELL HEALTH,  AND COMMUNITY CARE, MORE  TESTING SITES IN THOSE  DIFFICULT AREAS FOR PEOPLE IN  THOSE ZIP CODES TO GET TESTED.  SO 240 TESTING SITES ALONE IN  NEW YORK CITY.  AND YOU CAN GET A TEST.  IT DOESN'T COST ANYTHING AND  THERE ARE 240 SITES AVAILABLE  SO THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO DO  IT.  THERE IS A WEBSITE WHERE YOU  CAN GO TO THE WEBSITE, PUNCH IN  YOUR ADDRESS AND FIND  AVAILABILITY, CALL AND SET IT  UP.  I'M ASKING PROTESTERS TO GET  TESTED AND AS A PRECAUTION, ACT  AS IF YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND  YOU WANT TO TELL THE PEOPLE YOU  ARE INTERACTING WITH, STAY AWAY  FROM PEOPLE IN A VULNERABLE  POPULATION AND THEN YOU TAKE  THE TEST AND KNOW THAT YOU'RE  NOT INFECTED, PEOPLE IN THOSE  ZIP CODES WHERE YOU HAVE THAT  HIGH INFECTION RATE, GET  TESTED.  GET TESTED.  AND THAT'S ALL ON THE WEBSITE.  ALSO, AS WE ARE WORKING THROUGH  THIS WE ARE GOING TO EXTEND THE  DEADLINE FOR FILING PROPERTY  TAXES BY 90 DAYS.  TO GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES SOME  ASSISTANCE, WE ARE GOING TO  RESTART ELECTIVE SURGERY AND  AMBULATORY CARE IN NEW YORK  CITY, THE MPA IS REOPENING --  ASKED ME ON AN INTERVIEW HOW DO  YOU KNOW THE SUBWAY IS GOING TO  BE SAFE ON REOPENING DAY AND I  SAID BECAUSE OF IT WASN'T SAFE  I WOULDN'T ASK ANYONE TO GO ON  THE SUBWAY.  I MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND FOR  ME IT'S VERY SIMPLE.  I JUST ASSUME I'M MAKING THE  DECISION FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY  CHILDREN.  AND I SAID TO ROMA IF THE  SUBWAY ISN'T SAFE FOR ME THAN I  WOULDN'T ASK ANYONE ELSE TO GO  ON THE SUBWAY.  AND TODAY I TOOK A RIDE ON THE  SEVEN TRAIN.  THE MTA HAS DONE PHENOMENAL  WORK.  YOU KNOW, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO  REMEMBER THE BAD OLD DAYS IN  NEW YORK CITY.  AND REMEMBER WE WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW DIRTY THE CARS WERE AND THE  GARBAGE THAT WAS IN THE SUBWAY  CARS AND THE STENCH FRANKLY  THAT WAS IN THE SUBWAY CARS.  THE SUBWAY CARS ARE CLEANER  THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.  IN MY LIFETIME.  I MEAN, THEY HAD TO DISINFECT  THE SUBWAY CARS, JUST THINK  ABOUT IT.  IT'S ALMOST A BIZARRE TASK,  RIGHT?  WE ARE GOING TO DISINFECT A  SUBWAY CAR.  SO MANY YEARS THEY COULDN'T  FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET  NEWSPAPERS AND COFFEE CUPS OUT  OF SUBWAY  CARS AND NOW THEY ARE  DISINFECTING AND THEY ARE  DISINFECTING THE CARS AND THE  STATIONS.  THEY'VE DONE 30,000 STATIONS,  500,000 CAR CLEANINGS AND  DISINFECTION'S, THEY'VE APPLIED  ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENTS TO THE  SURFACES IN THE SUBWAY CARS IN  THE STATION, THEY ARE USING UV  LIGHT TECHNOLOGY TO CLEAN  FACILITIES.  SO THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING  THEY CAN.  WE ARE GIVING THEM AN  ADDITIONAL MILLION MASKS AND  25,000 GALLONS OF HAND SANITIZER THAT WE MAKE IN THE STATE,  500,002 OUNCE BOTTLES AND IF  YOU WRITE ON THE SUBWAY, I HAVE  ABOUT 10 TO OUNCE BOTTLES THAT  I COLLECTED.  MASKS ARE MANDATORY WHEN YOU  ARE WRITING PUBLIC  TRANSPORTATION, THE SUBWAY BUS  IF YOU ARE IN A STATION, STAY  FIT 6 FEET AWAY WHEN POSSIBLE  AND USER HAND SANITIZER, USE  THE HAND SANITIZER AND OBSERVE  THE GUIDANCE ON TRAINS ETC.  THE MTA IS ALSO LAUNCHING THE  IT'S UP TO US NEW YORK CAMPAIGN, YOU WILL SEE THIS IF YOU ARE  WRITING THE SUBWAYS OR BUSES.  IT'S UP TO US, HOW DO YOU STOP  THE SPREAD?  IT'S WHAT WE DO.  ARE THE SUBWAYS SAFE?  IT'S HOW WE ACT, ARE THE  SIDEWALKS SAFE?  HOW WE ACT.  IF YOU ARE WEARING A MASK AND  KEEPING DISTANCE THEN YES IT'S  SAFE.  BUT IT IS A FUNCTION OF US.  EACH ONE OF US AS A COLLECTIVE.  WHILE THE RIDERSHIP HAS BEEN  REDUCED THERE WAS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY  IN THE REDUCED RIDERSHIP, RIGHT? ONE OF THE ONGOING CHALLENGES  HAS ON CONSTRUCTION IS TO DO  CONSTRUCTION YOU HAVE TO REDUCE  THE TRAIN USAGE.  YOU REDUCE THE TRAIN USAGE AND  YOU INCONVENIENCE COMMUTERS.  WHEN RIDERSHIP WAS REDUCED THE  MTA SMARTLY INCREASED THEIR  CONSTRUCTION.  BECAUSE RIDERSHIP WAS REDUCED  SO FEWER WRITERS WERE  INCONVENIENCED BY CONSTRUCTION.  THEY ACCELERATED $2 BILLION IN  CAPITAL PROJECTS,  REHABILITATING THE F TRAIN,  USING THE LESSONS THEY LEARNED  IN THE L TRAIN WHERE I WANT TO  APPLAUD -- AND HIS TEAM FOR  LITERALLY SETTING A RECORD IN  SMART GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTION,  SMART GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTION  DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AN  OXYMORON, YOU CAN HAVE SMART  GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTION AND --  SHOWED THAT, THEY ARE  ACCELERATING 11 STATIONS, 24  NEW ELEVATORS, REHABBING  HUNDRED 38 STREET STATIONS,  ACCELERATING -- FROM THE 2345  PARKWAY LINE IN BROOKLYN, NEW  YORKERS DID WHAT MANY EXPERTS  TOLD ME WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN 100  DAYS.  I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD A  GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP IN 100 DAYS.  NEW YORKERS BENT THE CURVE BY  BEING SMART.  WE ARE CELEBRATING, WE ARE BACK  AND REOPENING, WE ARE EXCITED.  OUR MOJO IS BACK, OUR ENERGY IS  BACK, STAY SMART, STAY SMART. LOOK AT THE FACTS AROUND US,  OTHER STATES THE SPIKE IS GOING  UP.  CALIFORNIA THE NUMBERS ARE  GOING UP.  FLORIDA THE NUMBERS ARE GOING  UP.  TEXT IS THE NUMBERS ARE GOING  UP AND LOOK AT THE REOPENING  DATE AND LOOK AT WHEN WHAT  HAPPENED AFTER THEY REOPENED.  THAT IS THE CAUTIONARY TALE MY  FRIEND.  GENTLEMAN ON THE SUBWAY CAR  SAID TO ME HE HAS FAMILY IN  ARIZONA AND THEY REOPENED AND  THEY ARE SEEING  A SPIKE.  LOOK AT THE SPIKE IN ARIZONA.  YOU HAVE TO STAY SMART AFTER  THE REOPENING.  BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU COULD  SEE A SPIKE.  THAT IS THE LAST THING THAT WE  WANT TO SEE.  BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE WILL  BECAUSE WE ARE NEW YORK TOUGH,  SMART RIGHT THERE, SECOND WORD  ANDREW, SMART.  RIGHT AFTER TOUGH.  SMART.  UNITED, DISCIPLINED AND THE  LAST WARD IS FOR ME, LOVING.  >> Reporter: IN OTHER STATES  THAT SAW A SPIKE THEY DON'T  EVEN HAVE MASS TRANSIT, THEY  DON'T HAVE PEOPLE IN SUBWAYS SO  BY DEFINITION -- AS CLEAN AS IT  IS DON'T YOU EXPECT NEW YORK TO  SEE A SPIKE?  >> ARE YOU A CYNIC MY FRIEND?  THE SUBWAY HAS BEEN OPEN.  ALL DURING THIS TIME.  FOR 100 DAYS THE SUBWAY HAS  BEEN OPEN.  WE HAD THE HIGHEST INFECTION  RATE IN THE COUNTRY, WE HAD THE  HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES IN THE  COUNTRY AND THE HIGHEST  HOSPITALIZATION RATE IN THE  COUNTRY, THE SUBWAYS WERE OPEN  AND WE WENT FROM THAT POINT  HUNDRED DAYS AGO TO NOW ONE OF  THE LOWEST INFECTION RATES AND  ONE OF THE BEST DOWNWARD SPIRALS WITH THE SUBWAY.  IF WE STAY AS SMART AND AS  DISCIPLINED AS WE'VE BEEN FOR  THE PAST 100 DAYS WE WILL BE  FINE.  IF WE CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR, IF  WE REVERT AND GET SLOPPY, IF WE  GET COCKY ONE OF THE LOWEST INFECTION  RATES AND ONE OF THE BEST  DOWNWARD SPIRALS WITH THE  SUBWAY.  IF WE STAY AS SMART AND AS  DISCIPLINED AS WE'VE BEEN FOR  THE PAST 100 DAYS, WE WILL BE  FINE.  IF WE CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR AND  REVERT AND GET SLOPPY, IF WE  GET COCKY AND A LITTLE  ARROGANT, THEN WE HAVE A  PROBLEM BUT WE AREN'T DOING  THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SMART.  >> PEOPLE WITH MASKS ON THE  TRAIN, IF THE RIDERSHIP TAKES  UP, THEY ARE NOT SIX PETER  FEET APART.  >> IF THEY USE THE SANITIZER  AND USE THE MASKS, IT WILL BE  OKAY.  >> WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE  REFORM?  >> IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A  PROBLEM, THE VARIABLE IS, DID  THE PROTESTS HAVE AN EFFECT?  I DON'T KNOW.  I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE AND  THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THEM TO  GET TESTS.  BUT, WE WILL HAVE THE MASKS  FOR A CENTRAL WORKERS AND IF  WE KEEP THE DISCIPLINE AND THE  INTELLIGENCE, WE WILL BE FINE.  >> THE STATE WILL BE PASSING  THESE BILLS AND SOME OF THEM  HAVE BEEN BOTTLED UP FOR MANY  YEARS AND THEY ARE NOW GOING  TO PASS THEM.  DO YOU THINK THE DEPARTMENT,  ITSELF, HAS TO DO ITS OWN  INTERNAL WORK?  WOULD YOU LIKE CHANGES WITHIN  THE NYPD TO GO A STEP FURTHER  AND WITH THE CURRENT LEADER  SHEEP SHIP TEAM BE UP TO DOING  THAT?  >> LOOK -- MAYORS RUN THEIR  LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.  I THINK THIS IS A WAKE-UP CALL . NOT A WAKE-UP CALL, THIS IS  A TRANSITION, TRANSFORMATION  MOMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT HAS TO  STOP AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE,  RIGHT?  WHEN THEY SAY DEFUND THE  POLICE, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?  THEY ARE SAYING WE WANT  FUNDAMENTAL, BASIC CHANGE WHEN  IT COMES TO POLICING.  THEY ARE RIGHT, THEY ARE  RIGHT.  THEY ARE SAYING, MR. FLOYD,  MR. GARNER, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.  THEY ARE RIGHT.  THE STATE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES  WILL DO THAT BUT I ALSO  BELIEVE YOU WILL SEE THAT IN  EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT NOW  OPERATING.  THEY UNDERSTAND AND ARE  OPERATING IN A DIFFERENT  REALITY WITH DIFFERENT  PERCEPTIONS AND MANDATES.  I THINK YOU WILL SEE A SHIFT  ACROSS POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND  POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT DON'T  HEAR IT AND DON'T GET IT WILL  HAVE A REAL PROBLEM AND THE  POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF THAT  POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE A  PROBLEM, RIGHT?  AND THOSE LOCAL MAYORS, WHAT'S  HAPPENING IN MINNEAPOLIS, NOW.  I THINK THE MAYOR, AS ELECTED  OFFICIAL, THEY WILL GET THE  MESSAGE AND THEN IT WILL BE UP  TO THEM WHETHER OR NOT THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE IT.  NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US GO  FURTHER THAN THAT, ZACH.  YES, THERE IS DISCRIMINATION  INSTITUTIONALIZED IN SOCIETY  AND IT IS MANIFESTED IN THE  POLICING CRIMINAL JUSTICE  SYSTEM.  BUT, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.  IT'S ACTUALLY WORSE THAN THAT.  EDUCATION IS WHERE IT STARTS  IN HOUSING IS WHERE IT STARTS.  HEALTHCARE IS WHERE IT STARTS.  YOU WANT A DIFFERENCE IN  AMERICA AND YOU WANT TO LIVE  UP TO THE AMERICAN PROMISE IN  THE AMERICAN DREAM, LET  AMERICA BE AMERICA AGAIN,  EVERY CHILD HAS A QUALITY  EDUCATION.  NOT TWO EDUCATIONS SEPARATE  BUT EQUAL, SEPARATE BUTTON  UNEQUAL BUT EQUAL EDUCATION  FOR EVERY CHILD.  NOT THE POOR CHILDREN EVEN IN  THIS STATE.  POOR SCHOOLS, $13,000 PER  STUDENT.  RICH SCHOOLS, $36,000 PER  STUDENT.  MY CHILD STARTS OUT $13,000  FOR EDUCATION AND YOUR CHILD  STARTS OUT $36,000 FOR  EDUCATION AND MY CHILD COMES  FROM A POOR ZIP CODE WITH LESS  SOCIAL SERVICES AND MORE  PROBLEMS IN THE COMMUNITY AND  OFTEN MORE PROBLEMS IN THE  HOUSEHOLD AND THAT CHILD GETS  LESS EDUCATION AND LESS  SERVICES.  EQUAL OPPORTUNITY?  NO.  WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS  FOR DECADES.  THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS.  THE FUNDAMENTAL INSANITY, YOU  ARE SPENDING $50,000 A YEAR ON  A PRISON CELL AND IT'S MORE  THAN THE TUITION AT HARVARD  UNIVERSITY.  I MEAN, HOW OFTEN HAVE WE  TALKED ABOUT THIS?  IT'S A REVERSE SET OF  PRIORITIES.  >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT  POLICE REFORM AND MAINLY HOW  THE POLICE UNIONS FACTOR INTO  THAT.  DO YOU VIEW THE POLICE UNIONS  AS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT  FOR POLICE REFORM?  >> LOOK, EVERY UNION ARGUES  THE INTEREST OF THEIR EMPLOYEES , RIGHT?  WHEN YOU GO TO MAKE EDUCATION  REHAUL FORM, YOU HEAR FROM THE  TEACHERS UNION AND WHEN YOU  REFORM THE MENTAL HEALTH  SYSTEM, YOU HEAR FROM CSEA AND  WHEN YOU REFORM GOVERNMENT,  YOU HERE.  YOU HEAR ABOUT CONSTRUCTION  AND LABOR AND YOU HEAR FROM  THE CONSTRUCTION AND LABOR  UNIONS.  SO, THEY ARE ARGUING FROM  THEIR EMPLOY'S POINT OF VIEW  AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.  POLICE UNIONS ARE SAYING IF  YOU RELEASE PERSONNEL RECORDS,  YOU MAY JEOPARDIZE THEIR  PRIVACY AND THAT'S A POINT.  THE BILL HAS PRIVACY  PROTECTION.  BUT, MY POINT ON 50 A, WHICH I  KNOW THE POLICE UNIONS ARE NOT  HAPPY ABOUT, LOOK -- ALL IT IS  DOING IS REVERSING AN  EXEMPTION ON POLICE RECORDS.  NOW, A POLICE EMPLOYEE, A  POLICE OFFICER IS LIKE A  SCHOOLTEACHER.  IT'S LIKE THE D.C. 37 WORKER  OR THE CSEA WORKER.  IT'S PARITY AND EQUALITY WITH  EVERY OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE  AND NOTHING PUNITIVE TO  POLICE.  THEY SAY IN THAT FILE, IT WILL  RELEASE JUST COMPLAINTS.  IF I JUST SENT A COMPLAINT  LETTER IT WOULD BE RELEASED?  YES.  IF I SENT A COMPLAINT LETTER  ABOUT A TOLL TAKER OR A  COMPLAINT ABOUT A  SCHOOLTEACHER, IT'S GOING TO  BE RELEASED.  IT'S JUST FAIRNESS AND EQUITY  ACROSS THE BOARD.  >> WHAT ABOUT OTHER UNIONS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST  NEW YORK? DO YOU THINK THAT  REVERBERATES THROUGH OTHER  UNIONS AND DO THEY POSE ANY  DIFFICULTY, OR IS THERE A ROLE  FOR THEM AND POLICING?  >> OF COURSE THERE IS A ROLE  IN POLICE REFORM FOR THE  UNIONS.  I THINK THE UNIONS WILL BRING  THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE POLICE  OFFICER TO THE TABLE, AS THEY  SHOULD. WHEN YOU MAKE ANY  DECISION, GOING THROUGH A  REFORM, YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND  ALL OF THE ISSUES AND THE  PERSPECTIVES AND THEN PICK THE  RIGHT PATH.  EVERYBODY HAS A PERSPECTIVE  HERE.  EVERYBODY HAS AN INTEREST.  LISTEN TO ALL THE VOICES AND  PICK THE RIGHT, THE JUST  PASSED.  NOW, THIS IS A HYPER EMOTIONAL  ISSUE AND I GET THAT.  BUT, PEOPLE HAVE VERY STRONG  OPINIONS.  THAT IS THE ART FORM OF  GOVERNMENT, RIGHT?  WE PASSED A GUN SAFETY REFORM.  THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS,  HUNDREDS OF DEATH THREATS ON  GUN SAFETY AND EVERYBODY HAS A  POINT, EVERYBODY HAS AN  ARGUMENT AND YOU CAN MAKE  EVERYBODY HAPPY.  IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING  EVERYBODY HAPPY BUT IT IS  ABOUT HEARING ALL SIDES.  >> FOR THE PROTESTS, WE HEAR  YOU ENCOURAGING PROTESTERS TO  GET TESTED AND THERE ARE  SPECIAL SITES FOR DIFFERENT  PROTESTERS.  IS THERE A MESSAGE TO POLICE  OFFICERS?  WE'VE SEEN EVERY DAY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS  NOT WEARING MASKS.  >> THE POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD  BE WEARING MASKS.  THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE  GETTING TESTED AND I ENCOURAGE  THEM TO GET TESTED.  WE HAVE TESTING AVAILABLE FOR  A CENTRAL WORKERS WHERE THEY  ARE PRIORITIZED.  SO, YES -- WAS A MESSAGE TO  THE PROTESTERS AND I'VE HAD  THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH  POLICE SEVERAL TIMES.  THE POLICE WERE OUT THERE AS  ESSENTIAL WORKERS EARLY ON ALL  THROUGH THIS.  WE STARTED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT  OF TESTING WITH THE POLICE  FORCE WEEKS AGO WHEN THIS  FIRST STARTED.  >> DO EXPECT PHASE TWO IN THE  CITY?  YOU SAY NEW YORK IS BACK BUT  THERE ARE BOARDED UP STORES  ACROSS THE CITY.  HOW WILL THAT AFFECT NEW YORK  TO COMING BACK TO WHAT IT  ACTUALLY WAS?  >> LOOK -- WE HAD A TERRIBLE  NIGHT THE NIGHT OF LOOTING IN  THIS CITY.  IT WAS TERRIBLE.  IT WAS DESTRUCTIVE AND IT WAS  FRIGHTENING.  IT WAS BAD FOR THE CITY IN A  NUMBER OF WAYS AND I THINK IT  SCARED THE CITY RESIDENCE.  IT SCARED THEM AT A BAD TIME  BECAUSE WE ALREADY WERE GOING  THROUGH A CULVERT AND PEOPLE  WERE NERVOUS ABOUT THE CITY  AND THE DENSITY AND THE  NUMBERS.  THEN, YOU SEE THIS NIGHT OF  LOOTING, WHICH LOOK LIKE THE  CITY WAS OUT-OF-CONTROL.  AND IT WAS BAD FOR THE  COMMUNITIES WE WERE TRYING TO  HELP AND PEOPLE SEE THE  PICTURES OF LOOTERS RUNNING UP  AND DOWN MADISON AVENUE IN  MANHATTAN.  THERE WEREN'T AS MANY  PICTURES, BUT THERE WAS JUST  AS MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE BRONX  AND IN BROOKLYN AND IN QUEENS,  DESTROYING MOM-AND-POP  BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING  ON A GOOD DAY. DESTROYING  BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE NEEDED  SERVICES TO POOR COMMUNITIES.  SO, THE LOOTING WAS VERY BAD.  IT WASN'T THE FAULT OF THE  PROTESTERS.  SOME PEOPLE TRIED TO PUT THE  PROTESTERS AS LOOTERS BUT THAT  IS A WAY TO DISMISS THE  PROTESTERS, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE  AND IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THE  POLICE OFFICERS, RIGHT?  THE POLICE OFFICERS, IT'S NOT  THEIR ISSUE.  POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS CITY  ARE THE BEST POLICE  ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY.  I BELIEVE 36,000 STRONG AND  THEY'VE HANDLED MANY DIFFICULT  NIGHTS IN THIS CITY.  I SAID IT WAS THE MANAGEMENT  OF THE POLICE, THE MANAGEMENT  AND THE DEPLOYMENT.  YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH POLICE  DEPLOYED. I DON'T SEND STATE  POLICE SOMEWHERE UNLESS I HAVE  ENOUGH STATE POLICE TO DO THE  JOB.  OTHERWISE, IT'S DANGEROUS FOR  EVERYONE.  I SAID IT WAS ABOUT THE  MANAGEMENT AND DEPLOYMENT.  IT WAS OF THE PROTESTERS. IT  WASN'T THE POLICE OFFICERS,  THEMSELVES.  BUT, IT'S OVER.  IT WAS A BAD NIGHT.  I TOOK ACTION, THE MAYOR TOOK  ACTION AND IT'S OVER.  IT HASN'T HAPPENED AGAIN AND  THE PROTESTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN  PEACEFUL.  THERE HAS BEEN SOME ISSUES,  BUT THERE'S BEEN NO LOOTING.  THERE IS PROTESTERS AND THE  ISSUES AROUND PROTESTERS AND  THEN THERE IS LOOTING.  THERE HASN'T BEEN LOOTING.  THE BOARDED UP STORES FROM THE  LOOTING, THAT WAS ONE NIGHT AND IT WAS ARRESTED, IT STOPPED  AND IT'S OVER.  >> THAT LINGERING FEAR, IT HAS  TO GET A FULL COME BACK?  >> I THINK THE LOOTING WAS ONE  NIGHT.  IT WAS A BAD NIGHT, BUT IT WAS  ONE NIGHT, RIGHT?  I THINK NEW YORKERS KNOW HOW  TO CALIBRATE THIS.  AND LOOK -- ALSO, HONESTY  WORKS, RIGHT?  YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH BEING  INAUTHENTIC IN THIS CITY.  IT WAS A BAD NIGHT.  A BAD TWO NIGHTS.  THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOME  LOOTING TWO NIGHTS.  YEAH, IT WAS BAD.  BUT, I SAID IT WAS BAD AND I  SAID IT HAD TO STOP AND STOP  NOW AND IT WAS A MANAGEMENT -DEPLOYMENT ISSUE OF THE  POLICE AND THE MANAGEMENT  ACTED DIFFERENTLY AND THE  DEPLOYMENT WAS DIFFERENT AND  IT STOPPED. SO, IT WASN'T  GOOD, BUT I THINK IT WAS  ADDRESSED HONESTLY AND IT WAS  ADDRESSED EFFECTIVELY AND OVER  THE PAST SEVERAL NIGHTS, WE  HAVEN'T SEEN ANY LOOTING.  SO, I THINK NEW YORKERS ARE  PAST THAT.  >> GOVERNOR, CAN YOU TELL US  ABOUT YOUR EVOLUTION IN  THINKING ON 50 A? YOU'VE  RESISTED CALLS TO REFORM,  REPEAL OR AMEND IT.  I ASKED YOU A QUESTION ABOUT  THIS A WEEK AGO AND YOU WERE  KNOWN WHERE NEAR AS DIFFIDENT  AS YOU'VE BEEN IN THE LAST  COUPLE OF DAYS.  TELL ME WHAT IT'S TAKEN?  >> WHAT DID I SAY WHEN YOU  ASKED ME THE FIRST TIME?  I SAID THERE IS NO NEED TO  CHANGE 50 A BECAUSE 50 A DOES  NOT DO WHAT THE LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS SAY THAT IT DOES.  THAT'S TRUE.  REMEMBER, NEW YORK CITY USED  TO RELEASE DISCIPLINARY  RECORDS.  THEY RELEASED THEM AND THEN  THEY STOPPED.  WHEN THEY STOPPED, THEY SAID  IT'S ILLEGAL BECAUSE OF 50 A.  NO.  50 A WAS IN EXISTENCE WHEN YOU  RELEASED THEM.  HOW DID YOU RELEASE THEM IF 50  A STOPPED YOU?  >> WHAT IS YOUR THINKING?  THAT'S GOOD PARAPHRASING OF  WHAT YOU SAID.  >> THEN, I SAID THE COUNCIL'S  LETTER SAYING 50 A DOESN'T  STOP YOU, BUT IT'S CLEAR THEY  ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT.  DO I BELIEVE 50 A IS THE  STRAWMAN FOR LOCAL  GOVERNMENTS?  YES.  BUT, EVEN AS THE STRAWMEN,  OKAY, WE WILL KNOCK IT DOWN AS  THE STRAWMAN.  >> ON THE MTA?  >> THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION.  >> THIS IS FOR YOU.  >> THAT NEVER WORKS.  >> WHAT ABOUT THE NOMINEES?  >> WHEN THE SENATE TAKES UP  CONFIRMATIONS, I WILL SEND  THEM.  >> IN THE COMING MONTH OR THE  WEEK?  >> AS SOON AS THEY TAKE  CONFIRMATIONS.  IT'S A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR  THE STATE SENATE BUT AS SOON AS THEY START CONFIRMING, I WILL  SEND THEM.  I HAVE A BATCH OF  CONFIRMATIONS.  >> I WAS SEEING MTA CALLS FOR  THE REOPENING AND SEIZING THE  MOMENT ON THE CITY STREETS IN  THE CITIES ACROSS THE WORLD,  DO YOU THINK THE MAYOR IS  DOING ENOUGH AND ARE CITY  OFFICIALS DOING ENOUGH TO GET  THE BUS IS MOVING AND OPEN UP  PLACES FOR RESTAURANTS TO  REFORM IN THE CITY?  >> LOOK, YOU ARE FACTUALLY  RIGHT.  THE MTA ESTIMATED AND  REQUESTED 60 MILES OF BUS  LANES AND I HAVEN'T HEARD THE  MAYOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT.  OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A  DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT THE MTA  ASKED FOR AND WHAT THE MAYOR  IS DOING.  YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT?  >> FROM THE MTA'S STANDPOINT,  20 MILES IS A STEP, A STEP IN  THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  WE ASKED FOR 60 FOR A REASON,  AND WE WANT TO HAVE SERVICE  FOR EVERYBODY CAN GET MORE  FREQUENT SERVICE AND WE CAN  ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH, AS THE  GOVERNOR SAID, TO PUT THE  ECONOMY BACK IN MOTION AND TO  MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING  WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  >> YOU ANNOUNCED THAT THERE IS  AN ACCELERATION OF PROJECTS AT  THE MTA BUT THE WHOLE CAPITAL  PLAN, IS THERE ANY UPDATE ON  THAT AND WHETHER OR NOT WE  WILL MOVE THAT PROCESS?  >> WHO IS WE?  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO  IMPROVE THE CONGESTION PRICING  PLAN AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT IT  AND MTA HAS SPOKEN TO THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT IT.  THE MTA HAS NOT APPROVED A  CONGESTION PRICING PLAN.  WHY NOT?  YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT.  I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE A  BONA FIDE REASON.  WHY HAVEN'T THEY APPROVE THE  CONGESTION PRICING?  I HAVE NO IDEA.  WHY HAVEN'T THEY IMPROVE THE  HUDSON TUNNELS AND FROM  LAGUARDIA AND THE EXTENSION OF  THE SECOND AVENUE SUBWAY AND  WHY DID THEY PASS SALT WHICH  PENALIZED NEW YORKERS AND  INCREASED THE TAXES OF NEW  YORKERS ALREADY CONTRIBUTING  MORE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  THAN ANYONE ELSE?

THE QUEENS SON WOULD BE  INTERVIEWED AS A WITNESS AND  HE STAYED WITH EPSTEIN IN NEW  YORK AND THE U.S. VIRGIN  ISLANDS AND A PERSON FAMILIAR  SAID THE APPLICATION WAS MADE  UNDER A U.S.-U.K.  MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE  TREATY.  PRINCE ANDREW WAS SEEN IN HIS  EX-WIFE SARAH FERGUSON POSTED  THIS INSTAGRAM PICTURE WITH  THE CAPTION, SO PROUD OF OUR  LOVING FAMILY.

LITTLE SURPRISE?  PARTICIPATION IN ONLINE  CLASSES AND GROSSE POINTE IS  95%, MUCH HIGHER THAN JUST A  ZIP CODE AWAY IN DETROIT,  WHERE IT IS ONLY 50%.  IT'S A REFLECTION, SOME SAY,  OF DEEPLY ROOTED SYSTEMIC  RACISM.  THE NUMBERS TELL PART OF THE  STORY.  IN DETROIT, THE MEDIAN  HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS ABOUT  $30,000 IN THE POPULATION IS  NEARLY 80% BLACK.  AND GROSSE POINTE, THE MEDIAN  INCOME IS JUST OVER $100,000  WITH THE BLACK POPULATION  BEING 2%.  IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN  DETROIT A RACIAL DIVIDE, AS  WELL?  >> ABSOLUTELY.  THE HAVES RECEIVED MORE THAN  THE HAVE-NOTS AND WE KNOW  CHILDREN ARE COMING IN AT A  DISADVANTAGE WITH FEWER  RESOURCES THAN UPPER-MIDDLE- CLASS STUDENTS BUT THE PUBLIC  SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE  GREAT EQUALIZER TO GIVE EQUAL  OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN.  IT ACTUALLY EXACERBATES THE  DIVIDE THAT ALREADY EXISTS.  >> Reporter: TO PRO DETROIT IS  GETTING A BIG BOOST WITH A 23  MILLION DOLLARS GIFT FROM LOCAL BUSINESSES TO GIVE EVERY  STUDENT A LAPTOP.  THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL  SUMMER, LONG AFTER THE SCHOOL  YEAR ENDS.  >> WE CAN ANTICIPATE MOST  STUDENTS LOSING SIX MONTHS OF  WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN,  HAD WE'VE BEEN IN SCHOOL.  >> Reporter: SIX MONTHS BEHIND  CAN BE A KNOCKOUT PUNCH FOR  KIDS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH  AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP.  IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE TO  SMART OR BECAUSE THEY AREN'T  WILLING TO WORK AS HARD.  IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE.  >> GROSSE POINTE IS RIGHT NEXT  TO US AND THEY'VE GOT  RESOURCES FROM THE SECOND THE  PANDEMIC STARTED.  THEIR SYSTEM ISN'T LACKING IS  MUCH AS WE ARE AND IT'S LIKE,  WOW, WHY CAN'T WE BE LIKE THAT  ALL RIGHT CAN WE STEP IN AND  GIVE TO OUR STUDENTS LIKE THEY  ARE?  OUR STUDENTS ARE NO DIFFERENT  FROM THEIRS.  >> Reporter: I ASKED WHERE THE  INCREDIBLE COURAGE COMES FROM  AND SHE SAID HER WORKING  MOTHER, WHO SHE CALLS A  SUPERHERO AND A FINAL POINT,  BROWN AND HARVARD DID A STUDY  AFTER THE VIRUS AROUND THE  COUNTRY, LOOKING AT JUST UNDER  ONE MILLION STUDENTS AND WHAT  THEY FOUND IS THAT IN THE  POOREST OF ZIP CODES, THE MATH  LEARNING WAS REDUCED BY 50%  AND IN THE WEALTHY ZIP CODES,  NO LEARNING LOSS.  >> EVEN IF THE KIDS GET THE  LAPTOPS, WHAT ABOUT THE  DIGITAL DIVIDE PERTAINING TO  INTERNET ACCESS?  >> Reporter: THAT'S PART OF  IT.  LAPTOPS WILL COME WITH  INTERNET ACCESS BECAUSE THAT  IS ABSOLUTELY THE PROBLEM.  >> WE DID THAT STORY OF THE  FAMILY THAT GOT IN THEIR CAR,  REMEMBER?  THEY DROVE TO WHERE THERE WAS  INTERNET ACCESS BUT YOU CAN'T  BELIEVE PEOPLE LIVE BLOCKS  APART AND HAVE THAT DISPARITY.  THAT WAS FASCINATING.

THIS MONEY, WE ARE JOINED BY  AHMAUD ARBERY'S MOTHER, WANDA  COOPER JONES AND HER LAWYER.  GOOD MORNING.  >> GOOD MORNING.  >> Reporter: LET'S DIG IN.  WANDA, DURING THE TESTIMONY  LAST WEEK, THE JUDGE REVEALED  THAT ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS,  TRAVIS MCMICHAEL, UTTERED A  RACIAL SLUR AFTER AHMAUD  ARBERY WAS KILLED AND THAT IS  GETTING BUZZ BECAUSE OF THE  IMPLICATIONS.  YOU WERE IN THAT COURT ROOM.  WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU  HEARD THAT AND HOW SIGNIFICANT  IS THIS FINDING TO YOU?  >> IT WAS SHOCKING.  THAT SOMEBODY COULD ACTUALLY  TAKE A LIFE AND STILL NOT HAVE  ANY VOICE IN THE LAST MINUTES  OF LIFE.  >> Reporter: LET ME ASK YOU --  GEORGIA IS ONE OF THE FEW  STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT  DOES NOT HAVE A HATE CRIME  STATUTE.  HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THIS  CASE?  >> WELL, IT MOVES US CLOSER TO  THE INTENT THAT WE NEED TO  MEET THE STANDARD FOR THE  MURDER CHARGE THESE MEN ARE  CHARGED WITH.  EACH MAN IS CHARGED WITH  FELONY MURDER AND IF THEY HAVE  A JUSTIFICATION, IT IS  UNDERMINED BY THE USE OF A  RACIAL SLUR WHILE STANDING  OVER A DEAD BODY.  >> AN ARREST WAS MADE IN THE  CASE ALMOST THREE MONTHS AFTER  HE WAS KILLED.  A WEIGHT CROSS DISTRICT  ATTORNEY RECUSED HIMSELF  BECAUSE OF TIES TO THE  MCMICHAEL'S.  THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT PROBABLE CAUSE TO ISSUE ARREST WARRANTS  AND UNDER GEORGIA LAW, TRAVIS  MCMICHAEL WAS ALLOWED TO USE  DEADLY FORCE TO PROTECT  HIMSELF.  THE CURRENT STATE HAS AN  INVESTIGATION INTO HOW THE  CASE WAS HANDLED.  WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?  IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT GOING ON  HERE.  >> THE STATE ATTORNEY TRIED TO  PAINT THIS AS JUST SOME MEN  TRYING TO PROTECT THE  NEIGHBORHOOD AND WENT A LONG  WAY TO NORMALIZE THE BEHAVIOR.  NOW THAT THERE IS A SECOND SET  OF EYES AND OVERVIEW FROM THE  D.O.J.  AND THE FAMILY IS WORKING  CLOSELY WITH BOBBI KRISTINA  FROM THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OTHER DISTRICT, THEY ARE  LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL HATE  CRIME PROTECTION.  AND, OTHER FEDERAL OR  PROTECTION. ALSO, FOR THE  SYSTEM WITH THE DISTRICT  ATTORNEYS AND THE LANE COUNTY  DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE  THAT SEEK TO COVER IT UP.  >> WANDA, YOU ARE GOING TO  HOUSTON TO ATTEND GEORGE  FLOYD'S FUNERAL TOMORROW.  WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE FLOYD  FAMILY?  >> THE WORDS WOULD BE THAT I'M  SORRY THIS HAS HAPPENED.  I WAS HOPING WHEN THIS  HAPPENED TO MY SON IN FEBRUARY  THAT THIS WOULD BRING AN END  TO SOME OF THIS, TO SOME OF  THESE TYPES OF EVENTS.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAPPENED  AGAIN SO QUICKLY.  IT WASN'T EVEN THREE MONTHS  AND WE HAD THE SAME TYPE OF  SITUATION AGAIN.  THIS MUST STOP.  >> Reporter: ON THAT NOTE,  WANDA, I KNOW THAT ON FRIDAY  REACHED OUT TO BREONNA  TAYLOR'S MOTH ON WHAT WOULD  HAVE BEEN HER 27th BIRTHDAY.  SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED WHEN  LOUISVILLE POLICE OFFICERS  EXECUTED A NO KNOCK WARRANT  BACK IN MARCH.  WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU  TO REACH OUT AND WHAT WAS THE  CONVERSATION LIKE WITH THE  MOTHER OF BREONNA TAYLOR?  >> I SHARED A VIDEO.  I DIDN'T HAVE THE CONVERSATION  I WANTED TO HAVE. IT WAS VERY  IMPORTANT FOR ME TO REACH OUT  BECAUSE I KNOW HER PAIN  BECAUSE I SHARE THE SAME PAIN.  WE LOST OUR CHILD.  THAT TYPE OF PAIN -- YOU DON'T  KNOW THAT IN THOSE WHO  EXPERIENCE IT FIRSTHAND.  AHMAUD HAD A BIRTHDAY BACK IN  MAY.  IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND I  HAD TO REACH OUT BECAUSE I  KNEW FRIDAY WAS GOING TO BE  VERY DIFFICULT FOR MS. TAYLOR.  >> Reporter: THERE HAVE BEEN A  LOT OF TEARS, WANDA AND I CAN  UNDERSTAND -- I CAN'T  UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARE FEELING, BUT A LOT OF US HAVE CRIED A  LOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF  WEEKS.  I'M INTERESTED ON YOUR TAKE  WHEN YOU SEE THE NEWS  HEADLINES THAT YOU SEE THESE  POWERFUL PICTURES AND YOU HAVE  DEMONSTRATORS AROUND THE  COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD  STANDING UP AGAINST POLICE  BRUTALITY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY AND THEY ARE CHANTING THE  NAMES OF GEORGE FLOYD AND  BREONNA TAYLOR AND YOUR SON,  AHMAUD ARBERY.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU  SEE CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND  THE WORLD AND ARE YOU HOPE FOR  CHANGE TODAY?  >> VERY HOPEFUL.  IT OFFERS STRENGTH WITH THE  DEMONSTRATIONS AND LETS ME  KNOW I'M NOT STANDING ALONE  AND IT SHOWS ME THAT SOMEONE  CARED. IN THE FIRST STAGES, I  WAS THE ONLY VOICE THAT SPOKE  FOR AHMAUD AND NOW PEOPLE ARE  CHANTING HIS NAME. IT GIVES ME  STRENGTH.  >> Reporter: WANDA, WE'VE SEEN  THESE PICTURES AND THE LOVELY  PORTRAIT OF YOUR SON AND THE  STRUGGLE BEFORE THE END OF HIS  LIFE AND THAT IS PRETTY MUCH  WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIM.  CAN YOU SHARE WHAT YOU'D LIKE  US TO KNOW ABOUT AHMAUD?  >> AHMAUD WAS LOVED.  HE LOVED AND HE WAS LOVED BY  MANY.  AHMAUD WAS CARRYING.  AHMAUD WAS KIND.  AHMAUD HAD GOALS AND AMBITIONS  AND IN FEBRUARY, THAT WAS  TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM.  >> Reporter: LEE, WITH  EVERYTHING GOING ON, AND WE  ARE TALKING ABOUT SYSTEMIC  CHANGE, HOPEFULLY, AND THERE  IS TALK ABOUT DISMANTLING OR  REIMAGINING OF POLICE  DEPARTMENTS.  DO YOU SEE GOOD COMING OUT OF  THIS WHEN ALL IS SAID AND  DONE?  >> ABSOLUTELY AND THE TRAGEDY  OF AHMAUD'S CASE IS NOT ONLY  WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, BUT THE  SYSTEM SEEMED TO JUSTIFY THIS  BEHAVIOR AND IT'S CAUSING  PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO  SAY WE NEED TO LOOK BACK AT  THE LAWS AND THE SYSTEMS WE  HAVE IN PLACE AND TO ENSURE  THAT NOTHING LIKE THIS  ACTUALLY HAPPENS AGAIN.  IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE  CASES ARE TIED TOGETHER  BECAUSE NOW WE CAN GO FURTHER  UP THE RIVER TO LOOK AT THE  SYSTEMATIC CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE WITH NEW LAWS, NEW  POLICIES, NEW ELECTED  OFFICIALS.  IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT  REVOLUTIONARY TIME.  >> Reporter: WE THANK BOTH OF  YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS  MORNING.  THIS IS GOING TO BE A  DIFFICULT COUPLE OF DAYS AND  YOU WILL BE RELIVING THAT,  WANDA, AS YOU VISIT GEORGE  FLOYD'S FUNERAL.  WE APPRECIATE IT AND WE THANK  YOU FOR TAKING TIME.  >>> WERE JOINED BY A FORMER  NBA PLAYER, STEVEN JACKSON, A  CLOSE FRIEND OF GEORGE FLOYD  AND HE JOINS US FROM HOUSTON,  TEXAS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS  MORNING.  >> HOW YOU DOING?  >> DOING OKAY.  LET'S TALK ABOUT GEORGE  FLOYD'S 6-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,  GIANNA.  WE SAW HER ON YOUR SHOULDERS  SHOUTING DADDY CHANGE THE  WORLD.  HOW IS SHE DOING?  >> SHE IS DOING AS GOOD AS  POSSIBLE.  FOR 6 YEARS OLD, SHE'S VERY  INTELLIGENT AND KNOWS  EVERYTHING GOING ON AND SHE  NEEDS A LOT OF PRAYER.  SHE IS DEFINITELY SCARRED.  IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING, EVEN  FOR ME.  SHE'S NOT DOING TOO WELL, BUT  FOR 6 YEARS OLD, AS STRONG AS  POSSIBLE.  >> SHE'S GOT QUITE THE VILLAGE  AROUND HER AND WE'VE SEEN OVER  THE PAST 13 DAYS, MASSIVE  PROTESTS, NOT JUST IN THIS  COUNTRY, BUT ALL OVER THE  WORLD.  YOU GUYS LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE,  YOU AND GEORGE FLOYD.  YOU CALLED HIM YOUR TWIN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR TWIN  WOULD SAY ABOUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN PLAY OUT IN THE WORLD OVER  THIS PAST TWO WEEKS?  >> HE WOULD BE SAYING THIS  RIGHT NOW, Y'ALL PUT YOUR KNEE  ON MY NECK AND KILLED ME BUT  YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHY I HAD A  TWIN WHO WAS A CELEBRITY AND  WOULD RIDE WITH ME TILL THE  END.  THE WORLD DIDN'T KNOW THAT.  THEY DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A  FRIEND LIKE ME THAT WAS A  CELEBRITY AND WOULD RIDE FOR  HIM.  I HAVE THE WORLD BEHIND ME AND  I'VE GOT PEOPLE KNOWING I  STAND FOR LOVE.  EVERY THING, I BELIEVE WE ARE  STANDING SIDE-BY-SIDE.  SPREAD THE LOVE AND TRY TO GET  JUSTICE FOR MY BROTHER AND  PEOPLE SEE THIS AND MORE  PEOPLE ARE STANDING WITH LOVE  AND 50 STATES AND 18  COUNTRIES, WE CAN'T BE  STOPPED.  >> YOU MENTIONED ABOUT  PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT  GEORGE FLOYD AND I WANT TO GET  IT RIGHT.  THE PRESIDENT SAID, QUOTE,  HOPEFULLY, GEORGE IS LOOKING  RIGHT DOWN AND SAYING THIS IS  A GOOD THING AND WHEN THE  PRESIDENT SAID THAT, WHAT DID  YOU THINK?  >> I THOUGHT HE COULD'VE  PICKED A BETTER CHOICE OF  WORDS.  THERE'S MORE GOING ON THAN  THINKING MY BROTHER IS LOOKING  DOWN AT ME.  HE SHOULD BE SAYING MORE  THINGS ON HOW TO BRING THIS  COUNTRY TOGETHER AND HOW TO  HELP POLICING AND HELP GET  JUSTICE AND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR  JACK FOR BLACK JOKES.  THIS IS THE SAME PRESIDENT WHO  SAID NEXT TIME YOU PUT HIM IN A CAR, MOVE THEIR HANDS SO THEY  CAN HIT THEIR HEAD.  THE WORLD HAS LOST COMMON  SENSE AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE  MORE CAUTIOUS OF THEIR WORDS  AND SHOW MORE EMPATHY FOR THE  FAMILY. THE THINGS HE IS  SAYING IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED TO  SAY.  I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT  WAS UPSET WITH THAT.  >> THERE HAVE BEEN, AS YOU  KNOW, A NUMBER OF POLICY  SUGGESTIONS AND AMONG THEM,  CALLS TO DEFUND POLICE  DEPARTMENTS ALL OVER THIS  COUNTRY.  MINNEAPOLIS, OVER THE WEEKEND,  VOTED TO DISBAND THEIR POLICE  DEPARTMENT AND I KNOW GEORGE'S  BROTHER WILL TESTIFY FOR  CONGRESS LATER THIS WEEK.  SPECIFICALLY, WHAT KINDS OF  POLICIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE  PUT IN PLACE?  >> I WANT PEOPLE COMING BACK  TO COMMON SENSE.  THE WORLD HAS LOST COMMON  SENSE.  WE JUST WANT A QUALITY.  THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES IN  PLACE THAT GIVE THESE POLICEMEN THE CONFIDENCE TO MURDER PEOPLE AND DO THINGS BECAUSE THE  REPERCUSSIONS AREN'T THERE AND  THEY DON'T DEAL WITH THE SAME  PUNISHMENTS WE DEAL WITH.  WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT AND WE  NEED TO PUT MORE PEOPLE FROM  NEIGHBORHOODS THEY ARE  POLICING, THEY NEED TO BE FROM  THESE NEIGHBORHOODS.  WHEN YOU GET POLICE FROM THESE  NEIGHBORHOODS, THEY WILL BE  SLOW TO ACT IN VIOLENT WAYS  AND COULD EASILY CALL SOMEBODY  FROM THEIR FAMILY BECAUSE THEY  WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THEM.  WE NEED POLICE THAT POLICE THE  AREAS WE GREW UP IN AND WE  WON'T HAVE AS MUCH VIOLENCE.  >> THEY ARE IN HOUSTON RIGHT  NOW.  THE PUBLIC MEMORIAL, A PRIVATE  FUNERAL TOMORROW.  HOW IS YOUR FRIEND GOING TO BE  REMEMBERED IN HOUSTON?  >> I'VE BEEN RIGHT IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD, RIGHT AROUND THE  CORNER WHERE HE WAS FOR THE  LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS.  THE OUTCRY OF SUPPORT IS  UNBELIEVABLE WITH EVERYBODY  THINKING HE WAS A GREAT GUY, A  LEGEND IN THIS CITY, MAN.  THAT'S THE WAY HE NEEDS TO BE  LAID TO REST.  A LOT OF THE PEOPLE HE GREW UP  WITH AND WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL  WITH, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY  WILL MAKE IT TO THE FUNERAL.  GEORGE IS LOVED, A GOOD GUY.  THEY LOVED GEORGE BECAUSE OF  HIS GOOD HEART AND THE LOVE HE  SHOWED AROUND THE CITY.  PEOPLE WANT THIS DONE THE RIGHT WAY.  I'M NOT DONE, WE ARE NOT DONE.  WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  FIGHT FOR JUSTICE.  WE HAVE A MARCH IN MINNESOTA ON THURSDAY AND MY BROTHER'S NAME  WILL BE THE NAME OF CHANGE.  THE NAME OF GEORGE FLOYD.  >> STEPHEN JACKSON, THANK YOU  FOR YOUR TIME.  >>> IT'S 8:42 AND WE HAVE AN  INSPIRING GROUNDBREAKER,  SAVANNAH.  >> YES.  A FORMER PROSECUTOR, A MOTHER  AND SHE WILL MAKE HISTORY AS  THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SERVE  A NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT AND  WE WILL TALK WITH HER IN JUST  A MOMENT BUT FIRST, HER STORY.  >>> 39-YEAR-OLD GIN13 WASN'T  ALWAYS SURE SHE WANTED TO BE A  LAWYER BUT NOW, SHE'S A  TRADITIONAL TRAILBLAZER.  >> IT'S HUMBLING TO BE  NOMINATED AND I'M BEYOND  ENTHUSIASTIC.  >> GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY  NOMINATED HER TO THE SUPREME  COURT IN NEW JERSEY, THE FIRST  BLACK WOMAN IN HISTORY.  >> THERE IS NO BETTER MEETING  OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE  TIMES.  >> THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO  HOLD STATEWIDE OFFICE IN NEW  JERSEY SINGS HER PRAISES.  >> SHE IS PROOF OF WHAT IS  POSSIBLE WHEN ONE DOES NOT  LIMIT THEMSELVES TO WHAT  OTHERS THINK THEY CAN DO.  >> FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS HAS  TRAVELED A LONG ROAD TO REACH  THIS BENCH.  HER PARENTS EMIGRATED FROM  HAITI AND HE WORKED AS A CAB  DRIVER AND SHE WORKED IN THE  HOSPITAL.  FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS STARTED  LIFE IN A CRAMPED BROOKLYN  APARTMENT SHARED WITH SEVEN  RELATIVES BEFORE THE FAMILY  MOVED TO NEW JERSEY.  SHE GRADUATED RUTGERS LAW  SCHOOL AND BECAME AN ASSISTANT  U.S. ATTORNEY, HEADING UP  OFFICES IN TRENTON AND CAMDEN.  ON FRIDAY, SHE WALKED INTO  HISTORY.  >> I KNOW OF TRULY LIVED AND  CONTINUE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN  DREAM THAT MY PARENTS CAME TO  THIS COUNTRY IN SEARCH OF.  >> FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS JOINS  US NOW AND GOOD MORNING.  I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD CALL YOU  MADAME JUSTICE BUT I KNOW YOU  HAVE TO GET CONFIRMED FIRST.  >> ABSOLUTELY.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.  >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO GET  THAT CALL FROM GOVERNOR MURPHY  AND WHAT IT SOAKED IN AS FOR  YOU.  SERVING ON THE SUPREME COURT.  >> SUCH AN HONOR TO BE  NOMINATED TO THE HIGHEST  COURT.  I FEEL INCREDIBLY BLESSED AND  UNFORTUNATE THAT GOVERNOR  MURTHY SAW IN ME THE  EXPERIENCE TO NOMINATE ME TO  THE COURT.  IT'S SUCH A PHENOMENAL  OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE STATE  OF NEW JERSEY.  I BEGAN WITH BEING A LAW CLERK  TO JUSTICE JOHN WALLACE JR.  AND THE IDEA THAT I MIGHT ONE  DAY SIT IN THE SAME SEAT HE  OCCUPIED IS UNBELIEVABLE.  >> I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOUR  LAW CLERK DAYS AND IF YOU EVEN  DREAMED ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE  THIS?  HOW ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?  IMMIGRANTS FROM HAITI AND THEY  EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM AND  YOU EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM.  WHAT DID THEY THINK WHEN YOU  TOLD THEM THE NEWS?  >> MY PARENTS WERE SPEECHLESS.  THEY ARE SO OVERJOYED AND SO  HAPPY AND PROUD.  I THINK THERE WERE SO MANY  EMOTIONS THAT THEY CONTINUE TO  EXPERIENCE THIS AFTER  REALIZING THE MAGNITUDE OF  THIS NOMINATION.  THEY ARE EXTREMELY PROUD AND  HAPPY.  >> YOU KNOW, THIS NOMINATION  WAS IN THE WORKS LONG BEFORE  THIS PARTICULAR CULTURAL  MOMENT THAT WE ARE IN.  YOU ARE, AS THE GOVERNOR SET,  SO WELL SUITED.  HE WORKED AS A FEDERAL  PROSECUTOR, IN CHARGE OF THE  CRIMINAL DIVISION IN SOME OF  THE TOUGHEST CITIES IN NEW  JERSEY.  WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS  MOVEMENT WILL MEAN TO THE  SYSTEM?  >> AGAIN, IT'S INCREDIBLY  HUMBLING AND AN HONOR TO BE  NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME  COURT.  IF CONFIRMED, IF I DO BREAK  THAT BARRIER TO BECOME THE  FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SIT ON  THE COURT, I HOPE TO BE AN  INSPIRATION TO FUTURE  GENERATIONS.  I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR  YOUNG PEOPLE TO SEE PEOPLE  THAT LOOK LIKE THEM WHO HAVE  SIMILAR BACKGROUNDS AS THEM IN  LEADERSHIP POSITIONS.  I TRULY HOPE TO BE AN  INSPIRATION TO OTHERS AND I  LOOK TO BRING A DIVERSE  PERSPECTIVE TO THE COURT.  >> WE KNOW YOU ARE A HARD  WORKER.  YOU ARE THE MOM OF TWO YOUNG  SONS AND YOU'VE BEEN  PRACTICING LAW ALL THESE  YEARS.  WHAT DO YOUR KIDS THINK ABOUT  MOM BECOMING A SUPREME COURT  JUSTICE?  >> MY SONS, ROB AND MARK, THEY  ARE SEVEN AND FOUR AND DON'T  QUITE UNDERSTAND THE  PARTICULARS OF THE JUDICIARY  SYSTEM.  BUT, THEY WERE THRILLED TO  MEET THE GOVERNOR ON FRIDAY  AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY  COOL TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE  CUES AND THEY HAVE A CONCEPT  OF WHAT A JUDGE IS AND THEY  THINK IT'S PRETTY EXCITING.  >> IT IS.  FABIANA PIERRE-LOUIS, THANK  YOU SO MUCH.  I'M A MOM OF LITTLE KIDS AND  IT WOULD BE NICE TO BRING A  GAVEL HOME.  SOMETIMES MOMS NEED TO LAY  DOWN THE LAW, TOO.  >> THAT'S FUNNY.  WE ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF  PHONE GAVELS AT HOME.  THEY OFTEN JOKE AND BANG THE  PHONE GAVELS AND SAY, ORDER IN  THE COURT.  THAT'S HOW I EXPLAIN I MIGHT  BE COMING INTO BEING A JUDGE.  >> THANK YOU SO MUCH AND  CONGRATULATIONS ON WE WILL  FOLLOW YOUR INCREDIBLE STORY.

EVEN AS HEALTHCARE WORKERS  STEPPED OUT INTO THE STREET TO  PROTEST INJUSTICE.  >> I AM THINKING ABOUT COVID-19  AND MAKING SURE THAT JUSTICE IS  SERVED AND THAT THIS NEVER  HAPPENS AGAIN.  >> A POWERFUL MOVEMENT.  NEW YORK CITY HAS REOPENED ITS  ECONOMY TODAY.  >> 15 SITES ARE DEDICATED FOR  PROTESTERS TO GET A TEST AND  GET IT EXPEDITIOUSLY.  PLEASE GET A TEST.  >> TESTING IN COLLEGE SPORTS IS  ALSO RAISING RED FLAGS.  ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE REPORTS,  SEVERAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS FROM  THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA HAVE  THE VIRUS.  AUBURN SAYS THREE PLAYERS  TESTED POSITIVE.  >>> ONE PLAYER SAID HE WAS  ASYMPTOMATIC BUT NOW HAS COVID- 19.  ALABAMA HAS THE MOST PROMINENT  FOOTBALL PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. THEY SAID THE HEALTH AND SAFETY  OF ATHLETES IS THEIR TOP  PRIORITY.  KENNEDY CAIN IS A FIGHTER. KENNEDY KANE IS A FIGHTER.  SHE IS NOT ONLY A STRAIGHT A  STUDENT AT ONE OF THE BEST  PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN DETROIT,  >> AFTER MONTH WITH NO  ASSIGNMENTS SHE LAUNCHED AN  ONLINE PLATFORM.  THAT HAS NOT MADE IT EASIER.  >> IT IS MEANT FOR THE TEACHERS  AS WELL.  SOMETIMES THE TEACHERS HAVE  DIFFICULTIES WHEN THEY ARE  TRYING TO PROGRAM IT AND THEN  THEY ASSIGN IT AS IF THEY KNOW  THAT EVERYONE HAS THE  OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TECHNOLOGY  IN THEIR HOME, WHEN THAT IS NOT  THE CASE.  IT IS FRUSTRATING.  >> 10% OF STUDENTS HAD ACCESS  TO A COMPUTER AND THE INTERNET  WITH SCHOOLS CLOSE.  THAT IS TROUBLING. THREE YEARS  AGO THE SUPERINTENDENT INHERITED A SYSTEM LONG ON PROMISE AND  SHORT ON RESOURCES.  >> WHAT WAS THE STATE OF THE  DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  BEFORE THE CORONAVIRUS.  >> ENROLLMENT WAS UP.  STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SHOWED  IMPROVEMENT.  >> THE TEACHERS SUPPLY HAS  IMPROVED BY 70%.  I LOVE IT.  >> THIS TEACHER TEACHES 11th  GRADE MAP.  STUDENTS ARE LESS AND LESS  COMMITTED TO SCHOOL.  >> THE FIRST WEEK I WAS INTO IT  50 TO 60% AND NOW IT IS ABOUT  20%.  >> WHAT PERCENT OF STUDENTS DO  THE WORK?  >> 10%.  >> THAT'S NOT VERY MANY.  >> NO.  NOT VERY MANY AT ALL.  >>  >>REPORTER: LITTLE LEARNING HAS  TAKEN PLACE SINCE MARCH.  >> THERE IS NO DENYING THERE IS  A DIGITAL DIVIDE.  IT IS SEVEN MILES FROM DOWNTOWN  DETROIT.  THERE WAS A COMPUTER IN EVERY  KIDS HANDS IN THIS COMMUNITY.  >> I DID NOT HAVE L LAPTOP.  I WAS ISSUED ONE RIGHT AFTER  SCHOOL ENDED.  >> HE IS A DEDICATED STUDENT.  >> WE CAN GO TO THE REMOTE  LEARNING RESOURCES.  >> HE HAS DREAMS OF GOING TO  UCLA AND HE IS WELL ON HIS WAY  WITH LOTS OF SUPPORT.  PARTICIPATION IN ONLINE CLASSES  IS 95%, MUCH HIGHER JUST ONE  ZIP CODE AWAY IN DETROIT WHERE  IT IS 50%.  THAT IS A REFLECTION OF  SYSTEMIC RACISM.  >> THE NUMBERS TELL PART OF THE  STORY.  IN DETROIT THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME  IS $30,000 AND THE POPULATION  IS 80% BLACK.  IN TORRENT THE INCOME IS  $100,000 WITH A BACK BLACK  POPULATION OF 2%.  >> THERE IS RACIAL DIVIDE.  >> YES.  THE HAVES RECEIVED MORE THAN  THE HAVE-NOTS.  CHILDREN ARE COMING IN WITH  FEWER RESOURCES THAN UPPER- MIDDLE-CLASS STUDENTS BUT THE  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SHOULD BE  THE GREAT EQUALIZER.  INSTEAD IT EXACERBATES THE  SITUATION.  >> THEY ARE GETTING $23 MILLION  TO GIVE EVERY STUDENT A LAPTOP.  THAT DOESN'T HELP THIS SUMMER.  >> WE CAN ANTICIPATE MOST  CHILDREN LOSING SIX MONTHS OF  WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD  WE BEEN IN SCHOOL.  >> SIX MONTHS BEHIND COULD BE A  KNOCKOUT PUNCH.  IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT  SMART, JUST BECAUSE OF WHERE  THEY LIVE.  GROSSE POINTE IS RIGHT NEXT TO  US.  THEY HAVE HAD RESOURCES FROM  THE TIME THE PANDEMIC STARTED.  WE SAID WHY, WHY CAN'T WE BE  LIKE THAT AND GIVE TO OUR  STUDENTS LIKE THEY ARE? OUR  STUDENTS ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM  THEIRS.  >> I ASKED WHERE HER COURAGE  AND WISDOM CAME FROM.  SHE SAID HER MOTHER WHO SHE  CALLED A SUPERHERO.  ONE FINAL POINT.  THERE WAS A STUDY LOOKING AT  JUST UNDER 1 MILLION STUDENTS  AND THEY FOUND IN THE POOR ZIP  CODES THE MATH LEARNING HAS  BEEN REDUCED BY 50% AND IN  OTHER ZIP CODES, NO LEARNING  LOSS.  >> WHAT ABOUT THE DIGITAL  DIVIDE FOR INTERNET ACCESS?  >> THAT IS PART OF IT.  THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A PROBLEM.  >> YES.  REMEMBER WHEN THE FAMILY GOT IN  THE CAR TO WHERE THERE WAS  INTERNET ACCESS?  YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE PEOPLE  ARE BLOCKS APART IN THEIR HOMES  AND THE DISPARITY IS SO GREAT.  >>> WELCOME BACK. IT'S HARD TO  BELIEVE BUT IT HAS BEEN THREE  MONTHS SINCE ARBOR HE WAS SHOT  AND KILLED WHEN HE WAS OUT FOR  A JOG.  >> YES.  THIS FATHER AND SON AND THEIR  NEIGHBOR ARE CHARGED WITH  MURDER.  THE McMICHAEL'S TOLD POLICE  THEY THOUGHT HE WAS A BURGLARY  SUSPECT AND CLAIMED THEY ACTED  IN SELF-DEFENSE.  LAST WEEK THERE WERE TROUBLING  NEW CLAIMS THAT A JUDGE RULED  THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE NOW  FOR TRIAL.  THIS MORNING WE ARE JOINED BY  HIS MOTHER AND HER LAWYER.  GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU.  >> GOOD MORNING.  >> LET'S BEGIN HERE.  LAST WEEK THAT JUDGE REVEALED  THAT A DEFENDANT UTTERED A  RACIAL SLUR AFTER AHMAD WAS  KILLED.  YOU ARE IN THE COURTROOM.  WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU  HEARD THAT AND HOW SIGNIFICANT  IS THIS FINDING TO YOU?  >> IT WAS SHOCKING.  JUST A NO THAT SOMEONE COULD  ACTUALLY TAKE A LIFE AND STILL  NOT HAVE ANY REMORSE IN THE  LAST MINUTES OF THEIR LIFE.  >> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.  GEORGIA IS ONE OF THE FEW  STATES THAT DOES NOT HAVE A  HATE CRIME STATUTE.  HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THIS CASE?  >> WE NEED THERE TO BE A  STANDARD FOR THE MURDER CHARGE.  EACH MAN IS CHARGED WITH FELONY  MURDER.  THEY HAVE A JUSTIFICATION OF  DEFENSE BUT IT IS NO LONGER  GOOD WHEN THEY HAVE A SLUR WHEN  STANDING OVER A DEAD BODY.  >> A DISTRICT ATTORNEY RECUSED  HIMSELF BECAUSE OF HIS TIES TO  THE McMICHAEL'S.  WE SAID THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT  PROBABLE CAUSE TO ISSUE ARREST  WARRANTS.  UNDER THE LAW HE COULD USE  DEADLY FORCE TO PROTECT  HIMSELF.  NOW THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION  INTO HOW THE HECK CASE WAS  HANDLED.  THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE.  WHAT DO YOU THINK?  >> THE STATE ATTORNEY OBVIOUSLY  TRIED TO SAY WAS MEN TRYING TO  PROTECT THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  NOW THERE ARE A SECOND SET OF  EYES ON IT AND THEY ARE WORKING  WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND  THEY ARE LOOKING AT FEDERAL  HATE CRIMES AND NOT ONLY FOR  THE MEN WHO MURDERED THE MAN  BUT ALTHOUGH FOR THE SYSTEM.  THEY WORK COVERING IT UP.  >> AND, YOU AND LEE ARE HEADED  TO HOUSTON TO ATTEND THE  FUNERAL FOR GEORGE FLOYD.  WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY TO THE  FAMILY?  >> I AM SORRY THIS IS HAPPENED.  I WAS HOPING WHEN THIS HAPPENED  TO MY SON THAT IT WOULD BRING  AN END TO SOME OF THIS -- SOME  OF THESE TYPE OF EVENTS.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAPPENED AGAIN SO QUICKLY.  IT WASN'T EVEN THREE MONTHS AND  WE HAD THE SAME TYPE OF  SITUATION AGAIN.  >> ON THAT NOTE, I KNOW ON  FRIDAY YOU REACHED OUT TO  RHIANNA TAYLOR'S MOTHER ON WHAT  WOULD'VE BEEN HER 27th BIRTHDAY. WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU  TO REACH OUT? WHAT WAS THAT  CONVERSATION LIKE WITH  BREANNA'S MOTHER?  >> I SHARED A VIDEO. I DID NOT  HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT I  WANTED TO HAVE.  IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO  REACH OUT BECAUSE I KNOW THE  PAIN.  I SHARE THE SAME PAIN.  WE LOST OUR CHILD.  THAT TYPE OF PAIN, YOU DON'T  KNOW THAT PAIN UNTIL YOU  EXPERIENCE IT FIRSTHAND.  >> HE HAD A BIRTHDAY IN MAY AND  IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT.  HAD TO REACH OUT.  I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE VERY  DIFFICULT FOR HER.  >> THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF  TEARS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW  HOW YOU ARE FEELING BUT A LOT  OF US HAVE CRIED A LOT OVER THE  PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  I AM INTERESTED IN YOUR TAKE  WHEN YOU SEE THESE POWERFUL  PICTURES AND YOU HAVE  DEMONSTRATORS AROUND THE WORLD  STANDING UP AGAINST POLICE  BRUTALITY AND THEY ARE CHANGING  THE WORLD BY CHANTING THE NAMES  OF THESE CHILDREN.  WHAT YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU SEE  THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE  WORLD?  ARE YOU HOPEFUL FOR CHANGE?  >> I AM NOT STANDING ALONE.  IT SHOWS ME THAT SOMEONE HERE  CARES.  IN THE BEGINNING, IN THE FIRST  STAGES, I WAS THE ONLY VOICE  THAT SPOKE.  NOW PEOPLE ARE CHANTING HIS NAME . IT REALLY GIVES [ INAUDIBLE  ].  >> OKAY.  WE HAVE SEEN THESE PICTURES AND  THE LOVELY PORTRAIT OF YOUR SON  AND THE STRUGGLE RIGHT BEFORE  THE END OF HIS LIFE.  THAT IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HIM.  CAN YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT YOU  WOULD LIKE US TO KNOW ABOUT  HIM?  >> HE WAS LOVED.  HE LOVED AND WAS LOVED BY MANY.  HE WAS CARING AND KIND. HE HAD  GOALS AND AMBITIONS.  BACK IN FEBRUARY, THAT WAS ALL  TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM.  >> LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.  WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING  ON, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT  SYSTEMIC CHANGE, HOPEFULLY AND  TALK ABOUT DISMANTLING OR  REIMAGINING OF POLICE  DEPARTMENTS.  DO YOU SEE SOME GOOD COMING OUT  OF THIS WHEN ALL IS SAID AND  DONE?  >> ABSOLUTELY.  PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF  AHMAD.  THE TRAGEDY IS NOT ONLY WHAT  HAPPENED TO HIM BUT THE SYSTEM  THAT SEEMED TO JUSTIFY THIS.  IT TOOK PEOPLE TO SAY MAYBE YOU  NEED TO LOOK BACK AT THE LAW.  YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING  LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.  THESE CASES NEED TO BE TIED  TOGETHER. WE NEED TO LOOK AT A  SYSTEMATIC CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO  TAKE PLACE TWO NEW LAWS AND NEW  OFFICIALS.  >> WE THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING  WITH US THIS MORNING.  IT WILL BE A DIFFICULT COUPLE  OF DAYS. YOU WILL RELIVE  EVERYTHING AS YOU GO TO VISIT  GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY.  >> NOW WE HAVE STEPHEN JACKSON.  HE JOINS US FROM HOUSTON,  TEXAS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  >> GOOD MORNING.  HOW ARE YOU DOING?  >> OKAY.  BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS  GOING TO HAPPEN IN HOUSTON, LET  ME ASK YOU ABOUT HIS SIX-YEAR- OLD DAUGHTER.  THAT IMAGE OF HER ON YOUR  SHOULDERS AS SHE IS SHOUTING  DADDY CHANGE THE WORLD.  HOW IS SHE DOING?  >> AS WELL AS POSSIBLE.  SHE WAS SIX YEARS OLD.  SHE IS VERY INTELLIGENT AND SHE  KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON.  SHE NEEDS A LOT OF PRAYER.  SHE IS DEFINITELY SCARRED.  AND HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR ME  AND SHE IS NOT DOING TOO WELL  BUT FOR A SIX-YEAR-OLD, SHE IS  AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE.  >> SHE HAS QUITE A VILLAGE  AROUND HER.  >> MASSIVE PROTESTS IN THIS  COUNTRY AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.  YOU AND GEORGE FLOYD YOU CALLED  HIM YOUR TWIN, WHAT DO YOU  THINK YOUR TWIN WOULD SAY ABOUT  WHAT WE HAVE SEEN PLAY OUT OVER  THE WORLD OVER THE LAST TWO  WEEKS?  >> I KNOW HE WOULD BE SAYING  THIS, YOU PUT YOUR NEIL MY NECK  BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW I HAD A  TWIN.  THE WORLD DIDN'T KNOW THAT.  THE POLICE DID KNOW THAT.  THEY DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A  FRIEND LIKE ME.  NOW I HAVE THE WORLD BEHIND ME  AND I SAID I HAVE MORE POWER  THEN TRUMP AND BIDEN.  EVERY RACE IS TOLD ME THAT THEY  LOVE ME.  I HAVE EVERYBODY STANDING SIDE  BY SIDE.  I'M TRYING TO GET JUSTICE FOR  MY BROTHER.  PEOPLE SEE THE CRUELTY AND HATE  FROM THAT MAN.  WE CAN'T BE STOPPED.  >> YOU MENTIONED PRESIDENT TRUMP . HE TALKED ABOUT GEORGE FLOYD  FRIDAY AND THAT ADDRESS, I WANT  TO MAKE SURE I GET IT RIGHT,  HOPEFULLY HE IS LOOKING DOWN  RIGHT NOW AND SAYING THIS IS A  GREAT THING THAT IS HAPPENING  FOR OUR COUNTRY.  WHEN THE CON PRESIDENT SAID  THAT, WHAT DID YOU THINK?  >> IT IS MORE THAN JUST LOOKING  DOWN AND BEING HAPPY.  HE SHOULD BE SAYING MORE THINGS  ON HOW TO BRING THIS COUNTRY  TOGETHER AND HELP WITH POLICING  AND GET JUSTICE FOR LACK PEOPLE  AND EQUAL RIGHTS.  THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS HE  COULD TALK ABOUT INSTEAD OF  MAKING JOKES.  THIS IS THE SAME PRESIDENT WHO  SAID THE NEXT TIME YOU PUT THEM  IN THE CAR, MOVE YOUR HAND SO  THEY CAN HIT THEIR HEAD.  YOU NEED TO SHOW MORE EMPATHY  FOR THE FAMILY AND USE YOUR  WORDS CAREFULLY.  THE THINGS HE IS SAYING RIGHT  NOW IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED TO  SAY.  I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT  WAS UPSET WITH THAT.  >> YES.  THERE HAVE BEEN POLICY  SUGGESTIONS AND CALLS TO DEFUND  POLICE DEPARTMENTS ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY.  MINNEAPOLIS OVER THE WEEKEND  VOTED TO DISBAND THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  GEORGE'S BROTHER WILL TESTIFY  IN FRONT OF CONGRESS.  WHAT KIND OF POLICY WOULD YOU  LIKE TO SEE PUT IN PLACE?  >> FIRST, I WANT PEOPLE TO COME  BACK TO COMMON SENSE.  IT IS EASY TO SEE WHEN SOMEONE  HAS BEEN TREATED WRONG.  WE JUST WANT A QUALITY.  POLICEMAN ARE COMFORTABLE  MURDERING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY  DON'T DEAL WITH THE  REPERCUSSIONS.  WHEN WILL WE CHANGE THAT?  >> THEY NEED TO HAVE POLICE IN  THESE NEIGHBORHOODS.  THEY ARE SLOW TO ACT AND THEY  COULD CALL SOMEBODY THERE  BECAUSE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL  WITH THEM.  WE NEED POLICE IN THE AREAS  THAT THEY GROW UP IN.  >> YOU ARE IN HOUSTON RIGHT  NOW.  THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC MEMORIAL  TODAY AND A PRIVATE FUNERAL  TOMORROW. HOW IS YOUR FRIEND  GOING TO BE REMEMBERED THERE IN  HOUSTON?  >> I HAVE BEEN IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE CORNER  WHERE HE GREW UP FOR THE LAST  COUPLE OF DAYS.  THE OUTCRY OF SUPPORT IS  UNBELIEVABLE.  GEORGE WAS A GREAT GUY.  HE WAS A RESIDENT IN THE CITY  AND THIS IS WHERE HE NEEDS TO  BE LAID TO REST.  IT IS GREAT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE  WHO HE GREW UP WITH, I DON'T  KNOW THEY WILL MAKE IT TO THE  FUNERAL BUT GEORGE IS LOVED.  YOU WAS A GOOD GUY.  HE SHOWED A LOT OF LOVE AROUND  THE CITY.  PEOPLE WANT TO GET THIS DONE  THE RIGHT WAY.  I AM NOT DONE.  WE ARE NOT DONE.  WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  FIGHT FOR JUSTICE.  WHEN YOU HEAR GEORGE, IT WILL BE THE NAME OF CHANGE.  >> STEPHEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR  TIME.  8:42 N AND INSPIRING GROUNDBREAKER.  >> YES.  SHE WILL MAKE HISTORY AS THE  FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO BE ON THE  SUPREME COURT.  WE WILL TALK TO HER IN JUST A  MOMENT.  >>> SHE WAS NOT ALWAYS SURE SHE  WANTED TO BE A LAWYER.  NOW, SHE IS A TRAILBLAZER.  >> IT IS HUMBLING TO BE  NOMINATED AND I AM BEYOND  EXCITED AND ENTHUSIASTIC.  >> SHE WAS NOMINATED TO THE  SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF  NEW JERSEY, THE FIRST BLACK  WOMAN IN ITS HISTORY.  >> THERE IS NO BETTER MEANING  OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE TIMES.  >>  >> SHE IS PROOF OF WHAT IS  POSSIBLE WHEN ONE DOES NOT  LIMIT THEMSELVES TO WHAT OTHERS  THINK THEY CAN DO.  >> SHE HAS TRAVELED A LONG ROAD  TO GET TO THE HIGHEST SPENT.  HER PARENTS IMMIGRATED FROM  HAITI. HE WAS A CABDRIVER AND  SHE WORKED IN A HOSPITAL.  SHE STARTED IN EIGHT CRAMPED  BROOKLYN APARTMENT WITH SEVEN  RELATIVES.  THEY MOVED TO NEW JERSEY.  SHE BECAME AN ASSISTANT U.S.  ATTORNEY HEADING UP OFFICES IN  TRENTON AND FRIDAY SHE WALKED  INTO HISTORY.  >> I KNOW I WILL LIVE THE  AMERICAN DREAM THAT MIKE  PARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN  SEARCH OF.  >> SHE JOINS US LIVE.  >> GOOD MORNING.  I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD CALL YOU  MADAM JUSTICE BUT I KNOW YOU  HAVE TO BE CONFIRMED FIRST.  >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.  >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO GET THAT  CALL FROM THE GOVERNOR AND WHEN  IT SOAKED IN, WHAT THIS MEANS  TO BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO  SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT?  >> IT IS AN HONOR TO BE  NOMINATED TO THE STATE'S  HIGHEST COURT.  I HAVE BEEN FEELING INCREDIBLY  BLESSED AND I AM FORTUNATE THAT  THEY SAW IN ME THE DILIGENCE. I  THINK IT IS A PHENOMENAL  OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE STATE  OF NEW JERSEY.  I BEGAN AS A LAW CLERK THERE.  THE IDEA THAT I MAYBE ONE DAY  WOULD SIT IN THE SEAM SEAT THAT  HE OCCUPIED IS UNBELIEVABLE.  >> I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT.  I WONDERED IF YOU LET YOURSELF  DREAM OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS.  AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?  THEY EMBODY THE AMERICAN DREAM,  IMMIGRANTS FROM HAITI.  WHAT DID THEY THINK WHEN YOU  TOLD THEM THE NEWS?  >> MY PARENTS WERE SPEECHLESS.  THEY ARE SO HAPPY AND SO PROUD  AND THERE WERE SO MANY EMOTIONS  THAT THEY CONTINUED TO  EXPERIENCE AFTER REALIZING THE  MAGNITUDE OF THIS NOMINATION.  THEY ARE EXTREMELY PROUD AND  HAPPY.  >> THIS NOMINATION WAS IN THE  WORKS LONG BEFORE THIS  PARTICULAR CULTURAL MOMENT THAT  WE ARE IN.  YOU ARE SO WELL-SUITED TO IT.  YOU WORKED AS A FEDERAL  PROSECUTED AND WORKED IN SOME  OF THE TOUGHEST CITIES IN NEW  JERSEY.  WHAT WILL THIS MEAN TO THE  SYSTEM?  >> AGAIN, IT IS INCREDIBLY  HUMBLING AND AN HONOR TO BE  NOMINATED.  IF CONFIRMED, IF I DO BREAK  THAT BARRIER AND BECOME THE  FIRST BLACK WOMAN ON THE COURT,  I HOPE TO BE AN INSPIRATION TO  FUTURE GENERATIONS.  I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR  YOUNG PEOPLE TO SEE PEOPLE THAT  LOOK LIKE THEM AND HAVE SIMILAR  BACKGROUNDS AS THEM IN  LEADERSHIP POSITIONS.  I HOPE TO BE A AN INSPIRATION  TO OTHERS AND I LOOK TO BRING A  DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE TO THE  COURT.  >> WE KNOW YOU ARE A HARD  WORKER, A MOTHER TO TWO YOUNG  SONS.  YOU HAVE BEEN PRACTICING LAW  ALL THESE YEARS.  WHAT YOUR KIDS THINK ABOUT MOM?  >> MY SONS ARE SEVEN AND FOUR  YEARS OLD.  THEY DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND  EVERYTHING BUT THEY WERE  THRILLED TO MEET THE GOVERNOR  FRIDAY AND THEY THOUGHT THAT  WAS REALLY COOL TO SEE  THEMSELVES ON TV.  THEY HAD TO ASK WHETHER THE  JUDGE WAS.  THEY BOTH THINK IT IS PRETTY  EXCITING.  >> IT IS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  MAYBE -- I HAVE A MOM OF LITTLE  KIDS.  IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT  GAVEL AT HOME.  >> YES.  WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PHONE  GAVELS AT HOME.  WE OFTEN JOKE AND BANG THE  PHONE GAVELS AND SAY ORDER IN  THE COURT.  THAT IS HOW I EXPLAIN TO THEM  THAT I MIGHT BE DOING THIS.  >> PERFECT.  THANK YOU.

MAKE SURE YOU DO THAT SOON.  ALSO KEEP IN MIND, THE EXTRA  $600 MEANS YOU CAN GET ON THE  STIMULUS PLAN, YOU WANT TO BE  ABLE TO GET THAT BEFORE IT ENDS  ON JULY 31.  >> RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE SCARED.  >> FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN  CONTROL.

WHAT DO YOU SPEND IT ON IN  TERMS OF BASIC NECESSITIES AND  ESSENTIAL ITEMS AND HOW MUCH  SAVINGS DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE?  HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE IN CASH?  TAXABLE INVESTMENTS?  AND HOW MUCH YOU HAVE IN  RETIREMENT?  THAT SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT.  YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOUR  ASSETS ARE.  >> IS THERE A BENEFIT TO NOT  HAVING THIS?  >> YES.  YOU SHOULD SAVE THAT MONEY.  HAVING THAT MONEY IN AN ACCOUNT  SEPARATE FROM YOUR CHECKING  ACCOUNT AND THE INSTITUTION  WHERE YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT IS  GOOD FOR SET DISCIPLINE ON YOU.  THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK  THAT I WOULD HAVE IN TERMS OF E  LUNCH OR GOING OUT FOR DINNER  AND NOW I'M NOT NMI SAVING THE  MONEY.

CHARLOTTE, WELCOME.   >> IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.   WHEN WE ORIGINALLY WANTED TO  TALK TO YOU IT WAS ABOUT COVID- 19 AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT HAS  CHANGED.  I WAS CURIOUS WHAT  YOUR LEARNING FROM THE  GRADUATES, THE YOUNG KIDS THAT  ARE OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT IS  GOING ON AND WHAT IS THEIR  PERCEPTION OF THE POLICE,  PROTESTERS AND THE REST?   >> GEN Z IS THE MOST DIVERSE  GENERATION AND THEY ARE MORE  LIKELY TO SAY RACIAL DIVERSITY  AND IT IS UP TO SOCIETY TO  UNDERSTAND HOW POLICE OFTEN  TREAT BLACK AND WHITE PEOPLE  DIFFERENTLY AND SO WHAT I'M  REALLY HEARING OUT THERE IS  THEY REALLY ARE SOPHISTICATED  IN UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURAL  RACES IN AMERICA AND THE SENSE  THAT PROTESTING FOR THE YOUNG  PEOPLE IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP  IN NEARLY EVERY YOUNG PERSON  I'VE SPOKEN TO ON THE STREET  OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS  HAS SAID THAT THEY ARE OUT HERE  MARCHING OUT DEMONSTRATING  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF WHAT  THEY ARE GOING TO DO TO ADDRESS  THE SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR  COUNTRY.   >> MAJOR HISTORIC EVENTS HAVE A  DIFFERENT IMPACT ON YOUNG  PEOPLE.   JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BETWEEN  THE AGES OF 14 AND 24 AND THOSE  -- THE EVENTS WILL HAVE A MAJOR  EFFECT ON THEIR WORLDVIEW SO  HOW IS EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING  ON GOING TO GENERATE -- SHAPE  GEN Z?   >> THINK OF IT HOW WHAT HAPPENS  TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE A KID  CHANGES YOUR PSYCHOLOGY INTO  ADULTHOOD AND THAT HAPPENS ON A  BROAD GENERATIONAL LEVEL AS  WELL AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM  MANY IS THAT LIKE SCHOOL  SHOOTINGS AND CLIMATE CHANGE  THE POLICE KILLINGS OF BLACK  AMERICANS HAVE BEEN A DRUM BE  THROUGH THEIR EARLY ADULTHOOD  AND MANY OF THEM THEY REMEMBER  WHEN ERIC GARNER WAS KILLED AND  WHEN MICHAEL BROWN WAS KILLED  AND THIS IS THE THING THEY HAVE  BEEN AWARE OF THEIR ENTIRE  YOUNG ADULT LIFE WHICH IS  DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY THAT  OLDER PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT IT.   ONE STAT THAT I SAW THAT  ILLUSTRATES THE GENERATIONAL  DIFFERENCES 43% OF GENERATION Z  REPUBLICANS SAY THERE IS  SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THE COUNTRY  WHILE ONLY 20% OF BABY BOOMERS  REPUBLICANS BELIEVE.   THERE'S A BROAD GENERATIONAL  UNDERSTANDING.   >> IT TAKES A LOT TO TAKE A  FINE AND PAINT SOMETHING ON IT  AND STAND AND HOLD IT UP.   TO DEFINE THE GENERATION YOU'RE  TALKING TO, ARE THEY ON THE  FRONT LINES OF THIS BLACK LIVES  MATTER BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE  TO CARE INSIDE TO DO THAT AND  IF THEY ARE, DO THEY FEEL LIKE  THEY ARE BEING HEARD?   >> I THINK BLACK LIVES MATTER  HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MOVEMENT OF  AND BY YOUNG PEOPLE.  IT WAS  STARTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND IT  IS VERY MUCH OF THE DIGITAL  GENERATION.   PART OF THAT IS THAT OFTEN  TIMES OLDER PEOPLE WHO LIVED  THROUGH THE CIVIL RIGHTS  MOVEMENT LOOK AT BLACK LIVES  MATTER AND SAY, WHERE IS MARTIN  LUTHER KING OR MALCOLM X AND  THEY EXPECT FOR THERE TO BE ONE  SINGULAR FIGURE TO STAND FOR  THE WHOLE MOVEMENT AND I THINK  ONE OF THE GENERATIONAL ISSUES  HERE IS THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE DO  NOT NEED FOR THERE TO BE ONE  SINGLE FIGURE.   IT IS A LEADER FULL MOVEMENT  AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT  RESEMBLES THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE  HAVE BEGUN TO LIVE THEIR LIFE  ON SOCIAL MEDIA.   >> WE SEE HOW SOCIAL MEDIA CAN  HELP BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND  HOW IT CAN REALLY START  MOVEMENTS BUT YOU ALSO SAY IN  THIS ARTICLE THAT FOR THIS  GENERATION, IT'S A DOUBLE-EDGED  SWORD AND IT CAN ALSO BE HARD  ON MENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL MEDIA  AND PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING  OUT THERE ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY  IT'S A PROTEST THAT WE SEE  PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT IN REAL  LIFE IN LARGE NUMBERS.   >> WHAT RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND  ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AND GEN Z IS  IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE  PRESENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT  MAKES SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL  ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED.   IT IS WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA  REPLACES OTHER THINGS THAT  YOUNG PEOPLE TYPICALLY DO IN  LIFE TO MAKE THEM HAPPY LIKE  GOING TO HANG OUT WITH THEIR  FRIENDS OR GOING TO A PARTY OR  THE MOVIES OR ANY SORT OF REAL- LIFE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT OUT IN  THE WORLD AND ONE OF THE  REASONS IS THAT GEN Z HAS BEEN  EXPERIENCING HIGH LEVELS OF  DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IS THAT  FOR MANY YOUNG PEOPLE, SOCIAL  MEDIA HAS COME TO REPLACE SOME  OF THE REAL-WORLD INTERACTIONS  THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN  HAVING AND ESPECIALLY WITH  COVID.   >> THANK YOU.

THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US  TODAY.   >>> GRADUATES FROM THE CLASS OF  2020 ARE ENTERING AN AMERICAN  CRISIS WITH COVID-19, THE  STRUGGLING ECONOMY AND IT NOW  CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTS TAKING  PLACE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY  >> CHARLOTTE WROTE A COVER STORY ENTITLED GENERATION PANDEMIC.

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.   >> WHEN WE ORIGINALLY WANTED TO  TALK TO YOU IS ABOUT COVID-19  AND THE EFFECTS IT WAS HAVING  ON THE GRADUATING CLASS AND  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS A  LOT HAS CHANGED.   I WAS CURIOUS WHAT YOUR  LEARNING FROM THE YOUNG KIDS  OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT'S IS GOING  ON AND WHAT IS THEIR PERCEPTION  OF THE POLICE, PROTESTERS AND  THE REST?   >> GEN Z IS THE MOST RACIALLY  DIVERSE GENERATION AND THEY ARE  MUCH MORE LIKELY THAN OLDER  GENERATIONS TO SAY THAT RACIAL  DIVERSITY AND IT IS UP TO  SOCIETY TO UNDERSTAND HOW POLICE TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY.   WHAT I'M HEARING OUT THERE IS  THEY REALLY ARE SOPHISTICATED  AND HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF  STRUCTURAL RACISM AND ALSO IN  THE SENSE THAT PROTESTING FOR  THE YOUNG PEOPLE IS ONLY THE  FIRST STEP IN NEARLY EVERY  YOUNG PERSON I HAVE SPOKEN TO  ON THE STREET OVER THE LAST  COUPLE WEEKS HAVE SAID THAT  THEY ARE OUT HERE MARCHING AND  ARE OUT HERE DEMONSTRATING THAT  IT IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF  WHAT THEY WILL TRY TO DO TO  ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM.   >> RESEARCHERS SAY MAJOR  HISTORICAL EVENTS HAVE A  DIFFERENT IMPACT ON YOUNG  PEOPLE.

HOW IS EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING  ON GOING TO SHAPE GEN Z'S  OUTLOOK?   >> THINK A BIT HOW WHAT HAPPENS  TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE A KID  CHANGES YOUR PSYCHOLOGY INTO  ADULTHOOD AND THAT HAPPENS ON A  BROAD GENERATIONAL LEVEL.   WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MANY OF  THE YOUNG PEOPLE IS THAT  SHOOTINGS AND CLIMATE CHANGE  AND THE POLICE KILLINGS OF  BLACK AMERICA HAVE BEEN A DRUM  BE THROUGH THE EARLY ADULTHOOD  AND MANY OF THEM REMEMBER WHEN  TRAYVON MARTIN WAS KILLED AND  ERIC GARNER WAS KILLED AND WHEN  MICHAEL BROWN WAS KILLED AND  IT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVE BEEN  AWARE OF THEIR ENTIRE YOUNG  ADULT LIFE WHICH IS DIFFERENT  THAN WHAT OLDER PEOPLE FEEL  ABOUT IT.   ONE STAT I SAW THAT ILLUSTRATES  THE GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCE IS  43% OF GEN Z REPUBLICANS SAY  THAT THERE IS SYSTEMIC RACISM  IN THE COUNTRY WHILE ONLY 20%  OF BABY BOOMER REPUBLICANS AGREE .  THERE IS A BROAD  GENERATIONAL UNDERSTANDING.   >> IT TAKES A LOT TO TAKE A  FINE, PAINT SOMETHING ON IT AND  STAND OUT AND HOLD IT UP.   DO YOU FIND THAT GENERATION  YOU'RE TALKING TO, ARE THEY ON  THE FRONT LINES OF THIS BLACK  LIVES MATTER?   >>> THE TRANSITION TO GREATNESS  HAS BEGUN.   FRIDAY'S JOBS REPORT, MORE THAN  2.5 MILLION ADDED AND THE  PROJECTION WAS 7.5 MILLION JOBS  LOST.   THE GREATEST NUMBER OF JOBS  CREATED IN A SYMBOL SINGLE  MONTH ON RECORD.   225,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS,  464,000 CONSTRUCTION JOBS AND  1.2 MILLION LEISURE AND  HOSPITALITY JOBS WERE ADDED.   BEYOND THAT THE NUMBER OF  WORKERS REPORTED BEING ON  TEMPORARY LATE LAYOFFS  DECREASED BY 2.7 MILLION IN MAY  AND MORE THAN THAT AND THIS IS  A GREAT NUMBER THAT WAS POINTED  OUT TODAY BY THE CEA, 300,000  JOBS CREATED FOR BLACK  AMERICANS IN PARTICULAR.   THAT IS IN MAY AND THAT IS A  1.7% INCREASE.   THE JUMP IN AVERAGE WEEKLY  HOURS ALSO AN ENCOURAGING SIGN.  DECREASING OURS IS A SIGN THAT  EMPLOYEES NEED TO HIRE --  EMPLOYERS NEED TO HIRE MORE  WORKERS.   THE AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS  INCREASED BY 0.5% TO 34.7  HOURS, THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE  2006.   73% OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE  OPEN AND THAT IS UP FROM 52%  RIGHT BEFORE THE APRIL JOBS  REPORT REFERENCE PERIOD.   WORKPLACE VISITS ARE UP 40%  FROM THE PANDEMIC LOW.   THE STOCK MARKET IS ABSOLUTELY  SOARING.   WE SAW WITH THE S&P THAT IT HAD  THE GREATEST 50 DAY RALLY IN  HISTORY AND THE DOW IS ALSO  BOOMING.   THE MARKETS CLEARLY HAVE  CONFIDENCE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP,  CREAMING THE HOTTEST ECONOMY IN  MODERN-DAY HISTORY.   ALSO COMMENTATORS AND  ECONOMISTS HAVE NOTED HOW GREAT  THE JOBS REPORT WAS.   YESTERDAY WE SAW THE CHIEF  ECONOMIC ADVISOR SAY THIS WILL  GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE  BIGGEST POSITIVE DATA SHOCK FOR  THE MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY AND  YOU SAW HOW SURPRISED THE  MARKETS WERE.  THEY SURGED ON  FRIDAY CAPPING A STRONG WEEK  WITH THE NASDAQ CLOSING AT A  RECORD HIGH AND IT WAS  SURPRISING TO THE ECONOMIST  THAT NOT A SINGLE ONE STOP THAT  WE WOULD CREATE JOBS AND  EVERYBODY EXPECTED THE  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD GO UP  AND IT DID NOT.   THE SENIOR ECONOMIC  CORRESPONDENT NOTED THAT WE  HAVE TO THINK THAT THE MAY  EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS COUNT AS A  STRONG WIND FOR PPP SUPPORTERS  AS THE PRESIDENT SIGNED IT INTO  LAW AND A BIG CHEERLEADER OF  PPP.   10 MILLION, THAT'S HOW MUCH  ECONOMISTS WERE OFF AMERICA HAS  TAKEN NOTE OF THE FACT THAT WE  HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO USHERED IN  THE HOTTEST ECONOMY IN MODERN  HISTORY, RECORD LOW  UNEMPLOYMENT FOR BLACK AMERICANS OR HISPANIC AMERICANS.   PAYCHECKS BEGINNING TO RISE  UNDER THE DONALD TRUMP ECONOMY  AND THE GREAT JOBS CREATOR AND  AMERICA CLEARLY HAS CONFIDENCE  IN THE PRESIDENT.  WE HAVE A  PRESIDENT WHO FUNDAMENTALLY  UNDERSTANDS HOW TO PUT THIS  COUNTRY BACK TO WORK AND WE SAW  THAT INACTION WITH THE FRIDAY  JOBS REPORT.   AND WITH THAT I WILL TAKE  QUESTIONS WORK  >> WHAT'S UP RESIDENCE THINKING  ON THIS MOVEMENT TO DISMANTLE  POLICE FORCES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY AND WHAT REFORMS DOES  THE PRESIDENT THINK WOULD BE  APPROPRIATE IN THE WAKE OF THE  GEORGE FLOYD DEATH?   >> THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE  SITTING CONGRESS WOMEN WANT TO  DV FUND THE POLICE, NOTABLY THE  BIDEN ADVISOR A FORMER CLINTON  SPOKESPERSON ONE TEETH --  WANTING TO DEFUND THE POLICE  AND IT COULD POSSIBLY GO  FARTHER AS WE ALL REMEMBER THE  DEFUND I.C.E.  MOVEMENT AND NOW THEY WANT TO  DEFUND THE POLICE AND ITS  EXTRAORDINARY, ROLLING BACK THE  PROTECTED LAYERS THAT PROTECT  AMERICANS IN THEIR HOMES AND  PLACES OF BUSINESS HE IS  APPALLED AND IT'S REMARKABLE TO  HEAR THIS COMING FROM THE  DEMOCRAT PARTY HE IS TALKING TO  A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS AND HE  RECOGNIZES THE HORRID INJUSTICE  DONE TO GEORGE FLOYD AND IS  TAKING A LOOK AT VARIOUS  PROPOSALS.   >> DOES THE PRESIDENT AGREE  WITH ANY OF THE MAYORS ACROSS  THE COUNTRY THAT SAY WE SHOULD  TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY FROM  POLICING AND PUT IT TOWARD  OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH COULD LEAD  TO THE POTENTIAL FOR A LESSER  NEED FOR POLICE?   >> THE MAYOR OF LA WANTS TO  DEFUND POLICE, TAKE MONEY AWAY  FROM POLICE AND THE MAYOR OF  NEW YORK WANTS TO TAKE MONEY  AWAY FROM POLICE.   THAT MEANS REDUCING PUT THE  LEASE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND HE  DOES NOT AGREE WITH THAT AND  THE REST OF AMERICA DOES NOT  AGREE WITH THAT.   >> AS YOU HAVE GONE OVER WHAT  YOU THINK IS NEEDED, DOES THE  PRESIDENT FEEL THERE IS  SYSTEMIC RACISM IN LAW  ENFORCEMENT?   >> HE HAS AGREED THAT THERE ARE  INJUSTICES.   NOTING GEORGE FLOYD AND THE  CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION AND  HE DEFINITELY BELIEVES THERE  ARE INSTANCES OF RACISM THAT HE  BELIEVES ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT  ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND  HE BELIEVES THAT BY AND LARGE  THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE.   750 WHO WERE INJURED DEFENDING  THE COUNTRY FROM RIOTERS AND  ANTIFA IN THE STREETS, THE 750  OFFICERS WHO WERE HURT  DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY WERE  HEROES AS WAS DAVID DORN THE  POLICE OFFICER WHO LOST HIS LIFE AND PATRICK UNDERWOOD WHO ALSO  LOST HIS LIFE.   >> DOES HE BELIEVE THERE  SYSTEMIC RACISM?   >> HE BELIEVES MOST OF THE  POLICE OFFICERS ARE GOOD HARD- WORKING PEOPLE AND HAS GREAT  FAITH IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.  >> DECEASED DO BELIEVE THAT  FORMER NFL PLAYERS THAT MEAL  SHOULD BE FIRED?   >> HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR FOR  YEARS THAT KNEELING IS TIED TO  THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AND IT DOES  NOT RESPECT THE MILITARY MEN  AND WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY  AND IS NOT A FAN AND HE'S MADE  THAT VERY CLEAR PARTICULARLY  BECAUSE IT IS DISRESPECTFUL TO  THE MILITARY AS THE KNEELING  ORIGINATED AT THE KNEELING  DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.   >> DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD BE  FIRED?   >> I HAVE NO COMMENT ON THAT.   >> DOES HE THINK THEY SHOULD BE  FIRED?   >> I HAVE NO INFORMATION ON  THAT.   >> THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS  GIVEN TO US, I'VE NOT TALKED  WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HE HAS  NOT REVIEWED IT.   HE IS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF  PROPOSALS THAT THERE ARE SOME  NONSTARTERS IN THERE SECURELY  ON THE IMMUNITY ISSUE AND THIS  WEEKEND WILLIAM BARR WAS ASKED  ABOUT REDUCED IMMUNITY AND HE  SAID I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO  REDUCE IMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT  WOULD RESULT IN POLICE PULLING  BACK WHICH IS NOT ADVISABLE  >> DOES THE ADMINISTRATION  SUPPORT THE BANNING OF THESE OF  CHOKE HOLDS?   >> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT  REVIEWED THE PIECE OF  LEGISLATION AND IS LOOKING AT  WHAT IS A STATE AND FEDERAL  ISSUE AND IS CURRENTLY  REVIEWING PROPOSALS ON THIS  VERY TOPIC ABOUT POLICE REFORM  AND I WILL NOT GET AHEAD OF HIM  ON THAT.   WE BELIEVE THE APPROPRIATE  AMOUNT OF FORCE SHOULD BE  REVIEWED FOR ANY POLICE  INTERACTION.   >> TWO WEEKS AFTER THE CIVIL  UNREST WHY DOES THE WHITE HOUSE  NOT HAVE A PLAN.   THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS PLAN IS  A STRONG ECONOMY AND HOW DOES  THAT WORK?   >> THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF  COMBATING RACISM AND MAKING  SURE THERE IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  FOR BLACK AMERICANS IN THE  COUNTRY.   WE HEAR A LOT OF WORDS FROM  DEMOCRATS ABOUT CRIMINAL  JUSTICE REFORM AND THEY GOT IT  AND IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP ON  REDUCING RACIAL SENTENCING  DISPARITIES.   DEMOCRATS TOPIC ABOUT ECHO DOT  -- ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES.   MORE THAN 900 PLACES CREATING  PRIVATE INVESTMENTS TO HELP  PEOPLE GET ON THEIR FEET AND  RECORD FUNDING.   THIS PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY  MADE A STEP FURTHER BY  COMMUNITY AND A BIG PIECE WAS  ECONOMIC REFORM.  AND ON  ECONOMIC REFORM THE U.S. AND CA  THE TRADE DEALS, PPP AND MAKING  SURE THAT DID NOT TAKE PLACE IN  THAT DIRECTLY ADVANTAGE HARD- WORKING WHAT MEN AND WOMEN IN  DETROIT.   THROUGH HIS REFORMATION WITH  TRADE AND ALSO OPPORTUNITIES IN  HELPING TO ENSURE THAT  AMERICANS OF ALL RACES HAVE THE  SAME ART VIRGINITY.   >> YOU SAY HE WILL EVENTUALLY  HAVE A POLICE REFORM?   >> HE IS LOOKING AT VARIOUS  REFORMS.   >> THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE  ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO BE  PULLING TROOPS FROM GERMANY.   CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY, WHEN AND  WHERE ARE THEY GOING?   >> WE HAVE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS AT  THIS TIME.   THERE IS REPORTING OUT THERE  BUT THERE ARE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS.  THE PRESIDENT IS CONTINUINGLY  REASSESSED IN THE BACK POSTURE  FOR THE UNITED STATES MILITARY.  WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING  WITH THE STRONG ALLIES.   >> WILL HE CONSULT BEFORE  MAKING THAT DECISION?   >> I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE  PRESIDENT.   >> DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION  ON WHEN THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL  BE REMOVED?   >> THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT  IS AN WHITE HOUSE CONTROL.   WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE  PRESIDENT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT  THE PROTESTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN  PEACEFUL BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS  TAKEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND  YOU WILL NOTICE MINNEAPOLIS WAS  IN CHAOS UNTIL THE NATIONAL  GUARD CAME IN HERE IN LAFAYETTE  PARK 750 LAW-ENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS INJURED ACROSS THE  COUNTRY AND ONE FIFTH OF THOSE  WERE IN DC AND THE VAST  MAJORITY IN LAFAYETTE PARK AND  ONCE THE NATIONAL GUARD CAME IN  DC WAS SECURED AND THAT  DECISION BY THE PRESIDENT  ENCOURAGING GOVERNORS TO SECURE  THE NATIONAL GUARD MADE THE  DIFFERENCE AND THE PRESIDENT  RECOGNIZE HIS NOW THAT THE  PROTESTS ARE PEACEFUL AND HE  WILL RECOMMEND A WINDING DOWN.   WITH REGARD TO SECURITY OF THE  BUILDING, NOT A DECISION FOR  THE WHITE HOUSE THE SECRET  SERVICE AND PARKS SERVICES.   THE PRESIDENT HAS RECOGNIZED  THE PEACEFUL PROTESTING.   >> ON HONG KONG, WHEN WILL THE  ADMINISTRATION REVOKE HONG KONG  TRADE STATUS AND DO YOU THINK  THAT THE MOVE WILL BE THE ONLY  THING THE ADMINISTRATION DOES  OR IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE  PLANNED?  TO SEND ME ANY SIGNS  OF RELENTING?   >> WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY UPDATES  FROM CHINA AND NO ANNOUNCEMENTS  REGARDING THE TIMING THAT THE  PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR  THAT THE ONE COUNTRY, TWO  SYSTEMS VERSUS ONE COUNTRY ONE  SYSTEM AND THEY WOULD BEGIN  ELIMINATING POLICY EXEMPTIONS  AND GIVING HONG KONG THE  SPECIAL TREATMENT THEY ONCE  HAD.   >> ONE WEEK AFTER WHAT WE SAW  IN LAFAYETTE PARK LAST MONDAY  NIGHT, ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE  HERE IN THIS BUILDING WHO  BELIEVE THAT OR DOES THE  PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT PERHAPS  THINGS WENT THE WAY THEY SHOULD  NOT HAVE GONE AND IS THERE ANY  REGRET ON THE PART OF THE  PRESIDENT OR ANYONE HERE ABOUT  PEOPLE WERE TREATED WHO WERE  PEACEFULLY PROTESTING?   >> THERE ARE NO REGRETS BUT  MANY OF THOSE DECISIONS WERE  NOT MADE WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE  AND IT WAS A G BAR WHO MADE THE  DECISION AND THEY MADE THAT  DECISION INDEPENDENTLY.   AND BEFORE THE PROTESTERS WERE  MOVED BY PARK POLICE, THERE  WERE THREE LOUD WARNINGS AND I  BELIEVE IT WAS AG BARR ON FACE  THE NATION THAT SAID SOME OF  THE PROTESTERS MOVED BACK AT  OTHER STARTED HURLING OBJECTS  AND THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND  POLICE ACTED AS THEY FELT THEY  NEEDED TO IN RESPONSE.   WE STAND BY THOSE ACTIONS.   >> THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SAW  THE VIOLENCE CLASH BETWEEN  PEOPLE OTHERWISE RECENTLY  PROTESTING BUT THE PRESIDENT IS  NOT SORRY FOR THE WAY THINGS  WENT?   >> THE PRESIDENT IS SORRY FOR  THE FACT THAT ANTIFA WREAKS  HAVOC IN THE STREETS AND THE  FAILURE OF SOME MEMBERS OF THE  MEDIA TO NOTE THAT EVEN CHRIS  CUOMO SAID SHOW ME WHERE IT SAYS PROTESTERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE  PEACEFUL AND I POINT HIM TO THE  FIRST AMENDMENT WHERE IT SAYS  YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO PEACEABLY  ASSEMBLE AND HE SHOULD GO BACK  AND READ THE CONSTITUTION.   THERE ARE MANY OTHERS OUT THERE  SAYING THAT RIDER RIOTERS IS A  MECHANISM TO RESTRUCTURE THE  COUNTRY AND BURNING DOWN ST.  JOHN OR CARVING OUT AS WE SAW  ON THE VIDEO ON CONCRETE FROM  THE SIDEWALK TO HURL IT  OFFICERS AND THAT IS NOT  PEACEFULLY PROTESTING.   THE ACTIONS OF THE RIOTERS WERE  NOT IN KEEPING WITH THE FIRST  AMENDMENT AND I THINK THE MEDIA  NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THERE IS A  DISCERNMENT BETWEEN PEACEFUL  PROTESTERS AND THE RIOTERS AND  YET AMERICA WILL ACT AGAINST  RIOTERS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP  WILL NOT ALLOW BURNING BUILDINGS , 150 FEDERAL BUILDINGS TOO  FACED AND 750 LAW-ENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS INJURED.   >> TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT, YOU  KNOW THE BURNING OF ST. JOHN  HAPPENED ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND A  LOT OF THE VIOLENCE THAT YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT HAPPENED ON  SUNDAY NIGHT AND HE WAS ASKING  ABOUT MONDAY WHEN AS ANYONE WHO  WAS DOWN THERE KNOWS IT WAS  ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY PEACEFUL  ESPECIALLY FOR THE CHEMICAL AND  MUNITIONS WERE USED ON THE  PROTESTERS.   YOU WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT  HAPPENED ON A DIFFERENT DAY.   >> THE BURNING OF ST. JOHN IS  WHAT PROMPTED THE DECISION  ABOUT THE PERIMETER WHAT  PROMPTED AG BARR TO AGREE WITH  THE DECISION ON MONDAY MORNING  AT THE PERIMETER NEEDED TO BE  MOVED WHEN YOU HURL OBJECTS AT  PARK POLICE AND WHEN YOU DON'T  MOVE AFTER THREE ORDERS ARE  GIVEN, PARK POLICE ACTED  APPROPRIATELY WHEN THE SHIELD  OF PARK POLICE WAS BATTED DOWN  AND ONE PERSON TRIED TO GRAB A  PARK POLICE OFFICER'S WEAPON.   THAT IS NOT PEACEFUL.   >> THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE  WHITE HOUSE IS KNOWN AS BLACK  LIVES MATTER PLAZA DOES THE  PRESIDENT KNOW ABOUT THAT  DECISION?   >> I HAVE NOT TALKED TO HIM  ABOUT THAT.   >> MEET ROMNEY CAN SAY THREE  WORDS OUTSIDE ON PENNSYLVANIA  AVENUE THAT I WOULD NOTE THAT  PRESIDENT TRUMP WON A % OF THE  BLACK VOTE AND PEOPLE ACROSS  THE COUNTRY RECOGNIZE THAT WILL  MEET ROMNEY HAS A LOT OF WORDS  HE SAID 47% OF THE NATION IS  DEPENDENT UPON GOVERNOR BELIEVE  THEY ARE VICTIMS AND BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY  THOSE WERE MITT ROMNEY IS WORDS. .  AMERICAS WHEN GIVEN  OPPORTUNITY VIA A TRUMP  OPPORTUNITY ZONE AND BELIEF  THAT AMERICANS OF ALL RACES CAN  RISE TO THE OCCASION AND  ACHIEVE AND BELIEF FOR RECORD  FUNDING BECAUSE WE NEED TO  ENABLE EDUCATION IN OUR COUNTRY , THOSE KINDS OF ACTIONS ON THE  PART OF THE PRESIDENT IN STARK  CONTRAST WITH THE VERY EMPTY  WORDS OF SENATOR ROMNEY.   >> THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED  ABOUT THE PROTEST AND THE DEATH  OF GEORGE FLOAT BUT HAS NOT  GIVEN A FORMAL ADDRESS TO THE  NATION.   >> THE PRESIDENT HAS ADDRESSED  THE NATION ON THIS BUT SEVERAL  MEDIA OUTLETS CHOSE NOT TO  COVER IT AND WHEN HE WAS IN  FLORIDA LAST SATURDAY, HE SAID  AND I HAVE THE WHOLE THING  HERE, HE SAID MANY TIMES THE  DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD ON THE  STREETS OF MINNEAPOLIS WAS A  GREAT TRAGEDY AND SHOULD NEVER  EVER HAVE HAPPENED AND SPIT  SEVERAL MINUTES GOING THROUGH  IT.   -- HE SAID I UNDERSTAND THE WAY  PEOPLE ARE FEELING AND WE HEAR  THE PLEASE AND HE WENT ON AND  ON AND SET IT ON MONDAY.   I AM YOUR PRESIDENT OF LAW AND  ORDER AND ALLY PEACEFUL  PROTESTERS.   THE MEDIA HAS CHOSEN NOT TO  COVER IT AND THE WORDS ARE OUT  THERE AND DOCUMENTED.   >> WE ARE HEARING EVER  OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE FROM THE  PRESIDENT ABOUT THE JOBS  NUMBERS IN THE MARKET RECOVERY  BUT IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER  THURSDAY NIGHT THE PRESIDENT  SAID HE WOULD FACE THE  LIKELIHOOD OF A LONG ECONOMIC  RECOVERY.  WONDERING WHY WE'RE  HEARING TWO MESSAGES ON HOW THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO  FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY.   >> THE PRESIDENT CEASED FRIDAY  FOR WHAT HE ULTIMATELY WANTS,  REARING ECONOMY, PAYCHECKS WERE  GROWING AND WE ARE AT A VERY  GOOD PLACE BEFORE HE CHOSE TO  STOP THE ECONOMY TO SAVE 2.1  MILLION LIVES POTENTIALLY.  HE  TOOK THE ACTION THAT WAS  NECESSARY AND WANTS TO GET US  BACK TO THAT PLACE AND HE IS  THE ONE THAT CAN DO IT AND HAS  NOTED THERE WILL BE A TIME OF  RECOVERY AND THINKS Q4 WILL BE  GOOD AND NEXT YEAR WILL BE  GREAT.   MONDAY WASN'T AN EXPECTED NOTE  THAT THE MARKET BELIEVES IN THE  PRESIDENT AND EMPLOYERS BELIEVE  AND THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN OPEN  THEIR DOORS.   WITH A NOTE OF A GREAT FIRST  STEP OF PROGRESS, THERE ARE  MANY MORE STEPS WE HAVE TO TAKE  TO GET BACK.   BUT WE WILL GET THERE.   >> NEW YORK CITY BEGAN REOPEN  TODAY.   DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP SAY THE  CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE --  >> HE HAS REMAINED OPEN TO A  PHASE 4.  I WILL GET AHEAD OF  HIM BUT HE HAS SAID THERE ARE  SEVERAL THINGS HE WANTS,  PAYROLL TAX HOLIDAY WAS ONE OF  THEM BECAUSE THAT DIRECTLY  ADVANTAGES LOW INCOME WORKERS  AND SEVERAL OTHER THINGS HE  WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE  PACKAGE.   HE IS CERTAINLY STILL OPEN TO A  PHASE 4.  HE HAS NOTED STATE  AND LOCAL BAILOUTS ARE BLUE  STATES THAT HAVE RUN THEIR  STATES INTO THE GROUND BECAUSE  OF DECADES OF STATE DEMOCRAT  POLICIES.   >> WITH WOOD PRESIDENT TRUMP  SUPPORT FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET  THE DAMAGE THAT COULD BE WAGED  ON DEPARTMENTS DEFENDED?   >> THAT WOULD BE GETTING AHEAD  OF THE PRESIDENT BUT HE'S A HAS  BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT HE DOES  NOT SUPPORT DEFENDING THE  POLICE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR  FORM AND NOTED IN FACT THAT WE  HAVE SEEN VIOLENT CRIME COME  DOWN AND WHY AT THE TIME WHEN  FILING CRIME COME IN DOWN, WHY  WOULD WE DEFUND THE POLICE WHO  ARE A LARGE PART RESPONSIBLE  FOR HELPING AMERICA TO GET TO A  PLACE WHERE STREETS ARE SAFE  AND I WOULD POINT YOU TO THAT  BEFORE GETTING AHEAD OF THE  PRESIDENT ON A SPECIFIC POLICY.  >> WHAT ARE HIS THOUGHTS  UNDEFENDED THE MOVEMENT AND  HENNESSY FACTOR THE TRAGEDY?   >> THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE THE  ONES WHO ARE DEFENDING THE  COUNTRY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE  HAVE LAW AND ORDER IN THE  STREETS AND THERE'S NO MORE  EVIDENCE OF THAT AND TAKING A  LOOK AT THE WRONG NUMBERS.   POLICE DESCRIBED THE BLUE LINE  IN AMERICAN SOCIETY TWIN PEACE,  CHAOS, ORDER AND ANARCHY AND  THE THIN BLUE LINE HAS BEEN  QUITE A BIT JUST LOOKING AT THE  2018 NUMBERS.   ROBBERY ARREST 800,130, VIOLENT  CRIME ARRESTS 495,900 AND THAT  IS POLICE OFFICERS DOING THE  ARRESTING AND IF YOU ELIMINATE  POLICE OFFICERS, YOU WILL HAVE  CHAOS, CRIME AND ANARCHY AND  IT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO THE  PRESIDENT.   >> IS THE MOVEMENT POLITICALLY  MOTIVATED?   >> I WOULD JUST TAKE IT THEIR  OWN WORDS LIKE LIVES MATTER DC  AND LIKE LIVES MATTER MEANS TO  FUND THE POLICE AND THE  PRESIDENT STANDS AGAINST  DEFUNDING THE POLICE AND ALL  BLACK LIVES MATTER INCLUDING  THE LIFE OF DAVID DORAN WHO  PERISHED IN THE LAST 1.5 WEEKS  INCLUDING PATRICK UNDERWOOD WHO  ALSO LOST HIS LIFE.   ALL BLACK LIVES MATTER BUT IN  TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT, LIKE  LIVES MATTER WANT TO DEFEND THE  POLICE AND THE PRESIDENT STANDS  AGAINST THAT.   >> LIKES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY  ARRESTED AND INCARCERATED AND  WHEN THEY RETURN TO SOCIETY  THEY ARE OFTEN DENIED THE RIGHT  TO VOTE, SOMETIMES FOR THE REST  OF THEIR LIFE.  IS THE  PRESIDENT CONCERNED ABOUT THIS  DISPARITY AND DOES HE FAVOR  RESTORING THE RIGHTS OF ALL  THOSE WHO COMPLETE THEIR STEPS  TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 2020  ELECTION?   >> HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO HIM ON  THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT OBVIOUSLY  SOMEONE WHO IS WRONGFULLY  INCARCERATED, WE NEED TO  ADDRESS THAT SITUATION THAT THE  PRESIDENT HAD WITH THE FIRST  STEP BACK WITH A GREAT PIECE OF  LEGISLATION THAT SAYS PREGNANT  WOMEN CANNOT BE SHACKLED WHEN  HAVING THEIR BABY IN JAIL AND  THESE ARE BASIC COMMENTS THAT  THE PRESIDENT PUT IN PLACE FOR  SENTENCING DISPARITIES BECAUSE  OF VIOLENT CRIME CONTROL AND  THE CRIME BILL WHICH HAS BEEN  -- THE PRESIDENT RECTIFIED THAT  IN THE FIRST STEP MORE THAN 90%  HAVE BEEN BLACK AMERICANS.  HE  HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE SIDE OF  JUSTICE THAT I HAVE NOT SPOKEN  TO HIM ABOUT THAT.   >> I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A  QUESTION ON BEHALF OF THE  COLLEAGUE WHO CANNOT BE HERE.   MANY COMPLAINTS WERE MADE  AGAINST DEREK CHAUVIN  PRIOR TO  THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD AND I  WAS WONDERING IF PRESIDENT  TRUMP LEAVES DISCIPLINARY  RECORDS AND COMPLAINTS AGAINST  POLICE AS WELL AS POLICE  PERSONNEL FILES SHOULD BE  ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC?   SHOULD THERE BE A MINIMUM  NATIONAL STANDARD ON POLICE  TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO  THE COMPLAINTS?   >> I WON'T ADDRESS THAT OR GET  AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENT BUT HE  HAS SAID THAT IN REFERENCE TO  GEORGE FLOYD THAT WAS EGREGIOUS. >> DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP URGE  PRINCE ANDREW TO COMPLY WITH  HIS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  REQUEST FOR AN INTERVIEW IN THE  CASE AGAINST JEFFREY EPSTEIN?   >> I HAVE NOT SPOKEN TO HIM  ABOUT THAT.   >> IS THERE ANY THOUGHT BEING  GIVEN TO RETURNING TO DAILY  CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING AND ON THE  REOPENINGS, THE PRESIDENT SAID  SOME WEEKS BACK HE WOULD  CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND IF ANY  STATES WERE DOING THINGS THAT  HE DID NOT THINK WERE  APPROPRIATE THAT HE WOULD STEP  IN AND INTERVENE AND HAS THE  PRESIDENT IN ANY OF THESE  REOPENINGS PARTICULARLY AS  CORONAVIRUS CASES ARE INCREASING , IS HE SEEN ANYTHING THAT GETS  SOME CONCERN?   >> DR. BURKE SENT ME NEW  INFORMATION THAT NEW CASES HAVE  STABILIZED AND MANY OF THE NEW  CASES ARE IDENTIFIED FROM  PROACTIVE MONITORING AND  FINDING ASYMPTOMATIC CASES AND  TODAY WE SAW THE LOWEST NEW  MORTALITY REPORT SINCE THE END  OF MARCH, LESS THAN 500 AND  TESTING CONTINUES WITH OVER 28  MILLION DONE AND MORE THAN 6%  OF AMERICANS TESTED AND IN  SEVEN STATES MORE THAN 10%.   WE ARE HEADED IN A POSITIVE  DIRECTION.   >> HAS THE PRESIDENT SEEN  ANYTHING THAT CAUSES HIM CONCERN ?   >> I WOULD NOTE THE ENCOURAGING  SIGNS AND HE IS IN THE COUNTRY  SAFELY REOPEN AND I WOULD ALSO  JUST NOTE THAT SOME OF THE  MEDIA CONTRADICTIONS CERTAINLY  NOT REFERRING TO SPECIFICALLY  BUT A LITTLE MORE BROADLY THAT  THERE ISN'T AN OUTCRY ABOUT  SOCIAL DISTANCING AMONG THE  PROTESTS.   I SAW ONE NETWORK WITH FOOTAGE  OF THE OZARKS COMPLAINING ABOUT  SOCIAL DISTANCING IN THE OZARKS  AND SEAMLESSLY TRANSITIONING TO  PROTEST FOOTAGE AND NOT  SUGGESTING THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY  CONSISTENT HERE AND ONE NOTE  THAT I REALLY WANTED TO GET IN,  IT'S IMPORTANT.  THERE SO MUCH  FOCUS ON POLICE OFFICERS RIGHT  NOW.   THERE ARE ABSOLUTE CASES OF  INJUSTICES AND THEIR HEART  BREAKS FOR THE CASES THAT I  WANT TO KNOW SOME OF THE GREAT  THINGS THE POLICE HAVE DONE  LAST YEAR ALONE.   AN ALASKA RETIRED COP JUMPED  INTO FREEZING WATER TO HELP THE  THEM TO SAFETY AFTER PLANE  CRASH.   IN IDAHO A WOMAN SAID HE SAVED  MY SON'S LIFE.  IN MAINE A  DETECTIVE WAS KILLED WHILE  HELPING A MOTORIST.   A BABY CHOKING WAS SAVED BY AN  OFFICER IN MARYLAND.   AN OFFICER WAS HAILED FOR  INTERVENING IN AN ACTIVE  SHOOTING SITUATION.   IN NORTH CAROLINA, POLICE  THWARTED A MASS SHOOTING.   AND OHIO POLICE TOOK DOWN A  MESH SHOOTER AT A BAR.   A TERMINALLY ILL GIRL WAS  VISITED BY 40 OFFICERS AND A  CANINE.   AND OFFICER ROMAN OF THE NYPD  RESPONDED TO AN INCIDENT WITH  HOMELESS PERSON AND THEY BOUGHT  HIM NEW GLASSES AND HELPED HIM  FIND A JOB.   AND OFFICER HELP THE HOMELESS  MAN STRUGGLING TO SAVE IN THE  STREETS AND IN VIRGINIA  OFFICERS COULD BE SEEN PLAYING  DOLLS WITH LITTLE GIRLS IN  ARIZONA, SOMEONE CALLED 911  ASKING FOR A HAPPY MEAL AND  POLICE DELIVERED AND THIS IS  WHO THE GREAT LAW-ENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS ARE IN NEED YOU TO  REMEMBER THAT.   THANK YOU SO MUCH.   >>> THIS MORNING THE FIRED  MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER,  DEREK CHAUVIN, PREPARING  FOR  HIS FIRST COURT APPEARANCE.   HE STILL DECLINING TO PUBLICLY  COMMENT IN THE FUTURE OF THE  MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT  IS UNCERTAIN.   ONE DAY AFTER THE MAYOR WAS  BOOED FOR NOT COMMITTING TO  ABOLISHING THE POLICE AND THE  MAJORITY OF THE CITY COUNCIL  VOTED TO DISBAND THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT.   >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT  ENGAGING A PLAN TO CREATE A  SAFETY SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR  EVERYONE.   >> WHETHER IT'S DISMANTLING  DEPARTMENTS ARE REINVESTING IN  OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS,  DEMANDS TO DEFUND THE POLICE  ARE BEING HEARD ACROSS THE  COUNTRY AND IN NEW YORK CITY  THE MAYOR WAS MOVING FUNDS FROM  POLICE AND USING IT FOR SOCIAL  SERVICES.   >> WE ARE PERMITTED TO SHIFTING  RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE FOCUS  IS ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE.   >> IN LOS ANGELES THE MAYOR IS  CUTTING AS MUCH AS $150 MILLION  FROM THE POLICE BUDGET AND  CRITICS SAY LESS MONEY WILL NOT  SOLVE THE PROBLEM.   >> DEFUNDING IS A NICE  CATCHPHRASE BUT IN REALITY IT  WILL INCREASE IN ORGANIZATIONS  FOR THE MOST PART ARE  UNDERFUNDED.   >> ALL THIS IS MORE DISTURBING  VIDEOS EMERGE AS POLICE ARREST  BLACK MEN IN VIRGINIA AND  OFFICER IS SEEN USING A STUN  GUN ON A MAN ON FRIDAY.  THE  OFFICERS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT.   IN ALAMEDA, CALIFORNIA, THIS  VIDEO OF AN ARREST LAST MONTH  ALSO UNDER INVESTIGATION.   IN MINNEAPOLIS, A LAWYER FOR  ANOTHER OFFICER SAID FLOYD  RESISTED ARREST.   THOMAS LANE HAD ONLY BEEN A COP  FOR FOUR DAYS.   >> HE WAS DOING WHAT HE THOUGHT  WAS RIGHT.   >> HE IS ACCUSED AND AIDING AND  ABETTING SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.   >> HOW IS A POSSIBLE YOUR  CLIENT STOOD BY AND WATCHED FOR  NEARLY 9 MINUTES  >> HE WAS HOLDING BECAUSE THE  GUY WAS RESISTING AND NOW WHEN  IS HOLDING HIS LEGS HE SAYS TO  DEREK CHAUVIN, SHOULD WE ROLL  HIM OVER BECAUSE HE SAYS  HE  CAN'T BREATHE.   >> THERE ARE NOTIONS ABOUT  DISBANDING THE POLICE, WHAT  WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT  WITH THE NEXT STEPS BE?   >> THAT IS A MAJOR QUESTION AND  THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ONE  INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC AND IT  COULD TAKE UP TO ONE YEAR TO  FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WILL WORK.   THE MAYOR WANTS TO REFORM THE  DEPARTMENT AND NOT ABOLISH IT  BUT ONE IDEA IS PERHAPS HIGHER  MORE COUNSELORS TO DEAL WITH  MENTAL HEALTH CALLS INSTEAD OF  RELYING SOLELY ON POLICE.   >>> OVERNIGHT, CHAOS IN SEATTLE.

THE CITY IS REOPENING TODAY AS  PART OF PHASE ONE,  STARTING WITH CONSTRUCTION AND  MANUFACTURING.  SOME WHOLESALEERS AND PARTIALLY  SOME RETAILERS AS  WELL.  JUST BECAUSE THE CITY IS  ENTERING PHASE ONE DOESN'T  MEAN THINGS GO QUITE BACK TO  NORMAL.  COVID-19, OF COURSE, HAS TAKEN  AN UNIMAGINABLE TOLL  ON NEW YORK CITY.  THERE IS A LONG ROAD AHEAD  THERE.  THAT WRAPS UP OUR HEADLINES FOR  THIS HOUR.  AS ALWAYS, WE'LL BE BACK LATER  WITH MORE, ALISON.  >> ALL RIGHT, ALEXA.  LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >>> IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE  GEORGE FLOYD DIED IN  POLICE CUSTODY IN MINNEAPOLIS,  INSPIRING WORLDWIDE  PROTESTS AND DEMANDS FOR  CHANGE.  TODAY FOREIGN MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE OFFICER DOOR YOU  CAN SHOVIN WAS IN COURT FOR THE  FIRST TIME.  HE IS CHARGED WITH SECOND  DEGREE MURDER FOR KNEELING  ON GEORGE FLOYD'S NECK FOR 8  MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS.  THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL  HAS AGREED TO DEFUND  AND DISMANTLE THE CITY'S POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  >> ONE THING THAT ALL MY  COLLEAGUES AGREE ON IS THAT  OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS  FAILED, AND THEY'VE FAILED  ON MULTIPLE FRONT SEAT OVER THE  COURSE OF THEIR  ENTIRE EXISTENCE.  SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW  TO ADDRESS THAT AND  KEEP OUR NEIGHBORS SAFE.  >> NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT DAVE  GUTIEREZ JOINING US  NOW FROM MINNEAPOLIS.  GABE, LET'S START WITH THAT  COURT APPEARANCE.  WHAT HAPPENED AT DOOR I CAN  SHOVIN'S COURT  APPEARANCE TODAY?  >> HI, ALSON.  IT HAPPENED JUST BEHIND ME IN  THIS PUBLIC SAFETY  BUILDING.  THE COURT HEARING WAS BRIEF.  THE ARRAIGNMENT LASTED ABOUT 15  MINUTES.  SHOVIN FAILED, $1.25 MILLION  WITHOUT CONDITIONS.  $1 MILLION WITH CONDITIONS.  . HE SHOWED UP VIA  TELECONFERENCE.  HE WAS HANDCUFFED.  HE WAS WEARING A BLUE FACE  COVERING.  NOW, WE HAVE NOT HEARD THROUGH  SHOVIN'S ATTORNEY UP  UNTIL NOW.  AND THAT DID NOT CHANGE TODAY  ACTUALLY.  WALKING OUT OF COURT, WE ASKED  HIM IF HE HAD ANY  FURTHER COMMENT.  HE DECLINED TO COMMENT.  WE BARELY HEARD FROM SHOV IRSN  HIMSELF.  HE ANSWERED DIRECT QUESTIONS  FROM THE JUDGE AS WELL  AS FROM HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY,  RESPONDING, \"YES,   MA'AM,\" OR, \"YES, YOUR HONOR.\"  HE WAS ASKED IF HE HAD A WEAPON  ON HIS PROPERTY IF  THAT BAIL WERE TO BE POSTED,  AND HE SAID, \"YES.\"  HE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THAT  WEAPON TO BE DISPOSED  AND WHEN BAIL WOULD BE POSTED.  WE DON'T KNOW IF HIS FAMILY  WILL POST BAIL.  THAT REMAINS UNCLEAR.  WE ASKED HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY  AS HE WAS LEAVING THE  COURTROOM, BUT SO FAR, NO  COMMENT.  AND AGAIN RIGHT NOW, WE DO NOT  KNOW WHAT HIS DEFENSE  MIGHT BE.  HIS ATTORNEY, ERIC NELLSON HAS  REPEATEDLY DECLINED  SINCE THIS ALL STARTED.  BAIL SET AT $1.25 MILLION.  >> GABE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  MINNEAPOLIS CITY  COUNCIL, DECIDING OVER THE  WEEKEND TO DISSOLVE AND  DISMANTLE THE POLICE.  WHAT SPECIFICALLY DOES THAT  MEAN?  WHAT DOES IT INVOLVE?  >> Reporter:  CERTAINLY,  ALISON, THAT IS THE BIG  QUESTION NOW, SOMETHING BEING  DEBATED HOTLY, NOT  JUST HERE, BUT ACROSS THE  COUNTRY.  THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL  YESTERDAY, NINE OF ITS  MEMBERS, A MAJORITY AGREE, AND  PLEDGED TO DISMANTLE  THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  NOW, YOUR QUESTION IS ONE THAT  MANY PEOPLE ARE  ASKING, WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT  MEAN?  AND WE'RE HEARING FROM THE  COUNCIL MEMBERS,  INCLUDING THE CITY COUNCIL  PRESIDENT, THAT THEY'RE  ASKING FOR PUBLIC INPUT TO  DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT THAT  MEANS.  IT COULD BE UP TO A YEAR BEFORE  THOSE DETAILS ARE  DECIDED.  BUT ALSON, WHAT WE'RE HEARING  HERE AND ALSO ACROSS  THE COUNTRY -- FOR EXAMPLE, NEW  YORK CITY'S MAYOR  SAYING HE IS SHIFTING RESOURCES  AWAY FROM THE NYPD,  AND INVESTING IN YOUTH AND  SOCIAL SERVICES.  THE MAYOR OF L.A., ERIC GARCIA,  SAYING HE WILL SHIFT  100 -- UP TO $150 MILLION IN  THE POLICE BUDGET FOR  OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS AS  WELL.  HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS, THERE'S A  LOT OF TALK ABOUT  PERHAPS HIRING MORE COUNSELORS  FOR MENTAL HEALTH  CALLS INSTEAD OF RELYING SOLELY  ON POLICE OFFICERS  FOR 911.  IT STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN  EXACTLY HOW THIS WILL  LACK LIKE.  THE MAYOR, WE SHOULD POINT OUT,  GOT IN SOME TROUBLE  OVER THE WEEKEND WITH SOME OF  THE PROTESTERS.  HE WAS BOOED WHEN HE WOULDN'T  COMMIT TO ABOLISHING  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.  INSTEAD, HE SAID HE WANTED TO  REFORM THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  A LOT OF THIS IS SEMANTICS.  THIS IS GETTING MORE TRACTION  AROUND THE COUNTRY,  THIS IDEA OF PEOPLE AND POLICE.  WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN?  DO YOU DISMANTLING THE POLICE  ALTOGETHER?  DO YOU REFORM IT?  THAT'S STILL BEING FIGURED OUT  HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS  AS WELL.  >> GABE, I KNOW THERE ARE STILL  SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT  WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE, WHAT  IT MIGHT ENTAIL.  DID THE CITY COUNCIL GIVE ANY  SENSE OF A TIME LINE  HERE WHEN WE COULD START TO SEE  CHANGES WITHIN THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT OR SEE THAT  POLICE DEPARTMENT  TRANSFORMED?  >> Reporter:  WELL, JEREMIAH  ELLISON, THE SON OF  KEITH ALLSON, SAID THIS IS  SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING  TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT.  THEY'RE GOING BE ASKING FOR  INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC.  IT COULD BE UP TO A YEAR BEFORE  WE SEE SOME OF THESE  CHANGES IMPLEMENTED AT THE  MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL.  STILL THIS IS AN IDEA THAT  STARTED TO GET TRACTION  LAST WEEK.  IT'S NOT NEW.  MANY ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR  QUITE SOME TIME.  AND IT TOOK THE DEATH OF GEORGE  FLOYD FOR IT TO  REALLY GAIN TRACTION HERE IN  MINNEAPOLIS.  AND NOW YOU HEAR REALLY ACROSS  THE COUNTRY, REALLY  EXAMINING THE LARGER  CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WHOLE OF  POLICING.  BUT AGAIN, FEW DETAILS RIGHT  NOW AS THE MINNEAPOLIS  CITY COUNCIL WORKS THROUGH  THIS.  THIS ALL CAME, OF COURSE, AS WE  REPORTED WITH HIS  FIRST COURT HEARING FOR OFFICER  DEREK SHOVIN, BAIL  SET AT $1.25 MILLION.  HIS NEXT HEARING IS SET FOR  JUNE 29th.  WE SHOULD POINT OUT ALSO THAT  WE SPOKE WITH THE  ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF THE OTHER  OFFICERS INVOLVED IN  THIS CASE, THOSE THREE OTHER  OFFICERS, YOU'LL  REMEMBER, ALSON, ARE CHARGED  WITH AIDING AND  ABETTING SECOND DEGREE MURDER  AND MANSLAUGHTER.  ONE OF THEM, THOMAS LANE.  JUST FOUR DAYS ON THE JOB, HE  SPOKE WITH HIS  ATTORNEY.  HE SAID HE MAINTAINS THAT  GEORGE FLOYD RESISTED  ARREST, AND THAT IS WHY HIS  CLIENT TOOK THE ACTIONS  HE DID.  I ASKED HIM, HOW COULD IT BE  POSSIBLE FOR HIS CLIENT  TO STAND BY AND WATCH WHILE  THIS WAS ALL GOING ON?  HE CLAIMED THAT HE DIDN'T JUST  STAND BY BY AND  WATCH, THAT IT WAS JUST HIS  FOURTH DAY ON THE JOB,  AND HE WAS ESSENTIALLY TAKING A  LEAVE FROM DEREK  SHOVIN.  HE SAID HIS CLIENT IS NOT  GUILTY OF THE CHARGES  AGAINST HIM.  THAT IS A PREVIEW OF THE  DEFENSE WE COULD SEE FROM  THOSE THREE OTHER OFFICERS.  AGAIN, WITH REGARDS TO DEREK  SHOVIN, HIS ATTORNEY  GAVE NO COMMENT.  >> YEAH, AND, DAVE, I KNOW YOU  HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE  INTERVIEW WITH LANE.  WE WILL BE SHOWING THAT LATER  IN THE SHOW.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING  HERE, AND THANK YOU FOR  THAT AS WELL.  >> YOU BET.  >>> NEW YORK CITY REOPENING  TODAY.  ABOUT 400,000 PEOPLE HEADING  BACK TO WORK.  IT HAS BEEN 100 DAYS SINCE THE  CITY'S FIRST  CORONAVIRUS CASE.  NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO  CONGRATULATING NEW  YORKERS ON THE PROGRESS.  >> WE DIDN'T JUST STOP THE  INCREASE.  WE BENT THE CURVE, AND WE  BROUGHT THE SPREAD DOWN  DRAMATICALLY.  AND YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE  TODAY, 100 DAYS LATER,  WE ARE CONTINUING OUR DECLINE.  THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS  STILL SPIKING.  HOW REMARKABLE IS THAT?  HOW REMARKABLE IS THAT?  SO CONGRATULATIONS TO NEW  YORKERS.  >> NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT  REHENA ELLIS JOINS ME FROM  TIMES SQUARE.  REHENNA, I HAVE TO ASK THE  QUESTION, WHAT DOES NEW  YORK CITY LOOK LIKE TODAY?  ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY OUT AND  ABOUT?  >> Reporter:  THERE ARE SOME  PEOPLE.  I THINK THAT IS A SLOW ROLL OUT  FOR MANY PEOPLE.  YOU GET AN IMAGE OF IT.  I WANT MY CAMERAMAN TO TURN THE  CAMERA.  THE FEW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE IN  THE WAY.  TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, ALISON.  WE'RE IN TIMES SQUARE.  THIS IS 47thth STREET, THE  PROCESSROADS OF THE  WORLD, AND YOU COULD CROSS THE  STREET WITHOUT ANY  PROBLEM TODAY.  THE ROADS ARE CLEAR.  GRANTED, THIS IS AN  ENTERTAINMENT.  THIS IS A THEATER AREA.  BUT IT IS ALSO A BUSINESS AREA.  IT'S A COMMERCIAL AREA.  LOT AND LOT OF OFFICES, EVEN 30  ROCK WHERE WE ARE  HEADQUARTERED IS NOT SO FAR  FROM HERE.  SO I THINK THAT PICTURE TELLS  YOU A LOT ABOUT WHAT  IT LOOKS LIKE HERE.  WANT TO SEE SOME TRAFFIC THIS  MORNING?  YES, THERE WAS IN OTHER PLACES  ON THE ROAD.  SOME TRAFFIC REPORTED.  ACTUALLY HAD SOME REAL TRAFFIC  TO TALK ABOUT.  BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW  YORK CITY.  AND THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS NOT  AS POPULATED AS SOME  PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT  WOULD BE, BUT FOX ARE  COMING OUT EVER SO SLOWLY.  .  >> I WALK PAST WHERE YOU ARE  ALMOST EVERY DAY.  LIKE MOST NEW YORKERS, I'M  USUALLY FRUSTRATED BY ALL  THE FOLKS YOU HAVE TO WEAVE IN  AND OUT TO GET TO  WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.  LOOKING VERY, VERY DIFFERENT  TODAY.  I KNOW THAT IS, OF COURSE,  BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE  STILL AREN'T BECOME AT WORK.  A LOT OF THINGS AREN'T OPEN  YET.  WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS FIRST  PHASE, AND WHAT KINDS  OF THINGS WERE OPEN AGAIN  TODAY?  >> Reporter:  THIRTY-TWO  THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION JOBS  AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING AND  RETAIL FOR CURB-SIDE  PICK UP.  BUT LOOK AT WHAT SOME RETAILERS  ARE HAVING TO  CONTEND WITH.  JUST, RONNY, IF YOU CAN GO OVER  HERE.  HERE IN TIMES SQUARE, WHERE  SOME BUSINESSES HAVE  BEEN BOARDED UP, BECAUSE WHEN  THERE WAS A SHUT DOWN  FOR CORONAVIRUS, THEY EITHER  WEREN'T GOING TO BE  AROUND FOR AWHILE.  THEY PUT PLYWOOD AND THEN SOME  OTHER BUSINESSES  BOARDED UP BECAUSE OF THE  DEMONSTRATIONS.  NOW THAT PLYWOOD HAS GOT TO  COME DOWN IF THEY ARE  GOING TO OPEN UP FOR ANY KIND  OF CURB-SIDE PICKUP.  BUT IT'S A SLOW PROCESS, AND  RETAILERS ARE ANXIOUS  TO OPEN.  THEY'RE ANXIOUS TO GET GOING.  WE TALKED TO ONE WOMAN, WHO  SAID SHE LOST 80% OF HER  BUSINESS WHILE THINGS WERE SHUT  DOWN, AND SHE JUST  HOPES THAT WHILE SHE IS GOING  TO BE DOING CURB-SIDE  PICK UP THAT PEOPLE WILL COME  BACK WHEN SHE OPENS UP  AGAIN TODAY.  >> I KNOW GOVERNOR CUOMO RODE  THE SUBWAY TO SHOW NEW  YORKERS THAT IT'S SAFE.  WHAT IS THE CITY DOING TO  PROTECT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO  USE THE SUBWAY AND THE BUSES TO  GET AROUND TOWN?  >> Reporter:  ONE OF THE THINGS  THEY'RE DOING IS  REQUIRING EVERYBODY TO WEAR A  MASK.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, THEY'RE  GOING TO PROVIDE ONE  FOR YOU.  THEY'RE OFFERING PEOPLE FREE  HAND SANITIZER.  THEY'RE ALSO PUTTING DOWN  MARKERS ON THE PLATFORMS  IN THE STATION, ENCOURAGING  PEOPLE TO  SOCIAL-DISTANCE.  IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DO ON A  NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY,  BUT THEY'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE  TO DO IT NONETHELESS.  TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT ONE  SUBWAY RIDER TOLD US ABOUT  HOW THINK FEEL GETTING BACK ON  THE SUBWAY.  >> LESS PEOPLE, LIKE, SPREAD  OUT.  >> IT WASN'T, YOU KNOW, CROWDED  LIKE IT USUALLY IS  ON A NORMAL NEW YORK DAY.  . .  >> I JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT.  >> Reporter: SO THIS IS THE  FIRST DAY, ALSON, OF THE  REOPENING.  MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SLOW, GOING,  BUT PEOPLE ARE  ENCOURAGED THAT IT WILL PICK UP  AS THE REOPENING  CONTINUES.  ALISON.  >> A QUESTION BEFORE YOU GO  ABOUT THE PROTESTS.  I KNOW THERE ARE MORE SCHEDULED  IN NEW YORK CITY  TODAY.  THERE ARE CONCERNS, OF COURSE,  THAT THOSE CROWDS  COULD LEAD TO MORE CORONAVIRUS  CASES.  WHAT IS THE CITY, AND HOW IS  THE CITY TRYING TO  REDUCE THAT RISK?  >> Reporter:  WHAT THE CITY HAS  DONE ALL THE WHILE,  THEY KEEP TELLING PEOPLE TO  WEAR MASKS, AND A LARGE  PORTION OF PEOPLE ARE WEARING  MASKS, BUT THEY'RE  ALSO TELLING PEOPLE TO SOCIAL- DISTANCE.  THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO.  THE CITY HAS OPENED UP ANOTHER  225 FREE TESTING  CENTERS AROUND THE CITY.  FIFTEEN OF THOSE ARE LOCATED IN  PLACES WHERE THE  DEMONSTRATIONS WERE THE  LARGEST.  AND THEY'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE  TO GO AND GET TESTED.  SO IF THEY WERE EXPOSED AND HAD  BECOME INFECTED,  THEY COULD QUARANTINE  THEMSELVES AND HOPEFULLY  REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY  KIND OF SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS THAT COULD RESULT AS A  RESULT OF THE CLOSE  CONTACT EVERYONE HAD DURING  THESE PROTEST  DEMONSTRATIONS, ALISON.  >> ALL RIGHT.  NEW YORK CITY REOPENING TODAY.  REHENA ELLISON, A QUIETER THAN  USUAL TIMES SQUARE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  >> YOU'RE WELCOME.  >>> GEORGE FLOYD IS BEING  ROBBED IN HIS HOMETOWN OF  HOUSTON TODAY.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PAYING  THEIR RESPECTS AT A  PUBLIC MEMORIAL.  GOVERNOR GREG ABBOT WAS THERE,  AND SAID THAT FLOYD'S  DEATH WILL NOT BE IN VAIN.  .  >>> LOREN CHESKY JOINING ME  FROM HOUSTON.  HOW ARE PEOPLE IN GEORGE'S  HOMETOWN REMEMBERING HIM  TODAY?  >> ALISON, PEOPLE ARE COMING  OUT, BECAUSE THEY  ABSOLUTELY WANT TO CELEBRATE  HIS LIFE AND ALSO HONOR  THE MAN THAT HAS BECOME BECOME  REALLY A SYMBOL FOR A  GLOBAL MOVEMENT.  HE GREW UP IN THE THIRD WARD  NEIGHBORHOOD.  I JUST HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO  TWO OF HIS FORMER  HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS.  ONE OF THEM WAS A TEAMMATE ON  THAT FOOTBALL TEAM  WHERE GEORGE FLOYD WAS A STAND  OUT PLAYER.  AND, ALSON, YOU GET THE SENSE,  WHEN YOU COME TO  HOUSTON, HOW DEEP HIS TIES RUN.  AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE  PEOPLE THAT HE GREW UP  WITH ARE COMING HERE TO THE  CHURCH, TO THE SOUTHWEST  OF THE CITY, OR THEY'RE TAKING  PART IN THIS  VISITATION WHERE SEVERAL  THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE  ALREADY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH.  BUT ON TOP OF THAT, WE KNOW  THAT PEOPLE ARE DRIVING  IN FROM ALL OVER THE STATE,  GETTING -- DRIVING HOURS  TO GET HERE ALISON, AND THEN  STANDING REALLY HOURS  IN MORE THAN 90-DEGREE HEAT SO  THEY CAN HAVE A  CHANCE AND HONOR HIS LIFE.  WE DO KNOW THAT THIS STARTED AT  1. IT GOES UNTIL 6:00 P.M.  THIS EVENING.  .  >> MORGAN, YOU CAN SEE THAT IN  THE IMAGE THERE IN  THE LINE OF PEOPLE WITH MASKS  ON.  LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE DOING  THEIR BEST TO SPREAD OUT.  WHAT ELSE ARE THEY DOING THERE  TO MAKE SURE, YOU  KNOW, THAT THEY'RE PROTECTING  PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE  -- THEY'RE KEEPING THEM SAFE  WHILE THEY'RE INSIDE?  >> Reporter:  RIGHT.  THEY HAVE ONE SPECIFICALLY  MARKED ENTRANCE AND EXIT.  NOBODY IS HAVING TO CROSS PATHS  WITH ONE ANOTHER.  THEY'RE KEEPING A STEADY STREAM  OF PEOPLE GOING IN,  ALSON, AND THERE'S SUCH LARGE  GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT  ARE COMING OUT TO THIS PLACE,  THAT THEY'RE SHUT LING  PEOPLE TO AND FROM THIS CHURCH,  AND THAT'S BEEN  GOING ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS NOW.  IN THE MEANTIME, YOU DO GET THE  SENSE FROM PEOPLE  WAITING OUTSIDE, THAT EVEN IF  THEY DIDN'T GROW UP  TOGETHER, THERE IS NOW KIND OF  A SHARED KINSHIP OF  SORTS BY JUST COMING OUT HERE  TO HONOR THE LIFE OF  GEORGE FLOYD.  ONE OF HIS FORMER TEAMMATES  MADE A GREAT POINT,  SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, WHENEVER  HE WAS GROWING UP,  YOU KNOW, HE JUST WENT BY, YOU  KNOW, FLOYD ON THE  FOOTBALL FIELD.  AND . HE SAYS THAT TODAY, HE'S  NOW KNOWN AS GEORGE FLOYD.  AND EVERYONE, WHEN THEY SAY HIS  NAME, KNOWS WHAT IT  REALLY MEANS WHEN IT'S REALLY  THE CATALYST FOR THIS  ENTIRE MOVEMENT, ALSON.  AND IN A VERY TELLING POST ON  SOCIAL MEDIA THAT  GEORGE FLOYD MADE JUST A FEW  MONTHS PRIOR TO HIS  DEATH, WHEN HIS TEAMMATE TOLD  ME THAT WHEN HE WENT  ON, I BELIEVE, FACEBOOK, AND HE  SAYS, \"I'M GOING TO  CHANGE THE WORLD,\" AND HIS  TEAMMATE TOLD MANY NOBODY  AT THAT POINT IN TIME WOULD  HAVE EVER WANTED THIS TO  HAPPEN THIS WAY, BUT HE SAYS  THAT IN HINDSIGHT, YOU  KNOW, GEORGE FLOYD REALLY DID  GOT HIS WISH IN THAT  HE HAS ABSOLUTELY CHANGED THE  WORLD, AND SEEING THE  RESPONSE HERE, EVERYONE COMING  OUT TO THIS CHURCH IS  JUST ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF THAT.  OF COURSE, HE'LL BE LAID TO  REST NEAR HIS MOTHER IN  A PRIVATE CEREMONY TOMORROW.  ALISON?  >> YEAH.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT  PRIVATE CEREMONY  TOMORROW, THAT FUNERAL?  WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT?  >> Reporter:  WE KNOW THAT IT  WAS PRIVATELY FINALSED  BY BOXER FLOYD MAYWEATHER.  HE WILL ALSO BE IN ATTENAT THAT  EVENT.  WE KNOW IT IS PRIVATE.  SO CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY  ONLY.  AND HE'LL BE LAID TO REST NEAR  HIS MOTHER.  AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, IT'S  GIVING A LOT OF PEOPLE  HERE PAUSE, ALISON, BECAUSE IT  WILL BE REUNITED WITH  THE VERY WOMAN THAT HE CRIED  OUT FOR IN HIS FINAL  MOMENTS OF LIFE, AND THAT'S  ABSOLUTELY NOT LOST ON  ANYONE HERE, THE FACT HE IS NOW  GOING TO BE GOING  HOME TO BE NEXT TO HER.  ALISON?  >> YEAH, MORGAN.  I THINK IT'S THE FIRST THING  MANY OF US THOUGHT OF  WHEN YOU SAID THAT.  REALLY MOVING.  WE KNOW THAT FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS IN  HOUSTON TODAY.  HE WILL NOT BE AT THE FUNERAL,  BUT HE MET PRIVATELY  WITH FLOYD'S FAMILY.  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US, WHAT DO  YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT  MEETING?  >> Reporter:  YEAH.  WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THAT  MEETING, ALISON.  WE KNOW THAT FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT  DID HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET IN  PRIVATE WITH THE  FAMILY.  WE EVEN REACHED OUT TO  REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE  FAMILY AND TO REPRESENTATIVES  FROM THE FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT -- OFFICE.  NEITHER ONE HAS SHARED EXACTLY  WHAT WAS SAID.  BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THAT  CERTAINLY TOOK PLACE.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE VICE  PRESIDENT KEEPING A  RELATIVELY LOW FROM FILE, NOT  MAKING ANY APPEARANCE  HERE AT THE CHURCH TODAY.  ALISON.  >> ALL RIGHT.  THANKS SO MUCH.  .  >>> CRISTOBAL, A TROPICAL  DEPRESSION BRINGING  TORRENTIAL RAIN AND FLASH- FLOODING TO PARTS OF THE  GULF COAST.  CRISTOBAL MADE LANDFILL OVER  THE WEEKEND IN  LOUISIANA.  CARRY SANDERS JOINING ME.  MY GOODNESS, CARRIE, THE WATER  WHERE YOU ARE, TELL  US MORE ABOUT WHAT CONDITIONS  ARE LIKE THERE, WHERE  YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.  >> Reporter:  WELL, IT  CERTAINLY HAS LET UP, BUT  THERE ARE STILL REMNANTS OF  THIS TROPICAL STORM.  I POSITIONED MYSELF ON THE  BEACH.  IF YOU LOOK OVER THERE, YOU SEE  THE PIER, BUT WHAT  YOU DON'T SEE IS THE REST OF  THE PIER?  BECAUSE THE STORM SURGE THAT  CAME IN TORE OFF A GOOD  PORTION OF THE PIER, AND WASHED  IT DOWN THE BEACH  ABOUT 1/2-MILE TO MILE DOWN THE  BEACH.  . THE REAL CONCERN IS THERE IS  MOVING NORTH.  . OVER U.S. 90.  FLASH-FLOODING IN TENNESSEE AND  IN ARKANSAS, ALISON.  >> CARRIE, WE'VE HEARD THE  REPORTS OVER THE WEEKEND,  FLASH-FLOODING, EVEN A TORNADO.  WE'RE SHOWING IMAGES NOW OF  JUST NEIGHBORHOODS  FLOODED OUT.  WHAT IS THE CLEAN UP LOOKING  LIKE TODAY FOR FOLKS?  >> Reporter:  WELL, THE CLEAN  UP IS SLOW-GOING.  FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT HERE IN  MISSISSIPPI, THEY'RE  WAITING FOR THE STATE  DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION  TO GET IN ON U.S. 90 TO SORT OF  MOVE THE SAND THAT  CAME IN, GET SOME FRONT-END  LOADERS THERE.  YOU MENTIONED THE TORNADOES.  THERE WERE SOME WATERSPOUTS,  TORNADOES, ONE TORNADO.  YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THE SIZE  OF THE STORM ALL THE  WAY FROM FLORIDA OVER TO NEW  ORLEANS.  THERE WAS ONE TORNADO THAT  TOUCHED DOWN IN ORLANDO,  AND THAT CAUSED A FAIR AMOUNT  OF DAMAGE, DISPLACING  ABOUT 50 PEOPLE.  FORTUNATELY, NOBODY WAS  SERIOUSLY INJURED.  BUT WHAT YOU DO HAVE THERE IS  HOMES THAT LOST THEIR  ROOFS.  CARS FLIPPED OVER.  AND OF COURSE, THE POWER  OUTAGES, AND SO PEOPLE ARE  DEALING WITH THAT.  WHEN YOU'VE LOST THE ROOF TO  YOUR HOUSE, IT IS A  VERY SLOW RETURN, BECAUSE, YOU  KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST  GO BACK HOME.  ALISON?  >> YOU SURE CAN'T.  >> CARRIE, WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU  STANDING THERE,  WEARING A MASK RIGHT NOW,  WHICH, OF COURSE, BRINGS  TO MIND THE CORONAVIRUS.  SOME AREAS EVACUATED.  THE RESIDENTS WERE TOLD TO SEEK  SHELTER.  ARE THERE CONCERNS THAT THIS  STORM COULD SPREAD  CORONAVIRUS CASES AND INCREASE  CASES OF CORONAVIRUS?  >> Reporter:  WELL, THIS IS  REALLY ABOUT, I GUESS, A  PRACTICE RUN FOR EVERYBODY.  PEOPLE WERE TOLD, FOR INSTANCE,  DOWN IN GRAND ISLE  AND LOUISIANA THAT HAY HAD TO  EVACUATE.  IT'S A GOOD THING THE PEOPLE  THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN  VISITORS, BECAUSE MOST OF THAT  ISLAND WAS WASHED  OVER, A BIG SURPRISE.  BUT THEY DID NOT OPEN SHELTERS,  NUMBERS, THE PUBLIC  SHELTERS LIKE GOING TO THE  SCHOOLS.  BUT THIS WAS A GOOD REMINDER TO  EVERYBODY THAT IN  THIS TIME OF CORONAVIRUS,  SHELTERS WILL BE VERY  DIFFERENT.  IN FACT, IF YOU GO TO A SHELTER  IN THE PAST, YOU  WILL FIND YOURSELF MAYBE IN THE  GYMNASIUM SPREAD  OUT.  NOW, THEY'RE LIKELY TO OPEN ONE  CLASS, ANOTHER  CLASSROOM, ANOTHER CLASSROOM TO  TRY AND HAVE PEOPLE   SOCIALLY DISTANCED.  BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE  EASY.  AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE  SAYING, IN FLORIDA --  IN FACT, I HAD A PRESS  CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE  NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER.  ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE  TALKING ABOUT IS THAT  THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL  SOME PEOPLE, \"THINK  TWICE ABOUT EVACUATING,\" AND  THAT IS THE FIRST TIME  WE'VE EVER HEARD THAT IN A  HURRICANE SEASON.  IT'S USUALLY GOT OUT.  . THE THING ABOUT THE  TEMPERATURE, THEY HAVE A LOT  SPREAD OUT NOW, BECAUSE WHEN  THEY DO OPEN SHELTERS,  THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK PEOPLE'S  TEMPERATURE WITH  THOSE LITTLE HAND-HELD DEVICES,  AND IF YOU HAVE A  TEMPERATURE, THEY'RE GOING TO  DIRECT PEOPLE TO WHAT  THEY CALL COVID-19 SHELTERS.  SO THERE'S A LOT OF  COMPLICATIONS FOR HURRICANE  SEASON, ALISON.  >> YEAH.  >> UNFORTUNATELY, THE  PREDICTION IS FOR 19 NAMED  STORMS.  LOOK AT THIS.  WE'RE 8 DAYS INTO THE HURRICANE  SEASON.  FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW,  HURRICANES AND TROPICAL  STORMS GET THEIR NAMES A, B,  AND C. WE'RE ON CRISTOBAL ON  THE 8th DAY.  JUST CONSIDER WHAT WE'RE  LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY FOR  A VERY, VERY LONG HURRICANE  SEASON.  . .  >>> YOU'RE WATCHING \"NBC NEWS  NOW.\"  >> WHEN PEOPLE GO BACK TO THEIR  JOBS, THEY WANT TO  MAKE SURE THEY ARE PROTECTED.  >> IT'S NEWS MADE FOR YOUR  STREAMING WOD, LIVE  WEEKDAYS, STARTING AT 6:00 A.M.  EASTERN.  >>> WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE  TODAY?  WHAT ARE THE PROTESTS THERE  DEMANDING?  >> Reporter:  ALISON, WE WERE  OUT THERE THIS  WEEKEND, WHERE WE SAW THOUSANDS  OF WASHINGTON  TONEIANS AND PEOPLE FROM THIS  LARGER AREA COMING TO  THE SHADOW OF THE WHITE HOUSE,  AS WE'VE SEEN THEM  DOING FOR NOW ALMOST OVER A  WEEK.  THESE PROTESTS SHOW NO SIGN OF  ABATING, ALTHOUGH  TODAY WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE  HUNDREDS AND NOT THE  THOUSANDS.  I WANT TO SET THE SCENE.  LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE  FENCE AROUND LAFAYETTE  SQUARE PARK.  THEY'VE GOT SIGNS ALL OVER HERE  THAT SAY \"BLACK  LIVES MATTER,\" BASICALLY TAKING  THIS PIECE OF  FORTIFICATION AROUND THE PARK,  AND INSTEAD MAKING IT  A PART OF THIS SCENE HERE, DOWN  IN THE SHADOW OF THE  WHITE HOUSE.  AND WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE BE  PEACEFUL.  WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE COME OUT HERE  WITH THEIR KIDS WITH  THEIR DOGS, MANY SAYING THEY  WANT TO BE A PART OF  THIS MOMENT IN TIME AND TO SHOW  THE FUTURE  GENERATIONS JUST HOW IMPORTANT  THIS MOMENT IS.  I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU THAT  WE'VE SPAN TO ABOUT WHY  THEY'RE OUT HERE AND WHY  THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THE  GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON.  >> HAVING THE PAINTINGS IS  AMAZING, BUT UNTIL WE  HAVE THAT WRITTEN DOWN, AND  ACTUAL ACTION, I THINK  PEOPLE NEED TO KEEP COMING OUT  AND SHOWING THAT  THEY'RE SUPPORTING THE CAUSE.  >> MY KNEW ROLE IS ACTIVISM, SO  I'M GOING TO -- I'LL  BE DOWN HERE A COUPLE TIMES A  WEEK UNTIL THIS FENCE  COMES DOWN, AND THEN I'LL BE  WORKING, DOING WHATEVER  I CAN DO.  >> Reporter:  PEOPLE SAY THEY  WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS  ISN'T JUST A SHORT-LIVED MOMENT  IN TIME, BUT THEY'RE  ABLE TO KEEP THIS MOMENTUM  GOING SO THEY CAN GET THE  KIND OF CHANGE THEY WANT TO SEE  IN TERMS OF  REFORMING HOW POLICE AS WELL AS  HOW SOME COMMUNITIES  FUND POLICE FORCES AS WELL AS  OTHER PARTS OF THE  COMMUNITY, AND SO A LOT OF THE  FOLKS OUT HERE,  SAYING THIS MOMENT FEELS  DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE  DIVERSITY OF THE CROWD.  PEOPLE OF ALL RACES, ALL AGES,  COMING OUT TO MAKE  SURE THEY'RE UNITED ON THE  FRONT OF BLACK LIVES  MATTER, SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD  FROM ACTIVISTS AND  PROTESTERS ALIKE THAT SAY,  \"THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS  MOMENT FEEL DIFFERENT TO THEM.\"  >> SURE FEELS THAT WAY.  CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT THE  PROPOSALS THE CITY  COUNCIL IS INTRODUCING  TOMORROW?  >> Reporter:  YOU'RE RIGHT.  THAT PROPOSAL IS GOING TO BE  INTRODUCED TOMORROW.  AND YOU HIT A LOT OF THOSE KEY  POINTS.  IT'S GOING TO BE BANNING  CHOKEHOLDS.  IT WILL BE MAKING SURE THAT  COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN BE  ADJUDICATED OUTSIDE THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT BY AN  INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  FORCE.  IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING  AT HOW THESE POLICE  FORCES ARE FUNDED, WHERE THAT  KIND OF MONEY GOES,  AND IF THERE'S ANY WAY THEY CAN  MORE CREATIVELY USE  THOSE FUNDS TO KEEP COMMUNITIES  SAFER.  NOW, IT'S INTERESTING.  THE D.C. MAYOR, MORE YELL  BOWSER, SHE SAYS AFTER A  PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE BILL,  SHE'S GOING TO  SUPPORT IT.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE WATCHED  THAT MURAL THAT THE  D.C. MAYOR COMMISSIONED THAT  SAYS BLACK LIVES  MATTER.  OVER THE WEEKEND, ACTIVISTS  ADDED DEFUND THE POLICE.  SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO MAKE  SURE IT WAS CLEAR THAT  WASN'T AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE  MURAL SHE  COMMISSIONED.  , >> DEMOCRATS INTRODUCING A  SWEEPING BILL THAT  INCLUDES BANS ON CHOKEHOLDS AND  WARRANTS IN DRUG  CASES.  >> WE WANT TO MAKE AMERICA  PROUD AGAIN.  SO DO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE.  SO I BELIEVE THIS IS AN  OPPORTUNITY.  WE WILL MISS THE OPPORTUNITY IF  WE DIDN'T TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF IT, AND SHOW A  WAY, RACIAL PROFILING,  CHOKEHOLDS, THE DOCTRINE OF ALL  THE ISSUES THAT WE  DEAL WITH AND THE LEGISLATION  WILL MAKE A  DIFFERENCE, A DISCRETE  DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE RESPECT  PEOPLE.  >> Reporter:  SO WHAT IS IN IT?  WHAT DOES IT INCLUDE?  IT BANS CHOKEHOLDS, WHICH  INCLUDES HOW GEORGE FLOYD  DIED.  JUST LIKE HOW BRIANNA TAYLOR  DIED.  IT DOES BOTH OF THOSE THINGS,  BY TIEING FEDERAL  FUNDING TO POLICE DEPARTMENTS,  IMPING THESE REFORMS.  IT ALSO ATTEMPTS TO HOLD POLICE  DEPARTMENTS  ACCOUNTABLE AND INDIVIDUAL  POLICE ACCOUNTABLE BY  CREATING A NATIONAL DATABASE OF  POLICE MISCONDUCT.  AND IT COLLECTS DATA ON POLICE  USE OF FORCE AS WELL.  THERE'S ANOTHER INTERESTING  THING ABOUT THIS  LEGISLATION, ALSON, IS THAT IT  DOES NOT INCREASE  MONEY FOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN  ORDER FOR THEM TO  IMPLEMENT THEIR REFORM.  IT DOESN'T SHRINK POLICE  DEPARTMENT BUDGETS EITHER,  LIKE SOME ACTIVISTS ARE CALLING  FOR.  BUT IT IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT  THAT THIS FUND POLICE  MOVEMENT DOES HAVE A LOT OF  POWER AND A LOT OF  WEIGHT, ESPECIALLY AMONG  DEMOCRATS, WHO ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT IT IS A LOCAL ISSUE TO  DEFUND THE POLICING, HOW  THEY WANT TO DO -- WHAT THEY  WANT TO DO WITH THEIR  BUDGET.  BUT ALSO THAT DEMOCRATS  COMPLETELY SUPPORT FUNDING  OTHER PROGRAMS, SUCH AS MENTAL  HEALTH AND SCHOOLS,  THINGS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR  BLACK AMERICANS WHO  HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY  DISENFRANCHISED IN THE SYSTEM.  SO THIS IS A BILL THAT  DEMOCRATS TELL ME IS MUCH  MORE NARROW THAN SOME WOULD  HAVE LIKED.  THEY WANT TO TRY TO GET IT  THROUGH CONGRESS.  AND SPEAKER PELOSI CALLED THIS  JUST A FIRST STEP.  >> LEANNE, I HAVE TO ASK  DEMOCRATS INTRODUCED IT.  DOES IT HAVE ANY REPUBLICAN  SUPPORT?  >> Reporter:  IT HAS NO  REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AT THIS  MOMENT, AND IT COULD BE  DIFFICULT TO GET THAT.  >> OKAY.  >> ESPECIALLY SINCE PRESIDENT  TRUMP TWEETED JUST AN  HOUR OR TWO BEFORE THE  DEMOCRATS UNVEILED THIS  LEGISLATION, TIEING THEM TO THE  DEFUND THE POLICE  MOVEMENT, CALLING DEMOCRATS  CRAZY RADICALS, AND  INSISTING THAT HE IS THE LAW  AND ORDER PRESIDENT,  THAT HE IS TRYING TO MAKE THIS  ISSUE A POLITICAL  ISSUE.  THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HE RAN ON  SUCCESSFULLY IN 2016  OF LAW AND ORDER, AND IT LOOKS  LIKE HE'S INTENDING  TO DO THAT AGAIN.  BUT HERE'S WHAT DEMOCRATS HAVE  TO SAY ABOUT THAT.  >> SOME SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE  ACKNOWLEDGED  EGREGIOUS ROUNDS, BUT FEW HAVE  EXPRESSED THE NEED  FOR ACTION.  TOO MANY HAVE REMAINED SILENT.  MAYBE THEY'RE HOPING THE ISSUE  GOES AWAY.  I PROMISE THEM, IT WILL NOT.  >> THE LAW AND ORDER MESSAGE,  THERE'S NOTHING NEW  ABOUT THAT MESSAGE, AND I DO  NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BE  SUCCESSFUL.  .  >> THIS BILL WILL PASS, MOST  LIKELY.  BUT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS  WHEN IT GETS TO THE  REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE.  NOW, WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY  REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE COME  OUT AND OUTRIGHT -- SAYING IT  IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL.  THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT.  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH  McCONNELL SAID HE IS  GOING TO TAKE A LOOK.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT, THE ONLY  BLACK REPUBLICAN IN THE  SENATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, HE  SAID THAT HE IS GOING  TO RELEASE HIS OWN PROPOSAL  THIS WEEK AS WELL.  SO WHILE THEY MIGHT NOT TAKE UP  THE DEMOCRATS' BILL  WHOLESALE, THERE COULD BE SOME  ROOM FOR COMPROMISE.  BUT WITH THE PRESIDENT IN  THERE, YOU KNOW, TWEETING,  REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THIS A  WEDGE ISSUE.  .  >>> GEORGE FLOYD'S BROTHER WILL  TESTIFY ON  WEDNESDAY.  WHAT DO YOU KNOW?  WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT  HEARING?  >> THAT HEARING IS ABOUT RACIAL  PROFILING IN THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT.  IT'S ABOUT COMMUNITY POLICING  AND HOW THE POLICE  INTERACT WITH THE COMMUNITY.  . IT IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY  TO GIVE HIM A PLATFORM,  AN ABILITY TO SPEAK ABOUT HIS  BROTHER, WHAT  HAPPENED.  SO IT'S GOING TO BE PERHAPS A  VERY POWERFUL MOMENT  IN THIS BROADER PICTURE OF  DEMOCRATS TRYING TO  ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN  LEGISLATIVE WAY, BUT ALSO  WHILE USING THE PLATFORM THEY  HAVE TO GIVE ME PEOPLE  WHO ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS  DEBATE THE ABILITY TO  SPEAK, ALISON.  >> LEANNE CALDWELL, GREAT TO  SEE YOU.  THANK YOU.  >>> THE LAWYER FOR  EXMINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER  THOMAS LANE IS PREVIEWING HIS  DEFENSE PLAN.  LANE IS CHARGED WITH AIDING AND  ABETTING SECOND  DEGREE MURDER.  HIS LAWYER SAYS THAT LANE IS IN  SOLITARY COB FINE.  . IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW,  GRAY TOLD CORRESPONDENT  DAVE GUTIEREZ THERE IS EVIDENCE  THAT PROVES HIS   CLIENT'S INNOCENCE.  >> FIRST OF ALL, TELL ME -- I  SAW YOUR COMMENTS LATE  LAST WEEK AFTER THAT -- THE  INITIAL COURT  APPEARANCE.  IN A NUTSHELL --  >> HE IS CHARGED IN ABETTING  SECOND DEGREE MURDER,  AND IN ORDER TO AID AND ABET,  YOU HAVE TO HAVE  KNOWLEDGE WHAT THE PRINCIPAL IS  DOING, AND THAT  WOULD BE SHOVIN, AND YOU HAVE  TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT  HE WAS MURDERING MR. GEORGE.  AND YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE  KNOWLEDGE OF THAT, BUT  YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INTENT TO  ASSIST HIM IN DOING  THAT.  THE DIFFERENCE IS, IF YOU OPEN  A DOOR FOR A BANK  ROBBER, EVEN IF HE'S GOT THE  MASKS AND YOU'RE NOT  PAYING ATTENTION, YOU'RE NOT  AIDING AND ABETTING THE  BANK ROBBER, BECAUSE YOU HAVE  AN INTENT TO COMMIT A  CRIME.  >> THIS IS HIS FOURTH DAY.  >> FOURTH DAY, YES.  >> SHOVIN CAME ON THE SCENE, 0  YEARS' EXPERIENCE.  HE HAD 4 DAYS EXPERIENCE.  KING HAD 0 DAYS.  THEY WERE PARTNERS.  >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE  ARGUING THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW  ANY BETTER, OR HE WAS STILL --  HE WAS A ROOKIE COP.  >> RELYING ON HIS TRAINING AS A  POLICE OFFICER IN  FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS OF A  TRAINING OFFICER.  SHOVIN WAS ALSO A TRAINING  OFFICER.  >> SO WAS HE FOLLOWING ORDERS.  >> HE WAS DOING WHAT HE THOUGHT  WAS RIGHT.  HE WAS NOT ORDERED TO DO WHAT  HE WAS DOING.  HOWEVER, HE WAS -- IF YOU WANT  TO TALK ABOUT.  WHEN HE WAS LYING ON THE  GROUND, HANDCUFFED.  MY CLIENT'S DOWN BY HIS FEET  TWICE.  HE'S THINKING MAYBE WE SHOULD  ROLL HIM OVER.  HE SAYS, \"HE CAN'T BREATHE.\"  WELL, ROLL HIM OVER.  SHOVIN, THE 20-YEAR-EXPERIENCED  POLICE OFFICER SAID,  \"NO, HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT THIS  WAY.\"  >> WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS  MESSAGE WOULD BE TO THE  FAMILY OF GEORGE FLOYD?  >> WELL, HE'S EXTREMELY SORRY  FOR -- HE'S SORRY THE  MAN DIED, BUT HE -- HE DOESN'T  -- HE DOESN'T BELIEVE  THAT HE HAD -- IN THE HE WAS  THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH.  HE WAS NOT THE CAUSE.  I THINK HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT  THAT, THAT HE WAS THE  ONE THAT ASKED TO ROLL HIM  OVER.  HE WAS THE ONE THAT WENT IN THE  AMBULANCE.  >> BUT TO BE CLEAR, YOUR CLIENT  DOESN'T REGRET  TRYING TO RESTRAIN HIM.  HE DOES THINK THAT SHOVIN. DOES  HE -- YES, I WOULDN'T GO THERE.  I WON'T GO THERE NOW, BECAUSE  HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.  HE WAS FOLLOWING THE TRAINING  OFFICER'S MANDATE.  >>> THE EDITOR OF \"THE NEW YORK  TIMES\" EDITORIAL  PAGE HAS RESIGNED.  JAMES BENNETT STEPPED DOWN  YESTERDAY AFTER  PUBLISHING A CONTROVERSIAL OP- ED BY SENATOR TOM COT  TONIGHT.  MANY OF THE \"TIMES\" STAFFERS  ARGUED TO PUT BLACK  STAFFERS IN DANGER.  DILLON BIERS JOINING ME NOW.  TELL US MORE IF YOU WILL ABOUT  THE OP-ED.  WHAT MADE IT SO CONTROVERSIAL,  AND WHAT DO WE KNOW  ABOUT BENNETT'S RESIGNATION?  >> SURE.  THERE ARE A LOT OF FACETS TO  THIS, ALSON, BUT WHAT  IT STARTS WITH. TO EFFECTIVELY  GO IN AND HELP CITIES AND LOCAL  POLICE OFFICERS WITH QUELLING  THE PROTEST AND THE --  YOU KNOW, THE DEMONSTRATIONS  THAT ARE HAPPENING IN  THE STREETS RIGHT NOW.  A GROUP OF \"NEW YORK TIMES\"  STAFFERS ULTIMATELY  HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF  THEM CAME OUT IN  PROTEST OF THIS DECISION, AND  MANY BLACK EMPLOYEES  OF \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" CAME  OUT TWEETING THAT THIS  ARTICLE AND THE PUBLICATION OF  THIS ARTICLE IN \"THE  TIMES\" PUT THEM IN JEOPARDY,  PUT THEIR LIVES AT  RISK.  WHAT THAT DID IS KICK OFF A  LARGER DEBATE.  THERE ARE SUCH PRESSING  CONCERNS AFTER RACIAL  JUSTICE OF POLICE BRUTALITY, OF  STATE POWER, AND  THAT IS INDICATIVE OF A LARGER  DEBATE WE ARE SEEING,  SEEING FROM NEWSROOMS IN NEW  YORK AND D.C. TO TECH  CLASSROOMS IN SILICON VALLEY.  TO TRY AND BRING IN THE MOST  BROAD ARRAY OF CHOICES  ON THIS ISSUE AND TAKE A MORAL  STAND ON THE PRESSING  URGENT MATTERS.  >> AS YOU SAID, THIS DEBATE IS  NOT AT ALL EXCLUSIVE  TO \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\"  SO MANY NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE  ASKING WHAT THE ROLE  OF JOURNALISTS IS RIGHT NOW.  WHERE ELSE IS THIS COMING UP?  >> A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS  PROTESTED THE RATHER  UNFORTUNATE HEADLINE, AND THAT  LED TO THE  RESIGNATION OF THE TOP EDITOR  THERE.  AND LIKE WE SAID, IT'S  HAPPENING AT FACEBOOK AND  TWITTER AND SNAPCHAT, WHERE  THESE TECH PLATFORMS  THAT AGAIN HAVE TRIED TO BE  NEUTRAL, HAVE TRIED TO  WELCOME A BROAD ARRAY OF VOICES  AND SORT OF KEEP  THEIR HANDS CLEAN OF ANY SORT  OF POLITICAL. THE EDITORIAL  PAGE EDITOR MADE A DECISION,  THE STAFF  WOULD HAVE TO GRIN AND BEAR IT.  THAT IS NO LONGER THE WORLD WE  LIVE IN.  WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD IN  WHICH IF ENOUGH PEOPLE  AMONG THE RANK AND FILE CAN  SORT OF PROTEST AND  PROTEST PUBLICLY, WHAT WE ARE  SEEING IS THEY ARE  ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF FORCING  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.  >> IT IS A DEBATE THAT WILL NO  DOUBT SHAPE THE  FUTURE OF JOURNALISM.  DILLON, THANKS SO MUCH.  >>> ACTIVISTS CALLING FOR  CHANGE ARE ALSO PUSHING  AMERICANS TO FILL OUT THE 2020  CENSUS, INCLUDING  ACTOR DON CHEADLE AND MIKE.  >> LEARN HOW TO TAKE THIS  ENERGY AND ORGANIZE IT.  TAKE THIS ENERGY AND PUT IT  INTO VOTING, PUT IT INTO  VOTING.  .  >> YOU HAVE TO PROPERLY PLOT,  PLAN, STRATEGIZE,  MOBILIZE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY.  TAKE YOUR BUTT TO THE COMPUTER  AND FILL OUT THE  CENSUS SO PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU  ARE AND WHERE YOU ARE.  >> \"NBC NEWS NOW\" CORRESPONDENT  ALEXA FIGHTING A  COUNCIL FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS,  AND FEARS IT COULD  HAPPEN AGAIN.  >> LET'S GET CAMPING.  LET'S GET CAMPING.  >> THE CENSUS COUNT IS PROBABLY  THE MOST IMPORTANT  THING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  DOES.  >> THE CENSUS, WHICH WILL DIE  HOW THE 425 SEATS IN  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  WILL BE DIVIDE AMONG  THE 50 STATES.  THAT DORMS HOW $675 MILLION OF  FEDERAL FUNDS WILL BE  DISTRIBUTED TO STATES FOR  IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICES.  >> GOOD MORNING, BOYS AND  GIRLS.  HOW ARE YOU TODAY?  >> IDEALLY, THIS MONEY WILL BE  DISBURSED DEPENDING  ON FIGURES.  BUT IT WAS A PROBLEM.  >> EVERY CENSUS EXPERIENCES  SOME ISSUES WITH ACTUAL  ACCOUNTS.  >> THE COUNTY DROPPED A  COMPLAINT AGAINST THE  DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE OVER THE  2010 CENSUS NUMBERS,  SAYING IT UNDERCOUNTED THE  LATINO POPULATION.  WITH COSTS IT WOULD NEVER  FORMALLY FIRE.  RIOS IS AN ATTORNEY WHO  REPRESENTED HIDALGO.  >> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT  UNDERCOUNTING MINORITIES,  UNDERCOUNTING THE POOR,  UNDERCOUNTING PEOPLE OF  COLOR.  >> Reporter: THE CENSUS  RECORDED HUDALGO'S  POPULATION AT 744,769 PEOPLE.  ORLANDO SAYS ANYWHERE FROM  25,000 TO 70,000 PEOPLE  WERE MISSED.  HE SHARED SOME AERIAL PHOTOS  WITH US.  WE PRINTED THEM OUT, AND ASKED  HIM TO GO INTO  DETAIL.  >> YOU SEE THE NUMBER IN HERE  IS THE NUMBER THAT IS  REFLECTED IN THE CENSUS BUREAU.  IT'S 60 HERE, NONE HERE.  >> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.  THEY COUNT --  >> AS ONE PERSON.  IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT.  IT'S 210 ROOFTOPS.  210.  THAT'S 0.5, 735 POPULATION.  THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE.  THE CENSUS HAS 66.  >> Reporter: THE CENSUS BUREAU  SAYS THE 2010 CENSUS  MISSED ABOUT 2.1% OF BLACK  AMERICANS AND 1.5% OF  HISPANICS NATIONWIDE, TOTALING  1.0 MILLION PEOPLE.  IN TEXAS, PROJECTIONS  CALCULATED BY THE URBAN  INSTITUTE MORE THAN 550,000  HISPANIC AND BLACK  PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF BEING  MISSED IN THE COUNT.  >> THEY'RE ENCOURAGING MORE OF  AN UNDERCOUNT THAN  OTHER AREAS.  WHY IS THAT?  >> OTHER STATES ARE SPENDING  HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS.  THEY'RE SPENDING 0. THE COUNTY  HAS TO PICK IT UP.  >> Reporter: WE WENT TO  COLONIAL SAN JOAQUIN IN HID  AL GO COUNTY TO MEET ONE GROUP  ON THE FRONT LINES  THERE, THE BORDER PANDEMIC.  MONTHS BEFORE THE CENSUS 2020  GO TIME FOR YOU?  >> YES.  SO WE'RE UP FOR WORKING WITH  OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS  TO MAKE SURE THAT SOUTHERN  COLONIAL IN THE VALLEY  GETS COUNTED, ESPECIALLY  BECAUSE THE RESIDENTS ARE  LOW INCOME, LACK  INFRASTRUCTURE,  DRAINAGE.  >> ON MARCH 26th, A 24-HOUR  SHELTER IN PLACE WENT  INTO EFFECT IN HIDALGO COUNTY  DUE TO THE  CORONAVIRUS.  WE CAUGHT UP WITH ABRAHAM, WHO  SAID THE OUTBREAK IS  A THREAT TO ALL THEIR PREVIOUS  EFFORTS, AND COULD  LEAD TO AN UNDERCOUNT SIMILAR  IF NOT WORSE THAN  2010.  , >> IT'S MAKING THINGS VERY  DIFFICULT.  WE'RE STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE  NUMBERS.  >> A MISCOUNT WOULD BE A BLOW  TO IMPORTANT SERVICES  LIKE HEAD START.  >> OUR PROGRAM IS STRICTLY FOR  LOW-INCOME FAMILIES,  THREE- AND FOUR-YEAR-OLDS, AND  THE POPULATION IS  PROBABLY 99% HISPANIC.  >> MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ARE  RECENT IMMIGRANTS,  UNDOCUMENTED.  .  >> ONE, TWO, THREE.  THE FUNDING AMOUNT IS TO MEET  GROWING DEMAND, IN  PART DUE TO AN INACCURATE COUNT  IN 2010.  >> HAS THIS AREA GROWN?  HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO ADD MORE  --  >> IT HAS GROWN, BUT IT HAS NOT  GROWN WIDE.  WE DO NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL SLOTS  AVAILABLE FOR OUR  CHILDREN.  >> YOU'RE GOING TO SAY SHORT,  TALL.  >> WE DO NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL  FACILITIES.  WE DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO BE  ABLE TO FUND THAT.  >> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS COMING  UP AGAIN AND AGAIN ON  THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THIS ISSUE  IS WHY SHOULD  UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE BE COUNTED?  >> THE FACT IS THAT YOU'RE  HERE.

PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY PARENTS  SHOULD HELP KIDS TALK  ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SEEING.  IT IS HARD EVEN FOR ME AND MY  SON.  FROM THE TIME HE WAS LITTLE TO  NOW AS A TEENAGER.  I'VE STRUGGLED TO FIND THE  RIGHT WORDS TO TELL MY  BLACK CHILD ABOUT HOW TO STAY  SAFE WHEN HE'S NOT  WITH ME.  , .  >>> MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT  LED A ROUND TABLE OF  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FROM  AROUND THE COUNTRY.  LET'S LISTEN IN.  >> AN INABILITY TO TALK ABOUT  SOME VERY IMPORTANT  THINGS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.  THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN VERY  TRYING TO LAW  ENFORCEMENT.  MY NAME IS PATRICK YOST, THE  NATIONAL PRESIDENT OF  INTERNAL ORDER POLICE.  IN THE LAST YEAR, LAST FEW  MONTHS, WE'VE DEALT WITH  COVID.  WE'VE LOST 117 OFFICERS ACROSS  THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE  BEEN EXPOSED TO COVID, AND I  THANK YOU FOR YOUR  LEADERSHIP IN RECOGNIZING,  THERE'S NOT A SINGLE  THING IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT  PROFESSION IN WHICH WE  ARE TRYING TO BRING HOP TO OUR  COMMUNITIES DURING  THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE DID NOT  RECEIVE SOME GREAT  ASSISTANCE FROM YOUR  ADMINISTRATION.  SO THANK YOU FOR THAT SUPPORT.  WE'RE DEALING WITH ANOTHER  CRISIS NOW, A CRISIS  THAT'S PUSHING US TO OUR  LIMITS.  . SO THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE  TO HAVE DIALOGUE.  LOOKING AT US AS A PROFESSION,  WE RECOGNIZE IT'S  TIME FOR US TO HAVE SOME GOOD,  DEEP DISCUSSION, AND  LOOK WITHIN, AND FIND WAYS TO  IMPROVE THE CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM.  AND I STAND HERE TO TELL YOU WE  WANT A SEAT AT THE  TABLE AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSION.  THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US.  >> THANK YOU, PATRICK.  I APPRECIATE IT.  >> FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE HAVE  TO ENSURE, BEFORE WE  CAN COLLABORATE AND MAKE  PROGRESS ON AREAS IN THE  CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARENA, WE HAVE  TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE  SPACE TO DO THAT, AND LAW AND  ORDER CRIMINAL, AND WE  APPRECIATE YOU FOCUSING ON WHAT  IS IMPORTANT, THAT  PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO  EXPRESS THEIR OPINION AND  PROTEST IN A PEACEFUL WAY, BUT  WE CANNOT HAVE  ATTACKS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT,  LOOTING.  THIS IS -- DISMANTLE WHAT WE  HAVE BUILT FOR SO LONG.  IN FLORIDA, WE ARE AT A 48-YEAR  CRIME-RATE LOW.  WE HAVE NOT BEEN THIS LOW IN  CRIME IN SOME TIME.  AND I BELIEVE IT IS PEOPLE LIKE  YOU THAT HAVE  SUPPORTED LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND  I BELIEVE IN ANY  ADMINISTRATION AND ANY CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM AND  ANY STATE.  WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE  IMPROVEMENTS.  AND I ADMIRE THAT YOU ARE  WILLING TO DIG IN AND HAVE  THESE CONVERSATIONS AND DO  THAT.  I THINK THAT MOVING FORWARD,  THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD  EVER DISMANTLE OUR POLICE  ADMINISTRATION COMING FROM  NOT ONLY AS THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL OF THE GREAT STATE  OF FLORIDA, AS A FEDERAL  PROSECUTOR OR AS A JUDGE  FOR OVER A DECADE, BUT AS A  WIFE OF A LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.  I SEE WHAT THESE MEN AND WOMEN  DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY.  THEY RUSH IN TO SAVE US WHEN  OTHER PEOPLE RUSH OUT.  THEY DELIVER BABIES.  THEY CHARGE IN WHEN SOMEONE IS  HYPED UP ON FENTANYL  AND JUST BEAT HIS WIFE AND HIS  KIDS, AND RESCUE HIM.  I MEAN, WE EXPECT GREAT THINGS.  WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM.  WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE  SAFE.  AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE MUST  REMAIN COMMITTED TO  IMPROVING OUR SYSTEM, AND I  ADMIRE THAT ABOUT YOU,  PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU'RE WILLING  TO  TO IMPROVING THE  SYSTEM AND I ADMIRE THAT ABOUT  YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT YOU  ARE ABLE TO DO THAT.   >> THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.   YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.   >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND  STAFF.   THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS  MEETING.   I'M ALSO HERE IS A SERGEANT  WORKING THE STREETS DURING THE  TIME OF CRISIS IN OUR NATION.   THE REASON I'M SO HAPPY TO BE  HERE TODAY REPRESENTING IS  BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR  EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THERE IS  NOT ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  IN THE COUNTRY THAT I HAVE  SPOKEN TO THAT LOOKED AT THIS  HORRIFIC INCIDENT AND REMOTELY  THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING  RIGHT ABOUT IT.   THE GREAT VAST MAJORITY OF MEN  AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT  ARE APPALLED BY WHAT HAPPENED  AT THE VAST MAJORITY ALSO AS  THE PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS SAID,  THOSE ARE THE GOOD MEN AND  WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE  WORK HARD EVERY DAY.   WE APPLAUD IT AND WE ARE GLAD  TO BE HERE BECAUSE THERE IS NO  DOUBT IN ANYBODY'S MIND THAT  THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT  AND WE KNOW THAT AND ARE HAPPY  TO WELCOME THAT INPUT AND DO  WHAT WE CAN TO BE BETTER.

WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER LONG  TIME.   >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND  THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING.   WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO  GO CLOSE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT  TO BRING FORWARD TO THE COUNTRY  CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM TO THE  LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND  SAW THE INJUSTICES IN THE SYSTEM AND RESPONDED BY COMING  TOGETHER TO FIX IT AND IT HAS  BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP THE  REFORMS MAKE THE COMMUNITY SAFER AND HAS MADE THE SYSTEM FAIRER  AND WITH THAT TYPE OF ACTION WE  HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BY  WORKING TOGETHER.

WHEN I SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH  GEORGE FLOYD, IT MADE MY HEART  SINK.   IT HIT ME TO MY CORE AS WELL AS  A LOT OF OTHER LIVES THAT HAVE  BEEN LOST.   WE LIVE IN A PARADOX WHERE MY  WIFE IS SOMETIMES SCARED TO  WALK THE STREETS BY HERSELF.   BUT AT THE SAME THING AS AN  INDIVIDUAL I HAVE ALSO HAD TO  FEAR BEING IN A CERTAIN  NEIGHBORHOOD OR DRIVING CERTAIN  TYPES OF CARS AS AN AFRICAN- AMERICAN JUST BECAUSE MY  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE  AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AFRICAN- AMERICAN MALES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY THAT HAVE STORIES THAT  THEY CAN SHARE BUT I THINK LAW  ENFORCEMENT IS THERE TO THREAD  THE NEEDLE AND HELP US AND  PROTECT US AND NOT TO DEMONIZE  AND IT HAS BEEN VERY TOUGH TO  SEE WHAT HAPPENED IF WE WANT  REAL REFORM STARTS WITH LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND PARTNERING WITH  THEM AND NOT DEMONIZING BECAUSE  I HAVE A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT  INDIVIDUALS IN MY LIFE AND THEY  ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE  I HAVE EVER MET AND WE CANNOT  LET BAD APPLES REPRESENT  SOMETHING THAT IS A QUARTER OF  ANY COMMUNITY.   WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING  TO PARTNER WITH YOU TO FIND  SOLUTIONS BECAUSE THAT IS ONE  THING I HAVE LEARNED WORKING  UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  LEADERSHIP THAT WE ARE NOT JUST  ABOUT TALK BUT ACTION.   COMMUNITIES LEADING TO TAKE  ACTION AND IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR  TO SERVE.   >> GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US  AND GREAT JOB THAT YOU ARE  DOING.   >> GOOD AFTERNOON, MR.  PRESIDENT AND MR. VICE  PRESIDENT.   THANK YOU FOR GETTING THIS  MEETING TOGETHER ONE OF THE  MOST IMPORTANT MEETINGS IN MY  PROFESSION IN MY 43 YEARS AS A  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.   I WILL WILL ECHO SOME OF THE  THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID  ABOUT THE HORRIFIC INCIDENT  THAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY BUT  WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO MAKE THE  APPROPRIATE CHANGES AND LAUNCH  MORE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS  GREAT LEADERSHIP.   THERE ARE LEADERS IN LAW  ENFORCEMENT THAT ARE WILLING TO  STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND GIVE  NEW IDEAS TO MAKE OUR  PROFESSION BETTER AND HOW WE  CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY.  I  THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT  THINGS MR. PRESIDENT THAT YOU  HAVE DONE IS LISTEN TO US AND  WHAT WE HAVE ASKED FOR AND THAT  IS THE COMMISSION ON LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND THE  ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND I  WANT TO THANK YOU FOR  ESTABLISHING THAT BECAUSE NOW  MORE THAN EVER THE COMMISSION  IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.   >> THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.   >> THANK YOU, MR.

THIS IS REALLY THE BEST OF  AMERICA.   I TOLD THE CHIEF THAT MY UNCLE  WAS A POLICE OFFICER IN CHICAGO  FOR 25 YEARS.   AND I GREW UP WITH MY THREE  BROTHERS AND TWO SISTERS WITH  GREAT MEMORIES OF VISITING MY  GRANDPARENTS IN CHICAGO AND  SEEN MY UNCLE AND HIS UNIFORM  AND SEEN HIM WALK OUT THE DOOR  AND PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO  PROTECT AND SERVE AND I WANT TO  PROMISE YOU THAT YOU HAVE A  PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION  THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO STAND  WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO  SERVE AND AT GREAT RISK AND  GREAT SACRIFICE.

IN THE WAKE OF THE TRAGIC EVENT  OF NOW ALMOST TWO WEEKS AGO, WE  WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT HOW  WE CAN IMPROVE BUT IMPROVE IN A  WAY THAT BUILDS ON THE  FOUNDATION.   THE FINEST MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR  COUNTRY, THE BRAVEST MEN AND  WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE  MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND HOW WE MAKE  SURE THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO  DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND TAKE RISKS  EVERY SINGLE DAY TO KEEP OUR  COMMUNITIES SAFE.

THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND  THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE  HERE.   >>> MR. PRESIDENT, IT IS AN  HONOR TO BE HERE AND BE PART OF  THE TEAM FOR NOW THAN TWO YEARS. TAKING ON DOMESTIC POLICY  COUNCIL ABOUT ONE MONTH AGO BUT  RUNNING THE OFFICE OF AMERICAN  IMMUNIZATION BEFORE THAT AND  WHEN I WANT TO SAY IS THIS.   THREE MONTHS AGO ON THIS SIDE  OF THE WHITE HOUSE WE GATHERED  ALMOST -- BLACK LEADERS FROM  AROUND THE COUNTRY CELEBRATING  BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND IN THAT  CELEBRATION YOU TALKED ABOUT  HAVING THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT,  LOWEST POVERTY RATE AND IT WAS  A REMARKABLE FEAT THAT DESERVE  SUCH GREAT CELEBRATION BUT HERE  WE ARE THREE MONTHS LATER AND  AT A DIFFERENT TIME FOR OUR  COUNTRY THAT ON FRIDAY WE HAD  ANOTHER MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT,  2.5+ MILLION JOBS CREATED IN A  TIME OF SUCH DARKNESS AND  DESTRUCTION AND IT REMINDED ME  THAT WHILE WE ARE IN THE MIDST  OF THE GREAT AMERICAN COMEBACK  AND WHILE WE ARE GOING TO BE  RENAMING AND REBUILDING AND  RESTORING THIS COUNTRY THAT  NONE OF IT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT  ALL ARMED LAW-ENFORCEMENT MMO  THAT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT REAL  SAFETY AND REAL SECURITY AND AS  WE CUT POVERTY RATES AND WE  SLASH AND EMPLOYMENT AGAIN AND  BUILD A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY  MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD HAS A SHOT  AT THE AMERICAN DREAM AND IT IS  AGAIN TODAY AND I BELIEVE IT  BEGINS WITH THE PEOPLE IN THIS  ROOM AND LAW ENFORCEMENT  SUPPORTED AND STOOD UP AND I  KNOW YOU AND THE VICE PRESIDENT  STAND BESIDE IT MOVING FORWARD  SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.   IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE  >> THANK YOU, VERY MUCH I'M  PLEASE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH  FOLKS LIKE SHERIFF CHILDRESS  AND GENERAL CAMERON AND MOODY  WHO TOOK THEIR TIME TO COME UP  AND BE A PART OF THE VERY  IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND SOME  OF THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND MY  FAMILY AS WELL.   EVERYBODY I HAVE TALKED TO ON  THE LEADER LEVEL ALSO RANK AND  FILE LEVEL WAS APPALLED BY WHAT  HAPPENED IN MINNEAPOLIS BUT OUT  OF THAT COMES THE COMMITMENT  AND REDOUBLING TO MAKE  IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  AND THE STATE WITH LOCAL LEVEL  AND PLEASED TO HAVE SUCH STRONG  PARTNERS TO WORK WITH TO MAKE  THAT PROGRESS UNDER YOUR  LEADERSHIP.   >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT FOR  YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I THINK  EACH ONE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE  TODAY.   WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE NOT  ROLLING AND WHEN THERE ARE NO  REPORTERS AROUND THIS  UNBELIEVABLE WORK THAT HAS BEEN  GOING ON AND WILL CONTINUE TO  GO ON TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S  NOT JUST WORDS BUT ACTIONS.   ESTHER PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE BEEN  A PRESIDENT OF ACTION AND FOR  SUCH A TIME AS THIS, ACTION  BEGINS AND WILL SPEAK LOUDER  THAN WORDS AND ALL OF YOU THAT  ARE GATHERED AROUND THIS TABLE  TODAY, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR  ACTIONS TO BE HERE AND FOR THE  ACTION THAT WILL COME FROM THIS  PLACE TO SERVE YOU.   >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND  MR. VICE PRESIDENT AND THE  ADMINISTRATION FOR ALLOWING US  TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU ONCE AGAIN  TODAY.   WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT  YOU ARE A FRIEND AND YOU HAVE  BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF LAW- ENFORCEMENT AND AS A MATTER OF  FACT, I HAVE BEEN 29 YEARS WITH  LIVINGSTON COUNTY SHERIFFS  DEPARTMENT, TONY CHILDRESS IS  MY NAME AND I AM THE SHERIFF OF  LIVINGSTON COUNTY.   WHICH IS THE FOURTH LARGEST  COUNTY IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. I CALL IT RURAL CENTRAL  ILLINOIS AND WE HAVE AN IDEOLOGY THAT I FEEL AND MANY OTHERS  FEEL WORKS VERY WELL.  AND THAT  IDEOLOGY IS BEING A FRIEND OF  THE COMMUNITY, SUPPORTING THE  COMMUNITY WITH PROGRAMS LIKE  SHOPPING WITH THE SHERIFF,  HALLOWEEN WITH THE CHILDREN.   ALWAYS BEING THERE WITH A  LISTENING EAR FOR THE COMMUNITY  AND WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY  AND MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE HAPPY  TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND TO TRY  TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE  THIS NATION BETTER BY KEEPING  THE COMMUNITY SAFE AND BY  WORKING WITH YOU AND THE NATION  AND MAKING A BETTER PLACE.   SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL  AND LIVINGSTON COUNTY WILL BE  VERY IMPORTANT IS MANDATORY DE- ESCALATION TRAINING FOR ALL LAW  OFFICERS, PROHIBITION OF ALL  PHYSICAL RESTRAINT, MANEUVERS  ON OR ABOVE THE NECK AND ANY  PHYSICAL ACTS THAT RESTRICT THE  FLOW OF BLOOD OR OXYGEN TO THE  BRAIN REQUIRING ALL OFFICERS TO  RENDER MEDICAL AID TO ALL  PEOPLE AND REQUIRING OFFICERS  TO INTERVENE WHEN PHYSICAL  FORCES ARE BEING APPLIED TO  EITHER STOP OR ATTEMPT FORCES  THAT ARE BEING INAPPROPRIATELY  APPLIED AND IS NO LONGER  REQUIRED.   WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH  YOU HOPEFULLY GET LEGISLATION  INVOLVED IN MAKING THESE THINGS  TRUE AND MAKING THEM LAW.   AND WE JUST THANK YOU AGAIN FOR  ALLOWING US TO BE HERE AND KNOW  THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND IN  ILLINOIS AND ANYTHING YOU NEED,  LET US KNOW.   >> THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.   >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT FOR  CONVENING THE SESSION.   IT'S GOOD TO JOIN WITH ALL MY  FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES FROM THE  LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND  MANY WHOM I'VE WORKED WITH OVER  THE YEARS.   I THINK LAW-ENFORCEMENT FULLY  UNDERSTANDS AND HAS UNDERSTOOD  FOR SOME TIME THAT THE DISTRUST  THAT EXISTS IN THE AFRICAN- AMERICAN COMMUNITY TOWARD THE  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.   AND AS I HAVE BEEN REFLECTING  ON THIS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS  AND WEEKS, IT STRUCK ME THAT  FOR MOST OF OUR HISTORY IN FACT  MAYBE JUST 60 YEARS AGO, THE LAW WAS EXPLICITLY DISCRIMINATORY  AND DID NOT PROVIDE EQUAL  PROTECTION AND IT HAS ONLY BEEN  SINCE THE EARLY 60s THAT THE  LAW HAS ACTUALLY PROVIDED EQUAL  PROTECTION TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WHAT WE HAVE HAD OVER THE PAST  50 YEARS OR SO IS REFORM OF OUR  INSTITUTIONS SO THAT THEY  REFLECT THOSE VALUES, THE  VALUES UPON WHICH THE COUNTRY  WAS FOUNDED AND SOME  INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE  MILITARY HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT  JOB OF REFORMING AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT HAS TOO AND THAT  SOMETHING UNDERSTAND FROM BEING  ATTORNEY GENERAL 30 YEARS AGO  AND WHAT MAKES ME OPTIMISTIC  TODAY IS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT  LEADERS THAT WE DEAL WITH AND  YOU ALL KNOW THIS, NO ONE IS  MORE COMMITTED TO REFORMING THE  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE  PROFESSION OF POLICING TODAY.   AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A  PRESIDENT RECENTLY WHO HAS BEEN  MORE COMMITTED.   HE DID NOT REQUIRE THE CRISIS  WE HAVE TODAY TO GET US STARTED  AND ESTABLISHING A COMMISSION  WHICH HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE  VERY ISSUES WE ARE DEALING WITH  TODAY AND I KNOW THERE IS A LOT  OF INTEREST AMONG POLICE LEADERS FOR CLARITY AND GUIDANCE ON THE  USE OF FORCE WITH SOME OF THE  ISSUES YOU WERE JUST TALKING  ABOUT.   MAKING SURE THE STANDARDS ARE  OUT THERE AND MAKING SURE THEY  ARE TRAINED AND MAKING SURE  THAT THEY ARE ADHERED TO AND WE  ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING  WITH YOU TO GET THAT DONE.   IT'S THE TIME FOR WAITING IS  OVER AND IT'S NOW INCUMBENT  UPON US TO BRING GOOD OUT OF  BAD AND WE CAN DO IT THROUGH  COMMITMENTS WITH LAW  ENFORCEMENT SO LET'S GET IT  DONE AND FINALLY LET ME SAY  THAT THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS  IS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NEED  FOR LAW AND ORDER ABOVE THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MAIN  ENTRANCE IS THE LATIN PHRASE  FROM LAW AND ORDER, EVERYTHING  ELSE COMES.   IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF  CIVILIZATION.   AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE, IT IS  OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE  THAT OUR COUNTRY IS RULED BY  LAW AND NOT BY VIOLENCE.   >> THANK YOU, BILL PICKED.  AND  DANIEL I GOT TO KNOW IN  KENTUCKY AND HAD AN INCREDIBLE  RACE AND WE WATCHED IT TOGETHER. CONGRATULATIONS, THAT WAS SOME  EVENING.   >> IT WAS AN OBVIOUSLY I WAS  GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND  GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON  THIS CURRENT ISSUE.   WE HAVE HAD CHALLENGES WITH  COVID-19 AND NOW WE ARE  STARTING TO SEE CIVIL UNREST IN  OUR SOCIETY AS IT RELATES TO  SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT  BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES  HAVE HAD AS GENERAL BAR SO  ELOQUENTLY STATED AND WE HAVE A  RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS ROOM  WITH ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT  PARTNERS TO LOOK FOR WAYS AS WE  MOVE FORWARD TO DO IT BETTER  AND TO BECOME BETTER CITIZENS  AND BETTER NEIGHBORS AND I'M SO  THANKFUL FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN  OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT  COMMUNITY THAT RECOGNIZES THE  IMPORTANCE OF THAT NEED AND  HAVE THE INTEREST, NOT ONLY TO  PROTECT AND SERVE TO  DEMONSTRATE UNDERSTANDING OF  THE CHALLENGES AND LOOK FOR  WAYS TO HEAL THE FABRIC OF THE  NATION.   WE CANNOT ALLOW FOR CHAOS IN R  STREETS.  WE CAN ALLOW FOR  PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND CANNOT  ALLOW FOR CHAOS AND CANNOT  ALLOW FOR VIOLENCE AND THOSE IN  THIS ROOM KNOW THAT AND THOSE  THAT HAVE BEEN PEACEFULLY  PROTESTING KNOW THAT BUT OUR  CHALLENGE TODAY IS HOW CAN WE  MOVE TOGETHER TO BETTER OUR  COMMUNITY, SOCIETY IN A  MEANINGFUL WAY AND I'M HONORED  TO BE A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION  AND SOMEONE FROM THE  COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY  UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CIVIL  UNREST WE ARE SEEN SO I  APPRECIATE YOU ASSEMBLING THE  ROUNDTABLE AND I APPRECIATE ALL  OF YOU ALL THAT ARE HERE TO BE  A PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND  I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH  YOU ALL AND COLLABORATING.   >> IT'S VERY INTERESTING  BECAUSE AS YOU SEE IN SOME OF  THE PAPERS, THEY WANT TO END  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN  MINNEAPOLIS.   WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?   IN IT.   THEY HAD A COUPLE OF VERY WERE  ROUGH NIGHTS AND A THIRD NIGHT  WHICH IS NOT GOOD.   THEY ABANDONED THE POLICE  PRECINCT, SOMETHING I'VE NEVER  SEEN BEFORE.  AND MAYOR ASKED  THEM TO ABANDON AND NOW THEY  HAVE ABANDONED THE MAYOR IT  LOOKS LIKE.   THE OPPOSITE OF FOR THINKING.   YOU SAY FOR THINKING AND IS  THAT FOR THINKING?   I INSISTED ON BRINGING IN THE  NATIONAL GUARD AND ALL OF A  SUDDEN IT WAS LIKE MAGIC IN  GOOD SHAPE AND THEY HELPED WITH  THE POLICE BUT THE POLICE WERE  TOLD TO LEAVE THEIR POST AND NO  ONE HAS SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT  BUT WE INSISTED ON HAVING  PROTECTION FOR THAT GREAT CITY  AND STATE OF MINNESOTA, WHAT A  HORRIBLE THING, THAT'S WHERE IT  STARTED AND WE ENDED STRONGLY.   WE GOT INVOLVED RIGHT FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE.   I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK  NOTICE AND THE POLICE ARE DOING  AN INCREDIBLE JOB AND THEIR  RECORDS ARE BEING BROKEN IN  TERMS OF LACK OF CRIME AND WE  HAD A TREMENDOUS 12 MONTHS AND  TREMENDOUS 36 MONTHS DURING THE  TERM.   3.5 YEARS HAVE GONE BY VERY  QUICKLY BUT WE HAVE HAD A  TREMENDOUS RECORD ON CRIME AND  WE ARE GOING TO WORK AND TALK  ABOUT IDEAS AND HOW WE CAN DO  BETTER AND HOW WE CAN DO IT IF  POSSIBLE IN A MUCH MORE GENTLE  FASHION.   AND PLENTY OF THING SHOULD NOT  HAVE HAPPENED THAT WE CAN'T  GIVE UP, THE FINEST LAW  ENFORCEMENT ANYWHERE IN THE  WORLD AND THERE IS NOTHING LIKE  IT.   FEW COUNTRIES HAVE OUR RECORD  AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE  POSITIVE RECORD SO WE WILL BE  DISCUSSING IDEAS AND CONCEPTS  THAT WE WON'T BE DEFUNDING THE  POLICE AND WILL NOT BE  DISMANTLING THE POLICE.   WE WILL NOT BE DISBANDING THE  POLICE ARE AND IN THE POLICE  FORCE.  YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME  CITIES THAT WANT TO TRY BUT IT  WILL BE VERY SAD SITUATION.   PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE  PROTECTED.   PEOPLE DO A TREMENDOUS JOB OF  PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF OUR  COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHAT THEY  ARE PAID FOR BUT WHETHER THEY  WERE PAID OR NOT, THAT'S WHAT  THEY DO AND SOMEONE PUT IT VERY  BEAUTIFULLY BEFORE WHEN THEY  SAID PROTECT PEOPLE, RISK THEIR  OWN LIVES PEOPLE THEY HAVE  NEVER SEEN BEFORE.   AND YOU'RE PROTECTING THE LIVES  OF PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW.   IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING AND A  GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL  AND WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE  DISCUSSION NOW.   THANK YOU ALL, VERY MUCH.   >>> YOU ARE WATCHING NBC NEWS  NOW.   HAPPY MONDAY.   LET'S GO TO OUR CORRESPONDENT  WHO HAS ALL THE LATEST HEADLINES FROM NBC NEWS.COM.   >> LOTS OF NEWS TODAY AND  SPECIFICALLY IN THIS HOUR.   A POLICE OFFICER FROM  MINNEAPOLIS, DEREK CHAUVIN  APPEARED  IN COURT BY  VIDEOCONFERENCE AND THE JUDGE  SET BAIL AT $1.25 MILLION.   HIS NEXT APPEARANCE WILL BE  LATER THIS MONTH.   A MAN DROVE INTO A CROWD OF  PROTESTERS AND SHOT A PROTESTER. OFFICIALS SAY THE SUSPECT IS IN  CUSTODY.  THE 27-YEAR-OLD MAIL  WHO WAS  SHOT IS IN HOSPITAL IN STABLE  CONDITION.   >> YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF  WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS A  PLANNED ATTACK OR WAS IT AN  INDIVIDUAL WHO IS AFRAID FOR  HIS RIGHT -- LIFE AND RESPONDED ?   >> THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE  OUT THERE IT WOULD BE HARD TO  SAY THE PERSON DID NOT SEE THE  LARGE CROWD IN THE THOUSANDS  WHEN HE DROVE THE VEHICLE INTO  THE CROWD.   >> NOW FROM THE CAPITOL HILL  TEAM THE CONGRESSIONAL  DEMOCRATS HAVE INTRODUCED  SWEEPING LEGISLATION AND THIS  OF COURSE AS AMERICANS ACROSS  THE COUNTRY PROTEST POLICE  BRUTALITY FOLLOWING THE DEATH  OF GEORGE FLOYD.   IT IS CALLED THE JUSTICE IN  POLICING ACT AND WOULD BAN  TACTICS LIKE SO COLD.   A NUMBER OF MEASURES WOULD ALSO  BE IMPLEMENTED.   >> JOE BIDEN'S PRESIDENTIAL  CAMPAIGN IS SAYING HE PROVED  DEFUNDING THE POLICE WHICH HAS  GAINED POPULARITY.   IN A STATEMENT THE CAMPAIGN  SPOKESPERSON SAID JOE BIDEN  DOES NOT PULL BELIEVE POLICE  SHOULD BE DEFUNDED THAT HE  ADDED THEY SUPPORT THE URGENT  NEED FOR REFORM INCLUDING  FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS,  SUMMER PROGRAMS, MENTAL HEALTH  SEPARATE FROM FUNDING FOR  POLICING SO OFFICERS CAN FOCUS  ON THE JOB.   >> HEALTH OFFICIALS IN NEW  ZEALAND SAY THE COUNTRY HAS  MANAGED TO ERADICATE THE  CORONAVIRUS.   NO NEW CASES REPORTED IN 17  DAYS WHICH IS A MAJOR VICTORY  FOR THE COUNTRY.   >> WE MOST CERTAINLY WILL SEE  CASES HERE AGAIN BUT THAT IS  NOT A SIGN WE HAVE FAILED BUT  IT IS A REALITY OF THE VIRUS  THAT IF AND WHEN IT OCCURS, WE  HAVE TO MAKE SURE AND WE ARE  THAT WE ARE PREPARED.   >> 100 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST  REPORTED CORONAVIRUS CASE AND  NEW YORK CITY IS STARTING TO  COME BACK.   THE CITY IS REOPENING TODAY AS  PART OF THE PLAN REOPENING  MANUFACTURING AND SOME  RETAILERS AS WELL JUST BECAUSE  THE CITY IS ENTERING PHASE 1  DOES NOT MEAN THINGS WILL GO  BACK TO NORMAL.   THEY'VE TAKEN AN UNIMAGINABLE  TOLL ON THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S  A LONG ROAD AHEAD.   THAT WRAPS UP THE HEADLINES FOR  THIS HOUR AND WE WILL BE BACK  WITH LATER -- WITH MORE LATER.   >>> IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE  GEORGE FLOYD DIED IN POLICE  CUSTODY IN MINNEAPOLIS  INSPIRING WORLDWIDE PROTESTS.   TODAY FOUR -- THE FORMER  MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER WAS  IN TRIAL CHART -- WAS IN COURT  CHARGED WITH SECOND DEGREE  MURDER MEANWHILE THEY HAVE  AGREED TO DEFEND AND DISMANTLE  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.   >> THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS  FAILED AND HAVE FAILED ON  MULTIPLE FRONTS.   WE HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY  TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS SAFE.  >> THE NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT  JOINING US NOW FROM MINNEAPOLIS. LET'S START WITH THE COURT  APPEARANCE AND WHAT HAPPENS AT  THE COURT APPEARANCE TODAY?   >> IT HAPPENED JUST BEHIND ME  IN THE BUILDING AND THERE WAS A  BRIEF ARRAIGNMENT THAT LASTED  15 MINUTES.   HIS BAIL WAS SET AT $1.25  MILLION WITHOUT CONDITIONS.   $1 MILLION WITH CONDITIONS.   IT WAS VERY BRIEF AND HE WAS IN  AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT WITH  HANDCUFFS AND A BLUE FACE  COVERING.   WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE  ATTORNEY UP UNTIL NOW AND IT  DID NOT CHANGE TODAY WALKING  OUT OF THE COURT WE ASKED IF  YOU HAVE FOR THE COMMENTS THAT  HE DECLINED TO COMMENT.   WE HAVE BARELY HEARD FROM DEREK  CHAUVIN HIMSELF  AND JUST  ANSWER DIRECT QUESTIONS.   HE WAS ASKED IF HE HAD A WEAPON  ON HIS PROPERTY AND IF BALE  WERE TO BE POSTED AND HE SAID  YES AND COULD YOU MAKE  ARRANGEMENTS FOR IT TO BE  DESTROYED IF BALE WOULD BE  POSTED.   THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY CHOSE NO  COMMENT AND RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT  KNOW IF WHERE THE DEFENSE WILL  LEAD.   AS ATTORNEY HAS REPEATEDLY  DECLINED TO COMMENT BUT DEREK  CHAUVIN FOR THE FIRST TIME  GOING BEFORE THE JUDGE WITH  BAIL SET AT $1.25 MILLION .   >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL  DECIDING TO DISSOLVE AND  DISMANTLE THE POLICE, WHAT DOES  THAT MEAN AND WHAT DOES IT  INVOLVE?   >> THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS  BEING DEBATED HOTLY.   THE CITY COUNCIL YESTERDAY,  NINE OF THE MEMBERS AGREED AND  PLEDGED TO DISMANTLE THE  MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT  AND WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN  AND WE ARE HEARING FROM THE  COUNCIL MEMBERS INCLUDING THE  CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT AND THEY  ARE ASKING FOR PUBLIC INPUT TO  DECIDE WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT  COULD BE UP TO ONE YEAR BEFORE  THE DETAILS ARE DECIDED BUT WE  WE HEAR AND FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW  YORK CITY MAYOR IS SHIFTING  RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE NYPD  AND INVESTING IN SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE MAYOR OF LA SAYING THAT  HE WILL SHIFT UP TO 151 UP TO  $151 -- $151 MILLION OF THE  POLICE BUDGET.   AND THEY ARE HIRING MORE  COUNSELORS FOR MENTAL HEALTH  CALLS INSTEAD OF RELYING SOLELY  ON POLICE OFFICERS.   IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THIS  WILL LOOK LIKE AND THE MAYOR  GOT INTO SOME TROUBLE OVER THE  WEEKEND WITH SOME PROTESTERS  AND HE WAS BOOED WHEN HE WOULD  NOT COMMIT TO ABOLISHING THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT AND INSTEAD  HE WANT TO PERFORM IT.   THIS IDEA OF DEFUNDING POLICE  AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,  DISMANTLING THE POLICE  ALTOGETHER?   THAT IS STILL BEING FIGURED OUT  HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS AS WELL.   >> THERE ARE STILL SO MANY  QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT MAY  LOOK LIKE AND CAN THE CITY  COUNCIL GIVE ANY SENSE OF THE  TIMELINE OF WHEN WE COULD START  TO SEE CHANGES WITHIN THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT OR SEE IT  TRANSFORM?   >> THE SON OF THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL DID SAY THAT THIS IS  SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE  A LOOK AT.   IT COULD BE UP TO ONE YEAR  BEFORE WE SEE SOME OF THE  CHANGES IMPLEMENTED.   THIS IS AN IDEA THAT STARTED  LAST WEEK BUT IT'S NOT NEW AND  MANY ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR QUITE  SOME TIME.   IT HAS GAINED TRACTION AND NOW  YOU HEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY  EXAMINING THE LARGER  CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF  POLICE.   FEW DETAILS RIGHT NOW AT THE  CITY COUNCIL AS THEY WORK  THROUGH THIS.   THIS ALL CAME AS WE REPORTED  WITH THE FIRST COURT HEARING  FOR OFFICER DEREK CHAUVIN WITH   BAIL SET AT 1.25 BAIL SET AT  $1.25 MILLION AND THE NEXT  HEARING SET FOR JUNE 29 AND WE  SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE SPOKE  WITH THE ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF  THE OTHER OFFICERS INVOLVED IN  THE CASE.   THERE ARE THREE OTHER OFFICERS  CHARGED WITH AIDING AND  ABETTING SECOND-DEGREE MURDER  AND MANSLAUGHTER AND ONE IS  THOMAS LANE AND FOUR DAYS ON  THE JOB AND WE SPOKE WITH HIS  ATTORNEY AND HE SAID THAT  GEORGE FLOYD RESISTED ARREST  AND THAT IS WHY HIS CLIENT TOOK  THE ACTIONS HE DID AND WE ASKED  COULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE  CLIENT TO STAND BY AND WATCH  AND HE CLAIMS HE DID NOT JUST  STAND BY AND WATCH AND HE WAS  ESSENTIALLY TAKING THE LEAD FROM DEREK CHAUVIN A 19 YEAR VETERAN  OF THE FORCE .  AND HE SHOULD  BE FOUND NOT GUILTY OF THAT IS  A PREVIEW OF THE DEFENSE WE  COULD SEE VERBAL THREE OTHER  OFFICERS AGAIN WITH REGARD TO  DEREK CHAUVIN , WE HAVE NO  COMMENT FROM HIS ATTORNEY.   >> YOU DID HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE  INTERVIEW AND WE WILL SHOW THAT  LATER IN THE SHOW.   THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORTING.   >>> GEORGE FLOYD IS BEING  REMEMBERED IN HIS HOMETOWN OF  HOUSTON TODAY WITH THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE PAYING THEIR RESPECTS AT  A PUBLIC MEMORIAL.   THE TEXAS GOVERNOR WAS THERE  AND SAID THAT GEORGE FLOYD'S  DEATH WILL NOT BE IN VAIN.   >> THIS IS THE MOST HORRIFIC  TRAGEDY I HAVE EVER PERSONALLY  OBSERVED.   GEORGE FLOYD WILL CHANGE THE  FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES.   GEORGE FLOYD DID NOT DIE IN  VAIN.   >> THE NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT  JOINING ME FROM HOUSTON.   HOW ARE PEOPLE IN HIS HOMETOWN  REMEMBERING HIM TODAY?   >> PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT  BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CELEBRATE  HIS LIFE AND ALL THEIR MET THE  MAN WHO HAS BECOME A SYMBOL FOR  A GLOBAL MOVEMENT.   HE GREW UP IN THE THIRD WARD  NEIGHBORHOOD HERE IN HOUSTON  AND I SPOKE TO TWO OF HIS  FORMER HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS AND  ONE OF THEM WAS A TEAMMATE ON  THE FOOTBALL TEAM WHERE GEORGE  FLOYD WAS A STANDOUT PLAYER.   YOU REALLY GET THE SENSE WHEN  YOU COME HERE TO HOUSTON OF HOW  DEEP HIS TIES RUN AND WE KNOW  THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE  GREW UP WITH ARE COMING HERE TO  THE CHURCH TO THE SOUTHWEST OF  THE CITY AND ARE TAKING PART IN  THE VISITATION WERE SEVERAL  THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR  WAY THROUGH AND ON TOP OF THAT  WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE DRIVING IN  FROM ALL OVER THE STATE AND  DRIVING HOURS TO GET HERE AND  STANDING HOURS AND MORE THAN 90  DEGREE HEAT SO THEY CAN HAVE A  CHANCE TO HONOR HIS LIFE AND WE  DO KNOW THAT THIS STARTED AT  1:00 AND GOES UNTIL 6:00 P.M.  THIS EVENING AND THERE HAS BEEN  A NONSTOP STREAM OF PEOPLE  GOING INTO THE CHURCH WITH  EVERYONE HAVING A MASK ON,  GLOVES ON AND MAINTAINING  SOCIAL DISTANCING TO MAKE SURE  FOLKS STAY SAFE.   >> YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE  IMAGES THERE OF THE LINES OF  PEOPLE WITH MASKS ON AND IT  LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE DOING  THEIR BEST TO SPREAD OUT.   WHAT ELSE ARE THEY DOING TO  MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE  PROTECTING PEOPLE AND KEEPING  THEM SAFE WHILE INSIDE? >> Reporter:  THEY HAVE ONE  SPECIFICALLY MARKED ENTRANCE  AND EXIT POINT SO NOBODY IS  HAVING TO CROSS PATHS WITH ONE  ANOTHER AND THERE'S A STEADY  STREAM IN AND OUT AND THERE IS  SUCH A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE  COMING OUT THAT THEIR SHUTTLING  PEOPLE TO AND FROM THE CHURCH  AND THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR  SEVERAL HOURS AND IN THE  MEANTIME YOU GET THE SENSE FROM  PEOPLE WAITING OUTSIDE THAT  EVEN IF THEY DID NOT GROW UP  TOGETHER THERE IS A SHARED  KINSHIP AND THEY ARE JUST  COMING OUT HERE TO HONOR HIS  LIFE AND ONE OF HIS FORMER  TEAMMATES MADE A GREAT POINT  SAYING WHENEVER HE WAS GROWING  UP HE JUST WENT BY FLOYD ON THE  FOOTBALL FIELD AND AS THE YOUNG  MAN WHENEVER HE GREW HE WAS  KNOWN AS BIG FLOYD AND TODAY HE  IS NOW KNOWN AS GEORGE FLOYD  AND EVERYONE WHEN THEY SAY HIS  NAME THEY KNOW WHAT IT REALLY  MEANS AND IT'S REALLY THE  CATALYST FOR THE ENTIRE  MOVEMENT.   AND IN A VERY TELLING POISED --  POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA HE MADE A  FEW MONTHS PRIOR TO HIS DEATH  AND HIS TEAMMATE TOLD ME THAT  HE WENT ON FACEBOOK AND SAID  I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD  AND HIS TEAMMATE TOLD ME THAT  NO ONE IN THAT POINT OF TIME  EVER WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN THIS  WAY BUT HE SAID IN HINDSIGHT,  GEORGE FLOYD REALLY DID GET HIS  WISH AND HE IS ABSOLUTELY HAS  CHANGE THE WORLD AND YOU SEE  THE RESPONSE WITH EVERYBODY  COMING OUT TO THIS CHURCH AND  IT IS ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF THAT. HE WILL BE LAID TO REST NEAR  HIS MOTHER IN A PRIVATE  CEREMONY TOMORROW.   >> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT  THE PRIVATE CEREMONY TOMORROW? >> Reporter:  WE KNOW THAT IT  WAS PRIVATELY FINANCED BY BOXER  FLOYD MAY OR MERRIWEATHER AND  HE WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE  EVENT AND IT IS PRIVATE SO  CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY ONLY  AND WILL BE LAID TO REST NEAR  HIS MOTHER AND WHEN YOU HEAR  THAT IT'S GIVING A LOT OF  PEOPLE PAUSE BECAUSE HE WILL BE  REUNITED WITH THE VERY WOMAN  THAT HE CRIED OUT FOR IN HIS  FINAL MOMENTS OF LIFE.   AND IT IS NOT LOST ON ANYONE  HERE THE FACT THAT HE IS NOW  GOING TO BE GOING HOME TO BE  NEXT TO HER.   >> I THINK IT IS THE FIRST  THING MANY OF US THOUGHT OF.   WE KNOW THAT FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS ALSO IN  HOUSTON TODAY AND WILL NOT BE  AT THE FUNERAL BUT MET  PRIVATELY WITH THE FAMILY.   WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT  MEETING?   >> WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THAT  MEETING AND WE KNOW THAT THE  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DID HAVE  A CHANCE TO MEET IN PRIVATE  WITH THE FAMILY AND WE HAVE  REACHED OUT TO REPRESENTATIVES  FOR THE FAMILY AND  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FORMER  VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND  NEITHER ONE HAS SHARED EXACTLY  WHAT WAS SAID BUT WE DO KNOW  THAT THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE  MEANTIME THE FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT KEEPING A LOW PROFILE  NOT MAKING ANY APPEARANCE HERE  AT THE CHURCH TODAY.   >>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.   >>> NEW YORK CITY REOPENING  TODAY, 400,000 PEOPLE HEADED  BACK TO WORK AND IT HAS BEEN  100 DAYS SINCE THE FIRST  CORONAVIRUS CASE.

HOW REMARKABLE IS THAT?   CONGRATULATIONS TO NEW YORKERS.  >> THE NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT  JOINS ME NOW FROM TIMES SQUARE  WHAT DOES NEW YORK CITY LOOK  LIKE TODAY AND ARE PEOPLE  ACTUALLY BACK OUT AND ABOUT?>>  Reporter:  THERE ARE SOME  PEOPLE OUT AND I THINK IT IS A  SLOW ROLLOUT FOR MANY.

THIS IS A THEATER AREA BUT IT  IS ALSO A BUSINESS AREA AND  COMMERCIAL AREA WITH LOTS OF  OPPOSITES -- OFFICES.  I THINK  THAT PICTURE SHOWS YOU A LOT  ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HERE.   THERE WAS SOME TRAFFIC HERE AND  OTHER PLACES AND WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT NEW YORK CITY AND THIS  PARTICULAR AREA IS NOT AS  POPULATED AS SOME PEOPLE MAY  HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUT  FOLKS ARE COMING OUT EVER SO  SLOWLY.   >> THE IMAGE SAYS SO MUCH, I  WALK PAST WHERE YOU ARE EVERY  DAY AND LIKE MOST NEW YORKERS  I'M USUALLY FRUSTRATED BY ALL  THE FOLKS YOU HAVE TO WEAVE IN  AND OUT OF TO GET TO WHERE YOU  NEED TO GO AND IT'S LOOKING  VERY DIFFERENT TODAY.   A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL ARE NOT  OPEN YET -- A LOT OF PLACES ARE  STILL NOT OPEN YET.   >> 32,000 CONSTRUCTION JOBS AS  WELL AS MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL FOR CURBSIDE PICKUP BUT LOOK AT  WHAT SOME RETAILERS ARE HAVING  TO CONTEND WITH.   HERE IN TIMES SQUARE, SOME  BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN BOARDED UP  BECAUSE WHEN THERE WAS A  SHUTDOWN THEY KNEW THEY WOULD  NOT BE AROUND FOR A WHILE AND  THEY PUT PLYWOOD AND OTHER  BUSINESSES BOARDED UP BECAUSE  OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS AND NOW  THE PLYWOOD HAS GOT TO COME  DOWN IF THEY ARE GOING TO OPEN  UP FOR ANY KIND OF CURBSIDE  PICKUP BUT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS  AND RETAILERS ARE ANXIOUS TO  OPEN AND ARE ANXIOUS TO GET  GOING AND WE TALKED TO ONE  WOMAN WHO SAID SHE LOST 80% OF  HER BUSINESS WHILE THINGS WERE  SHUT DOWN AND SHE IS HOPING THAT PEOPLE WILL COME BACK WHEN SHE  OPENS UP AGAIN TODAY.   THERE ARE MARKERS ENCOURAGING  PEOPLE TO SOCIAL DISTANCE.   THEY ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO  DO IT NONETHELESS.   TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT ONE  SUBWAY RIDER TOLD US ABOUT HOW  THEY FEEL GETTING BACK ON THE  SUBWAY.   >> THERE WAS LESS PEOPLE AND IT  WAS VERY SPREAD OUT.   I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT.

IT MAY BE SLOW GOING BUT PEOPLE  ARE ENCOURAGED THAT PEOPLE --  IT WILL PICK UP.   >>> A QUESTION BEFORE YOU GO  ABOUT THE PROTESTS, I KNOW  THERE ARE MORE SCHEDULED TODAY  AND THERE ARE WORRIES THAT THE  CROWDS COULD LEAD TO MORE  CORONAVIRUS CASES.  HOW IS THE  CITY TRYING TO REDUCE THE RISK? >> Reporter:  THEY KEEP TELLING  PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS AND A  LARGE PORTION ARE WEARING MASKS  AND THEY ARE SOCIAL DISTANCING.  THE CITY HAS OPENED UP ANOTHER  225 FREE TESTING CENTERS AROUND  THE CITY AND 15 ARE LOCATED IN  PLACES WHERE DEMONSTRATIONS  WHERE THE LARGEST AND ARE  ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET  TESTED.   IF THEY WERE EXPOSED AND HAVE  BECOME INFECTED THEY COULD  QUARANTINE THEMSELVES AND  HOPEFULLY REDUCE THE POTENTIAL  FOR ANY KIND OF SPREAD THAT  COULD RESULT AS A RESULT OF THE  CLOSE CONTACT ANYONE HAD DURING  THE DEMONSTRATIONS.   >> NEW YORK CITY REOPENING  TODAY AND A QUIETER THAN USUAL  TIMES SQUARE.   >>> IF IT IS ASKING THE TOUGH  QUESTIONS, IF IT IS ASKING FOR  ACCOUNTABILITY, IF IT IS  NAVIGATING THE NEW NORMAL IN  AMERICA AND IF IT IS SUNDAY IT  IS MEET THE PRESS.   >> IT WAS FORGED IN PART BY  SHARED SACRIFICE.

TELL US MORE ABOUT WHAT  CONDITIONS ARE LIKE THERE WHERE  YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.>> Reporter:   IT CERTAINLY HAS LET UP BUT  THERE ARE STILL REMNANTS OF THE  TROPICAL STORM AND I POSITIONED  HERE ON THE BEACH BECAUSE IF  YOU LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER AND  WHAT YOU DON'T SEE IS THE REST  OF THE PIER BECAUSE THE STORM  SURGE THAT CAME IN TORE OFF A  GOOD PORTION OF THE PIER AND  WASHED IT DOWN THE BEACH ABOUT  A HALF-MILE TO ONE MILE.   THAT IS BECAUSE THE STORM SURGE  HERE WAS ABOUT FOUR FEET AND  THE REAL CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS  THIS IS MOVING NORTH AND THERE  IS THE POTENTIAL FOR FLASH  FLOODING AND HERE IS THE WATER  CAME IN WE ARE RIGHT OVER U.S.  290 AND FLASH FLOODING IN  TENNESSEE AND IN ARKANSAS.   >> WE HAVE HEARD THE REPORTS  OVER THE WEEKEND A FLASH  FLOODING AND EVEN A TORNADO.   WE ARE SHOWING COMMUNITIES NOW  WITH NEIGHBORHOODS FLIGHT ABOUT. WHAT IS IT LOOKING LIKE TODAY  FOR FOLKS? >> Reporter:  THE CLEANUP IS  SLOW GOING FOR INSTANCE HERE IN  MISSISSIPPI THERE WAITING FOR  THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF  TRANSPORTATION TO GET ON U.S.  90 TO SORT OF MOVE THE SAND  THAT CAME IN WITH THE FRONT END  LOADERS BUT YOU ALSO MENTIONED  THE TORNADOES.   THE STORM ALL THE WAY FROM  FLORIDA TO NEW ORLEANS AND  THERE WAS ONE TORNADO THAT  TOUCHED DOWN IN ORLANDO AND  THEY CAUSED A FAIR AMOUNT OF  DAMAGE DISPLACING 50 PEOPLE AND  FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS  SERIOUSLY INJURED BUT WHAT YOU  DO HAVE THERE ARE HOMES THAT  LOST ROOFS, TREES THAT CAME  DOWN ON CARS AND CARS THAT  FLIPPED OVER AND THE POWER  OUTAGES.   PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH THAT  AND WHEN YOU HAVE LOST YOUR  HOUSE IT'S A SLOW RETURN.   >> WE ARE LOOKING AT YOU  STANDING THERE WEARING A MASK  RIGHT NOW WHICH BRINGS TO MIND  THE CORONAVIRUS AND SOME AREAS  EVACUATED AND RESIDENTS WERE  TOLD TO SEEK SHELTER.   ARE THERE COME CONCERNS THAT  THE STORM COULD SPREAD  CORONAVIRUS CASES AND INCREASE  THE CASES? >> Reporter:  THIS IS ABOUT A  PRACTICE RUN FOR EVERYBODY.   PEOPLE WERE TOLD DOWN GRAND  ISLE IN LOUISIANA THAT THEY HAD  TO EVACUATE.   AND THE VISITORS AND TOURISTS  WHO WERE THERE DID LEAVE BUT  MOST OF THE ISLAND WAS WASH  OVER.   THEY DID NOT OPEN SHELTERS PER  SE.   THE PUBLIC SHELTERS LIKE THE  SCHOOLS BUT THIS WAS A GOOD  REMINDER TO EVERYBODY THAT IN  THIS TIME OF CORONAVIRUS,  SHELTERS WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT  AND IN FACT IF YOU GO TO A  SHELTER IN THE PAST YOU WOULD  FIND YOURSELF IN THE GYMNASIUM  WITH COTS SPREAD OUT BUT NOW  THEY ARE LIKELY TO OPEN ONE  CLASSROOM AND ANOTHER CLASSROOM  AND ANOTHER CLASSROOM TO HAVE  PEOPLE SOCIALLY DISTANCE.   THIS WILL NOT BE EASY AND ONE  THING THEY ARE SAYING IN FLORIDA AND THEY HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE  AT THE NATIONAL HURRICANE  CENTER AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING  ABOUT IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO  HAVE TO TELL SOME PEOPLE TO  THINK TWICE ABOUT EVACUATING  AND THAT IS THE FIRST TIME WE  HAVE EVER HEARD THAT IN A  HURRICANE SEASON AND IT IS  USUALLY GET OUT BUT NOW THEY  ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO RECONSIDER  AND DO YOU THINK THE STRUCTURE  YOUR HIM CAN WITHSTAND AND IF  YOU THINK SO THEN YOU MIGHT  WANT TO STAY PUT AND THEY HAVE  A LOT OF THE TEMPERATURE GUNS  SPREAD OUT BECAUSE WHEN THEY DO  UP THE SHELTERS THEY WILL CHECK  THE TEMPERATURES WITH THE  HANDHELD DEVICES AND IF YOU  HAVE A TEMPERATURE THEY WILL  DIRECT PEOPLE TO WHAT THEY CALL  COVID-19 SHELTERS.  A LOT OF  COMPLICATIONS THIS HURRICANE  SEASON AND UNFORTUNATELY THE  TRADITION IS 19 NAMED STORMS  AND WE ARE EIGHT DAYS INTO THE  SEASON AND HURRICANES AND  TROPICAL STORMS GET THEIR NAMES  THROUGH THE ALPHABET AND WE ARE  ON C.

AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE  THAT HE WAS MURDERING MR.  GEORGE.   AND YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO HAVE  KNOWLEDGE OF THAT BUT YOU  HAVEN'T -- HAVE TO HAVE INTENT  TO ASSIST THEM IN DOING THAT.   THE DIFFERENCES IF YOU OPEN THE  DOOR FOR A BANK ROBBER EVEN IF  HE HAS A MASK AND ARE NOT  PAYING ATTENTION, YOU'RE NOT  AIDING AND ABETTING THE BANK  ROBBER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE  AN INTENT TO COMMIT A CRIME.   >> THIS WAS HIS FOURTH DAY IS A  COP.   >> YES.

AND DEREK CHAUVIN THE 20 YEAR   EXPERIENCE POLICE OFFICER SAID  NO, HE WILL BE ALL RIGHT.   >> WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS  MESSAGE WOULD BE TO THE FAMILY  GEORGE FLOYD?   >> HE'S EXTREMELY START SORRY.   HE IS SORRY THE MAN DIED BUT HE  DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT HE WAS  CAUSE OF THE DEATH.   I THINK HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT  THAT THAT HE WAS THE ONE THAT  ASKED TO ROLL HIM OVER AND HE  WAS THE ONE THAT WENT INTO THE  AMBULANCE.   >> YOUR CLIENT DOESN'T REGRET  TRYING TO RESTRAIN HIM AND HE  DOES THINK THAT DEREK CHAUVIN  WENT TOO FAR ?   >> I CANNOT SAY THAT.

THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE  SAID THE  INVESTIGATION WAS ONGOING, BUT  DECLINED TO COMMENT  FURTHER.  >>> NOW, FOR MORE ANALYSIS ON  HOW CORONAVIRUS IS  ACTUALLY SPREADING, THE WORLD  HEALTH ORGANIZATION  SAYS THAT ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIERS  ARE NOT THE PRIMARY  DRIVERS OF COVID-19  TRANSMISSION.  IN FACT, THEY SAY IT'S PRETTY  RARE.  OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS RESEARCH  IS CONTINUOUSLY  EVOLVING.  BUT LISTEN TO THE HEAD OF THE  WHO'S EMERGENCY UNIT.  >> WE HAVE A NUMBER OF REPORTS  FROM COUNTRIES WHO  ARE DOING VERY DETAILED  CONTRACT TRACING.  th AER FOLLOWING ASYMPTOMATIC  CASES.

SINCE BEING HERE, THINKING  ABOUT MY BROTHER, HE HAD  HIS LIFE TAKEN AWAY WHEN HE  SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.  HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.  WE GREW UP TOGETHER.  HAVING FUN IN A HOUSE FULL OF  LOVE.  BROTHERS, SISTERS, Y'ALL LOVED  EACH OTHER.  MY MOTHER, I WISH SHE WAS HERE  TO SEE THIS.  BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,  SHE'S NOT.  MY BROTHER, HE WAS A ROLE MODEL  FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.  HE WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO  EVERYBODY LOOKED UP TO,  AND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, BECAUSE  HE WAS THE FIRST ONE  TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO GO AND  PLAY BASKETBALL OR  FOOTBALL, WHAT HE WANTED TO DO.  . A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE  THE MONEY, AND HE WAS  ONE OF THE ONES THAT SAY, \"HEY,  YOU CAN DO IT.  YOU CAN DO IT.  .\" HE WOULD HELP ME THROUGH A  LOT OF THINGS.  HE WOULD TACK YOU TO PEOPLE WHO  WOULD HELP YOU DO  IT.  SO I JUST RIGHT NOW APPRECIATE  EVERYBODY COMING OUT.  THIS HELPS A LOT, JUST BEING  LIKE THIS.  IT'S TAUGHT ME.

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TURNING  OUT, INCLUDING HIS  CLASSMATES, TEACHERS, AND  PUBLIC OFFICIALS.  NBC NEWS REPORTER PRISCILLA  THOMPSON LIVE NOW IN  HOUSTON.  PRISCILLA, I KNOW IT HAS BEEN  HOT THERE TODAY, BUT  THAT HAS NOT DISCOURAGED  PEOPLE.  TELL US HOW THEY'RE REMEMBERING  GEORGE FLOYD TODAY.  >> Reporter: MORE THAN 90  DEGREES TODAY, ALISON.  TO YOUR POINT, IT HAS NOT  STOPPED A STEADY STREAM OF  FOLKS COMING OUT TO VIEW GEORGE  FLOYD'S BODY AND PAY  TRIBUTE.  RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE A LARGE  CROWD OF FOLKS GATHER TO  LISTEN TO REVEREND AL SHARPTON.  ALSO THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF  GEORGE FLOYD.  YOU JUST PLAYED SOME SOUND FROM  THAT, HIS BROTHER  GETTING SOMEWHAT EMOTIONAL  THERE, AS HE DESCRIBED  HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS  BROTHER.  AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S EXACTLY  WHAT WE'VE SEEN  THROUGHOUT THE DAY HERE TODAY,  YOU KNOW.  THE PUBLIC VIEWINGS, ANYONE CAN  COME.  YOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO KNEW  FLOYD OR DIDN'T KNOW HIM  AT ALL, AND WANTED TO BE HERE  AND PAY RESPECTS TO  HIM.  THE PRIME THING THAT I'VE HEARD  AT A LOT OF THESE  SERVICES IS WE DON'T WANT HIS  DEATH TO BE IN VAIN,  AND PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THEIR  PRESENCE KNOWN HERE  AND SHOW THAT THEY DO CARE, AND  THIS COULD BE A  TURNING POINT.  AND, YOU KNOW, TODAY, WE SPENT  THE DAY SPEAKING TO  SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO KNEW  GEORGE FLOYD BEST.  WE SPOKE WITH HIS SECOND GRADE  TEACHER, WHO TALKED  ABOUT HIS ASPIRATIONS FOR LIFE  AS A YOUNG MAN.  TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT SHE TOLD  US.  SHE ACTUALLY READ ONE OF HIS  PROJECTS TO US.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> HE WROTE THAT HE WANTED TO  BE A SUPREME COURT  JUDGE, JUST LIKE THUNDERSHOWER  GOOD MARSHAL.  HE DOESN'T SAY THAT, BUT I KNOW  THAT'S WHAT INSPIRED  HIM.  HE'S WORLDWIDE FAMOUS NOW -- OR  FAMOUS WORLDWIDE  NOW.  AND I WAS LISTENING THIS  MORNING ABOUT THINGS  HAPPENING IN FRANCE AND  GERMANY, AND I THOUGHT, OH,  YOU COULD NEVER HAVE PREDICTED  WHEN WE WERE IN THAT  CLASSROOM THAT'S WHAT THE  IMPACT THAT THIS  EIGHT-YEAR-OLD WAS GOING TO  HAVE ON JUSTICE.  HE WANTED TO WORK IN THE AREA  OF JUSTICE, AND HE  CERTAINLY FULFILLED HIS DREAMS.  >> Reporter:  AND, ALSON,  THAT'S A COMMON THEME  WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT OUR  TIME, THAT THIS FIGHT IS  NOT OVER.  YOU KNOW, GEORGE FLOYD'S  CLASSMATES SAID HE WANTED  TO CHANGE THE WORLD, AND  THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE  ON TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR HIM  AND FIGHT FOR  CHANGE.  AND HIS DEATH WILL NOT BE IN  VAIN.  HE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD,  ALISON.  >> PRISCILLA, IT'S SO  INCREDIBLE TO HEAR THE STORIES  OF HOW OFTEN HE SAID HE WANTED  TO CHANGE THE WORLD,  AND THE WAYS HE DID IT, EVEN AS  A YOUNG CHILD.  YOU ARE, OF COURSE, TALKING TO  US, WEARING A MASK  TODAY.  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LINING UP,  WEARING MASKS, A  REMINDER THAT WE ARE, OF  COURSE, IN THE MIDDLE OF A  PANDEMIC.  WHAT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ARE IN  PLACE THERE TODAY?  >> Reporter:  WELL, THE IDEA  THAT WE'RE IN THE  MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC IS  CERTAINLY NOT LOST UPON  FOLKS HERE.  THE PEOPLE YOU JUST HEARD FROM  CAME AND SPOKE TO US  DID NOT ATTEND THE ACTUAL  VIEWING, BECAUSE INSURES  OLDER.  SHE HAS SOME UNDERLYING HEALTH  CONDITIONS, AND SHE  WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.  THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING A NUMBER  OF PRECAUTIONS TO  KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.  THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING  TEMPERATURE CHECKS.  EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO WEAR A  MASK.  THERE ARE MARKERS ALL  THROUGHOUT THE AREA,  DESIGNATING A 6-FOOT DISTANCE,  AND FOLKS ARE ALSO  BEING ASKED TO STAY 6 FEET AWAY  TO CONTINUE TO  PROMOTE THAT DISTANCING, AND  THEY'RE GOING IN ONE  DOOR AND OUT A COMPLETELY  SEPARATE DOOR TO AGAIN  KEEP PEOPLE APART.  THE OTHER THING HERE IS  SOMETHING WITH TALKED ABOUT  A LITTLE EARLIER, WHICH IS JUST  HOW HOT IT IS HERE.  SO THERE ARE EMTS HERE ON SITE  WITH ONLY LISTENING  LINES OUT HERE.  THEY'RE WALKING BLOCKS TO GET  HERE.  PARKING IS SORT OF FAR AWAY,  AND WALKING OVER.  AND SO THE EMTS ARE HERE,  HANDING OUT WATER, AND  JUST CHECKING ON FOLKS TO MAKE  SURE THERE AREN'T ANY  ISSUES AROUND HEAT EXHAUSTION  OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT  AS WELL, ALISON.  >> PROPERTY SILL LAXER I KNOW  THAT YOU MENTIONED  REVEREND AL SHARPTON, THE  FAMILY BEHIND YOU.  I KNOW THAT FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, TEXAS  GREG ABBOT MET WITH THE FLOYD  FAMILY TODAY.  WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THAT  MEETING?  WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?  >> Reporter:  YES.  SO, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT  REVEREND -- EXCUSE ME --  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN  MET WITH THE FAMILY  FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, AND, YOU  KNOW, PART OF WHAT  HE DID WAS JUST LISTEN AS THEY  SORT OF SHARED WITH  THEM THEIR FEELINGS AND  EMOTIONS AROUND ALL OF THIS.  AND REVEREND AL SHARPTON  ACTUALLY -- HE MENTIONED  THAT.  SAID, \"TOMORROW ISN'T MEANT TO  BE A POLITICAL  RALLY.\"  AND SO THAT WAS PART OF THE  REASON WHY JOE BIDEN MET  WITH THE FAMILY IN PRIVATE  TODAY, BECAUSE TOMORROW  IS REALLY GOING TO BE ABOUT, OF  COURSE, FLOYD'S LIFE  AND THEIR FAMILY SAYING THEIR  FINAL FAREWELL BEFORE  THEY LAY HIM TO WEST.  . HE DESCRIBED THE DEATH OF  GEORGE FLOYD AS ONE OF THE  MOST HORRENDOUS THINGS HE HAS  EVER SEEN, AND HE SAID  HE IS GOING TO BE MEETING WITH  THE FAMILY AND  WORKING WITH THE FAMILY TO  ENSURE THAT SOMETHING  LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE  FLOYD.  WE KNOW THE HOUSTON MAYOR TOLD  US THEY WILL BE  THERE.  ALSO ART ACEVEDO WAS HERE TO  PAY THEIR RESPECT FOR  GEORGE FLOYD AHEAD OF THAT  PRIVATE CEREMONY THAT'S  GOING TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE  FAMILY AND CLOSE  FRIENDS  TOMORROW.  >> ALL RIGHT.  PRISCILLA THOMPSON IN HOUSTON,  THANKS SO MUCH.  >> Reporter:  THANKS, ALISON.  >>> DEREK SHOVIN, EXPOLICE  OFFICER CHARGED WITH  SECOND DEGREE MURDER IN THE  DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD.  HE WAS IN COURT FOR THE FIRST  TIME TODAY.  SHOVIN'S BAIL SET AT A QUARTER  OF A MILLION DOLLARS  IN THE VIDEO SEEN ON GEORGE  FLOYD'S NECK FOR NEARLY  9 MINUTES.  NBC NEWS REPORTER SHY  BRUESERRER IT JOINING ME FROM  MINNEAPOLIS.  CHEF, WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT  TODAY?  I KNOW HE APPEARED BY VIDEO  CONFERENCE.  >> Reporter:  IT WAS THE FIRST  TIME WE SAW OFFICER  SHOVIN SINCE THAT VIDEO YOU  JUST MENTIONED, WHERE HE  HAD HIS KNEE ON THE NECK OF  GEORGE FLOYD, WHERE HE  WAS UNRESPONSIVE.  ASS YOU MENTIONED, OFFICER  SSERIN APPEARED VIA VIDEO  CONFERENCE.  HE WAS IN AN ORANGE JUMP SUIT,  HANDCUFFED, AND  WEARING A BLUE SURGICAL MALLS  YOU CAN.  THE ENTIRE HEARING WAS QUICK,  LESS THAN 60 MINUTES  IT WENT ON FOR.  THE JUDGE SET THE BAIL AT THAT  $1.25 MILLION.  WITHOUT THIS TECHNICIANS, IT  COULD BE $1 MILLION IF  SOME CONDITIONS ARE AGREED TO.  DIDN'T HEAR MUCH FROM OFFICER  SHOVIN OR HIS  ATTORNEY.  THEY DIDN'T OBJECT TO THAT BAIL  AMOUNT THAT WAS SET.  THEY AGREED ON A HEARING DATE.  WE DIDN'T HEAR A PLEA FROM THE  OFFICER.  WE DIDN'T HEAR A COMMENT FROM  THE ATTORNEY AS THEY  WERE WALKING OUT.  .  >> THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS  ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS  AND WHAT THAT PROCESS WILL LOOK  LIKE.  WHAT DO YOU KNOW SO FAR?  >> Reporter:  WELL, THAT HAS  BEEN A CALL FROM  ACTIVISTS AND PROTESTERS SINCE  GEORGE FLOYD DIED,  SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN  INCREASING NOT ONLY HERE IN  MINNEAPOLIS AND MINNESOTA, BUT  REALLY ALL ACROSS THE  COUNTRY.  YOU'VE SEEN THE HASHTAG TO  DEFUND THE POLICE.  REALLY, WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  CALLING FOR ON THE  GROUND, PUTTING IT INTO MORE  COMMUNITY-BASED  SOLUTIONS, EDUCATION, HEALTH  CARE, THINGS LIKE THAT.  WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL DID  YESTERDAY -- AND THIS IS  SOMETHING THAT WAS A BIG  SURPRISE FOR MANY OF US --  THE MAJORITY OF CITY COUNCIL  MEMBERS APPEARED ON  STAGE AT A PROTEST ADVOCATING  FOR THE MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE DEPARTMENT TO BE  DEFUNDED.  THEY APPEARED ON STAGE, AND  THEY ALSO COMMITTED -- A  MAJORITY OF THEM COMMITTED TO  SUPPORTING A MOVE TO  DISBAND THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE  DEPARTMENT.  A COUNCIL MEMBER WHO HELPED  LEAD THE CHARGE TO GET  THOSE COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THE  COUNCIL TO SUPPORT  THIS MOVEMENT, HE WARNED THIS  DOES NOT MEAN YOU'RE  GONG SEE A SITUATION WHERE THE  MINNEAPOLIS POLICE  DEPARTMENT ARE REMOVED FROM THE  STREET IMMEDIATELY.  THEY'RE NOT LEAVING THEIR  POSTS.  INSTEAD, IT'S 1-YEAR  CONVERSATION -- A YEAR-LONG  CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW BEST TO  ACHIEVE THOSE  RESOURCES.  HE SAYS IT'S VERY CLEAR, AND  EVENING TO  COUNCILMEMBERS DON'T AGREE IN  THAT DEPARTMENT, HE  SAID IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT  HAS DONE HAS BEEN FAILING, AND  YOU SEE THAT IN THE  KATIE OF GEORGE FLOYD.  SO THAT'S THE MOVE THAT YOU'RE  HEARING.  THAT'S THE PUSH.  I'LL TELL YOU THAT GOVERNOR TIM  WOLF IS JUST -- WAS  SPEAKING EARLIER TODAY.  WILL NEVES SAINT PAUL, JUST  ACROSS THE RIVER, AND HE  WAS POURING SOME DAMAGE FROM  LOOTING.  HE WAS ASKED WHETHER OR NOT HE  SUPPORTS THIS PUSH TO  DISBAND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.  HE SAID IT GETS REALLY  COMPLICATED, BUT HE SUPPORTS  THE CHANGE THAT THE COMMUNITY  MEMBERS HAVE BEEN  CALLING FOR, BECAUSE HE SEES  THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN  FAILING.  SO YOU SEE PEOPLE USING THAT.  IT MEANS A LOT OF DIFFERENT  THINGS FOR DIFFERENT  PEOPLE.  I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT I MEAN  BY THAT.  WHEN I WAS HERE AT THE VIGIL,  AND I ASKED SOMEONE  ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HE  SUPPORTED DISBANDING THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT.  LISTEN TO WHAT THE GENTLEMAN  TOLD ME.  >> DISBANDING, I'M A LITTLE BIT  UNCERTAIN ABOUT.  CUTTING FUNDING, YEAH, MAYBE,  BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE  THE GOVERNMENT OR WHATEVER  PRIVATE FUNDING MIGHT BE  BETTER SERVED WITH COMMUNITY  PROGRAMS AND THE LIKE.  >> Reporter:  AND, ALISON, YOU  MIGHT HAVE SEEN VIDEO  OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND  OF THE MAYOR, JACOB  FREY, GOING INTO A PROTEST ON  SATURDAY, AND HE WAS  ASKED DETECTLY, POINT-BLANK,  \"DO YOU SUPPORT THIS  FUNNING?\"  HE SAID, NO, HE SUPPORTED THE  CURRENT POLICE CHIEF  AND THE REFORMS THAT THE POLICE  CHIEF WAS ADVOCATING  FOR IN CHANGING THE CULTURE.  HE WAS B,OD FROM THAT PROTEST.  . THE EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.  BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS  GROWING SUPPORT,  GAINING SUPPORT, THE IDEA OF  DISBANDING AND  DEFUNDING THE MINNEAPOLIS  POLICE DEPARTMENT.  >> PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF  QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, BUT  SUPPORT IS GROWING FOR SURE.  ZACH SHUSTER IN MINNEAPOLIS,  THANKS A LOT.  .  >>> NEW YORK CITY ONCE  CONSIDERED THE EPICENTER OF  THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC.  . PEOPLE ARE BACK TO WORK IN  SECTORS LIKE RETAIL AND  CONSTRUCTION.  THE REOPENING HAPPENING,  THOUGH, WHILE THERE ARE  STILL PROTESTS IN THE CITY,  RAISING CONCERNS THAT WE  COULD SEE A NEW SPIKE IN  CORONAVIRUS CASES.  NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT ELLISON  BARBER JOINING ME NEW  FROM BROOKLYN, AND, ELLISON,  YOU'RE AT A PROTEST  NOW.  WHAT'S IT LIKE THERE?  >> Reporter:  YEAH.  HEY, ALISON, I'M ACTUALLY  STANDING WHERE ONE OF THE  LARGEST PROTESTS THIS WEEKEND  STARTED.  THOUSANDS MARCHED ACROSS THE  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN SEE AND SEE  BEHIND ME THERE IS A  RALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, A  PROTEST OF SORTS.  AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE ARE HERE,  TAKING PART IN A  CIRCLE.  WE SAW A PROTEST A COUPLE HOURS  AGO.  THAT SEEMED TO BE LED BY  COLLEGE STUDENTS.  WE SPOKE TO ONE PROFESSOR  ATTENDING THAT RALLY.  HERE'S A LITTLE OF WHAT SHE HAD  TO SAY.  >> WE DON'T WANT TO BE  ARRESTED.  WE WANT TO SPEAK AND HAVE A  VOICE IN WHAT HAPPENS TO  OUR COMMUNITY, AND THE ELECTED  OFFICIALS HAVE DONE  NOTHING.  AND I HOPE THAT THEY DO VOTE  THEM OUT.  THEY'VE GOT ONE YEAR TO DO  THEIR JOB, AND VOTE OUT  THE INCUMBENT, BECAUSE THEY  HAVE A LONG TIME.  >> LATISHA JAMES, THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL, SHE WAS  FIRST PUBLIC ADVOCATE.  SHE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT POLICE  BRUTALITY.  SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING  ON IN OUR COMMUNITY.  THEY ARRESTED ME, ARRESTED US  FOR SPEAKING UP AND  ASKING FOR A VOICE.  >> Reporter:  THAT WOMAN WENT  ON TO SAY YOU CAN TALK  ABOUT BANNING, BUT IT DOESN'T  MATTER IF PEOPLE DO  NOT ENFORCE THEM.  SHE HAD A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR  THE GOVERNOR OF THE  STATE AS WELL AS MAYOR BILL DE  BLASIO.  AT LEAST 200 PROTESTS ARE SET  TO TAKE POLICE IN  BROOKLYN THIS EVENING.  THIS IS THE SECOND NIGHT WHERE  THERE HASN'T BEEN A  CURFEW.  LAST NIGHT, PROTESTS WITHOUT  THAT CURFEW REMAINED  RELATIVELY CALM AND PEACEFUL.  ALISON?  >> THOSE PROTESTS HAPPENING, OF  COURSE, AS THE CITY  REOPENS.  WHAT ARE CITY LEADERS TRYING TO  DO TO REDUCE THE  RISK OF THE SPIKE IN CASES  HERE?  >> Reporter:  WELL, THE  PROTESTERS, THEY ARE TELLING  THEM -- WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY  PEOPLE SAY BEFORE,  THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE OUT HERE  TO WEAR FACE MASKS,  TO WASH THEIR HANDS, TO SOCIAL- DISTANCE WHEN IT IS  POSSIBLE.  THEY HAVE ALSO TOLD PEOPLE,  ENCOURAGED PEOPLE THAT  IT IS THINKER DUTY, THEIR  RESPONSIBILITY TO GO OUT  AND GET A COVID-19 TEST.  GOVERNOR CUOMO HAS SAID THAT HE  ADDED 1 NEW TESTING  SITES IN THE STATE,  SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO  HAVE  BEEN OUT PROTESTING, TO GO AND  GET A TEST FOR  COVID-19.  ALISON?  >> ALISON, LET'S TALK ABOUT  COMMUTING FOR A SECOND  BEFORE YOU GO.  IT IS JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE TO  KEEP 6 FEET AWAY FROM  PEOPLE IN TRANSPORTATION IN NEW  YORK CITY.  WHAT IS THE CITY DOING ABOUT  THAT?  >> KIMMY, THEY'RE DOING SOME OF  THE THINGS WE'VE  SEEN TAKEN POLICE IN SOME OF  THE OTHER STATES WHEN  THEY'VE STARTED TO REOPEN.  THEY'RE PUTTING OUT MARKERS FOR  PEOPLE TO  SOCIAL-DISTANCE, ENCOURAGING  PEOPLE TO ALWAYS WEAR A  FACE MASK.  OPERATING AT FULL CAPACITY,  THAT WOULD BE HARD TO  DO.  OFFICIALS SAY THEY DO NOT  EXPECT THE SUBWAYS TO BE  AT FULL CAPACITY FOR QUITE A  WHILE.  THEY ARE ALSO EXPANDING BUS  ROUTES.  THE MAYOR SAID HE IS ADDING 20  MILES OF NEW BUS  LANES AND ROUTES THAT PEOPLE  HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR  COMMUTING THAT THEY CAN SPREAD  OUT AND BE SAFER.  MTS ASKED FOR THREE TIMES THAT  AMOUNT OF BUSWAY  LANES AND MILES.  THAT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION TOWARD  REOPENING.  >> ALISON BARBER, THANK YOU SO  MUCH.  .  >> NINETY-NINE -- I SAY 99.9,  BUT LET'S GO WITH 99%  OF THEM ARE GREAT, GREAT  PEOPLE, AND THEY'VE DONE  JOBS THAT ARE RECORD-SETTING.  >> NBCNEWS.COM SENIOR REPORTER  SHANNON PETAHY  JOINING ME NOW.  TELL US WHAT CAME OUT OF THIS  MEETING.  WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT FROM THE  PRESIDENT THERE.  >> WELL, ALISON, TWO WEEKS INTO  THESE  DEMONSTRATIONS, THIS IS THE  FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN  THE PRESIDENT TALK AT LENGTH  ABOUT THE UNDERLYING  ISSUES HERE THAT DEMONSTRATORS  ARE RAISING.  WE DENT KNOW ABOUT PLANS OR  SPECIFICS, BUT HAVING  THEIR MEETING TO TALK ABOUT  ISSUES, IS THE FARTHEST  WE'VE SEEN HIM GO.  THEY HAD A TALK ABOUT GEORGE  FLOYD, THE FLOYD  FAMILY.  WITH RELATION TO WHAT HE'S  DOING DO ABOUT THE POLICE  BRUTALITY, HE HAS DECLINED TO  TAKE OUR QUESTIONS OR  NOT REALLY HAD A RESPONSE.  SO THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST THE  WHITE HOUSE HAS DONE  TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS UNDERLYING  ISSUE.  THE PRESIDENT, AS YOU CAN SEE  HERE, WAS DEFENDING  POLICE OFFICERS, TALKING ABOUT  A FEW BAD ACTORS  HERE.  THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT WAS  EARLIER IN THE DAY.  . HIS PRESS SECRETARY WAS ASKED  ABOUT RACISM IN THE  POLICE FORCE, AND SHE SAID THAT  SHE BELIEVED THERE  WERE A FEW BAD ACTORS, A FEW  BAD APPLES HERE AND  THERE.  BUT ESSENTIALLY, THERE IS NOT A  SYSTEM I CAN  PROBLEM.  WE DO EXPECT TO HEAR MORE FROM  THE PRESIDENT ON THIS  ISSUE, THIS BROADER ISSUE OF  POLICING AND POLICE  REFORM.  I AM TOLD BY AN ADMINISTRATION  OFFICIAL THAT THAT  WAS SOMETHING THEY DISCUSSED  OVER THE WEEKEND, AND  HOW THE PRESIDENT WEIGHED MORE  INTO THAT ISSUE.  BUT I THINK THE COMMENTS WE SAW  TODAY WITH THE  POLICE FORCE IS WHAT WE'RE  GOING TO CONTINUE TO HEAR  FROM THE WHITE HOUSE GOING  FORWARD, WHATEVER  PROPOSALS THEY HAVE.  >> SHANNON, THE PRESIDENT  MEETING WITH LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHILE  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT  JOE BIDEN IS IN HOUSTON,  MEETING WITH GEORGE FLOYD'S  FAMILY.  THE PRESIDENT REALLY LEANING  INTO THIS MESSAGE OF  LAW AND ORDER.  WHAT IS HE TRYING TO ACHIEVE  WITH THAT?  >> Reporter:  LAW AND ORDER IS  SOMETHING THAT IS  VERY -- TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN  DONE VERY WELL WITH  CONSERVATIVE VOTERS, WITH OLDER  VOTERS, WHITE MALE  VOTERS, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK  DECADES.  THAT HAS BEEN LAW AND ORDER HAS  BEEN A KEY IN  CONSERVATIVE POLITICS.  THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO SHORE UP  HIS SUPPORT AMONG --  AMONG HIS BASE, REALLY NON- COLLEGE-EDUCATED WHITE  MALES, YOU KNOW, WHITE MALES IN  GENERAL, SENIORS,  EVEN REPUBLICANS WHO IDENTIFY  REPUBLICAN.  SO THIS IS A MESSAGE THAT FITS  STRANGELY IN LINE  WITH THAT.  AND IT WAS A THEME HEARD OVER  AND OVER AGAIN WHEN  TALKING ABOUT SENDING IN THE  NATIONAL GUARD, SENDING  IN THE MILITARY, TALKING ABOUT  THAT BEING THE  SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, YOU  KNOW, INSTEAD OF  SUGGESTING THE POLICING REFORM  OR HAVING  CONVERSATION ABOUT RACISM AND  THOSE UNDERLYING  ISSUES.  A SOLUTION TO THIS AS IN A LAW  ENFORCEMENT AND AT  TIMES MILITARY RESPONSE.  .  >> SHANNON, WE KNOW HOUSE  DEMOCRATS UNVEILED A  POLICE REFORM BILL.  WE HAVE NOT HARD A WHOLE LOT OF  SUPPORT FROM  REPUBLICANS.  ANY CHANCE THAT THE PRESIDENT  WILL BACK THIS BILL?  >> Reporter:  WE WERE TOLD NO,  THAT THIS IS COMING  -- THE PRESIDENT IS NOT LIKELY  TO SUPPORT.  OF COURSE, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS  NOT PUT FORWARD ANY  OF THEIR OWN PROPOSALS, NO  COUNTER PROPOSALS FROM  THE WHITE HOUSE AT THIS TIME,  NO WORD OF A PROPOSAL  FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AT THIS  TIME AS WELL.  >> SHANNON, FORMER SECRETARY OF  STATE COLLIN POWELL,  WHO SERVED UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH  IS THE LATEST LEADER  TO CONDEMN THE PRESIDENT.  HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD CNN OVER  THE WEEKEND.  >> THE ONE WORD I HAVE TO USE  WITH RESPECT TO WHAT  HE'S BEEN DOING THE LAST  SEVERAL YEARS IS A WORD I  WOULD NEVER HAVE USED BEFORE, I  WOULD NEVER HAVE   USED WITH THE FOUR PRESIDENTS  I'VE WORKED FOR.  HE LIES.  HE LIES ABOUT THINGS, AND HE  GETS AWAY WITH IT,  BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL NOT HOLD  HIM ACCOUNTABLE.  .  >>> FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W.  BUSH REPORTEDLY WON'T  BE BACKING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  REELECTION.  HOW CONCERNED IS THE WHITE  HOUSE ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT'S REELECTION?  DO THE LATEST POLLS SHOW HIM  TRAILING BIDEN?  >> THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN  ABOUT THESE POLL  NUMBERS.  NORMALLY YOU'D SEE THE  PRESIDENT DOWN 3 POINTS.  OKAY.  THERE IS A MARGIN OF ERROR.  WHEN YOU SEE HIM DOWN 7 POINTS,  LIKE WE'RE SEEING IN  THIS POLL HERE, YOU'RE PUTTING  UP -- IN FRONT OF US.  WHEN YOU'RE SEEING HIM DOWN IN  THE KEY SWING STATES,  LIKE ARIZONA, WISCONSIN, YOU  KNOW, NOT JUST NECK AND  NECK, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN,  THEY ARE TROUBLING  SIGNS THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS  SEEING IN KEY STATES.  SO THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT THAT.  NBC NEWS IS REPORTING NOW THAT  THE CAMPAIGN PLANS TO  RENEW RALLIES ACTUALLY AS EARLY  AS THE END OF JUDGE.  THERE ARE SOME PROPOSALS  SUPPOSED TO BE PRESENTED TO  THE PRESIDENT.  THEY ARE WANTING TO GET THE  PRESIDENT OUT THERE, AND  IF NOTHING ELSE, SHORING UP HIS  BASE, AS WE TALKED  ABOUT A MOMENT AGO.  THOSE SENIOR VOTERS, THOSE  WHITE MALE VOTERS.  YOUR TRADITIONAL BLUE COLLAR  VOTERS.  SO SHORING UP THAT SPACE, IF  NOTHING ELSE, IS WHAT  THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS  ON, AND THEY'RE  GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE  NUMBERS, ALISON.  >> ALL RIGHT.  JENNA, THANKS SO MUCH.  .  >>> YOU'RE WATCHING \"NBC NEWS  NOW.\"  >> WE'VE GOT SOME BREAKING  NEWS.  >> IF THEY DO GO BACK TO THEIR  JOBS, YOU WANT TO  MAKE SURE THEY ARE PROTECTED.  >> IT'S NEWS MADE FOR YOUR  STREAMING WORLD.  >> LIVE WEEKDAYS, STARTING AT  6:00 A.M.  EASTERN.  >> Reporter: SO THE BOTTOM  LINE, OUR NBC WALL STREET  POLL HERE, JOE BIDEN CONTINUES  TO LEAD OVER DONALD  TRUMP, AND CONTINUES TO BE A  SIGNIFICANT LEAD HERE,  7 POINTS IN OUR POLL.  BIDEN, 49, TRUMP 42.  ALSO NOTABLE, BY THE WAY, THERE  ARE SOME UNDECIDED  VOTES.  BIDEN ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO  50%.  THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT, TOO.  DON'T HAVE THIRD-PARTY  CANDIDATES, LIKE WE DID IN  2016.  BIDEN UP THERE NEAR 50%.  BY THE WAY, THERE ARE A LOT OF  POLLS OUT, AND THEY  ARE SHOWING A SIMILAR RESULT.  SOME OF THEM HAVE BIDEN UP BY  MORE.  IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS,  THESE ARE THE AVERAGE OF  ALL THE POLLS OUT THERE NOW.  THE AVERAGE IF THEM SHOWS BIDEN  LEADING TRUMP BY  NEARLY 8 POINTS, 7.8.  BY THE WAY, THAT IS A LARGER  MARGIN THAN WE'VE SEEN  AT THIS SAME POINT IN ANY OF  THE PAST FOUR  PRESIDENTIAL RACES.  YOU SEE IT HERE.  NOT ALL THESE CANDIDATES WANT  ON TO WIN, BUT NO ONE,  AT THIS POINT IN THE PREVIOUS  FOUR RACES, LED BY THE  KIND OF MARGIN BIDEN DOES NOW.  WHY IS BIDEN AHEAD?  BIG SHIFT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR  POLL IN 2016 AMONG  WHITE VOTERS.  TRUMP WON THIS GROUP BY 20  POINTS IN 2016.  NOW JUST 6 AMONG BLACK VOTERS.  THERE IS A SHIFT HERE A LITTLE  BIT -- A LITTLE  BETTER WITH VOTERS THAN IN  2016.  THAT'S GIVING A LITTLE BOOST.  BUT THAT BIG CHANGE AMONG WHITE  VOTERS.  BY THE WAY, SPECIFICALLY  NONCOLLEGE, NO GREG DEGREE  BY NEARLY 20 POINTS.  LOOK AT THIS.  WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS,  BIDEN BY 13.  THE EXIT POLL IS 2016.  TRUMP WITHIN THIS GROUP, NOW  TRAILED BY 13.  BIG PART OF THE STORY.  .  >>> EIGHT OUT OF TEN VOTERS IN  THE POLL BELIEVE  THINGS ARE OUT OF CONTROL IN  AMERICA.  NBC NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL  EDITOR MARK MURRAY JOINING  ME NOW.  AND, MARK, WHAT WERE THE  BIGGEST ISSUES TO AMERICANS  IN THIS POLL, AND WHAT SHOULD  THE PRESIDENT BE MOST  WORRIED ABOUT HERE?  >> Reporter:  YEAH, ALISON.  IT REALLY REFLECTS A VERY  TURBULENT LAST THREE  MONTHS IN AMERICAN POLITICS,  AMERICAN SOCIETY, OF  COURSE, AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE  YOU END UP HAVING  STRONG MAJORITIES IN OUR  COUNTRY, 64% OF PEOPLE WHO  SAY THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT  SOMEONE IN THEIR  FAMILY MIGHT END UP GETTING THE  CORONAVIRUS.  WE HAVE 54% WHO DON'T THINK THE  ECONOMY IS GOING TO  RECOVER WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR,  BEFORE THE END OF THE  NEXT YEAR.  AND YOU END UP HAVING A  SITUATION WHERE OBVIOUSLY  GEORGE FRIDAY'S DEATH AND THE  PROTESTS, IT JUST KIND  OF CREATES A VERY UNSETTLING  ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS  NEVER GOOD FOR AN INCUMBENT  PRESIDENT, AS THE  NUMBERS SHOW THAT STEVE  WORNACKY -- IS ONE OF THE  BIG REASONS WHY HE'S DOWN NOW.  >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  ECONOMY.  THIS SURVEY HAPPENED BEFORE  FRIDAY'S BIG JOBS  REPORT.  WE SAW 2 1/2 MILLION JOBS IN  MAY.  THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUT OUT AN  AD TOUTING THOSE  NUMBERS.  THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS STILL  OVER 1%.  TODAY THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF  ECONOMIC RESEARCH SAID  WE FINALLY ENTERED A RECESSION  IN FEBRUARY.  WHAT KIND OF A CHALLENGE DOES  THAT POSE FOR  PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO HAS BASED  BOTH HIS PRESIDENCY  AND CAMPAIGN STRATEGY ON A  STRONG ECONOMY?  >> Reporter:  YEAH, ALISON.  JUST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AGO,  THE ENTIRE GAME PLAN  FOR THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS TO  BE ABLE TO TOUT HIS  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AT ABOUT  3.7%, OR 3.6, OR 3.5.  NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING,  WHERE 13.3 IS AN  IMPROVEMENT FOR THEM.  THIS IS A RADICALLY DIFFERENT  ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  LET ME JUST RUN SOME OTHER  NUMBERS FROM OUR POLL  THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY, WHERE  YOU END UP HAVING  NEARLY 1/2 OF ALL VOTERS, 46%  WHO RATE THE ECONOMY  AS POOR RIGHT NOW.  THAT IS A HUGE CHANGE FROM JUST  A FEW MONTHS AGO IT  IS THE WORST NUMBER IN OUR POLL  ON THAT QUESTION,  THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF 2012, AND  OF COURSE, BARACK  OBAMA WAS ABLE TO WIN  REELECTION AS THE INCUMBENT  PRESIDENT IN SEPTEMBER OF 2012,  BUT CERTAINLY THE  ECONOMY WASN'T SEEN AS A  STRENGTH WITH OTHER ISSUES  HE WAS TRYING TO WIN ON.  THIS IS SEEN AS ANOTHER  CHALLENGE FOR PRESIDENT  TRUMP.  >> ANYTHING ON THE GENDER GAP  BETWEEN TRUMP AND  BIDEN IN THIS POLL?  WHAT DID YOU FIND THERE, AND  WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT  THE PRESIDENT'S CHANCES OF  REELECTION?  >> Reporter:  YEAH, ALISON.  WE END ENDED UP FINDING THE  GENDER GAP, WOMEN ENDED  UP FAVORING BY 20 PERCENTAGE  POINTS.  CONVERSELY, DONALD TRUMP IS  HAVING AN 8-POINT LEAD  AMONG MEN.  TO PUT THAT 20-PLUS-POINT LEAD  IN PERSPECTIVE,  HILLARY CLINTON HAD A 12-POINT  LEAD IN HER 2-POINT  NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE WIN IN  2016.  AND SO THE FACT THAT JOE BIDEN  IS DOING MUCH BETTER  THAN THAT, I THINK, IS -- KIND  OF REFLECTS THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 2-POINT  NATIONAL POLL RATE IN  2016 VERSUS ONE WHERE JOE BIDEN  IS AHEAD BY, IN OUR  POLL, BY 7 POINTS.  IN OTHER NATIONAL POLLS, BY  EVEN A GREATER MARGIN.  >> MARK, SOMETHING INTERESTING  AS WELL, WHETHER  PEOPLE WEAR A MASK, TELLING A  LOT ABOUT HOW THEY'LL  VOTE.  AS YOU MENTIONED, OF COURSE,  THE CORONAVIRUS TOP OF  MIND FOR A LOT OF FOLKS.  WHAT DOES THE POLL FIEND THERE?  >> Reporter:  YEAH.  AND AGAIN, THINGS LIKE MASKS  BECOMING INDICATIVE OF  YOUR VOTER PREFERENCE.  THREE MONTHS AGO, I DON'T THINK  ANYONE WOULD HAVE  THOUGHT THAT.  BUT, ALISON NEW YORK OUR POLL,  WE HAVE 63% OF ALL  VOTERS WHO SAY THAT THEY ALWAYS  END UP WEARING A  MASK, AND JOE BIDEN'S LEAD  AMONG THOSE 63% OF  VOTERS, BY A WHOPPING 40-POINT  MARGINAL.  CONVERSELY, WE END UP HAVING  15% OF THE ELECT RAT  WHO SAY THEY RARELY EVER WEAR A  MASK, AND DONALD  TRUMP IS AHEAD BY 76 POINTS.  SO JUST, LIKE, 2 HUGE DIFFERENT  SETS OF NUMBERS.  AND AGAIN, WHEN YOU'RE OUT AT  THE GROCERY STORE OR  ELSEWHERE, HAVING A MASK  PROBABLY IS A VERY GOOD  INDICATION OF WHAT YOUR VOTER  PREFERENCE IS,  FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY,  ACCORDING TO OUR POLL.  >> YOU'RE GIVING AWAY YOUR  PERSONAL POLITICAL  PREFERENCES, JUST BY WEARING A  MASK.  MARK, I KNOW WE HAVE SAID THIS  SO MANY TIMES BEFORE,  BUT SO MANY THINK WE NEVER STOP  WHAT WE WOULD BE  TALKING ABOUT IN THE 2020  ELECTION, BUT THIS IS AN  UNPRECEDENTED TIME.  >> Reporter:  AN UNPRECEDENTED  TIME.  WE STILL HAVE 5 MONTHS TO GO,  ALISON.  >> GOING TO BE INTERESTING.  MARK MURRAY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  HANGING OUT WITH US.  WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT.  >> Reporter: THANK YOU.  >>> A FUNERAL PROCESSION  THROUGH THE STREETS OF  DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.  A HEARSE LEADING PROTESTERS IN  TRIBUTE TO GEORGE  FLOYD.  NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT JACOB  SILBLOCKS IS IN LOS  ANGELES.  JACOB, I CAN SEE FOLKS BEHIND  YOU.  WHAT'S IT LIKE IN L.A.  TODAY?  >> Reporter:  THIS IS AN INTER- FAITH MEMORIAL  SERVICE IN HONOR OF GEORGE  FLOYD.  JUST TAKING A QUICK LOOK AT IT,  WHAT'S GOING ON HERE  NOW IS THE CHANGE GOING ON,  PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER,  A SPECIFIC CALL TO ACTION.  IN THIS CASE, AS SAID, TO  DEFUND THE POLICE.  IT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN  THIS BUILDING RIGHT  HERE, LOS ANGELES CITY HALL.  . POLITICIANS IN THE BUILDING  BEHIND ME, A  READAPTATION OF FUNDS FROM THE  LOS ANGELES POLICE  DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY  SERVICES THAT BENEFITS THE  AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND  OTHER COMMUNITIES OF  COLOR, PARTICULARLY AROUND  ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE,  OF INEQUALITY.  YOU KNOW WHAT?  MOST ISSUES OF INEQUALITY ARE  IN STARK CONTRAST.  YOU CAN SEE AN ENCAMPMENT JUST  ALONG LOS ANGELES  CITY HALL.  THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES,  HOMELESSNESS, UP HERE THIS  AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT.  WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SYSTEM I  CAN RACISM, RACISM AND  POLICE BRUTALITY, IT'S ALL  INTERCONNECTED.  NOW THE QUESTION IS, HOW ARE  YOU GOING TO GET THE  WORK DONE?  TAKE IT FROM THE STREETS  THROUGH THE HALLS OF POWER.  AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MOVEMENT  IS ALL ABOUT.  WE'RE SEEING IT HAPPEN IN REAL- TIME, ALISON.  >> DAVID, I KNOW ONE THING THAT  WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT  QUITE A FEW TIMES LOCAL, THE  NATIONAL GUARD, AND THE  NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE THERE  IN L.A..  THE NATIONAL GUARD IS LEAVING  AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF  DEMONSTRATIONS.  WHY NOW?  >> Reporter:  WELL, THEY'VE  LEFT.  THEY'VE ALREADY LEFT.  THEY'RE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.  THE REASON IS, ACCORDING TO  CITY LEADERS, IS THE  NATURE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS.  WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NATURE  OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS,  LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHERE I'M  STANDING RIGHT HERE,  MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT FAITHS  FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF  THE CITY, FROM DIFFERENT  DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE ALL COME  TOGETHER, TO CALL FOR PEACE.  >> GREAT TO HEAR, GREAT TO SEE.  JACOB SILBEROV, THANKS SO MUCH.  >>> GEORGE FLOYD WAS KILLED IN  POLICE CUSTODY TWO  WEEKS AGO TODAY.  THE EXOFFICER CHARGED WITH  SECOND DEGREE MURDER IN  FRIDAY'S DEATH, MAKING HIS  FIRST COURT APPEARANCE  TODAY.  DERRICK SHOV IRSN PRESSED HIS  KNEE INTO FLOYD'S NECK  FOR 9 MINUTES.  HE WAS IN COURT BY VIDEO  CONFERENCE, HIS BOND SET AT  $2.5 MILLION.  DANNY SABAL IRSS JOINING ME  NOW.  DENNY, GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH  US.  WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS  FROM TODAY'S  PROCEEDINGS, IN YOUR OPINION?  >> Reporter:  THERE WEREN'T A  LOT OF TAKEAWAYS TO  HAVE FROM THIS PROCEEDING.  IT WAS VERY PRO FORMA, A  PROCEDURAL EVENT, WHERE  BILL WAS ADJUSTED, APPEARS TO  HAVE BEEN INCREASED.  IN THIS CASE, HE DIDN'T EVEN  ENTER A PLEA.  SO THE NEXT PHASE IS ANOTHER  HEARING IN JUNE, AND  THESE EARLY HEARINGS AREN'T  GOING TO TELL US A WHOLE  LOT ABOUT THE EVIDENCE WE'RE  GOING TO SEE LATER AT  TRIAL.  >> DABNY, GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY  WANTS SHOVIN TO BE  CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE  MURDER.  HIS CHARGES HAVE BEEN UPGRADED  TO SECOND AGREE  MURDER FROM THIRD.  IS IT LIKELY PROSECUTORS WILL  GO FURTHER HERE?  >> Reporter:  RESPECTFULLY,  IT'S NOT ONLY NOT  LIKELY, IT SEEMS COMPLETELY  IMPOSSIBLE.  I UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT OF  WANTING THE MOST  SERIOUS PUNISHMENT, BUT IT'S  NOT TYPICALLY A CASE --  FROM THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF  MURDER OR OTHER CRIMES  ARE SIMPLY A REFLECTION OF  MURDER ONE BEING THE  WORST, AND MURDER THREE BEING  LESS WORSE.  IN FACT, MINNESOTA'S MURDER ONE  STATUTE HAS VERY  SPECIFIC AGGRAVATING  SITUATIONS.  SO YOU CAN LOOK UP THE STATUTE  ONLINE AND GO DOWN  THE CHECKLIST, AND YOU'LL SEE  THAT FOR EACH ONE, IS  IT A KILLING OF A LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER?  NO.  IS THIS A KILLING THAT OCCURRED  DURING A SEXUAL  ASSAULT?  NO.  IS THIS A KILLING THAT HAPPENED  DURING A DOMESTIC  ABUSE CALL OR SITUATION?  NO.  SO YOU GO THROUGH ALL THOSE  CHECKLISTS, AND THE ONLY  THING THAT COULD POSSIBLY  REMAIN UNDER THE STATUTE  APPEARS TO BE PREMEDITATED,  INTENTIONAL MURDER.  NEW, THE FAMILY MAY SAY, \"WELL,  THAT'S WHAT THIS  WAS, PREMEDITATED MURDER.\"  BUT THE CHALLENGE THERE IS THAT  THAT WOULD BE  COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT WITH  EVERY OTHER CHARGE  AGAINST ERIC SHOVIN, BECAUSE  EACH OF THOSE ARE  CONDITIONED OR CONCEIVED THAT  THIS WAS AN  UNINTENTIONAL KILLING.  SO REALLY WOULDN'T MAKE A LOT  OF SENSE TO THEN  CHARGE HIM WITH AN INTENTIONAL  -- NOT JUST  INTENTIONAL, BUT PREMEDITATED  KILLING, AND ALSO  CHARGE HIM WITH MURDER TWO AND  THREE, BASED ON THE  UNINTENTIONAL KILLING.  SO AS MUCH AS I SYMPATHIZE WITH  THE FAMILIES AND  DESIRE TO SEE THE MOST SERIOUS  CHARGE BROUGHT  AGAINST ERIC SHOVIN, YOU HAVE  TO LOOK AT THE  STATUTE.  WE JUST DON'T APPEAR TO BE HERE  IN THIS CASE.  >> DANNY, THREE OTHER OFFICERS  WERE INVOLVED IN  GEORGE FRIDAY'S DEATH.  IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH  DAVE GUTIEREZ, THE  LAWYER FOR THOMAS LANE, A  PREVIEW OF HIS DISSENT.  LISTEN TO THIS.  >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE  ARGUING THAT, YOU KNOW, HE  DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER, OR HE  WAS SO --  >> HE WAS RELYING ON HIS  TRAINING AS A POLICE  OFFICER, AND FOLLOWING THE  DIRECTIONS AFTER A  TRAINING OFFICER.  SHOVIN WAS ALSO A TRAINING  OFFICER.  >> WAS HE FOLLOWING ORDERS?  >> HE WAS -- HE WAS DOING WHAT  HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.  >> DANNY, YOU'RE A DEFENSE  ATTORNEY.  WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT  ARGUMENT.  >> WE'RE LOOKING AT 17 YEARS  EXPERIENCE AHEAD OF  THESE OTHER OFFICERS.  AND HE'S A TRAINING OFFICER.  THESE ARE HUGE FACTORS. SOME OF  THEM APPARENTLY, AT LEAST AT  THIS STAGE,  APPARENTLY VOICED THOSE  CONCERNS.  . THE PROSECUTION PUT OUT  EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN'T GET  AWAY -- 7 MINUTES WITHOUT  STANDING ON SOMEONE'S  NECK, THAT'S GOING TO BE HARD  TO OVERCOME IF YOU'RE  ERIC SHOVIN OR THE OTHER  DEPARTMENT.  >> THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE  DEPARTMENT IS UNDER  INVESTIGATION.  IT'S GOING TO GO ABOUT 10 YEARS  TO SEE IF THE  DEPARTMENT ENGAGED IN  DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES.  HOW WILL THAT FACTOR INTO THESE  CASES? . . SOMEONE ELSE MAY HAVE  SIGNED OFF ON.  BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT WITH  FRESH EYES.  THIS MAY HAVE RESULTED IN A  CONSENT DEGREE OR THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT USUALLY  AGREED TO DO MORE TRAINING  OR DID SOMETHINGS TO  ACKNOWLEDGE -- FOUND TO HAVE  BEEN INVOLVED IN DISCRIMINATORY  PRACTICES OR  HABITUAL EXCESSIVE USE OF  FORCE.  . .  >> ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR LEGAL  EXPERTISE HERE.  >>> U.S. PROSECUTORS WANT TO  FORMALLY SPEAK WITH  BRITAIN'S PRINCE ANDREW AS PART  OF THEIR CRIMINAL  INVESTIGATION INTO JEFFREY  EPSTEIN'S ALLEGED SEX  TRAFFICKING RING.

YOUR QUESTION IS ONE MANY ARE  ASKING, WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT  MEAN?  WE ARE HEARING FROM THOSE  COUNCIL ", "k29Hyub0wqM": "- [Instructor] We are\nasked what is the height of the sunflower? So pause this video and think about it. All right, so let's see. The bottom of the\nsunflower is right aligned with the bottom of the ruler, so there ruler's in the right place. And let's see, the sunflower goes all the way up to this\npoint right over here. So this is one, two, three, four, five, and then a little bit more. So we're going to get into a fraction. So what is this extra amount? So if we can see the space between five and six is divided into\nfour equal sections. So we have, one, two, three, four. Or we could see it here. They've divided it with\nthese little hash marks into one, two, three, four equal sections. And this goes one of\nthose four equal sections towards six, so this is 5 1/4 feet. That's how tall the sunflower is. All right, let's do another example. So here we are told, or we are asked, which pencil measures 2 3/4 of an inch? So pause this video and\ntry to think about it. All right, so we go one inch, two inches, and then we have to think about how far between two and three is 3/4? So to think about 3/4, we have to divide the part, or\nthe part of this ruler, between two and three\ninto four equal sections. So let's see. If I were to just split it like this, that's two equal sections. So if I were to take each of those two equals sections and then split them, now\nthat's four equal sections. Notice one, two, three,\nfour equal sections. So when we're thinking about 3/4, we wanna go three of\nthose four equal sections. One, two, three. And so you can see right over here, that is 2 3/4. This is 2 3/4 right over here. And that is pencil A.", "V5ym0o43t4M": "okay I think we're live it is Saturday 11:15 p.m. and forgive me guys I have not used OBS Studios in in quite some time I've been using stream yards but since this is a solo stream I wanted to give you guys better quality so I would like to talk about speaker impedance I've seen several questions come up on the forums about what's the difference between an 8 ohm speaker and a 4 ohm speaker so I wanted to kind of do a very basic video here we could do something that's more in detail at a later date I'm gonna keep this pretty short and concise I hope everybody could see me okay so what I'd like to do is do some screen sharing with you on speaker stuff so I think there's a misconception sometimes when people think an 8 ohm speaker is better than a 4 ohm speaker or a forum speakers better than an 8 ohm speaker it's really it depends on the design it depends on the engineers goal when they made the speaker it depends how it's gonna be used and I wanted to kind of drop some knowledge on you guys about that so I'm hoping right now that you're seeing my screen share because I don't really have a way to monitor this but anyways we have an article called loudspeaker sensitivity and impedance explained I will link it up in this video I do recommend you read it it's important and one thing that really kind of stands out about this article is about the impedance of a speaker and how you can't just go by a single number when you look at a manufacturers website and they say a speaker is 8 ohms or a speaker is 4 ohms without actually seeing an impedance graph it's a pretty useless speaker spec because you don't know how they're measuring the impedance you don't know what frequency that rating is from because the only time a speaker is is a constant load at one particular rating is at DC basically and you don't listen to a speaker at DC you listen to a speaker from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz and over that range the impedance fluctuates it goes up and down the pin whether it's inductive or capacitive or how the drivers interact with the crossover so it's interesting to note that there are speakers that are 8 ohm rated and forum rated and the sensitivity also changes on that as well so if you look at if you keep things everything constant except for the impedance of the speaker and for argument's sake you have two identical speakers 1 speakers 8 ohms rated the other speakers forums rated with any given voltage if you keep voltage fixed they'll say a 2.8 3 volts if that 8 ohm speaker is rated at 87 dB at 2.8 3 volts then that equivalent speaker in a 4 ohm version would be rated at 90 DB so you gain 3 DB of sensitivity with or 3 DB of loudness what all other things being equal so that's kind of an important thing to note and people ask well why are some speakers 8 ohms and some speakers for arms and sometimes that has a lot to do with the driver specs that they're using the system if you take a speaker that has for example 3 8 inch woofers in the cabinet and each woofer is rated at 12 ohms well if they put all three of those woofers in parallel with each other then the equivalent impedance of those 3 woofers in parallel would be 4 ohms it's basically the reciprocal sum of the resistances of the reciprocated resistances so 1 over 12 plus 1 over 12 plus 1 over 12 you sum that up and you take the inverse of that and you get 4 ohms well that's fine like in a consumer speaker with 3 8 inch drivers but when you're dealing with commercial or you're dealing with large powered systems that have woofers with larger voice coils like a 3/4 inch voice coil and and the speaker is designed to handle a lot more power the wire that goes around the voice coil tends to be lower gauge and as a result these woofer impedance tends to be lower in resistance so you might use in that case 3 6 ohm woofers and when you put 3 6 ohm woofers in parallel you get a 2 ohm equivalent so you can start seeing how a speaker impedance can go really low and we'll talk about what the hell that could affect the amplifier now there are there are tricks around that manufacturers can do they can put speakers they could put woofers in series as opposed to parallel but then again you're reducing sensitivity because if you put two Eitan woofers in see in series that's an equivalent resistance of 16 ohms as opposed to two 8 ohm offers in parallel which is 4 ohms so of course if you go across 2.8 3 volts and you do that it's it's V squared over R so you do 2.83 and you divide that by 4 that gives you 2 watts but a 2.8 3 and you divide by 16 and that gives you half a lot so that's a difference of fourfold in terms of how much power that they an amplifier is dissipating just by how they're wiring the woofer is whether they're doing them in series of parallel so you can see the lower impedance speaker has a sensitivity advantage and that's why you get some of the pro speakers or some of the large scale speakers that have a lot of output capability tend to be lower impedance so I wanted to show you what an impedance graph would look like on a speaker because most manufacturers don't give you this most manufacturers will literally give you just one singular rating so you look at this speaker from infinity this is like a $400 Tower it's an infinity primus p 363 I think this I think this model might be discontinued now but it was actually pretty well rated people liked this speaker it's a good speaker for what it is for a 400 all a tower and they rated this at 8 ohms and if you look this is 8 ohms right here 8 is the line here so this is the impedance and this is the face I don't want to talk too much about phase but in general if you have too much of a sharp phase angle at a very short distance in frequency that could cause amplifier problems but I don't want to get too far into that I want to keep this pretty general let's just focus on the impedance you can see here you have a saddle point because this what this system is tuned and this is about where the tuning frequency is which looks like it's about 45 Hertz so in order to meet an 8 ohm spec if you go by IEC standard which is a standard measurement method for measuring loudspeaker impedance and sensitivity they want you they want to see whatever this the loudspeaker company rates the speaker let's say they rated it 8 ohms they want to see that impedance being no less than 80% that rating from 300 Hertz to 3 kilohertz so in this case an 8 ohm speaker should have no dips lower than about 6.4 ohms you can see in this case that's the infinity is really not it's it's it dips down to about five and a half ohms that it's tuned of frequency then over here and around 100 to 200 Hertz it goes well below 4 ohms here so they they could have optimized this cross over a little bit better but this is the interesting thing at 10 kilohertz this is something that you that's unexpected to see the impedance of the speaker dip down to 4 ohms for an 8 ohm system when everything else is pretty close to 8 ohms up here if you take the kind of magnitude of this what this what's happening here is Harman was being very clever they try to use the cheapest tweeter possible in this case because of budget and what they try to do is they try to increase the system sensitivity by going to a 4 ohm tweeter in an 8 ohm system and the reason why they did that is if they were to use an 8 ohm tweeter and wanted to get the kind of output and sensitivity from an 8 ohm they would have had to use a tweeter that had a larger motor structure and maybe even a bigger waveguide on it and those kind of things cost more money so they went with a 4 ohm tweeter and they stuck it into an 8 ohm speaker I don't agree with this kind of design philosophy I think they probably should have spent a couple more bucks and put a motor structure that was a little bigger and a better tweeter but overall the speaker is a good speaker and to their defense there's not a whole lot of program material you know above 10 kilohertz so you don't dissipate a lot of power so most amplifiers can handle a forum load like this there's only very few exceptions some of the earlier class D amplifiers like the older ice modules they did not like a low impedance above about 5 kilohertz so this speaker on an older pioneer ice amplifier could potentially be a problem when driven at full power they could potentially shut the receiver off and that's an important thing to know - is the receivers today have a lot of short-circuit protection a lot of nanny control over thermal protection you're probably not going to blow out a receiver driving it with a forum load if it's not fully capable of driving that forum load but you might shut it off and you might be at a party you might be cranking it up and all this on the receiver shuts off and this is a potential reason why because here's the deal when you're looking at most AV receivers on the market at 1 watt at 2.8 3 volts an amplifier will operate like an ideal voltage source so if you supply 2.8 3 volts to an 8 ohm speaker you'll get 1 watt if you supply to 23 volts to a 4 ohm speaker you'll get 2 watts you've doubled your power and that happens on amplifiers in ideal circumstances it happens at 1 watt and virtually every amplifier I've ever seen but when you get to the amplifiers limits whether it's the power supply limits or it's the thermal limits of the actual amplifier module itself it starts becoming thermally limited or power limited so if that receiver is rated at 150 watts at 8 ohms most receivers will not give you 300 watts at 4 ohms that might give you 250 watts at forums and then when you start driving a couple of channels you start getting into the area where it starts going into its nanny control because it just can't dissipate that much heat and that's what you got to be careful about with lower impedance speakers so I wanted to show you a couple more examples here we had we recently reviewed the SVS pinnacle prime speaker and I'm going to show you their manufacturers page right here so this is a tower that has three I think these are six and a half inch woofers and five and a quarter inch mid and a tweeter so you got three bass drivers in parallel you got the mid-range that's probably in parallel but it's got a high-pass on it so at low frequencies it doesn't the equivalent impedance of this speaker is not going to have four woofers in parallel because they put a capacitor there too that problem and that is a problem with some tower speakers I've seen I've seen some pretty sloppy designs that have no high-pass on the mid-range driver so at DC it's essentially for drivers in parallel and that P dance of that speaker dips down to like 2 ohms some receivers will have a problem at near DC at a couple of Hertz especially if you're hitting bass and they're not they don't have a high pass on this receiver if you're not bass managing that could cause receivers are shut off as well so at the very low end of the spectrum that could be a problem too that's why when a speaker manufacturer gives you impedance back I'd like to personally see a graph but if they don't give you a graph I'd like to see a nominal rating I'd like to see a DCR rating of the system and I'd like to see a minimum rating usually the minimum rating tends to be the DCR of the system but you rarely see that SPECT in the manufacturers website so SPS here they tell you the nominal impedance is 8 ohms and that's in my opinion a useless rating I'm sorry SPS I'm not bashing you but most companies do this but what is interesting is they actually give you a real sensitivity spec so they rated IEC from 300 Hertz to 3 kilohertz and we went and we measured this speaker and I want to show you the measurements here this is a very interesting phenomenon here so if you look at this impedance graph this is the impedance that's the phase if you look at the impedance graph here this is really not an 8 ohm system you could see it dips below 5 ohms I would really consider this a 6 ohm because if you do point eight of 6 it goes down to about four point eight homes so I would really consider this a 6 ohm maybe even a 4 ohm speaker but I would tell it I would tell you it's a 6 ohm speaker it's really not an 8 ohm speaker but the interesting thing is they rated at 88 DB sensitivity at 2.83 volts we measured 90 DB sensitivity so that almost compensates they were like overly conservative with the sensitivity rating but they were not conservative at all with the impedance rating I'm if I knew SVS well and I know the guys there I would almost think that the engine hearing people wanted to rate the speaker a 6 ohm speaker but the marketing people wanted to call it an 8 ohm speaker so the engineering said ok well let you rate it as an 8 ohm system but we're gonna dere 8 the sensitivity rating and I think that's why they came out with the 88 D because if you work out the math and you switch from 6 ohms from 8 ohms to 6 ohms you get your 90 DB which is what we measured so this is a pretty benign load to drive it's not a hard speaker to drive in most cases if you're driving a tower like this with multiple woofers and the sensitivity is 90 DB or so you'll probably be ok with a normal mid-price receiver but I would caution you if you're running a receiver that has 9 or 11 amplifiers built in I would use a separate power amp in this case for a big Tower like this especially if you're not based managing it so I want to show you a bookshelf speaker from Revell and I believe they rated this as a 6 ohm speaker and you can see here it is about a 6 ohm it's a it's it's a little shy of it so 6 ohm shouldn't dip below I'm sorry it shouldn't dip below 4.8 ohm so this is actually closer to an 8 ohm speaker this is a conservatively rated speaker you can see the saddle points here are above 6 ohms the whole system itself especially at high frequency is very high impedance like 12 ohms so I would really call this an 8 ohm speaker this is a real easy load to drive it's got decent sensitivity at 86 DB for a bookshelf that's pretty good or actually if they measured it at 88 DB even though Revell spected at 86 so that's you know this is pretty much the pinnacle of engineering and a bookshelf speaker is here and it's a high-end speaker and there was no reason to make this a forum speaker I mean it just that's how it worked out with the woofer itself didn't need to be a super low in resistance coil and whatever they chose here I don't know if it's a 2 inch or three inch coil this thing handled plenty of power it had a lot of sensitivity and you know it plays loud and plays clean so that's why I just wanted to show you and then here's one more example here's an rbh tower that's rated at 4 ohms and you could see I have a dotted line here the IEC minimum for 8 for 4 ohms is 80% of 4 so it's 3 point 2 ohms that's where this dotted line is an RB H speaker doesn't dip below basically about 3.8 ohms this is a conservatively rated Borum speaker so the only other thing I wanted to talk to you about let me stop sharing my screen here for a minute and I'm back ok so I know there's a temptation despite the fact I've done tons of articles tons of videos on the receiver impedance which people still ask me I have a six ohm speaker from Brand X should I set the impedance switch on my receiver to 8 ohms or should I set it to 4 ohms and I will tell you every single time it's asked always leave your receiver on the high setting on the a dome setting or the 6 ohms and more setting never set that switch to the low setting that switches there for one purpose only that switch is there so it lowers the output voltage when ul or CSA or whoever's doing the thermal tests on that receiver and they want to stamp a 4 ohm rating on that receiver they D rate the power so they make that amplifier clip soon or at lower voltage so that receiver dissipates less power and it meets their thermal requirements so they could say this receiver is capable of handling 4 ohm speakers you're actually gonna cause more clipping and you get a reduce your dynamics more by using the low setting regardless of your speaker impedance always keep the switch on the high setting so I think that's all I wanted to cover about this I hope you guys found this useful the difference between 8 ohm and 4 ohm speakers it doesn't mean that one speaker is better than the other just because of the impedance it's just really about design compromises and design considerations about really about the impedance of the drivers about the woofers about how many woofers are in parallel versus doing series connections inside the speaker and it's about getting as much sensitivity out of that system as you can so I would again say if you're getting forum speakers and you're running them full range in most cases you don't want to use a receiver to power them when that receiver internal amplifier is doing is basically powering all the other speakers in your system unless you're getting like a 60-pound receiver from 10 years ago that had huge power supplies in it multiple output devices per channel and could really handle driving a low impedance loads I would almost tell you to always get a separate amplifier when you're driving a forum a real forum speaker especially if the sensitivity is below like 90 DB and you like a lot of bass and you like to play it loud go with a separate amplifier amplifier power is cheap really not that big of a problem these days and in fact in most cases you can reassign on unused amplifiers and a receiver to say the back channels or another zone and then preamp out to a 2-channel amplifier from model price or outlaw para sound you know there's so many brands out there excuse me so guys I think that sums it up here I hope I answered your questions on the difference between eight ohm and 4 ohm speakers if you like this video please thumb it up please share it YouTube's algorithm change now so if you don't get a lot of shares on videos within 24

I'll throw in a two and a\nfour, and two threes. Huh?", "IVKJBLY-R4I": "hey everybody this is miss Dietrich and we're going to explore a fraction division we're going to explore the following question how many groups of 1/16 are in a half so first of all let's make sure we understand that this box is going to represent one so I'm just going to click and drag this over here and let's take a look at some of my fractional models that I have down here it's my hope that you can tell what one blue would represent one of these light blues you would need 16 of those to make up the hole so one of these represents 1/16 if we take a look at this yellow box you would need 8 of those to make up the hole so that's equal to 1/8 let's move that down to my bank one of these purple or actually it's more pink that would represent 1/4 you need 4 of those to make up the hole or horse equals a hole and the green represents 1/2 because you need two of those to make up the hole alright so isn't that what we're starting with here how many groups of 1/16 are in a hat so here's a half now we're going to figure out how many of these we have and you can probably visually see we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 of them well let's see what that would look like if we were to do the old paper pencil method so we have 1/2 and we want to know how many groups of 1/16 now if we were to do the work for this that's the same as 1/2 times the reciprocal of this which would be 16 over 1 now we were going to go ahead and take advantage of the fact that we can pre reduce because we have a common factor between this numerator and this denominator we can divide by 2 and get 1 and divide by 2 here and get 8 and is 1 times 8 8 and 1 this is a 1 1 times 1 is 1 and 8 divided by 1 is 8 now we counted out eight of them didn't we the answer is 8 see 1 2 3 4 5 six seven eight all right so let's just pretend that we were going to change this not to 1/16 but let's see we're going to change that number to two sixteenths so do you see how here is a group of two sixteenths here's a group of two sixteenths here's a group of two sixteenths and then here's another group of two 60s by the way to sixteenths isn't that equal to one of these and we can turn it around same thing right it's an eight still an eight we have how many of those we have four of them don't we so we can kind of do all different configurations hopefully this model helps you understand a little bit better about fraction division", "T3T-evQZiQo": "[Music] for years the truth was hidden [Music] people from other times other world heroes but now we know they're among us what does shield stand for agent ward strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division and what does that mean to you someone really wanted our initials to spell out shield I'm clearance level six I know that Agent Coulson was killed in action before the Battle of New York welcome to level seven where is that that's superhero age award we worked the case of shield hasn't classified strange the unknown such a spy versus spy anymore the whole worlds in on the action [Applause] you're in danger what do you mean danger shield pressure carry shield shield government scary men in dark suits who come after guys like you is that who I think it is she's just the pilot Melinda may is just the pilot Fitzsimmons first Simmons I'm Engineering she's biochem it's not a desert we will ride against those who shield us from the truth and nothing can stop us in them Hey there are two ways we can do this Wow it's Mona thing the easy way No I'm not exactly a team player they're not exactly a team but we're in a position to do some good I've seen Giants the good ones you're not heroes because of what they have it's what they do it we're not the only ones interested in people with powers when we take the shot if you have to we have a couple of hours at most has no way that we could don't ever tell me there's no way [Music] don't touch Lola [Music] you [Music]", "-QgneVVw9gA": ">> HIGH STAKES, HIGH PRESSURE. WRESTLEMANIA IS ON THE LINE. IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO WILL EARN THE WOMEN'S TITLE OPPORTUNITY  AGAINST BECKY LYNCH AT   WRESTLEMANIA.  >> AS WE ROOK AT THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER AND THIS CROWD IS  PUMPED, LET'S LOOK AT THE RULES  FOR THE WOMEN'S QUALIFIER. IT BEGINS WITH TWO WOMEN IN THE  RING IN THE CHAMBER AND TWO  OTHER WOMEN ENCLOSED IN THEIR  RESPECTIVE PODS. A POLLED DOOR WITH OPEN AT   RANDOM IN SUPERB VALS. THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL ALL PODS ARE EMPTY.  IF AT ANY TIME A WOMAN IS  ELIMINATED, SHE MUST EXIT THE  CHAMBER UNTIL WE HAVE ONE WOMAN  LEFT.  >> AND WHO BETTER TO HELP US   DISCUSS THE WOMEN'S ELIMINATION  CHAMBER, MAX, THAN ONE OF THE  WOMEN COMPETING TONIGHT IN THE   CHAMBER, MISS RUBY RIOTT.  RO HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?  >> I'M FEELING GOOD, I'M FEELING READY. >> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK  ABOUT THE FORMER SQUAD MEMBERS.  TWO OF THOSE COMPETITORS WILL BE IN AGAINST YOU IN THE LIMB LEM.  DO YOU FEEL LIKE THOSE MIGHT BE  TWO OF YOUR BIGGEST THREATS? RUBY: I'M NOT GOING TO DISCREDIT LIV MORGAN OR SARAH LOGAN. THEY'RE PRODUCTS OF ME BUT I   CAME BACK TO PUT LEAVE MORGUEN   IN HER PLACE AND AS WE ALL SAW   LAST WEEK ON SUNDAY NIGHT \"RAW,\" SARAH LOGAN NEEDS TO BE TAKEN  DOWN A PEG TOO.  I'M GOING TO SECURE MY PLACE AT  WRESTLEMANIA STANDING ACROSS   FROM BECKY LYNCH FOR THE \"RAW\"   WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP.  >> I LIKE THE CONFIDENCE.  >> RUBY, ONE THING THAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT YOU TONIGHT IS THERE'S  SO MUCH TALK ABOUT THE RIOTT   SQUAD AND YOU, LIV AND SARAH, I  FEEL LIKE SOME OF THE ATTENTION  SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON SHAYNA  BASZLER. SHE'S IN THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER TONIGHT TOO. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE   DISTRACTED WITH THE RIOTT SQUAD? RUBY: LOOK, I KNOW THE WWE   UNIFORMS HAVE YOUR FAVORITES,  YOU ALL HAVE YOUR FAVORITES BUT  FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS, I'VE   BEEN WITHIN ARM'S REACH OF MY  WRESTLEMANIA MOMENT AND NOW,   JUST -- I CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND  WHY I'VE BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR SO  LONG.  I WATCHED THE ELIMINATION  CHAMBER PANEL LAST YEAR AND  EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THAT  PANEL, WHETHER YOU WERE THERE OR NOT ONLY SPOKE MY OPPONENT'S   NAME.  THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME.  BUT I'M SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW   TO SHOW YOU WHY YOU CAN'T FORGET ABOUT ME, WHY NONE OF THOSE  WOMEN CAN FORGOT ABOUT ME  BECAUSE I'M IN CHARGE. I RUN THIS DIVISION AND YOU'RE   GOING TO FIND OUT WHY WHEN I   ENTER THAT CHAMBER TONIGHT.  >> RUBY, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR   YOU. YOUR FORMER RIOTT SQUAD MEMBERS, THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO WITH ANY  CHAMBER EXPERIENCE.  ARE YOU AT ALL CONCERNED ABOUT   THE STRUCTURE ITSELF?  YOU'RE STEPPING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME.  RUBY: FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,   OBVIOUSLY THAT CHAMBER IS AN   UNFORGIVING ONE AND I KNOW MY  FORMER TEAMMATES ARE THE ONLY  TWO THAT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE IN  IT BUT THEY RELIED ON EACH   OTHER. THEY HAVE ALWAYS RELIED ON OTHER PEOPLE TO GET THEM WHERE THEY  NEED TO BE BUT I WORK BEST   ALONE. SO IF I'M STANDING IN THAT POD   ALONE WITH THE WORLD AGAINST ME, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SURROUNDS ME.  THE ONLY THING I NEED TO DO IS   GET THROUGH THAT TO GET TO   WRESTLEMANIA.  >> YOUR CONFIDENCE IS CLEARLY  WHERIT SHOULD BE.  YOUR FOCUS IS WHERE IT SHOULD  BE.  WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST   TONIGHT. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY   NIGHT FOR ANYBODY SO GOOD LUCK.  RUBY: THANKS, COACH. >> THAT IS RUBY RIOTT, LATER ON  SHE'LL BE A PART OF THE  ELIMINATION MATCH.

EDGE IS BACK ON \"RAW.\" WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE  RATED-R SUPERSTAR COMES  FACE-TO-FACE WITH RANDY ORTON  FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE   VIPER'S MALICIOUS ATTACK?  \"RAW,\" LIVE, TOMORROW NIGHT,   8:00, 7:00 CENTRAL, ONLY ON  U.S.A. JONATHAN: WE CONTINUE ON THE   ELIMINATION CHAMBER KICKOFF SHOW AND THE CHAMBER SITS OMINOUSLY   BEHIND US JUST WAITING FOR THOSE TWO BIG MATCHES LATER ON TONIGHT BUT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT  THINGS THAT MUCH POMED UP IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  CERTAINLY THE RETURN OF EDGE AT  THE ROYAL RUMBLE AND THEN YOU  FAST FORWARD TO WHAT HAPPENED  BETWEEN HIM, RANDY ORTON, HIS  WIFE BETH PHOENIX. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS AS WE   HEAD INTO TONIGHT? >> I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, I'M   ENJOYING NOTHING MORE THAN   WATCHING WHAT'S PLAYING OUT  BETWEEN EDGE AND RANDY ORTON AND I'M WAITING WITH BAITED BREATH   TO SEE WHAT EDGE HAS TO SAY. HE'S BEEN WAITING SINCE HE TOOK  WHAT HE TOOK ON THE ROYAL RUMBLE AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED TO  BETH.  AND BY THE WAY, THE INSPIRATION  THAT RANDY ORTON HAS GOTTEN FROM EDGE BEING AROUND THIS GUY HAS  A BATTERY IN HIS BACK LIKE I   HAVEN'T SEEN IN YEARS. IN IS THE BEST, MOST DANGEROUS   RANDY ORTON I'VE SEEN IN YEARS.  >> I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT EDGE IS  FEELING TOO NOW AFTER WE SAW   EVERYTHING UNRAVEL MONDAY NIGHT  ON \"RAW.\"  JONATHAN: DAVID, AS A  COMPETITOR, SOMETIMES YOU NEED   SOMETHING TO GET YOU FIRED UP  AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AND TO   PETER'S POINT, MAYBE THAT'S  WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RANDY  ORTON. DAVID: IT WELL COULD BE. THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS RANDY ORTON WE'VE SEEN IN SOME TIME. HE'S ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST  SKILLED PEOPLE IN THAT RING AND  WHEN HE'S MOTIVATED, THERE'S NO  ONE BETTER.  >> I HAVEN'T SEEM HIM THIS   MOTIVATED IN A LONG TIME.  DAVID: WHEN DOES HE GET  MOTIVATED? WHO INSPIRES HIM?  APPARENTLY EDGE SHOWING UP AT  THAT ROYAL RUMBLE HAS INSPIRED   HIM. >> WE HAVE ANOTHER ELIMINATION   CHAMBER MATCH TO DISCUSS THIS  EVENING. THAT IS FOR THE \"SMACKDOWN\" TAG  TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP. HERE TO HELP US BREAK THAT DOWN, NONE OTHER THAN THE \"SMACKDOWN\"  TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS, MIZ AND MARY SON. HELLO, GENTLEMEN.  >> HEY, WHAT'S UP? HOW YOU DOING? ?  >> HOW ARE WE DOING? OH, I DON'T KNOW, WE HAVE TO   DEFEND OUR TITLES AGAINST 10   SUPERSTARS INSIDE THE  ELIMINATION CHAMBER IN OUR FIRST TITLE DEFENSE, MIND YOU. >> HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN. YOU'RE DEFYING THE ODDS, I GUESS YOU'D SAY. YOU'VE BEEN DEFYING THE ODDS   YOUR WHOLE CAREER. >> I HAVE. >> NO ONE EVER THOUGHT HE'D BE   WWE CHAMPION.  WAS THERE A QUESTION?  >> YES, THIS IS A QUESTION.  YOU TALKED ABOUT IT'S YOUR FIRST TITLE DEFENSE. THIS COMES LESS THAN TWO WEEKS   AFTER YOU WON THE TAG TEAM   TITLES AND NOW NOT ONLY ARE YOU  HAVING TO DEFEND THEM AGAINST  SOME OF THE BEST TAG TEAMS IN  THE WE'VE BUT INSIDE THE   ELIMINATION CHAMBER. ARE YOU READY AND HOW PREPARED   TO YOU -- DO YOU FEEL? >> THIS IS WHAT MIZ AND MARY SON DO.  WE ELEVATE EVERY BRAND, EVERY  STAR.  THEY ALL WISHTHEY COULD BE THIS TIME OF TAG TEAM, WHETHER IT'S   THE PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE. MIDST AND MARY SON ARE TAG TEAM  -- MIZ AND MARY SON ARE TAG TEAM WRESTLING. >> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,  JOHN.  OFF LOT OF CHAMBER EXPERIENCE,   THREE TIMES, TO BE EXACT.  IT'S BEEN SINCE 2011.  DO YOU THINK YOU'RE PREPARED TO  GET BACK INTO THIS DEMONIC   STRUCTURE? >> HOW DARE YOU SIT THERE AND  SAY THAT MORRISON MIGHT HAVE A   LITTLE RUST OR MORRISON MIGHT BE READY FOR THE ELIMINATION  CHAMBER. HE FEELS READY THAT IS WHAT WE   DO, WE ARE ALWAYS READY. WE OVERCOME THE ODDS.  WE DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THROWING OUT CAN -- PANCAKES BECAUSE WE   ARE MIZ AND MORRISON.  HEY, HEY, HO, HO, MIZ AND  MORRISON.  >> SEVEN GOING TO SAY THAT WHEN  WE'RE OUT THERE AT THE END OF  THE CHAMBER HOLDING THE TITLE  CUSTOM.  >> I DIDN'T SEE ANY RUST AT THE  END OF SHOWDOWN. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE  PERFECTLY IN SYNC. JOHN, YOU'VE BEEN AWAY FOR SOME  TIME.  YOU CAME BACK AND PICKED UP WITH THE MIZ LIKE YOU GUYS NEVER LOST A STEP.  WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE MIZ THAT  MAKES YOU GUYS CLICK SO WELL   TOGETHER?  >> I DON'T KNOW BUT EVERYONE HAS FRIENDS IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU  SOMETIMES TALK TO AND SOMETIMES  DON'T. MIZ AND I HADN'T TALKED IN YEARS BUT WHETHER WE GOT BACK TOGETHER IT WAS LIKE WE HADN'T MISSED A   BEAT.  WE'RE READY FOR THIS CHAMBER.  >> AND WE'RE READY TO PROVE WHY  WE ARE THE GREATEST TAG TEAM OF  THE 21ST CENTURY.  >> MIZ, MORRISON WE FLOW THE   COUNTDOWN CONTINUES. GENTLEMEN, WE'LL LET YOU GO GET  READY AND WE WISH YOU NOTHING  BUT THE BEST TONIGHT IN THE  ELIMINATION CHAMBER. [LAUGHTER] >> CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THOSE GUYS  COMPETE LATER TONIGHT. BUT LET'S GO BACK FOR A SECOND,  IF WE COULD. LET'S GO BACK TO \"RAW\" AND WE  CALLED THIS THE GAUNTLET AND I'D LIKE TO GET TO A.J. STYLES.  HE HAD TO GO THROUGH ANDERSON,   GALLOWS. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE   GAUNTLET AND WHAT ALEISTER BLACK WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ON MONDAY NIGHT IS   >> THIS IS NOTHING NEW IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALEISTER'S  CAREER.  WHAT IS SO EXCITING ABOUT THIS   IS FOR HIM TO HAVE A MATCHUP   WITH A.J. STYLES ON SUCH A BIG   STAGE LIKE THE ELIMINATION   CHAMBER. IS A.J. READY FOR IT?  BECAUSE ALEISTER BLACK YOU KNOW  IS.  >> ALEISTER BLACK AND A.J.   STYLES WILL GO ONE-ON-ONE AND  GET THIS, IT'S A   NO-DISQUALIFICATION MATCH, WHICH MEANS ANYTHING GOES. AND DAVID OTUNGA, ALEISTER BLACK BETTER BE READY FOR ANYTHING.  DAVID: HE BETTER BE BUT HE KNOWS TO EXPECT ANYTHING TONIGHT.  LOOK AT THIS.  MESSAGE FROM THE UNDERTAKER  HERE.  AND THAT'S MY CONCERN IS HE'S  TOO FOCUSED ON THE UNDERTAKER. JONATHAN: THAT'S A VERY GOOD   QUESTION BUT THIS IS A MATCH   THAT A LOT OF FANS IN THE WWE  UNIVERSE HAVE BEEN TALKING   ABOUT. ALEISTER BLACK. THIS IS ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST   NIGHT OF HIS CAREER. DOES HE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO  STEP UP TO THE PLATE AGAINST ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST?  >> THREE SEPARATE ATTACKS, A.J.  STYLES, AND NOT ONCE DID I SAY   DIE. AND THAT WAS WHEN THE RULES  APPLIED. NOW, TONIGHT IS A  NO-DISQUALIFICATION MATCH, WHICH MEANS THIS IS NO ONE TO SAVE   YOU. NOT YOUR FRIENDS, NOT YOU, NO  FALSE IDOLS. NOW, YOU ARE ALL ALONE.  AND FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN   ALONE AND FIGHTING ALONE HIS   ENTIRE LIFE. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO ENTRUST TO  YOU HOW TRUE LONELINESS WILL   FEEL.  JONATHAN: CERTAINLY A LASER  FOCUS FROM ALEISTER BLACK AND  DAVID, CLEARLY IT'S A BIG  OPPORTUNITY FOR ALEISTER BLACK.  DAVID: THIS IS A VERY BIG STAGE, A HUGE OPPORTUNITY BUT ALEISTER  BLACK HAS PROVEN TIME AND TIME   AGAIN HE'S READY FOR THIS. HE'S THE REAL DEAL.  I THOUGHT HE LOOKED SUPER  IMPRESSIVE GOING UP AGAINST O.C. HE HAD TO RUN THROUGH ALL OF   THEM AND STILL WAS IMPRESSIVE. AGAINST A.J. STYLES, HE KNOWS  WHAT TO EXPECT.  YOU HEARD HIM. I DIDN'T HEAR ONE OUNCE OF FEAR  OR INTIMIDATION IN HIS VOICE.  >> BUT HE DOES REALIZE THIS  MATCH ISN'T LIKELY JUST HE VS.   A.J. STYLES. IT'S HIM VS. A.J. STYLES, GALOS  AND ANDERSON MOST LIKELY.  DAVID: THAT'S MY POINT.  HE REALIZES THAT AND HE'S NOT  INTIMIDATE SOD OBVIOUSLY HE'S  GAME PLANNED IFER THAT.  JONATHAN: WHEN YOU TAKE ON ONE   OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS, PETER,   YOU HAVE TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF   YOUR OWN GAME. WHERE IS BLACK RIGHT NOW WITH  THAT?  PETER: I LOVE THAT YOU SAID  THAT.  A.J. STYLES IS ONE OF THE  ALL-TIME GREATS.  A SURE-FIRE FIRST-BALLOT HALL OF FAMER AND ALEISTER BLACK IS AN   EMERGING STAR, ONE OF THE GREAT  TALENTS IN THE WORLD BUT IS HE   PREPARED FOR A SURE FIRE FIRST-  BALLOT HALL OF FAMER IN ARCH.  YOU DO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE   O.C., HOWEVER, IS A.J. STYLES  TINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN  CALLED RAIN? IS HE THINKING ABOUT THE   UNDERTAKER AND COULD THAT  DISTRACTION AFFECT HIM?  JONATHAN: IT'S TOO FRESH.  IT HAS TO A LITTLE BIT.  THAT'S CERTAINLY A MATCH TONIGHT I THINK EVERYBODY FEELS COULD  STEAL THE SHOW.  SWITCHING GEARS, THE   INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE ON THE  LINE TONIGHT IN A THREE-ON-ONE   HANDICAP MATCH.  BRAUN STROWMAN TAKING ON   SHINSUKE NAKAMURA, CESARO AND  SAMI ZAYN. WHOEVER IS ABLE TO PIN BRAUN   STROWMAN WOULD WALK TOUT   CHAMPION BUT THAT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE. >> THE FOLLOWING CONTEST,  SCHEDULED FOR ONE FALL, IS FOR   THE INTERCONTINENTAL   CHAMPIONSHIP!  >> SHINSUKE NAKAMURA DEFENDERS   AGAINST BRAUN STROWMAN.  >> HE WANTS THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP.  >> HE'S NEVER WON A SINGLE TITLE IN WWE.  >> BIG SHOT BY ZAYN. AND CESARO TRIED TO SNEAK IN   FROM BEHIND AND NOW THE EXPOSED  TURN -- TURNBUCKLE.  KNACK MARA ON THE TURNBUCKLE.  POWER SLAM.  STROWMAN WINS IT.  HE'S THE INTERCONTINENTAL  CHAMPION!  >> THE ONE THING THEY HAVEN'T  BEEN ABLE TO DO AS A WWE   SUPERSTAR IS HOLD A SINGLE TITLE OVER MY HEAD.  THAT IS, UNTIL NOW!  >> WE'RE HERE TO DEMAND AN   HONORABLE REMATCH. >> AHHH! >> I'LL DEFENDER MY  INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP  ANY TIME, ANY PLACE. I DON'T EVEN CARE WHAT'S IN THIS CONTRACT BECAUSE AT THE END OF   THE DAY I KNOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT YOU THREE CLOWNS  ANYWAYS AND I'M TOTALLY FINE   WITH IT SO GIVE ME THE DAMM  CONTRACT.  I'M SIGNING IT.  -- DAMN CONTRACT.  I'M SIGNING IT.  >> SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,   YOU'RE WILLING TO FIGHT ALL  THREE OF US? >> ALL RIGHT, IT'S OFFICIAL. THE INTERCONTINENTAL   CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH AT  ELIMINATION CHAMBER WILL NOW BE  A THREE-ON-ONE HANDICAP MATCH. >> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE   GOING TO MAKE IT TO ELIMINATION  CHAMBER? \u266a    >> A THREE-ON-ONE HANDICAP   MATCH. \u266a   >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE  WELCOME MY GUEST, THE  INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPION, A   MONSTER AMONG MEN, BRAUN   STROWMAN.  BRAUN, LATER TONIGHT THE ODDS  ARE AGAINST YOU. ARE YOU PREPARED FOR SHINSUKE  NAKAMURA, CESARO AND SAMEY   ZAYN'S THREE-PRONGED ATTACK? BRAUN: I DON'T CARE HOW MANY   SUPERSTARS SAMI SHOWS UP WITH IN HIS CLOWN CART TONIGHT.  I AM READY FOR EVERYONE. >> ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THE  NUMBERS ARE TOO MUCH?  BRAUN: SAMEY ZAYN IS A   LOUD-MOUTHED CLOWN.  SHINSUKE NAKAMURA AND CESARO, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE TWO OF THE   BADDEST DUDES IN THE WWE BUT   I'VE WORKED FOUR AND A HALF  WEARS YEARS -- YEARS TO WIN IN   CHAMPIONSHIP AND I'LL BE DAMNED  IF I'M GOING TO LET SOMEBODY   TAKE IT. I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE TO FIGHT  THREE GUYS, 300 GUYS.  ANYONE THAT COMES FOR MY TITLE   IS GOING TO GET THESE HANDS. >> BRAUN STROWMAN, YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM TO KNOW HOW   POWERFUL HE IS. HE'S ONE OF THE MOST DOMINANT  SUPERSTARS IN ALL OF WWE   HISTORY. BUT COULD THE NUMBERS END UP   BEING TOO MUCH FOR HIM TO HANDLE TONIGHT? PETER: THEY VERY WELL COULD. YOU TAKE A GUY LIKE SAYS ROLL. HE IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BEST   POUND FOR POUND GUYS.  SHINSUKE NAKAMURA IS ALSO  PHENOMENAL AND SAMI ZAYN AS  WELL.  BRAUN OBVIOUSLY APPRECIATES  WHAT'S IN FRONT OF HIM AND   OBVIOUSLY, AS YOU SAID, HE'S   WORRIED ABOUT THE NUMBERS. ONE-ON-ONE I THINK HE'S GOT  THERE THIS BUT NOW I THINK THEY  MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK SOMETHING  OUT AND GET ONE OVER.  >> AND DON'T SLEEP ON SAMI.  WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING AT CESARO   AND SHINSUKE.  THERE IS A WILEY, SMART,   ANNOYING PEST NAMED SAMI ZAYN  WHO COULD COME OUT AND STEAL THE TITLE. THERE'S PRESSURE ON BRAUN  STROWMAN TONIGHT.  AS DOMINANT AS HE'S BEEN,  CHARLY, THIS IS HIS FIRST  SINGLES TITLE REIGN. THINK ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTMENT   IF HE LOSES THE TITLE TONIGHT,   FOUR WEEKS FROM WRESTLEMANIA.  DAVID: HOWEVER, THAT'S EXTRA   MOTIVATION FOR HIM TO KEEP IT. WE'VE ALL SEEN WHAT BRAUN CAN  DO.  INCREDIBLE FEATS OF STRENGTHS. FLIPPING OVER AMBULANCES, OTHER  VEHICLES.  CHARLY: WHAT DID HE DO LAST WEEK ON \"SMACKOWN\"?  HE GOT RIGHT BACK UP.  JONATHAN: HE IS A RARE KIND OF   SUPERSTAR. IT FEELS LIKE THE  INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE REALLY  MEANS SOMETHING TO BRAUN   STROLLEN.  CLEARLY HE WANTS TO TAKE OUT   THESE THREE BUT THIS TITLE MEANS SOMETHING TO ME. PETER: THAT'S THE TITLE OF BRETT THE HITMAN HART, SHAWN MICHAELS, SO MANY. AND WITH IT BEING HIS FIRST  TITLE, THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO ME AND YOU'RE TELLING   ME YOU DON'T THINK HE'S THINKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF HOLDING THAT   TITLE AND ANOTHER TITLE? BEREAVE -- BELIEVE ME, BRAUN   STROWMAN LOVES THE I.C. TITLE  AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT ADDING   ANOTHER ONE TO HIS COLLECTION. JONATHAN: UNEXPECTED IS A WORD   WE COULD USE TO DESCRIBE THAT  MATCH LATER ON TONIGHT.  LAST WEEK ON \"RAW,\" WE SAW   SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE VERY   OFTEN. BROCK LESNAR DOWN, CURT ANY --   COURTESY OF DREW MACINTYRE.  >> GOING TO GET SQUASHED --  JONATHAN: OUT COMES DREW   MACINTYRE. CLEARLY DID NOT WANT TO STAND IN THE BACK AND LISTEN TO PAUL  HEYMAN.  WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THIS  CONFRONTATION AND ULTIMATELY   WHAT HAPPENED? DAVID: HE WALKS RIGHT UP TO  LESNAR.  NO FEAR. CHARLY: THAT'S ONE.  PETER: EXACTLY.  THERE ARE MORE WHERE THAT CAME   FROM.  I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SEEN   BROK GO THROUGH SOMETHING QUITE  LIKE THIS ON \"MONDAY NIGHT RAW.\" JONATHAN: WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS DID FOR THE CONFIDENCE OF DREW   MACINTYRE? PETER: EVERYTHING. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT BROCK   LESNAR AT WRESTLEMANIA, YOU NEED TO BUILD ALL OF THE CONFIDENCE   YOU CAN. JONATHAN: AND PART OF  WRESTLEMANIA IS ALREADY SET. IN FACT, THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO.  BROCK LESNAR, THE CHAMPION,  TAKING ON DREW MACINTYRE   ONE-ON-ONE.  YOU TALK ABOUT A LEGIT,  HEAVYWEIGHT BAT. -- BATTLE. CHARLY: AND AS THE WINNER TO   HAVE WOMEN'S TITLE, BLAIR HAD  HER CHOICE OF WHICH TITLE TO GO  FOR. SO ON PRIM 5 AT WRESTLEMANIA,  IT'S GOING TO BE CHARLOTTE FLAIR VS. RHEYA RIPLEY LIVE FOR THE  WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP.  JONATHAN: WHAT ENDED UP  HAPPENING CAUSED HIM TO WANT TO  GO BACK TO WRESTLEMANIA AT LEAST ONE MORE TIME. CENA ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE FRIEND, BRAY WYATT IN TAMPA. WE WERE CROSSING THE BOTTOM OF   THE HOUR AS WE CONTINUES TO  COUNT DOWN TO THE TOP OF THE   HOUR AND THE ELIMINATION   CHAMBER. WE ARE LIVE AT THE WELLS FARGO   CENTER HERE IN PHILADELPHIA. ALL MONTH LONG, WWE AND COKE   ENERGY HAVING ASKING OUR FANS TO SIGN UP FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE.  I HAVE A SPECIAL TREAT TONIGHT.  I'VE BEEN TEXTING A REALLY GOOD  FRIEND OF MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO SEE IF HE MIGHT COME OUT AND JOIN US AT THE DESK AND I JUST HEARD   BACK.  CHARLY: OH, MY GOSH, WHO IS IT?  JONATHAN: I AM HONOR AND WOULD   PRIVILEGED TO BRING OUT ONE OF   THE BIGGEST SUPERSTARS IN THE  WWE TOOT, R-TRUTH. WELCOME TO THE KICKOFF SHOW. WHAT'S UP, BABY? R-TRUTH: THANKS FOR HAVING ME  HERE, MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF Y'ALL  INVITED ME --  JONATHAN: IT WAS ME. R-TRUTH: I GET TO COME REPRESENT -- WATCH MY CHILDHOOD HERO JOHN  CENA TAKE ON THE FIEND TONIGHT,  WRESTLEMANIA.  RIGHT HERE.  JONATHAN: R-TRUTH, THAT'S NEXT   MONTH, NOT TONIGHT.  CHARLY: THIS ISN'T WRESTLEMANIA, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?  R-TRUTH: WHY Y'ALL RUNNING ALL   THE GRAPHICS ABOUT IT? CHARLY: PROMOTING IT.  THIS IS THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER. R-TRUTH: MY BAD. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TELLING Y'ALL. JONATHAN: NO, IT'S NEXT MONTH. YOU MET PETER BEFORE, RIGHT? R-TRUTH: SAM ROBERTS.  JONATHAN: WE TEXTED ABOUT THAT   THIS WEEK. R-TRUTH: Y'ALL TRYING TO TRICK   ME.  PETER ROSENBURG FROM 97 WAS  GOING TO DO MY MUSIC.  PREERT -- PETER: THAT'S ME.  I'M NOT SAM ROBERTS. HE HAS A LOT OF HAIR.  CHARLY: THERE WAS A BIG PRESS  RELEASE THAT PETER WAS RETURNING TO WWE.  JONATHAN: WE TEXTED TWO DAYS   AGO, TRUTH.  ARE YOU MESSING WITH US? R-TRUTH: WHO'S YOUR PROVIDER?     CHARLY: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? JONATHAN: VERIZON. PETER: I WAS BLUE, I PHONE.  >> HE'S GOT A BURNER PHONE.  R-TRUTH: YOUR PHONE GOT A VIRUS  TOO. I'M NOT GETTING IT.  HELP YOU HELP ME.  JONATHAN WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.  R-TRUTH, YOU JUST SAW WHAT WE  SAW WITH BROK AND WE KNOW YOU  MAD A RECENT HISTORY WITH BROCK  LESNAR AND WHAT MACINTYRE DID. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT? R-TRUTH: BROCK IS A MOUNTAIN OF  A MAN BUT DREW MACINTYRE HAS   BEEN MAKING EVERYBODY FEEL HIS   PRESENCE.  NOT ONLY ARE THEY FEELING IT BUT I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE DREW   MCINTIRE WILL LEAVE WRESTLEMANIA WWE CHAMPION.  LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DOING? HE'S DOING THAT TO BROCK.  RIGHT? MA'AM, SIR?  ROBERTS, ROSENBURG?  IT'S BROCK LESNAR. CHARLY: AT LEAST HE GOT YOUR   NAME RIGHT.  YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT MAN. R-TRUTH: WHAT I'M SAYING IS  BROCK IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE -- HE  GOT HIS HANDS FULL.  DREW HAS BEEN RUNG THROUGH   EVERYTHING HERE. HE'S RUNNING THE HOUSE ONE.  JONATHAN: YOU'VE BEEN AROUND.  YOU KNOW.  ISN'T THAT THE WAY WRESTLEMANIA  IS SUPPOSED TO BE, YOUR BIGGEST  TEST ON THE BIGGEST STAGE? R-TRUTH: YEAH, BUT NOT WITH  LESNAR.  I'M JUST BEING HONEST WITH YOU.  IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT GAME. CHARLY: BUT YOU THINK IF ANYONE  CAN TAKE HIM DOWN, IT'S GOING TO BE DREW MCINTIRE?  R-TRUTH: I BELIEVE DREW RIGHT  NOW. DON'T Y'ALL? HE'S NOT SCARED. PETER: WE WEREN'T ABLE TO LINK   UP AT HOT 97.  CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE NEW  MUSIC YOU HAVE GOING ON. R-TRUTH: I HAVE A MILLION VIEWS  ON YOU-STAR. ALMOST A MILLION ON YOUTUBE. PETER: WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE  SONG?  R-TRUTH: \"SET IT OFF.\" SAM. PETER: PETER.  JUST HIT ME IN YOUR TEXT.  TEXT SAM ROBERTS AND I'LL GET  YOU ON.  JONATHAN: R-TRUTH, THANK YOU.  R-TRUTH: APPRECIATE IT, THANK  Y'ALL. JONATHAN: IF ANY OF YOU OUT HERE DID NOT KNOW, WRESTLEMANIA IS  NOT TONIGHT. IT'S A MONTH FROM NOW SO I   THOUGHT I'D CLEAR THAT UP. NOW, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AT  SUPER SHOWDOWN IT WAS ALL ABOUT  GOLDBERG AND PUTTING THE NEW   TITLE ON HIS SHOULDERS BUT THEN  ON \"SMACKDOWN\" LIVE TWO WEEKS  AGO IT WAS ALL ABOUT GOLDBERG  AND ROMAN REIGNS.  >> IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO'S NEXT!  \u266a I'M NEXT. JONATHAN: SO A MAN OF FEW WORDS  MADE IT VERY CLEAR AND YOU KNOW  GOLDBERG IS NOT BACKING DOWN   FROM THIS CHALLENGE AND ROMAN  REIGNS HAS MADE A CAREER OUT OF  BIG-TIME MOMENTS AT  WRESTLEMANIA.  PETER, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS  ONE-ON-ONE TITLE?  PETER: I'M EXCITED FOR ROMAN   REIGNS.  I'M EXCITED TO SEE HIM KNOCK   GOLDBERG'S BLOCK OFF.  I'M EXCITED FOR THIS MOMENT. YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING ROMAN REIGNS HAS BEEN THROUGH AND NOW  THE MOMENT HE HAS COMING UP FOUR WEEKS FROM TODAY, THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. I RESPECT GOLDBERG.  THE HISTORY IS THERE.  HIS NAME IS GOLDBERG, I'M  ROSENBERG, YOU KNOW I GOT LOVE   FOR GOLDBERG, RIGHT? BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THIS IS  ROMAN REIGNS' YARD.  HE CANNOT LOSE TO GOLDBERG AT  WRESTLEMANIA.  THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A PLACE THAT ROMAN   REIGNS HAS RUN FOR YEARS NOW SO  I THINK THIS IS A REALLY BIG   MOMENT FOR ROMAN AND I'M EXCITED FOR HIM AND I'LL BE HONEST, I'M  ROOTING FOR HIM TOO. DAVID: IT'S A HUGE MOMENT FOR  HIM. I KIND OF FEEL THE SAME WAY AS   YOU. I'M ROOTING FOR HIM THIS -- IN   THIS AS WELL.  HOWEVER, WE CAN'T LOOK PAST THE  FACT THAT GOLDBERG DEFEATED THE  FRIEND.  CHAL CHARLY: I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT.  DAVID: ME NEEVEMENT. ALREADY I KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THE MAN. IS JONATHAN: WHEN HE DID THIS TO BROCK LESNAR HE EXPLAINED WHY HE HAD TO DO IT SO QUICKLY. ON SOCIAL MEDIA HE SAID IF I   DON'T GET TO THEM QUICKLY AT   THIS POINT IN MY CAREER, I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. WHEN HE'S FAST WITH THE RIGHT  GAME PLAN IT WORKS OUT PRETTY  WELL FOR HIM.  ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST ROMAN REIGNS. LAST WEEK ON \"RAW\" WE HAD A  FEEL-GOOD MOMENT.  SOME NEWCOMERS THAT PEOPLE   ALREADY LOVED AND A LITTLE HELP  FROM KEVIN OWEN AND WE WOULD   HAVE NEW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS ON   \"RAW.\" DAVID, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THIS MATCH? DAVID: THIS WAS GREAT. HERE WE HAVE THE STREET PROFITS  ROLLING. SETH ROLLINS, STUNNER FOR YOU,   THANKS FOR COMING. MONTEZ FORD KNOWS WHAT TO DO.  HERE IT IS.  LOOK AT THE HEIGHT ON THAT.  PETER: WATCH THE REACTION FROM   BROOKLYN TOO.  I LOVED THIS MOMENT. JONATHAN: CLEARLY THE CROWD  LOVED IT.  CHARLY: LONG TIME COMING FOR   THAT.  JONATHAN: SO THE CELEBRATION WAS GREAT AND THEN THEY QUICKLY  REALIZED THAT WHEN YOU'RE  CHAMPION, YOU HAVE TO DEFEND   THOSE TITLES, RIGHT? SO IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT  AGAINST SETH ROLLINS AND MURPHY. IT COULD BE A VERY, VERY SHORT   LIVED TITLE REIGN IF THEY'RE NOT LASER FOCUSED HERE TONIGHT.  PETER, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS  MEET REMATCH?  PETER: FIRST OF ALL, PEOPLE WERE SO HIGHLIED IN BROOKLYN FOR THE  STREET PROFITS' WIN THEY LAD TO  TURN AROUND AND FIRE THE NETS'   COACH KENNY ATKINSON FOR NO  REASON YESTERDAY.  [LAUGHTER] SO APPARENTLY PEOPLE WERE VERY   HYPED UP BY STREET PROFITS.  MUCH LIKE I TALKED ABOUT   POTENTIAL DISTRACTIONS FOR A.J.  STYLES, I'M WORRIED ABOUT SETH   ROLLINS' DISTRACTION, TOO,   THINKING ABOUT KEVIN OWENS.  ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE   STREET PROFITS OBVIOUS OR ABOUT  K.O., WHO HAS ROLLINS FIRMLY IN  HIS CROSS HAIRS. CHARLY: I GOT A CHANCE TO TALK   TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR   LOSS ON \"RAW\" AND HE IS  EMOTIONALLY ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN I'VE SEEN HIM BEFORE  SO HOW IS THAT GOING TO PLAY   INTO TONIGHT'S MATCH?  DAVID: I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO PLAY.  IN SETH NEEDS TO BE LASER  FOCUSED BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE STREET  PROFITS. THEY'VE WORKED HARD AND LOOKED   GREAT CONSISTENTLY AND I THINK   THIS IS THEIR TIME.  THEY'VE MATCHED UP GREAT WITH  ROLLINS AND MEASURE BY THE EVERY TIME I'VE SEEN -- MURPHY EVERY   TIME I'VE SEEN THEM. I THINK THIS IS THEIR NIGHT. PETER: I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.  THESE GUYS SPENT FOUR OR FIVE  MONTHS BASICALLY HOSTING \"RAW\"   EVERY WEEK.  THEY GOT THEIR CHANCE TO SHINE   AND WENT TO BROOKLYN AND TOOK  ADVANTAGE. DAVID: THIS IS THEIR TIME. JONATHAN: BUT IT'S A COMPLETELY  DIFFERENT ANIMAL WHEN YOU'RE THE CHAMPIONS OR NOT.  TIME TO GET THINGS STARTED HERE  IN THE RING ON THE ELIMINATION   CHAMBER KICKOFF SHOW.  TOM PHILLIPS, THE KING, AND  BRYON SEXTON.  GENTLEMEN? TOM: TONIGHT, TWO ELIMINATION  CHAMBER MATCHES HERE, THE FIRST  TIME EVER. THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER  PAY-PER-VIEW EMANATES FROM THE   CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE.  FOUR CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES. TOM PHILLIPS, JERRY \"THE KING\"   LAWLER, AND BYRON SEXTON.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE  ELIMINATION CHAMBER TONIHT? JERRY: EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND BEING HERE IN PHILADELPHIA.  THESE ARE SO MANY SOME OF THE  CRAZIEST FANS IN THE NATION. ILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT  BECAUSE WHEN THESE FANS GET  GOING, THEY'LL GET THESE   ATHLETES ALL FIRED UP. TOM: ABOUT 189 MINUTES REMAINING UNTIL THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER  PAY-PER-VIEW BEGINS SCREAMING -- STREAMING LIVE ON THE WWE  NETWORK. WE'RE SET FOR OUR FIRST ACTION   OF THE EVENING.  JERRY: OH, BOY.  RING ANNOUNCER: THE FOLLOWING  CONTEST IS A TAG TEAM MATCH  SCHEDULED FOR ONE FALL.  INTRODUCING FIRST, AT A COMBINED WEIGHT OF 390 POUNDS, AARON AND  -- THE VIKING RAIDERS! TOM: BYRON, THE KICKOFF PANEL  WAS DISCUSSING THE REIGNING TAG  TEAM CHAMPIONS, THE STREET   PROFITS BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT  FORMER \"RAW\" TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS, YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE   VIKING RAIDERS.  BYRON: LOST \"RAW\" TAG TEAM TITLE BOUT ALMOST TWO MONTHS AGO AND   YOU KNOW A WIN TONIGHT WILL GET  THEM RIGHT BACK IN THE HUNT. TOM: ERIC AND AYBAR TWO OF THE   GROWING NUMBER OF SUPERSTARS   THAT CONTINUE TO STAND UP  AGAINST ROLLINS, MURPHY AND THE  A.O.P. JERRY: THANKS YEAH, THAT'S A BIG MEAFPBLGT RING ANNOUNCER: AND  THEIR OPPONENT, THE TEAM OF  HAWKINS AND ZACK RIDER?  TOM: AND ANOTHER TAG TEAM IN   RIDER AND HAWKINS. THIS TEAM WAS ON A TRAGIC LOSING STREAK FOR QUITE SOME TIME,  ESPECIALLY HAWKINS INDIVIDUALLY  THEN THEY GOT TO WRESTLEMANIA  LAST YEAR AND WON THE \"RAW\" TAG  TEAM TITLE, STUNNING THE WWE   UNIFORMS.  YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY,  ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN THIS TIME OF YEAR JA YEAR.  JERRY: YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE  BIGGEST UPTELLS -- UP WITH --  UPSETS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WWE LAST YEAR BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK  ABOUT THEIR MATCH AGAINST THE  VIKING RAIDERS?  BYRON: IT'S GOING TO BE TOUCH  BUT THEY'VE DEALT WITH THE   VALLEYS AND THIS IS A CHANCE TO  REACH THAT NEXT PEAK.  TOM: CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT'S   LIKE WITH THAT OMINOUS   ELIMINATION CHAMBER LOOMING OVER THE TOP OF THE RING? THIS IS ZACK RIDER AGAINST ERIC  OF THE VIKING RAIDERS. JERRY: THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN   BORN IN THE DARK AGES BECAUSE  THEY LOOK BAD IN THE LIGHT.  SCARY YES. BYRON: LOOK AT THE INTENSITY.  THE VIKINGS ONLY KNOW ONE SPEED. TOM: HAWKINS TAGS IN.  ALSO THE \"SMACKDOWN\" TAG TEAM  TITLES WILL BE DEFENDED INSIDE   THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER ITSELF.  BYRON: IF YOU'RE A SUPERSTAR AND KNOW WE'RE JUST MINUTES AWAY   FROM COMPETING INSIDE THAT   ELIMINATION CHAMBER, WHAT KIND   OF THOUGHTS, BUTTERFLIES DO YOU  THINK ARE FLOATING AROUND? TOM: HAWKINS.  JERRY: BYRON, I'VE BEEN AROUND   THIS BUSINESS FOR A LONG, LONG   TIME BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW   THINGS I'VE NEVER HAD THE  PLEASURE OF EXPERIENCING.  TOM: OH, AND HAWKINS SIGNALED TO RYDER, CAUSED A DISTRACTION AND  TRYING TO GET ONE UP ON THE  VIKING RAIDERS.  TOM: I'M SURPRISED TO SEE THIS   TABBLINGTIC FROM RYDER AND   HAWKINS. TOM: NECK BREAKER TO ERIK. KICKOUT. THIS IS NOT A TEAM THAT COMMONLY GOES BY THE RULES. BYRON: WE TALK ABOUT HOW RARE IT IS TO GET A TITLE OPPORTUNITIES  HERE IN THE WWE. SO IF YOU GET A CHANCE ON A  STAGE LIKE THIS, YOU MIGHT DO  SOME THINGS YOU NORMALLY   WOULDN'T.  JERRY: AND BOTH RYDER AND  HAWKINS HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR   WAY IN THE PAST TO FLY TRY TO  PLEASE THE FANS. BUT THAT DON'T WIN MATCHES. THIS IS WHAT WINS MATCHES. TOM: THIS TAG TEAM MATCH   CONTINUES. >> THESE SIX SUPERSTARS WILL   STEP INSIDE THE ELIMINATION  CHAMBER. THE LAST SUPERSTAR STANDING  FACES BECKY LYNCH FOR THE \"RAW\"  WOMEN'S TITLE AT WRESTLEMANIA. JERRY: THOSE SIX SUPERSTARS IN   THE RING AT THE SAME TIME, IT  WILL BE COMBUSTIBLE. >> I'M GOING TO CHOOSE EVERY   OTHER COMPETITOR IN THAT CAGE. >> I'LL BE WATCHING CLOSELY AND  ROOTING FOR YOU. >> AS ALWAYS, WWE NETWORK IS   FREE FOR NEW SUBSCRIBERS.  TOM: BACK HERE ON THE  ELIMINATION CHAMBER KICKOFF  SHOW.  LATER TONIGHT THE ELIMINATION  CHAMBER MATCH. WHO IS THE HUNGRIEST OF THE SIX  SUPERSTARS WHO WILL BE LOCKED  INSIDE THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER?  JERRY: I LOVE WHEN YOU USE THE   WORD HUNGRY AND WE HEARD SHAYNA  BASZLER SAY SHE'S GOING TO CHEW  THROUGH THE COMPETITION. THIS IS GOING TO BE SCARY. TOM: THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER   PAY-PER-VIEW BEGINS STREAMING  LIVE ON THE WWE NETWORK HERE IN  PHILADELPHIA AND A BIG RIGHT   HAND FROM ERIK.  HE HAS A CHANCE TO PICK A IT TO  IVAR.

AND THE ROUGH RYDER  INADVERTENTLY TO HAWKINS.  JERRY: THAT DID NOT WORK.  BYRON: IT'S ABOUT TO GET WORST,  GENTLEMEN. TOM: ERIK DRILLED HIM WITH A   KNEE STRIKE. THE VIKING EXPERIENCE. COVER. [BELL SOUNDS]  TOM: VACATIONING RAIDERS   VICTORIOUS.  RING ANNOUNCER: YOUR WINNERS,  THE VIKING RAIDERS!  JERRY: CERTAINLY NOT A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S WRESTLEMANIA   PERFORMANCE FROM HAWKINS AND   RYDER. TOM: THIS IS A CLEAR REMINDER TO THE ENTIRE \"RAW\" TAG TEAM  DIVISION THAT THE VIKING RAIDERS ARE STILL A THREAT.  JERRY: THIS KNEE STRIKE CHANGED  THE WHOLE THING. WATCH THIS.  TOM: AND LISTEN. OH!  RIGHT TO THE FACE. DOWN WENT RYDER. EHN ADVERTLY TOOK OUT HAWKINS  EARLIER. THAT GAVE A TWO-ON-ONE   OPPORTUNITY TO THE VIKING  RAIDERS AND THE VIKING   EXPERIENCE SPELLED THE END FOR   HAWKINS AND RYDER.

We're cooking the perfect Prime Rib Roast\nfor you and this Prime Rib is a 10-pound USDA Prime Dry-Aged Rib Roast from Lobel's of New\nYork. Y'all go check them out, lobels.com. And I'm going to show you how we're going to throw this together. Again, its going to be the perfect prime rib\nroast. Y'all stick around. I just to show you what we're working with. This is a five bone, approximately 10 pound,\ncheck out that nice marbling, USDA Prime and also dry-aged, you can see it's dry aged by\nthe way the outer skin looks, its gorgeous folks. And again, the butchers at Lobel's, they trim\nthe rib off and retied it because its best to cook with the rib meat with the ribs on\nthere if you can, it gives a lot better flavor. So let me show you what we're going to do\nwith this. I've got, let me back you out here, got the\nmirepoix here. You can use just a plain rack and sit the\nrib roast on the rack in your roasting pan or you can sit it on a bed of carrots, onion,\ncelery and that's what I've done here. And I put some garlic in there as well. So I'll transfer the rib roast right over\nhere, you want to put it fat side up. You want to add in about a 1/2 inch to a 1/3\ninch of liquid. I'm going to use some beef broth and a little\nbit of red wine but you can also use just beef broth or throw some water in there if\nyou like, just like so. A little red wine in there, Merlot or Cabernet\nSauvignon would work. It's going to give it a really nice flavor,\noh yeah really, really nice. When this is roasting you don't want to let\nthis pan run dry so if you need to add more liquid during the roasting process that's\nwhat you need to do. Alright, let me show you the next step. I'd get you a nice saucepan put it over a\nnice medium to medium-high heat. Got this nice extra virgin olive oil. Use the best olive oil that you can find,\nyou want to put about a quarter of a cup in there. And this is what we're going to baste\nonto the rib roast, that's probably good. I've got four cloves of garlic here. I'm just going to bruise them real quick,\nthere we go. I'm going to toss these into that oil and\nwe're just going to saute these a little bit until they start to turn a little bit of golden\nbrown. That's going to help infuse that oil with\na nice garlic flavor. Alright man this is really smelling good,\nits been a few minutes now, you can start to see some brown on the garlic, that's what\nwe're looking for. At this point you want to add a little bit\nof salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Turn the heat off and this is what we're going\nto brush on that roast. Take that olive oil that you just made, spoon\nthis or not spoon it but I guess you could spoon it, brush it all over the outside of\nthis roast and were going to let this roast sit out and come up to room temperature which\nyou know for, depending on the size of the roast you have is going to be two to four\nhours and this is a nice ten pound one so I am going to let this go for probably about three and a half, four hours. Alright everybody, its been three and a half\nhours, let me show you what we're going to work with here now. My oven is preheated to 450. I'm going on with some salt, this is a big\nhunk of meat so go ahead and salt it up really good, fresh cracked black pepper, and I've\ngot this Bittersweet Farms, this is a zesty garlicky type sauce, its kind of like, I mean\nnot sauce, herbs mixture blend. It's kind of like herbs de Provence I believe\nbut it's got a lot of garlic as you can see and this is also available at lobels.com if\nyou want some. Alright everybody my ovens again 450 Fahrenheit,\nI just popped that roast in there. We're going to let it go about 10 minutes\nuncovered and then we'll turn the oven down to 350 Fahrenheit and we're going to let it\nfinish cooking. Now generally you need to let it cook for\nabout 12 to 13 minutes per pound. This is a 10 pound roast, we're looking at\nabout 120 minutes to get it to a nice rare temp, which that's about 130 Fahrenheit internal\ntemp but you want to pull it about 5 degrees before it reaches that final internal temp\nthat you're wanting so I'm going to pull this one at about 125 Fahrenheit. Then we're going to tent it, let it rest for\nabout a good 20 - 30 minutes and it should come out nice, y'all stick around. Alright everybody, I pulled this roast out\nit hit 125 internal temp and it took right at 2 hours which we were expecting so I'm\ngoing to take it out of this. I'm going to put this over on this cutting\nboard. We're just going to tent this with some foil,\nwe're going to let this rest and all of this pan dripping we're going to make some nice\nau jus out of this. As you can see here I pulled out all my veggies\nhere, the mirepoix, and the reason I use the mirepoix instead of just using a plain rack,\nI like to have a little flavor in my au jus so carrots, onion, celery, that's good stuff. Its going to help really flavor this au jus. Now what I'm going to do I'm going to strain\nthis a little bit and separate the oil so I pour this, these pan drippings into this\nseparator which separates the fat from the rest of it and give us a couple of minutes,\nlet all those pan drippings separate. We'll be right back. Alright everybody, just bringing you back\nup to speed. This fat separator here, I'm left with the\nfat in here and I poured off the actual pan drippings without the fat so what I'm going\nto do is take, oh I don't know couple, two or three tablespoons of this fat, like that,\nI'm going to warm this up, I've got this over a nice medium-high flame, let this get kind\nof warm. Alright this is coming up to a little boil,\nwe're going to throw in a little bit of flour. Don't need a whole lot, maybe a teaspoon and\na half or so, a couple teaspoons. That should be good. What you want to do is mix this flour with\nthat fat and just let it cook for 2-3 minutes, kind of get that flour taste out and then\nwe're going to add those pan drippings. Alright everybody it's been a couple minutes\nor so, let's go ahead and start adding in these pan drippings here. And you want your au jus to be kind of thin,\nthat's the reason I didn't put a whole lot of roux in here or didn't make a large roux\nanyway. Just incorporate all this. Get a whisk if you need to. And I will bring you back here in a little\nbit. And its probably going to take about ten minutes\nand I'm going to slowly add more of these pan drippings as I need to. Alright as you can see my au jus is just starting\nto come up to a little boil. When it does that go ahead and turn the heat\noff and taste it. If it needs more salt and pepper or anything\nelse go ahead and add it at that point. Just let it cool off a little bit and you're\nready to serve it with your rib roast. Here's your rib roast. It's rested for about a half hour. I'm going to go ahead and flip it over. Again because this is a boned and tied rib\nroast, we need to cut the string off here. So just do this real quick. There we are. Now what you're left with is the bones that\nshould come free off of this roast. Just like that, there we go and then I need a little\nbit of help I think. Oh yeah, here we go, perfect. Now you can take these ribs, put them back\nin the oven and let them finish cooking and get tender. That's fabulous right there, beef ribs, its\ngood stuff so sit these off to the side. Flip this roast back over, pull all the string\noff. Let's see if we can cut some of this for you\njust to see what it looks like. Oh yeah, beautiful, beautiful. You can cut these as thick or as thin as you'd\nlike. Smells, perfect, smells absolutely fantastic\nfolks, my goodness I wish y'all were here. This is awesome, oh yeah perfect prime rib\nfolks. Check that out, isn't that gorgeous? Absolutely amazing, perfectly cooked. There you go, perfect, perfect, perfect. We're going to plate some of this up and we're\ngoing to give it a taste. This is our final plate folks. Y'all check it out, this gorgeous prime rib\nroast, took a slice of it and got some au jus homemade over the top of it, got a nice\nhorseradish sauce I made. Also Karen made some of these fingerling potatoes\nand some of the green beans and we used that butter infused or garlic infused butter for\nthe veggies here. This is gorgeous. I just must have to say this is absolutely\namazing. I'm going to go ahead and take me a little\nbit of this rib cap, this is my favorite part right here. I'm going to take some of this and we're fixing\nto taste this. Oh yeah, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Let's give this prime rib roast a try. I put a little bit of that horseradish sauce\non here and it's got that au jus on top of it and it smells fantastic. I wish y'all could smell this, oh my gosh. USDA Prime Dry-Aged, it doesn't get any better\nthan that. That is fabulous folks so tender, so juicy. Hope y'all go to lobels.com, give it a try. And folks if y'all like this y'all give me\na thumbs up and I hope you share this video and when you do, please tell all your friends\nthat T-ROY Cooks responsibly. We'll see y'all next time everybody.", "40o82o3uNfk": "in this video we're gonna talk about quartiles the deciles and percent house so what are they exactly quarts house divides the data into four equal parts what I like to think about is quarters for quarters adds up to one dollar now let's draw a number line and we're going to go from 0 to 100 but let's divide the number line into four equal parts so this is the first part second third and the fourth part this is q1 this is q2 and here we have q3 or the third quartile on the left this is the zero percentile the first quartile is the 25th percentile the second quartile is the 50th percentile and the third quartile is the 75th percentile and this goes up to 100% house divides the data into a hundred equal parts think of percentage 100 percent represents the total of everything q2 is basically the median of the entire data q1 is the median of the lower half of the data and q3 is the median of the upper half of the data now let's talk about des House des \u00eeles divide the data into 10 equal parts think of a decimeter a decimeter is basically once half of a meter which means that it takes 10 decimeters to equal one meter so when you hear the word deci think of @f so a Dessau is basically once half of the data so it takes 10 des \u00eeles to cover the entire data so let's break up this data into ten equal parts so this is going to be d1 this is D 0 D 2 D 3 is the third decile d 4 the fourth decile now q 2 is the same as d 5 and this is d6 d7 d 8 d 9 d 10 so what you need to know for instance is d 4 represents the 40th percentile in this example d 5 is the 50th percentile which is the same as the second quartile so we can write the percentage of valleys here so d1 is the 10th percentile d2 is the 20th percentile d3 is the 30th d 4 is the 40th d 6 is the 60th and so forth so d 9 will be the 90th percentile so now you can visually see how quartiles des \u00eeles and percentiles divide the data into different equal parts now what is the meaning of a percentile have you thought about that the 70th percentile for example is a data point where 70% of the entire data is less than or equal to the data point now it can also mean that 30% of the data is greater than or equal to the data point so what it will mean let's use the visual example so this would be zero this would be 70 and this would be a hundred so let's say if you took the SAT exam and your score ranks among the 70th percentile so your scores right here now 70% of students how to score that as equal to or less than your score so basically you scored better than 70% of the students who took the SAT at that time however 30% of the students who took the SAT did equal to or better than you did on the exam and so that's what the 70 percentile tells you it tells you that 70 percent of the data is less than the 70 percentile but thirty percent of the data is greater than this any of percentile or it could be equal to it as well so now you know the meaning behind a percentile now let's say if we have the numbers 2 3 5 7 8 10 11 13 15 16 and 19 how can we find a 3 quarts house in this list of numbers so what is the first second and third quartile the best thing to do is to find the second quarts offers the second quartile is basically the median of the entire data set and so let's find a middle number we can eliminate the first two and then the last June until we get the number in the middle which in this case is 10 so I'm going to get rid of the 10 I'm going to separate the data into two equal parts I'm going to put the 10 right here so 10 is our Q 2 value that is the median of the entire data set Q 1 is the median of the lower half of the data set so Q 1 is five as you could see five is the middle number of these five four numbers now what about Q 3 Q 3 is the median of the upper half of data set so the middle number is 15 so that is the third quartile now it turns out that there's another way in which we can calculate q1 q2 and q3 use in percentiles keep in mind q1 is basically the value of the 25th percentile to find the location of a percentile it's equal to K divided by a hundred times n plus 1 so n is basically the number of data items in your list or the number of numbers in the set K is basically the subscript so if you want to find the 25th percentile K is 25 so let's illustrate this with an example so let's find the location of the 25th percentile so it's gonna be 25 divided by 100 and there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 numbers in the list so n is 11 so let's get the answer what is 25 over a hundred a hundred divided by 25 is 4 so 25 divided by 100 is 1/4 and 11 plus 1 is 12 so we have 12 divided by 4 which is dream so what does this number tell us the 3 indicates that the first quartile is in the third position it's the third item from the left so this is the first item this is the second item this is the third item so the third number from the left is five which is our first quartile as we can see here and so that's how you supposed to use the formula now let's try another example let's calculate the second quartile so the second quartile is basically the fiftieth percentile which we know to be 10 so let's determine the location of the 50th percentile so it's K divided by 100 or 50 divided by 100 times n plus 1 so n is not going to change it's still 11 for this list so 50 divided by 100 that's basically point five or we could say it to run over to 11 plus 1 is 12 half of 12 is 6 so the second quartile is basically the sixth item from the left so this is the fourth item this is the fifth item that we can see here this is the sixth item which is 10 and so that is the second quartile if you wish to calculate the 3rd quartile and it's basically the 75th percentile which we know to be 15 so using the same formula we're gonna calculate the location of the 75th percentile so it's 75 over a hundred times 11 plus 175 over a hundred if you divide both numbers by 25 you could reduce it to three over four now twelve divided by four is three times the three on top that gives us nine so 3/4 of twelve is nine so the knife data point in this case is going to be 15 which is the third quartile let's try another example so this time we have an even number of items in his list so let's determine the first second and the third quartile so let's split the data into two equal parts so here we have eight numbers on the left and eight numbers on the right so this time the median is going to be the average of 15 and 16 if we add those two numbers and then divide by 2 this will give us the midpoint or the average of those numbers which is 15 point 5 so that is our second quartile now to find a first quartile we need to find the middle number of the numbers on the left now they're even so we're gonna split it here so that we have 4 on the Left 4 on the right so the median is going to be the average of 9 and 11 9 plus 11 is 20 divided by 2 that's 10 so 10 is the first quartile now let's split the data on the right into 2 equal parts and so the average of 19 and 20 is going to be nineteen point five nineteen point five is right in the middle of 19 and 20 so that's our third quartile now let's see if we can calculate that using the same process that we did before so let's calculate the location of the 25th percentile so it's K divided by 100 in which case K is 25 and there's 16 numbers in this list we have 4 4 4 and 4 so n is 16 so this is going to be 16 plus 1 so it's run 4th of 17 now 17 divided by 4 that is not going to give us a whole number in fact we're gonna get a decimal number so what is the 4.25 value well that's hard to tell when you get a situation like this you need to round up and down you need to look at the fourth value and the fifth value so this is the first second third fourth fifth value the fourth value is nine and the fifth value is eleven so if you average four and five it will give you ten I mean if you average nine and eleven it will give you ten and so this is the location well the location of the twenty-fifth percentile is this number but the value of the 25th percentile is 10 which is q1 so that's how you could use this formula to help get you this answer now let's use the same process to calculate q3 so q3 is the 75th percentile which has a value of nineteen point five so let's determine the location of the 75th percentile so it's 75 divided by 100 times 16 plus 1 so it's 3/4 of 17 17 times three divided by four is twelve point seven five so this is six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen so we can see that twelve point seven five is between these two numbers so it's gonna make sense to average them so when you get a number like this you need to identify the twelfth value which is nineteen in this case as we see here and the thirteenth of value which is twenty and so the 75th percentile is going to be the average of the 12th and the 13th value so we're gonna take nineteen and add it to 20 and then divide by 2 so we get 39 divided by 2 which is nineteen point five here's another example using this list of numbers let's say if we want to calculate the value of the six Dessau how can we do so the six decile is basically the 60th percentile and so first we need to calculate the location of the 60th percentile so it's gonna be 60 divided by 100 times 16 plus 1 so it's basically point six times 17 which is ten point two so the 60th percentile is going to be the average of the Tefnut and the eleventh number because 10 point two is between the tenth and the eleventh number and then we're going to divide it by two so the tenth value we could see at 16 and the eleventh value is 17 the midpoint between 16 and 17 is sixteen point five so this is the 60th percentile based on the data that we have here that is of course if we follow the same process as we've been doing however I'm inclined to think that the 60th percentile is based on the tenth value in the list well for one thing 10 is very close to ten point two and a 10 value in the list is 16 and here's why I'm inclined to think about it intuitively the second quartile is the 50th percentile the third quartile is the 75th percentile so it's clear to see that our answer should be somewhere in its region so 16 point five is not a bad estimate however if we split this in the middle the midpoint between 50 and 75 if you add them up and divide by 2 that should give you sixty two point five and 60 is to the left of sixty two point five which puts it more closer to 16 and then to 17 now granted the calculations will not be perfect because n is small but as you increase your n value as you increase the number of numbers in a list these calculations become more accurate so keep that in mind now there's something else that we can do with this list of numbers so far we talked about finding the value of a percentile for instance the value of the 50th percentile is fifteen point five but what if we're given the value how can we find the percentile that corresponds to that value so let's use let's use twelve for example now we know that 12 is between the twenty-fifth percentile and the 50th percentile would you say this is the 30th percentile the 40th percentile the 35th percentile what would you say well if we're going to Ballpark in the average between 25 and 50 is thirty seven point five so it makes sense that twelve is between the twenty-fifth percentile and the 37.5% but let's see if we can do some math to get the answer to find it you could use this formula it's X plus point five Y divided by n times 100 so what is X in this formula X is the number of numbers that is less than 12 so all these numbers are less than 12 so there's five numbers less than 12 thus X is 5 y is the number of times this number appears there's only one 12 so why it's gonna be 1 if there were two 12s Y would be 2 now n is the number of numbers in the list we know we have a total of 16 numbers we got 4 in each quadrant and then we're gonna multiply everything by 100 so this is basically 5.5 divided by 16 times 105.5 divided by 16 is 0.34 375 so times 100 this is 34 point 375 now let's Rob it then there's whole number so therefore we could say that the 34th percentile is equal to 12 or we could say that 12 is the 34th percentile and thus that is how we could find it and it makes sense because 34 is between 25 and 37 point 5 so that's a good approximation let's try another example what about the number 16 the knife data point in the list what is the percentile that corresponds to that number now we know it's going to be between 50 and 60 to 45 but feel free to pause the video and calculate the answer there's no need for me to retype that formula so P of what subscript number is equal to the first 16 that we see well first let's determine X X is the number of items that is less than this 16 value so notice that we have eight numbers to the left of this number so the x value is 8 now why is the number of times 16 appears because 16 is the number that we're focused on notice that there's two 16 in this case it's going to be two and it's still 16 and then times 100 so point 5 times 2 is 1 plus 8 that's not so this is going to be 9 over 16 times 100 and so this is going to be fifty six point two five and so we're going to round this 256 so 16 is the 56 percentile or we can say that the 56 percentile is equal to 16 now does this answer make sense well let's see 16 is between 50 and 62 point five and 56 is between 50 and 62 point five so saying that the first 16 is the 56 percentile is reasonable it makes sense based on the data that we see here now there's one more thing we need to talk about and that is the ability to make a cumulative relative frequency table and then to use it in order to calculate percentile values so let's work on this example let's create a cumulative relative frequency table and then let's calculate the fourth the seventh the third and the six deaths out the order so to make a cumulative relative frequency table we need four columns the first one will contain the value the second will be the frequency the third will be the relative frequency and the fourth column will contain the cumulative the relative frequency values so the lowest value in this list is two now how many times does 2 appear one two times so the frequency is 2 now the next highest value is a 3 so we have one two three four threes in this list now the next value in the list is 4 so we have one two three four x' analyst next up we don't have a five but the next number is a six and so there's only two sixes that I've counted now we do have a 7 only one of them the next number is a nine and there's one two three four five nines I'm gonna need some extra space here and then we have a ten it turns out we have two tenths and the last number is a 12 but there's only one 12 now our next step is to take the sum of the frequency column so 2 plus 4 is 6 plus 3 is 9 plus 2 is 11 and then 12 17 19 20 so this tells us that we have a total of 20 items in our list the next step is to calculate the relative frequency to do this take the frequency and divided by the total frequency when the total number of items two divided by 20 is point ten 4/20 that's gonna be point twenty three divided by 20 is point fifteen two divided by 20 is point ten one divided by 20 is point zero five five divided by 20 that's point two five and two over twenty point ten one over twenty s point zero five now if you add all of these numbers you should get one point zero zero which are marked in red now let's calculate the cumulative relative frequency so first we're going to start with this number point 10 and then we're going to add point 10 and the next relative frequency which is point 20 so this is going to give us a point 30 and then add point 30 plus a point 15 so that's going to be point four five and then add point forty five plus point ten so that's point fifty five and then adding those two this is going to be point sixty point sixty plus 0.25 that's point eight five and point eight five plus point ten that's point nine five and then the last one it's going to be one when you add point nine five and point zero five so that's how you can calculate the cumulative relative frequency now let's use it to calculate the deciles that we have listed here so let's start with the four two Dessau D for the fourth deaths are we know to be the 40th percentile the 40th percentile corresponds to a cumulative relative frequency of point four notice that point four is somewhere between point three and point four five so here is a question for you will the 40th percentile be equal to three or will it be equal to four or will it be equal to the average of three and four which one of these three options is correct now you need to understand that the 30th percentile it ends with the last three out of the four threes that we have here and it begins with the first four out of the three fours that we have here so if you want to find the 30th percentile exactly it's really the average of three and four however if you want to find a percentile that is between two cumulative relative frequency values it's going to be the higher of the two numbers for is between a percentile of 30 and 45 the value 6 is between a percentile of 0.45 and point 555 or 45 and 55 so the the knife value or the value of 9 is between the 60th percentile and the 85th percentile but if you want to find let's say the 85th percentile it is the average of 1910 and I'm gonna explain why and visually so you can see it so because the 40th percentile is between these two numbers it's going to be for the 30th percentile ends with 3 but it begins before so the 44 Center has to equal 4 now what about the seventh Dessau or the 70th percentile what is the value that corresponds to that so the 70th percentile has a cumulative relative frequency of 0.7 which is between point sixty and point 95 now keep in mind the 60th percentile ends with seven and begins with nine so the 70th percentile has to be one of the five nines that we have here so it's going to equal 9 now what about the third Dessau so that's the thirtieth percentile notice that we do have an exact value here accumulative relative frequency of point three zero so point three or the 30% ow it ends with the last three and it begins with the first four so in this case it's going to be the average of those two numbers so the thirtieth percentile will be three point five now what about the six Desa or the 60th percentile notice that we have that exact number in our chart or in our table so this is going to be the average of these two the 60th percentile ends with the last seven and starts with the first five so the average of seven and nine I meant to say it ends with the last seven but starts with the first nine so that's the average of those two numbers is going to be eight now let's confirm these answers let's see if we can make sense of it so we said that the fourth Dessel is for the seventh desam is nine the third desam is three point five and the six desam is eight now let's go ahead and put this list in increasing order you could also use the cumulative relative frequency table that we had to do this as well so if you go back to it we said that we had two twos and we had four threes and we had two sixes we had a seven and we have five nines and then we have two tenths and we have run 12 it looks like I'm missing something I'm missing the force so let's go back there were three fours and then we had two sixes one seven and then five nines and then there were two tens and a twelve so notice that I'm grouping everything in pairs because I have 20 numbers and I wanted to divide it into ten equal parts so you could see what the des \u00eeles are so this is gonna be the first SL this is the second third fourth fifth six seven eight nine ten and we could say this is zero so let's start with the fourth Dessau which we said was four so here's d4 notice to the left is the four and to the right it's a four so the fourth decile or the 40th percentile is four so because they were the same we didn't really have to average any numbers now let's talk about the seventh decimal so here's the seventh s out to the left we have a nine to the right we had a 9 so as we could see it's one of the five 9s that we have in our list so this answers accurate now the third Dessau is between two different numbers as we could see here it ends with the last three and it begins with the first four so that's we average three and four and get 3.5 now the situation is the same for the six Dessau as we could see it ends with the last seven and begins with the first line so it's the average of seven and nine given us eight so hopefully that makes sense and now you have a better understanding of quartiles deciles and percentiles and you know how to find them given a list of numbers thanks for watching", "4VNl7QXykUY": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] welcome back everybody it's a lovely evening out here in the Carolinas and I wanted to wait till the Sun went down a little bit before making this video because it was over on degrees here today so I didn't want to sweat horrifically in this video it's gonna be somewhat of a long video but basically what we're discussing here today is something that I think is it's very misunderstood frequently in the firearms world and we're talking about 300 blackout specifically as it relates to velocity and barrel length with different loads and then we also have some other issues that we're gonna address at the end I put it out to my viewers earlier today I said hey what do you guys wanna know about throwing a blackout I'm delving into it anyway so there's three things we're gonna discuss we're gonna discuss pressures in terms of like gas port sizes where the gas port should be like and those sorts of things if you're running a silencer how does that affect it that type of stuff pistol versus carbee I just said that twist rate how does that affect that why are certain rates still made and then also how does it compare out of a sort of a pistol braced AR in five five six versus 300 blackout so we're gonna address that I realize you guys probably see some reflections right now on the board that's because I have some lighting here to help illuminate us here because it is relatively low light but on your screen I will also roll in a very clear crystal clear screenshot of what all these numbers are here so we'll walk you through what we did if you guys aren't falling over on my B channel check it out if you guys want to see the actual test being done but what I did yesterday was I went out with five different 300 watt uppers so we had a I guess rifles - 7.5 inch caracal so we under black obvious they're all three hundred nine inch BCM ten-point three inch Daniel offense twelve point five inch BCM which is this little blaster right here and and also a 16-inch brownells barrel which a lot of people think oh why would you ever have this forget or blackout in 16-inch we're going to address that fear not and the rounds that we used we're 110 grain the real ammunition it's their Lehi controlled chaos load and then we went with some 125 grain a hornet ii american gunner I believe 300 blackout and then some 150 green Fiocchi just practice bulk ball stuff and some 220 grain guerrilla ammunition subsonics with this year bullet in there so I wanted to give a wide range of what 300 blackout has to offer because that's key that is one of the huge huge huge like stomp on foot things about throwing a blackout that makes it a very cool caliber is that you can just do so much with it without having to change your setup so it's very very versatile so what I want to talk about is when this was first released it was three and a whisper at first and then kind of as it became more standard I started the intro into industry rather it became three in a blackout it's really the same thing if you look at it but all the marketing literature out there at the time when I was introduced in a lot of it to this day unfortunately says things like beyond the nine inch barrel you don't gain anything with three owner black ops printer blackout is optimized for nine inch barrels we're in a blackout is optimized for short-barrel rifles all those sorts of things that's what people say about it people say there's no more powder burning after it goes nine inches past the chamber none of this is true all of that is wrong it may here's what I would say to that and well we will show you detailed examples of it here in just a second it Raider blackout can be very effective and I'm in a nine inch barrel that's what I will say it is not the best blank that it's not any of that stuff with few exceptions to that so to get into the chart again we had 100 110 grain so supersonic stuff coming out of the 7.5 inch Carrick I was at 200 and I robbed excuse me 2011 hundred eight feet per second i will not read all these to you rest assured and then out of the 16 inch barrel we're up around 2,400 ft/s now just to juxtapose that to kind of bring everything into context here for those oh no the 300 blackout is essentially a fattened five five six round to make it be able to shoot a 30 caliber bullet and something that a lot of people say is why don't you just go with 7.62 by 39 it's much cheaper you know there's ammo and rifles and stuff that have been out there forever that are proven at this point so why don't you just go with that so again just to look at this velocity here we're at 2400 feet per second and then we'll step ahead one second just to make this point 125 grand Hornady we're at 2,200 feet per second with random blackout so with wolf depending on the woods I've gone out over the years a tunnel out of 16-inch aks 16.5 in JK's I should say and depending on if it's hundred twenty-three Greene hundred twenty-four grain if it's haul point depending on what year it was made who knows I always get somewhere between 2300 and 2,400 ft/s so the point I want to make about that is if you look at similar bullet weights in 7.62 by 39 versus three in a blackout so hundred twenty-five grain here what you will see across the board regardless there may be an exception to this with weirdos specialized powder however commercially available those which you will see across the board is you will see a one to two hundred foot per second difference in those two rounds in a given barrel length again outside of really odd type of loadings that I that aren't commercially available at least not widely that will be the case across the board so does anyone ever say like if you look around and someone would be like yeah 7.62 by 39 is optimized for 9 inches beyond a nine inch barrel you won't get anything out of a 7.62 by 39 no no one says that cuz it's not true so the same thing applies here I just want to keep that in mind so again with 110 graders we gained 294 feet per second moving from the 7.5 up to the 16 inch over there so significant there in terms of foot-pounds of energy we gained 325 that's very significant it's huge that's a very large difference in terms of foot-pounds of energy now I want to talk about defensive use hunting use those sorts of things here real quick before moving on because it will become applicable as we go through this chart so many of you guys may know and if you don't we'll try to put a link down below for you guys to check out but if you look at any type of ballistic studies over the years whether it's you know as far back as around 1900 when the army was studying 4570 up until modern times today what you'll see is that pistol rounds wound differently than rifle rounds so pistol rounds is just way over generalizing generally wound by crushing tissue as it pushes through and any type of you know temporary stretch cavity things like that that you see that you may see in a gel test in terms of real-world damage on human size life forms it's really a moot point it doesn't really do anything for you however with rifles that is not the case rifles have a temporary stretch cavity which turns into a permanent damage area and that is significant it also has the at least in my belief I know it's debated out there but it also has the capability for hydrostatic shock so where does that happen what velocity range does that happening and if you do some research online you're gonna see differing numbers you're generally speaking according to people who know what they're doing and have actually researched this and seen a lot of real world experience generally speaking that number is going to be somewhere in terms of velocity between 1800 to 2300 feet per second most folks believe for normal carbine size or carbine size we will get into that here's I can do rounds somewhere it happens between 1800 to 2100 feet per second and it's gonna change right so if it's a large boat I got 45 70 you're likely to see those rifle wounding characteristics on the lower end start to kind of creep up and then you know like a 22 caliber 2 2 3 you really have to be on the higher end of that spectrum to see those wounding the rifle like wounding capabilities and if you don't know and you have done a lot of hunting shooting something with a rifle round is dramatically different from a pistol round obviously each rounds a little bit different but in general people who take you know two to three rounds to the chest with a rifle round don't get up and they drop really quickly and they don't do a whole lot of stuff between the time those rounds hit and the time they expire there's always exceptions to that but with pistol rounds you'll see if you guys aren't watching active self-protection go check it out you see people take you know center-mass hits frequently with pistols and do whatever they want for another 10 to 20 minutes sometimes even longer without needing medical care so there's a significant difference there and that velocity that temporary stretch cavity and the permanent wounding capability that rifle cartridges have that diatribe aside so that's why these numbers in terms of velocity are hugely important in terms of energy again it doesn't really translate however a lot of ballast ditions over the years will say that you tend to see rifle wounding capabilities and again it's not like it's not it's not a line it's it's a curve right so if you were to take for example this 110 grain round here and say you're getting 2,100 feet per second and then you put it up to 2800 feet per second out of a 20-inch barrel just hypothetically that that's going to be much more damaging it's gonna be delivering much more energy at you know there's 2800 feet per second so there's a scale there but you can still expect with this round here to see rifle wounding capabilities at least that muzzle distances where we were measuring it there so that's why those numbers are important in terms of energy where you start to see that in terms of ballast ditions a lot of them will say about 800 foot-pounds of energy is where you start to see those rifle like wounding capabilities so again the energy here will become important as we go along so however if you're looking for rifle wounding capabilities I put much more emphasis on velocity than I would on energy just pointing that out as well again 125 grain we're looking at at the max end 2200 again we already covered it but you're losing about less than 200 rounds dart 200 feet per second versus 7.62 by 39 the if you're looking for hunting or self-defense and you're okay with a supersonic crack this is where I would want to be in terms of velocity in terms of bullet weight those sorts of things in terms of the actual BC of the round being likely to tumble and or if the round is designed for it being likely to fragment I like the hundred and 225 grain rounds for you no home defense self-defense type of things with a later wait you also minimize the possibility of over penetration versus a heavier weight I know it seems counter intuitive to a lot of folks but trust me on that it's true so this is where I like to be my home defense we're gonna block out guns I'm okay with the supersonic track I will I will take the hearing hit I'll have hundred and ten grain ammo in there so that's not a not a coincidence there that I say that I believe it and my guns have it in it so again moving on to the hundred fifty grain Fiocchi stuff you can see there's not a whole lot of difference in terms of the sixteen inch and the seven inch seven half-inch you got 145 feet per second different same thing not a whole lot of energy difference as well I will say this for 300 blackout some of the least least efficient and turns up giving you bang for your buck whether that be downrange performance if you're trying to hit a target at 150 yards or 200 yards or whatever the case may be or if you're talking about self defense distances some of the least effective cartridges out there are the 147 and 150 grain loadings however those are probably the most common brainer blackout rounds that you see out there simply because those bullets are available in 308 and manufacturers just literally stick them and a 300 blackout case and call it a new cartridge so it for practice and stuff like that totally fine in fact almost all of what I use for practice with Breen or blackout is the hundred fifty grand fealty around but if we're talking about animals human beings whatever the case may be in stopping them from hurting you not the greatest choice in terms of weight there are some hunting rounds like federal makes it fusion around it's actually pretty darn good it's got a lot of penetration those like 20 22 inches of penetration but it's a good round just be aware of that though as you're keeping as you're thinking of throwing a blackout in general you move over to subsonic this is one of the things that makes 300 blackout such an awesome round this same rifle right here can shoot you know out at distance can reach out and touch something very easily with the right ammo at 300 yards and then can if you want to have subsonic capabilities to shoot stuff up close and personal to not wake your neighbors to not damage your hearing in a home defense type of situation of course if you're using this presser subsonic is awesome however I will tell you you lose a lot as you guys can see here so we have our velocity from the seven and a half at 953 feet per second and then 1,100 feet per second there with the 16 inch so something else to cover there is the speed of sound so if you're talking about you want to shoot a subsonic load and you can't have a our pistols where you live you can't have SB hours where you live or you just don't want to whatever and you want to go to the 16 inch barrel but you still want to be quiet you're gonna be right on the edge there 1,100 feet per second is gonna be on the edge of being subsonic for those don't know elevation humidity temperature all those things play a role in to the speed of sound so it's gonna depend on where you are I'd be much more comfortable with the 1027 range and anything below counting on it to be subsonic and also something that you're gonna see here which is a huge difference is the energy numbers here so out of the seven and a half inch barrel we're getting 444 foot-pounds of energy versus 1096 I'm a higher and really seeing a significant drop a 593 foot-pounds of energy with the subsonic versus fourteen hundred foot-pounds of energy with a 16-inch 1400 foot-pounds of energy is nothing to joke about guys that is a hard-hitting round and again we're talking about you know things that are this size that I am right here so that is really the gist of it in terms of barrel length again if you guys want to actually see the video go check it out it's up on my B channel you can see the entire process happening but I will tell you what do I think about it what would I go with again I already talked about that I like the 110 to 125 that's where I'm comfortable there's a lot of really good loads out there the one I use for those we're gonna ask is the guerilla ammunition it's the nozzle or barmageddon' round I believe it is it said nasty round I have a gel test of it on the channel you guys want to see hit but I feel very comfortable at that round and my home defense guns right now our BCM 9 inch SB ours however this little guy right here is in the running for for taking over one of those slots simply because I do like the additional energy that we get out of it there it's not insignificant so that is it in terms of velocity energy all those sorts of things again you guys should have seen this in detail rolled in here on your screen but I wanted to debunk this optimize for 9 inch crap because that's what it is it's it's it's bummed ignore it do not listen to it it is wrong so there is that we already talked about these issues here just some other questions that people asked I want to get into that as well so pressure silence there's gas box buffers this question actually came in from gentleman who runs the fit and fire channel if you guys aren't haven't checked him out interested in gun content and check it out yes he said I'm setting up a home defense AR pistol with a 10.5 inch barrel it's gonna be suppressed what do I need to do in terms of setting it up ie do I need adjustable gas box do I need a heavier buffer those sorts of things the answer to that is generally speaking no in terms of over gassing issues the reinter blackout is much much more forgiving than five five six just for instance this one right here I can roll in some footage of me shooting it and it has a carbine buffer in it right now and we're shooting the footage that you guys are seeing 150 grains so supersonic stuff and it's suppressed with a gemtech 300 cam out there in the end it's fine I don't see it being an issue there however if you have to or if you'd notice signs of over gassing first thing I would look at is upping that buffer weight it's just the simplest most fail proof way to do it I tend to avoid gas walks adjustable gas blocks as much as you can I have full video on that and check that out as well but I haven't heard of any scenarios where folks are running a suppress through inner blackout and they're having reliability issues again as long as they have a get h2 or h3 buffer if that's the thing if you're getting over gassing I've not heard of it being an issue I've not seen it being an issue I shoot you know literally thousands of rounds I throw in a blackout every year 95% of them suppress and I have not seen it as an issue so I would say generally speaking no test it out if anything drop h-2a h-2b buffer out there and you guys should be good to go with that pistol versus carbine gasoline system so this debate is very in terms of serene or blackout is very similar to the 18-inch five five six debates so a lot of people want to compare carbine and mid length and ARS I kind of think that's not really where we want to think about in terms of pressure changes throughout the system it's much closer to an 18-inch do we have a mid-length or do we have a rifle and gas system what I mean by that is regardless of where you're at so you only really see carbine like gas systems when we get out beyond 12-inch it three and a blackout but regardless of where that port is that whether it's at the pistol length spot or the carbon link the spot the size of the port really is what's going to matter most that's generally speaking true across the board for direct impingement guns however as if you build it into any forums and you guys are going to see I'm getting an 18-inch barrel should I get a mid-length or a rifle length people will talk about the pore pressures and all of those sorts of things and dwell time but everyone who knows they're talking about is basically gonna say both work fine as long as their port size is correct the same is gonna be true here if we're talking about carbine vs pistol length gas systems with random blackout again you only really see the carbines in the 12 to 16 inch barrel both of them work both of them are fine you're cool as long as the barrel manufacturer knows what they're doing in size the port correctly alright twist rate so I recently like last week as I'm filming this who knows when you guys are watching it did a video on this rifle right here which is our pistol I should say - 7.5 inch caracal we're gonna black out it has a one in five twist rate which is pretty radical for 300 black guy generally what you see today you know years ago you see a lot of 1 & 9 twist today generally what you see is 1 in 7 & 1 & 8 twists and every now and then you get weirdo companies like sig and Caracalla I don't mean that derogatory of to saying companies that are out there on the edge like care accountants take that are doing like one in five twists and stuff like that what I will tell you is that with that rifle I was pistol rather I was a little bit concerned that it might not stabilize supersonics well because that really fast twist rate I didn't see it at all it stabilized I'm fine in the actually testing that you guys saw for those of you guys that watch the video I will also say that I have a ton of one and eight I don't even Amin eight one and eight Brannon blackout uppers and I've read reports and get a ton of questions of people saying why would you ever use a 1/8 twist if it can't stabilize super subsonic ammunition I've never seen that I'm never I'm not saying it hasn't happened at certain altitudes with certain specific loads it's entirely possible that a wonder Nate may not stabilize some supersonic ammo sure I rather subsonic excuse me I say that correctly subsonic ammo due to the long o AO of the round I have never seen it in person so what I would say in terms of twist way true what do I recommend forth random black I would say 1 in 7 1 in 8 1 in 6 that's kind of where I feel comfortable the barrel length is gonna play into that as well in terms of stability those you guys I don't know there's some online stability calculators you can go online and plug your data in for your barrel your bullet your length of your barrel twist rate all that stuff and it will tell you how stable boat it will be roughly so check that out if you're concerned again I'd feel comfortable with anything 1 to 6 a one and eight twist rate for general purpose use the last question here is a total video well all of those actually are videos I could do full-length videos are on our questions I could do full-length videos on whether this one is definitely probably going to be a video one day but I wanted to quickly address it because I know it's gonna come up with time today in 2019 air pistols are all the rage right so everybody's got an air pistol I got like 10 of them so they're popular because obviously you don't have to deal with the NFA BS and a lot of states so the most common 4 5 5 6 for sure is going to be 10.5 now I have a whole video on air 15 barrel lengths 4 5 5 6 which is kind of similar to this but I will say I'm a huge fan of the 11.5 but 10.5 is the most popular so we're gonna address it right so if you were to get like let's say you're debating you're like should I get 300 blackout or should I get 5 5 6 I'm gonna 10.5 inch barrel take a look at the data here on this ten-point 3 inch daniel defense v 7 and you can kind of get an idea now what I will say is I just picked a at random something that's popular or something that's very well-documented and something that is a good self-defense hunting around etc the mark 2 1 2 mod 177 gram load out of a ten point five inch barrel and my youth I'm getting right around again depending on the day in the atmospherics 2,400 ft/s so you're getting 20 40 100 feet per second you were talking about in nine hundred seventy ish depending on the day foot-pounds of energy again we're gonna go over here and kind of check these two out rate that's obviously a supersonic ground so we're getting supersonic crack so you got to take that into account we're getting 2200 feet per second out of the 120 10 grain 1,900 feet per second 125 grain and our actual energy is dramatically more so again 970 ish for the five five six and that's a 77 grain so it's a heavy hitting round four five five six Energy's much higher for the 300 blackout supers that we have there so something to consider is it the end-all-be-all no but it is something to consider it another thing to consider that folks always want to know about obviously it's gonna be cost of ammo so five five six for practice stuff is definitely cheaper there's just the fish that jump behind me anyway five five six is definitely cheaper to practice with there's no getting around that in 2019 anyway that is the case just simply because of scale and just competition in the marketplace now if we're gonna black out has become much more I don't want the inexpensive cuz that's not the right word it has become less expensive over the last two or three years simply because the calibers being adopted much more widely and ammo companies can make more and take advantage of those efficiencies of scale by just reference with five five six generally speaking you can see three in a black out for about a 50 percent increase in price if you guys aren't following me on Facebook where I post a lot of ammo deals and stuff like that definitely follow me over there that's the place you're probably gonna find a lot of the best prices on the internet tell you the truth but it's definitely more expensive to practice with Rand or black out that said the majority of shooters out there I talk to a lot of you guys I go to a lot of gun shops those sorts of things that go to a lot of shows I interact a lot of folks the majority of gun owners don't fire a thousand rounds a year a lot of their guns so if that's the case does the extra cost really matter maybe you know that's so for you guys in your finances to decide but I would say for most people it's not a huge impact and I would go with around and the caliber that you think does what you want to do the best if what you want it to do is versatility and cost isn't a huge deal we're in a blackout all day long in my opinion if you want it to do some of these really cool things out here with the SuperSonics in terms of energy and relatively short barrels and cost is a factor I might want to look hit 7.62 by 39 it's a great round and again lots of proven proven bullets proven rifle systems pistol systems etc for those if but again if you want to be able to do all of that and have a really low back pressure and not be super gassy like five five six tends to be that's one thing I should point out as well so one thing just the way through and blackout works and into chamber pressures and all those sorts of things and the gas system pressures if you're very much gas to the face and a suppressed gun there's no question three no blackout is much less gassy if you're using a similar suppressor those sorts of things so if you want that type of capability again three in a blackout definitely wins over five five six all day and it also wins over 7.62 by 3 9 so that's pretty much it hopefully you guys learned something if there's more stuff you want to know about 300 blackout let me know I will do the work for you work up a video if you guys want to know if you want details on that five five six versus 300 blackout video I can do that too I think that's probably gonna be a frequently or a highly requested one but yeah hopefully we cleared up some of the stuff and the myths and misinformation that's out there about 300 blackout a nine-inch one especially I hate that one it's totally wrong don't believe it next time you hear somebody say it you're like oh do you not have to aim a shotgun inside a home to hit him either like he's the same dude the same dude that says I don't have to aim a shotgun for home defense is the same dudes it says if we're gonna black out is his optimized for nine-inch barrels anyway that's my rant that's my soapbox guys thanks for watching I truly appreciate if you're looking for good deals

found that you needed an envelope and you didn't have one well my name is Dana Johnson and I'm here to show you a very simple way to make your own envelope perhaps you have some pictures you want to send to your friends or family perhaps it you've made a greeting card and you need an envelope for it or perhaps there's that time that you've made the booboo on the envelope and you need to start over again it's very simple you need a piece of construction paper a ruler scissors pencil and anything to seal it you can use glue stick you can use an all-purpose glue or tape let's get started so you start out with a simple piece of construction paper place your greeting card just make a triangle here at the top place the greeting card down take your ruler draw yourself a nice straight line take the scissors cut along the line and you'll have the perfect shape to get started to make your envelope it's most important to start by folding in the smaller corners first and lo and behold you have the beginning of your envelope right here that past take two pieces of tape put it down here on the underneath side of your envelope place it down also to give a more professional look cut that off right there and we're just about done here with our finished product just need to lay your envelope down fold the final edge and a nice thing to use to close would be a little sticker and you just put the sticker on in your envelope is sealed and this is so much more cost efficient as well if you're doing these in bulk you can make these for up to fifty percent less than you would if you were

to it oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] guys so here's a little update guys on the vlog i actually really baked right now and i just ordered postmates right now i'm having del taco delivered so yes that's right instead of going gang food i just thought to myself you know what let's get on and let's just get some del taco all right so i got the five dollar box from del taco it comes with like a quesadilla a chicken burrito two chicken soft tacos and then a chicken quesadilla snacker thing or whatever and like just a bunch of food basically guys it's crazy i got like a tripler nacho and i got uh i got two brc burritos on the side as well those are ready to hit the spot as well so it's a ton of food for very cheap like 20 or whatever it's all costing me so i'm actually looking very forward to it hey what's up guys my delivery driver is arriving here in about one minute guys i'm getting del taco delivered so it's gonna be the bomb cannot wait he's so good we just got that eating right now guys i just dropped down all that del taco was so good that was the best i've had in a while to be honest like that was really good looks like i'm episode in the morning too but straight up oh yeah that was really good though guys really really good so all right guys well i'm nice and full now i'm just going to relax go get in bed here pretty soon so with that said make sure you guys leave this video

quarter of them agree so you need to work out what fraction of the marbles are red in order to do that you need to work out what fraction of blue and green in total so what would be the group the green and the blue so if we add the blue and the green marbles together we'll get the total of blue and green marbles so we need to add 1/3 and 1/4 and of course we can't add fractions with different denominators so we have to multiply this side by 4 it is our lowest common multiple and this side by 3 we'll be converting these fractions now into the first one will be 4 12 and the second one will be 3 12 so that's going to give us 7 12 so the amount of blue and green marbles that we have of 7 12 and the only other types of marbles we've got our red so that must mean that how many per what is the fraction of red well the fraction of red must be 1 minus the blue and the green because there are only those three different colors one can be written as 12 12 because we don't want to in just the number 1 so if we write 1 as 12 12 that's the whole fraction minus the 7 twelfths but with a blue and the green this has to give us the amount of red as a fraction the fraction of red will be 12 12 minus 7 12 subtracting fractions nice and easy with math we're counting in 12 so the denominator stays the same and we just do 12 minus 7 it's fine so we now know that these 15 red are actually five twelfths of the marbles are 15 we know that this fraction 512 is actually the number of marbles that we have which is 15 so what would 112 be if we divide by five would get what 1/12 would be 1/12 would be 15 over 5 which would be 3 so we now know that 1/12 of our marbles is 3 what would 12:12 to be that would be all our marbles would be 12 12 which would be the number that's 1 12 times 12 of course so it'd be 3 times 12 so we have 36 marbles in total are we sure we've done it right well we have a quick check here if we were to take a quarter of the marbles 36 divided by 4 that would give us 9 green marbles if we were to take 36 divided by 3 that would give us 12 blue marbles and if we've done that right and we add these numbers up 15 plus 12 would be 27 plus 9 would be 36 we'll get 36 which was the total that we got here so the nice thing about this system is it takes a little bit of while to work it out it's very structured it's very organized you're working out how many marbles are the blue and green as a total fraction subtract that fraction from 1 to work out how many are the red you know that 512 of the marbles are red work out what 1/12 is then and then you can work out the whole number of marbles so it takes a while but it's a problem-solving question it's supposed to take a little one", "GFGlgSfQ-Gk": "g'day and welcome to the techmath channel in this video what we're going to be having a look at is a way of adding two fractions together uh and then or subtracting two fractions from each other where we have different denominators different bottom numbers so i'll show you how to do this it's a really really simple method and this is the way i usually show my students at school it saves a lot of hassle so say for instance we have a fraction like this half and we want to add to that a third to do this really really simply this is what we do okay so hit equals and i'll put that line there what we do is this to get the bottom number first off what we do is we multiply these numbers so 2 times 3 is 6. pretty easy yeah and then what we do is we start at the top left here and we multiply this number by the diagonal here okay so it's diagonal bottom number here so 1 times 3 is 3. we use the same sign as a which is a plus then we go to the right number here at the top and we multiply this number by this number one times two is two okay equals three plus two is five and we've got the bottom number is a six and there you go we've got five six that's the easiest way of doing these okay so anyway i'll put another one up hopefully you got that one all right i'll get another another fraction what about we got something a bit different we'll go one quarter and i'll put what about something like two-thirds and that equals all right let's have a look i'll get this pen here and again we'll work out the bottom number we multiply these four times three is twelve we get this number here the top left and we multiply it by this number which is a three use the same sign multiply this number by this one okay 2 by 4 is 8. 8 plus 3 is 11 over 12. yeah you get that all right i reckon a few more examples because we'll go do a few subtraction ones in a minute also you'll notice with a few of these uh they're they're most simple um and so a couple of these you can simplify a bit further uh let's have a look we'll see if we can get one so what about if i add one half to three quarters hopefully this will work and what we do is again you might give this one a go before i start yeah you might have paused it and given it a go hopefully you did so what we do is we go two fours eight start at the left it's really important you start at the left by the way i'm not starting over here i'm always starting over here you'll notice one times four is four we use the plus three times two is six okay so four plus six is ten and then we get 10 8. now what you're going to notice first off is that we can simplify this further so let's do this first off we look for a number that goes into both of the top and the bottom and you'll see straight away that number is 2 so we divide the top by 2 we get 5 we divide the bottom by 2 we get 4. we can still simplify this this is the moment what we call an improper fraction we can turn into a proper into a mixed number that is and the way we do this is we go 5 divided by 4 because if this big this top number is bigger than the bottom number you can do this 5 divided by 4 is 1 and 1 left over we put that one over the bottom number which is four okay i reckon another one okay hopefully these are not a problem and hopefully you're picking them up really really easy i must say i've always wondered why they teach fractions really difficult difficult i often get a lot of students come in and they've done fractions three or four times in different in their school career and they still don't get it and it's actually a little bit annoying yeah so anyway i'll shut up and i'll keep going so what about we do uh three quarters and we multiply we're not going to multiply we're going to add that to a third all right what does that equal get the bottom number three fours twelve start up here three fours and nine we go plus one four is four we end up with 13 3 plus 4 is 9 plus 4 is 13 over 12. that we can simplify further because we have a this number here is bigger than this number and then so we divide 12 into 13 12 goes into 13 once one remainder one over twelve okay what about if we start with we could do the subtraction one okay what about that we do three quarters take away what about a third okay it's the same sort of thing and this is where it becomes really important that you start in a second in this top left in a little bit so first off we go 4 3's are 12. and this is where this becomes important you start over here 9 3's now 3 3's are 9 use the minus 1 4 is 4 9 take 4 is 5. this goes over 12. we have our answer now just one little variation on this by the way um i think this is a good thing to get but i might even um i won't be able to do this straight away but i'll put a link up to this and this is where i'll be looking at how to if we get a question that looks like this say we have something like one and a half and we add that to two and a third okay you notice now i'm not starting with simple fractions i'm starting with mixed numbers okay and we're going to be adding mixed numbers mixed numbers where we have a whole number and a fraction together so the way we deal with this is we have to turn these into what is known as improper fractions is is a fraction where the b the number on the top is bigger than the number on the bottom and the simplest way to do that is you get this number you times it by this number and you add to this number and that will give you the number on the top allow that again to get the number on the top this times this plus this so 1 times 2 is 2 plus 1 is 3. the bottom number stays the same the plus stays the same again same process 2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7 and then the bottom number stays the same and then we treat it like we were before okay bottom number what about we use red for this bottom number two threes six okay we do these ones three threes and nine we put the plus there seven twos are fourteen and then what we do is we add these guys together 23 and we put that over 6 now as you'll see again this number this is an improper fraction this number is bigger than this number so if we go 23 divided by 6 because this line here means divided by 23 divided by 6 goes 3 times because 3 6 is 18 we have 5 left over 5 and we put that over 6. i hope that was of some help anyway we'll uh see you next time", "JQJIWV1Yy8o": "hi everyone so we know that right now with the coronavirus in western washington there is a shortage of Purell and banana and I desert wipes and everything it seems like the source was all sold out so we decided to go ahead and give it a shot and try to make some homemade hand

I wasn't able to talk\nto him much today I know that he likes\naccessories and stuff I put a lot of effort into it It's Younghoon (An accurate prediction,\nJuyeon hands Younghoon his necklace) Younghoon Why didn't you talk to him today?

You have no shame (An embarrassed Hyunjae) I thought about Wakanda Forever\nthinking about Jacob A hero only focuses on one thing He's protective Jacob's similar in that sense\nSo, this is Wakanda Forever - I have a Wakanda item here\n- Jacob forever Thank you It suits you Jacob, yell out 'Wakanda Forever!' Let's go Wakanda Forever! Thank you There's a lot of problems\nNo, not problems I have a lot of questions He's always trying to learn I hope he continues to do so I hope he continues to\nexpress the fresh energy Both of you are fresh I hope he continues\nto have that energy Is it Haknyeon? It's Hwall (Finally, Haknyeon) The hat (YO excited) - It's pretty\n- It's really pretty How was it?\nDid you notice your manito? I was trying to find out\nall day but I couldn't I'm always thankful to this friend I have a lot of things\nto be sorry about With the hope that he recovers soon\nI made mine with squid legs Haknyeon put a lot of meaning into it It has a lot of meaning (I'm moved) Is this your fashion? Hwall is last Who's mine?\nWho's mine? He's, first of all Very cute all the time I can't hear you\nSay it once more He's very cute all the time Really?\nWho is it? I don't need to say it, right? I love you man (The cute BOYZ' friendship) (Thank you friend) Thank you (It suits you) I saw Hwall's and I really wanted it Thanks Everyone's necklace suits him\nIt has a certain style to it That's very interesting It's because it was made\nthinking about that person It's pretty It's very touching Today's the last shoot Let's have each person\nshare his thoughts New's going to give\na very inspirational speech Don't do it My eyes are already tearing up For us we never know when\nthe next shoot's going to be It's a job that requires us\nto be always prepared There are times when\nwe never get to rest The past few episodes felt like\nvacation during busy times It was a summer break\ninside a busy schedule I've gained a lot of confidence\nparticipating in these past episodes That confidence when you feel like\nyou can make noodles with a millstone I feel like making the noodles ourselves\nwas a memory never to forget When will we ever make\nsamgyetang ourselves again?

What really set this gun apart was not the fact that it\nwas small and light but the fact that it was really shootable and as a result by\n2015 over 1 million -- 1 million of these little babies and some various form or\nconfiguration were sold. Pretty awesome right? That's a pretty awesome thing and and it has been my carry gun for years now and I absolutely\nlove it, but what can you do to make something better, right?\nThat's what Smith is always asking and so when they looked at the 2.0 platform\nthey thought, hmm what can we do to a firearm that's going make it even better\naside from the normal things that we know and love about the Shield. And so\nhere you have it. Behold the new 2.0 Shield! Now the 2 major differences\nthat you will find with this particular gun over the 1.0 are 2 factors that\nshooters really really care about -- that's grip and trigger. Everything comes\ndown to these things when it comes to shootability. You know, these little guns\nare very, very capable this is not the type of firearm you're\ngoing to stand on the line at Camp Perry shooting bullseye at 50 yards. No. You\ncould. I mean, you could if you wanted to, but because this type of firearm and\ngenerally pocket pistols or concealed carry pistols have a shorter sight\nradius it makes a lot more difficult to see any errors in your sight picture so\nthat's not specifically what they're designed for. So the aspect that we\nreally care about in the concealed carry is how well we can hang on to that gun\nand how well we can squeeze the trigger to get a shot off quickly and accurately.\nThat's what it comes down to right and so that's what they focused on this\nShield. Let's talk about the trigger first. The original M 1.0 shield had, how can I\nsay this? A trigger that had a bit of roll to it. It was like.. kind of like\nmashed potatoes, a little mushy and a lot of people don't\nappreciate that new trigger. I myself enjoy a trigger with a lot of roll in it.\nIf you're a revolver shooter you probably like this a lot, but if you\nfocus a lot of your time on striker-fired pistols you are probably\ninfatuated with what everyone else is infatuated with at the moment -- which is\nthe reset. What we mean by reset... I'll show you clear, no magazines...\nTrigger reset means that as you squeeze the trigger it goes\nbang and instead of letting your trigger finger fly off the face of the trigger\nand squeezing again you're going to stop and reset it\nonly as far as it needs to go in order to make everything happen inside the\ntrigger mechanism, the sear and all that good stuff so that you can squeeze the\ntrigger again. It makes for a lot faster and sometimes smoother trigger pull for\na lot of people and this is how you can get really really fast\nrepetitive splits, shot to shot splits. A lot of people really like that. One of\nthe things that they didn't care so much about where the original M&P 1.0 Shield\nwas the fact that this reset wasn't as, it wasn't as easiest to detect and with\nthis new development, the engineers changed this M&P Shield trigger so that\nnow, not only can you feel this reset click you can also hear it so it's\ntactile and audible. The other feature about this particular trigger system is\nthat it's crisp that means the as you squeeze the\ntrigger you're going to feel that take-up and then you're gonna feel\ntension and instead of a lot of roll, a smooth like movement or\nsomething long, you're going to feel it break and that is a desirable trait for\na lot of shooters. They really like this style of trigger. They feel that they\nshoot it better and so with the 2.0 that is basically what they've done on the\ninternals so that it feels a lot like a lot of other striker fire guns and the\nguns that they're familiar with. The other main difference here is in grip\ntexture. This texture here is much more aggressive than on the original Shield\nit's not something that you'll notice so much to the eye, but it's definitely\nsomething you'll notice as you feel it What's great about this texturing is\nit not only fills the palmswell area but it's also on the front of the grip,\nthe front and as well as on the side panels. This allows you to have\ntexturing anywhere your skin is going to make contact with this grip. Very, very\nimportant because you want to be able to hang on to it. Now a lot of people they\nlike a smooth grip because they think it feels really good, but if you've ever had\nyour hands get wet or a little bit sweaty you'll notice that things slip\naround a bit. I even find this happens when my hands get cold. For some reason my skin seems to feel really smooth when it gets cold so that\ncombined with the fact that it's little harder to grip the gun makes it harder\nto get a good purchase but because of this texturing I not only feel it in the\nback but I feel it in the front where I can control it and also where my support\nhand meets the grip just like so. Very, very nice!\nSo grip and trigger are the two major stand out features. But wait, but wait\nthere's more! Not only do they make modifications to these two components of\nthe Shield platform they also make it available in a lot of different\nconfigurations so you can get this in 9mm and .40 cal as well as\nwith a thumb safety or without a thumb safety and if you hadn't noticed, this\nlittle red part right here on the gun, it also has an option where you can\npurchase it with an integrated Crimson Trace laser. This is really cool if\nyou're familiar with the M&P bodyguard series. This is something that you'll\nnotice. This is a really cool way to set up a laser and is one of my favorites\nbecause it's so easy to reach and being on the Shield it's just\nanother great option. Not only can you reach it with your trigger finger even\nif you've got short little stubby fingers like me that desperately need\nsome new nail polish, you can also reach it with your support hand thumb so you\nhave two possible ways that you can access this laser. It has a steady\nstream and then also a pulse so you have click it once for steady stream, a 2nd time for that pulsating stream & then click it one more time to turn it off. So\nif you're looking for a firearm with an integrated laser this is a great option.\nThere's also the option for those standard three dot sights or you can also upgrade to the night sight version as well. Again a lot\nof the same standard things that you know and love about the Shield, that Armonite finish, the fact that you get two magazines... I'll even show you those. In 9mm, you get a seven round magazine that is flush with the\nbottom of the gun. This is the way I personally carry it on my body because I\nwant the grip as short as possible and as you can see it's not a problem with\nmy short hands and then I use the 8 round magazine with the a little\nextender grip for my back up magazine but a lot of people find that they need\nthat additional little length because they have bigger paws than I do.\nSo lots of different options, lots of different configurations and again the\ntwo primary benefits to an already great gun is an improved trigger and of course\nthat grip texture all the way around! Love it right! Did I miss anything? I\nthink I got everything on there so let me know what you think about the new 2.0\nShield and if you're gonna go out and get one. If you had a Shield let me know\nwhat you like about it down below as well. If you have any interest in\nchecking out the new versions... You know one thing I was really curious about with this addition of the laser, I went ahead and took it,\nboth my old carry gun and my new carry gun, down stairs on my postal scale in my\noffice and little fun fact, on my scale both guns weighed exactly the same at 1\npound 2.6 ounces. Again I don't know my scales\nare calibrated right but they're equal They were the same and so I was curious\nif this additional laser would add a little weight to the end of the gun but\nit's absolutely same. The Shield is one of my absolute\nfavorite favorite carry guns out there and the reason being is that it just...  You\nknow, when you talk about a gun fitting your hand? Well this one, this one is just\nmagic for me. I have smaller hands & I feel like I can get such a good purchase on\nit and because you have an 18-degree grip angle, being that 1911 girl that I\nam at heart and starting out on the 1911 platform in that style of firearm,\nI really feel the ergonomics of this gun really work in my favor and so a lot of\ntimes with these smaller handguns, they tend to kick a little bit more, it's a little\nbit harder to line the sights because of that short sight radius, it's harder to\nbe accurate, the trigger might be a little bit too difficult and this this\ngun actually feels like it's shoots like a full size gun versus the actual\npackage that it's in so it's one of my absolute favorites. Will there be one\navailable without the laser Joel asks? Yes, there is there are lots of SKUs\navailable if you go to Smith & Wesson's website Smith-Wesson.com -- there's a\nhuge beautiful photo of the new Shields up there and there are lots of\ndifferent SKUs from no thumb safety to night sights to laser to thumb safety\nlots of different configurations so you can check it out in both 9mm\nand 40 calibers. Are current Shield magazines compatible? I believe so with\nthe other launch of the 2.0 platform with the new compact those magazines are compatible so I would imagine these are as well, but I will double check to make\nsure. I love my M&P 2.0 5 inch barrel as a range gun most accurate gun I own. Yes!\nCan't wait to get the Shield 2.0 for a carry option here. You're a 5 inch gun\nneeds a little friend! that's right! Can we expect to see a subcompact M 2.0? one of the things that S&W came out with last year when we talked about\ncoming out with a 2.0 platform is an extension of the lines I don't\nknow, I'm not in the secret squirrel part of the world so I\ndon't know exactly what's going on at Smith & Wesson in the engineering\ndepartment, but I do know that R&D is constantly in consideration so maybe\nwe'll just have to wait and see! When will they be available in stores? Jason, they are available now! They are available now. You can make orders for\nthem. One of the neat things about the recent launches that Smith has gone\nthrough is instead of the old classic hey, we have a new gun you can get it\nnext year, they're actually available so that's a really really cool thing and if\nfor some reason your dealer doesn't have one or doesn't know about them send them to the Smith webs ite, have them to talk to their distributor\nand get one in on order. So again, if you have any questions please leave them  in the comments section below. Have a great day and be safe and have fun! Later!!!  ", "AtBUQH8Tkqc": "In a previous video, we learned all about factoring whole numbers. And now we\u2019re gonna learn how factoring can help us when working with fractions. We\u2019re gonna learn how to simplify fractions. Simplifying a fraction means re-writing the fraction using the smallest top and bottom numbers we can without changing the value of the fraction. To help us understand what simplifying a fraction really means, let\u2019s take a look at the simplest fraction I can think of: 1 over 2 Now this is already as simple as it can possibly be. So, let\u2019s go the other way and \u2018complicate\u2019 it by dividing our rectangle here up into more parts. The amount of our rectangle that\u2019s shaded is still the same, but now the numbers for our fraction are 3 over 6. The numbers are bigger because our rectangle is now divided into more parts. The fraction we have now (3 over 6) is equivalent to our original fraction (1 over 2) That means they have the same value.  They represent the same amount. So what if someone gives you the fraction 3 over 6.  (Like three-sixths of a candy bar) Well we know from our picture, that means they\u2019re really giving you one-half. But how can we show that using math and not pictures? Well, that\u2019s where factoring comes in! Let\u2019s take our \u2018complicated\u2019 fraction (3 over 6) and factor both the top and bottom numbers. Now the bottom number (6) can be factored into 2 \u00d7 3. The top number (3) is a prime number.  Its only factors are \u20181\u2019 and itself, so we can write that as 1 \u00d7 3. There\u2026 we have re-written our fraction using factoring, and now it kinda looks like two fractions being multiplied together: (1 over 2) times (3 over 3) Of course, 3 over 3 is what I like to call a \u201cwhole fraction\u201d since its value is equal to 1. Now here\u2019s the interesting part... Since 3 over 3 equals 1, and multiplying by 1 has no effect on a number, we can just get rid of that 3 over 3. Basically, the 3 on the top and the 3 on the bottom cancel each other out. And once they\u2019re gone, we\u2019re left with the fraction: 1 over 2. So that means that the fraction 3 over 6 simplifies to 1 over 2. Another way of thinking about it is that we\u2019re trying to find any whole fractions that are \u2018hiding\u2019 in the fraction we are trying to simplify. And if we find any, we can just get rid of them and the fraction we\u2019re left with is simpler than what we started with. Now that we know the basics, let\u2019s learn the procedure for simplifying fractions. First:  Replace the top and bottom numbers of the fraction with their prime factors. Next:  Look to see if any of the factors are the same on the top and bottom. If they are, we call them \u201ccommon factors\u201d because they\u2019re something that both the top and bottom have in common. If you find a pair of common factors, you can cancel them out.  Just draw a line through them like this. And Last:  Once all the common factors have been canceled, you need to re-multiply any factors that are left over on the top or bottom. This makes sure that you end up with only one number on the top and bottom of your simplified fraction. Oh\u2026 and there\u2019s one important thing to remember. If you\u2019re ever able to cancel out ALL of the factors on the top or bottom of a fraction, don\u2019t be tempted to write in a zero.  Put a \u20181\u2019 in there instead! The reason you can write in a \u20181\u2019 is because \u20181\u2019 is ALWAYS a factor of ANY number. It\u2019s just we usually  don\u2019t write it in. For instance, if you\u2019re gonna factor the number 15, you just say that it\u2019s 5 \u00d7 3. But you could also say that it\u2019s 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1. In fact, you could even say it\u2019s 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1\u2026.. \u2026see why there\u2019s always a \u20181\u2019 left over when you\u2019re canceling common factors? Alright, so that\u2019s the basic idea behind simplifying fractions. And once you know the procedure, it\u2019s really not that hard. But you might want to re-watch this video just to make sure you\u2019ve got the idea. Now there aren\u2019t any exercises for this video cuz it\u2019s really just an introduction. But in Part 2, we\u2019ll see a couple more examples of how you can use the procedure to simplify fractions, and then you\u2019ll get plenty of exercises to do as homework.  [cheering] Oh yeah! Welcome to Part 2 of Simplifying Fractions.  In Part 1, we learned the procedure for simplifying fractions. Basically, you just take the top and bottom numbers and factor them down to their prime factors. And then you see if there\u2019s any factors that are the same on the top and bottom. We call those \u201ccommon factors\u201d.  And if there are, you just cancel them out. And once you\u2019ve canceled out all the common factors, you re-multiply whatever is left over to get your final answer. In this video we\u2019re gonna see a couple examples of how we can use that procedure to simplify fractions. Let\u2019s start with an easy one.  Let\u2019s simplify the fraction: 5 over 15. Step 1 is to factor the top and bottom numbers, so\u2026 We know that 15 factors into 5 \u00d7 3 And 5 is a prime number. That means its only factors are \u20181\u2019 and itself. But \u20181\u2019 is always a factor, so we don\u2019t need to write that down. Step 2 is to look for common factors and cancel them. And we can see that there\u2019s a 5 on the top and there\u2019s a 5 on the bottom. They\u2019re not directly over each other, but that doesn\u2019t matter. They still form a common factor pair, so we can cancel them out like this. Step 3 is to re-organize our answer. Now we don\u2019t have any factors that need to be re-combined by multiplying. We just have a 3 on the bottom, and we don\u2019t have any factors left over on top. But you\u2019ll remember that there\u2019s always a factor of \u20181\u2019. So, 5 over 15 simplifies to one-third. Alright, I think we need to see another example, but a harder one this time. Let\u2019s simplify the fraction 30 over 36. The procedure is the same: Step 1 is we factor the top and bottom numbers all the way down to their prime factors. Let\u2019s do the top number first:  30 factors into 5 \u00d7 6. 5 is prime, but 6 can be factored into 2 \u00d7 3. So our 30 on top becomes 5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3. Now the bottom number\u2026 36 can be factored into 6 \u00d7 6.  And each of those sixes can be factored into 2 \u00d7 3. So our bottom number becomes 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3. Well, it looks like we do have some common factors. There\u2019s a 2 on both the top and the bottom that will cancel each other out. And even though there\u2019s more than one \u20182\u2019 on the bottom, we can only cancel one of them out because there\u2019s only one \u20182\u2019 on top. Remember, you always have to cancel common factors as pairs. Now we can see that there\u2019s another pair we can cancel. The there\u2019s a \u20183\u2019 on both the top and bottom, so we can just cross those out. Okay, that\u2019s all the common factors we can cancel.  So now all we have to do is see what\u2019s left over. We\u2019ve got a \u20185\u2019 on the top and a \u20182 \u00d7 3\u2019 on the bottom. We don\u2019t want to leave our problem looking like this, so we need to re-combine any factors that didn\u2019t cancel. \u2026that means multiplying together our 2 and 3 on the bottom, which gives us 6. There, we\u2019re left with the fraction 5 over 6.  That\u2019s the simplified form of the fraction 30 over 36. They both have the same value, but the simplified one is written using the smallest numbers possible. Now some of you may have been taught that the way to simplify fractions is to find the greatest common factor of the top and bottom numbers, and just cancel that. Basically, that\u2019s what we ARE doing when cancel all of the common factors using our procedure. In fact, if you multiply all of the common factors together, you\u2019ll get the greatest common factor\u2026 or GCF as I like to call it.  Ya know\u2026 to sound cool\u2026 Alright, so that\u2019s how you simplify fractions.  But, I\u2019ll bet some of you are wondering, \u201cWhy would we even want to simplify fractions?\u201d That\u2019s a good question.  Basically it\u2019s to make life simpler! Well\u2026 at least for your teacher who has to grade all your homework. For you it just makes life more complicated! No, just kidding! [laughter] Simplified fractions make YOUR life easier too! Cuz usually, simplified fractions are much easier to work with. For example, if your friend said to you, \u201cHere, you can have 27/54 of my sandwich.\u201d it would have been much easier if they had just said that you could have 1/2 of their sandwich, since 1/2 is the simplified form of 27/54. So now, whenever you see a fraction you can ask yourself, \u201cHmmm\u2026 could that be any simpler?\u201d And if so, you\u2019ll know just what to do! So get on out there, work on those exercises, and start making the world a simpler place for us all!

automatically corrected to show a fraction the same is true if you were to type in say 3 / 4 3 quarters but if you want to type something that's a little different say 7-elevens it doesn't update it doesn't show that as a fraction in the same way but it is possible to show fractions in Microsoft Word such as these two here custom fractions how do you do that in this short video I'll show you how you do that so to insert a custom fraction the first thing we need to do is head to the insert tab here once you've gone to insert go right the way to the right hand side and you'll find the equation button click on a little pie symbol the top here and that'll bring up a new toolbar which possibly you've never seen before with a whole load of interesting symbols and features that you can use we'll use the fraction button which is just here in the middle and if we click on that you'll see a drop-down list of different fraction types so for example here we have the stacked fraction and if I click on that what happens is it brings up this form that it has if you like two text boxes one at the top and one at the bottom if I click on the one at the top I can type in whatever my top number is and then I can click underneath and click on that little dotted square type in whatever the second number will be the bottom number and that's it once I've clicked on that I'm done and I can start now writing the rest of my document with that fraction night nicely vertically aligned centrally to the line of text I'm using so that's how to write a fraction that stacked a vertical one we can see that the process for skewed fraction is just the same so we go to insert equation and then I can click on this fraction tab in the middle and choose let's say the skewed fraction here the second option click on that and again I simply type in whatever my top number is type in there once I click on that gray square the bottom what my bottom number is and that's it job done I now have my skewed fraction and you have some options here as well for example if I click on this right hand menu drop down menu here I can change the display I can change the different appearances so I can change that to inline professional and so forth so you can change the alignment you can change that a little bit you can also if you click on this form here and you click on this button at the top left little tab with three dots in it and you can select the whole fraction and then you can change certain things to do with the text formatting such as the font size and the font color and the alignment so that's

show you how to brew noit's and onion a brunoise x' is a classical French term that basically describes a really tiny dice a lot of times these are utilized for garnishes sometimes they're utilized in cooking processes but if you wind up cooking it for a really long period of time they will just basically start to lose their shape so for a lot of instances in restaurants for example you wind up seeing a brunoise x' maybe just sprinkled on a plate as a little garnish or it like in a salad with the with an instance of something like an onion I have an onion here that I've already peeled I've cut it in half and with an onion that's this large I'll often cut a brunoise x' by even separating the onion up a little bit I'm going to take out some of the interior sections and actually utilize maybe one or two of these of this outer layer here fact let's just go ahead and I'm just going to work with this outer layer I'm going to cut off the root of the onion peel off the first layer of it and I'm going to cut this in half then I'll actually take this little layer and I'm going to lay it on out onto my cutting board even press it on out to flatten it a little bit and then make a really I guess perfect or as close to perfect as you can Renoir's I'm going to cut off these rounded edges my middle ring and pinky finger are going to go around the handle of the blade knife a thumb and forefinger around the back I'm going to take my hand and curl it curl my fingertips underneath and cut off this little rounded edge of the onion this little rounded edge as well and then I could get this onion to lay nice and flat I'm going to cut some strips out of it I can take these strips gather them up as many is uncomfortable and handling we're really looking to get them really nice and pristine go ahead and use just grab a few line them up with the edge of my knife then I'm going to take the tip of my knife the front part of the blade and keep it in contact with a cutting board and cut with the back part of the blade my fingertips are still going to hold on to the onion with my fingertips curled underneath start to cut across and some really nice uniform dices that is what we call a broom logs and these would be great sprinkled in a salad mixed into ground beef to make to flavor up a hamburger or a meatloaf or sprinkled into a sauce since the really small size are not going to require a long cooking time and that is how you Boone logs and onions thanks again for watching be sure to subscribe so you can get some additional information if there's a recipe that you

to the 8 quart foodie all while having a whole lot of fun hey guys welcome back to my kitchen and 2:30 Friday oh no I'm Chris from recipes at crapcom I the monkey from recipes that crock don't call and so on Fridays here on our YouTube channel we like to talk about the foodie because we know several of you have got it or you at least like to hear about it and so one of the questions we get all the time is what's the differences between the 8 quart foodie and the six and a half quart foodie and so since we recently got the 8 quart foodie and we shared that with you guys a couple weeks ago we thought we would start to show you some of the differences in similarities and I will tell you right out of the gate the things I thought were going to be different weren't different the way that I thought they were and there were a lot of things that aren't as different as I thought they were going to be so let's just dig in what do you say ok so first of all when you look at these guys right next to each other I was kind of surprised that the 8 quart didn't feel as didn't feel huge compared to no it's I don't know more giant and it's not and actually it is just a little bit taller but we'll talk about this more but from a width size I'm fairly confident this sucker is the same width as the six and a half quart could you my muscley man lift them and tell me like the weight differences that it feels like all right these just have I think all they have is the they just have the bowl in right that would be okay so lift it and see what you think okay okay so that's the one we've been lugging around all of the nation in the heartbeat this thing has been used more than most people will use it into you and in the eight fort I just was really shocking there lady it doesn't feel that much heavier no it does not so like because one of the things I was considering for the next time we go out and the RV is do I really want this thing's the Beast do I really want something heavier just to have a higher capacity and honestly I was like really surprised that the 8 quart doesn't feel that much bulkier than six and a half so that was like okay that's that was interesting now to some other kind of really oh here's something that's very similar since they are the same with the pressure cooker lids I believe are the same size exactly well I don't have them lined up I got it okay they're the same size they're the exact same way so that means that they're gaskets and those kinds of things could be interchangeable um you can tell which one goes with this one because it's a little yellow because we've used all your own and this is the new one so I found that to be interesting because I thought oh I'm gonna have to keep track of my lid and all that kind of stuff and now but okay so now let's go to some of the differences the pot the way that you get eight quarts out of the eight core versus six and a half in the height so instead of being wider it's taller so this one has a max of twenty four cups or right above twenty it looks like maybe what 26 cup and this one is a max of 20 so when you compare those your whorehouse yeah when you compare the bowl side-by-side you can see that while they're the same width this one's slightly taller make sure that here they are it's the exact same width as yes so you've got that going on by the way another difference this one looks really good this one's scratched all the pieces because we're still waiting on our replacement we did get notification we were still in Texas when we ordered this like weeks ago ordered the pots and that I just got notification today that they are shipping my pots so I'm very excited about spam was five weeks so like five or six weeks because I ordered it I ordered it to ship to Aunt Lucy's house because I knew we weren't gonna be home when it came so anyhow well no yeah I've been for a while yeah ginger thanks a lot so something that's very very interesting originally I thought oh well my my basket that goes in the 8 quarts gonna be wider well because the bowls are all the same size width wise they're not wider I didn't so I then I thought oh they're the same but no this little guy that is very handy and probably the thing I use the most with both of my foodies is a little bit taller just like barely a little bit taller for for the 8 quart then it is you can see you're looking at maybe maybe what is that maybe a half inch not even maybe a quarter inch taller so not much difference there yeah so that's one slight difference now comes the big big difference and it's way different than I thought where did you do with this guy okay so what did I do with it it's always what yeah one of the reasons I was interested in the 8 quart was because I really like the air fryer feature on the foodie and I find any air fryer that I use doesn't have as large of a capacity as what I would like for it to I always feel like I'm cooking in batches and batches and batches and batches and so I was really interested in having a bigger air fryer in the foodie because I love the foodie air fryer so much well as you can see it did it in a different way than I thought it was going to it made it taller not wider which is an interesting concept when it comes to air frying because the heat from your air fryer is coming from up here so just making it taller sometimes doesn't make even cooking as easily done on a taller thing that it would a wider thing so I was concerned about that there's solution to all of this is this little guy which doesn't come with the six and a half quart and it shows down in here do you want to show them sure it goes down in here to give you a whole nother level of surface area for the air to rotate around I have tested this primarily with bacon and to good results better results than one I thought because I've tried hanging my bacon in my six and a half quart like a lot of people talked about and I just don't like that I feel like it it unevenly cooks it when you hang it versus lay it on so I tried bacon in here and stacking both shelves I've tried it with putting this sucker down like this and putting this guy up like this and doing bacon like this and you can cook a whole pack of bacon like yeah you can cut the whole baking but it won't be the same it but I will say you can't get it there because what happens is what I would normally do is do half a pack of bacon on this this bottom rack cook it all the way through and then do another half pack of bacon in this I can put a full package of bacon in cook it like I normally do and the top is definitely done and I remove the top and put the bottom on for another two or three minutes and then it gets there so it is saving time and I do like that it's just cooking a little bit different than what I'm used to but I do find it useful and I am impressed with that I was the look I was honestly a lot concerned I'm like oh well my ear for a basket really they can get all that bigger it just got taller and that it is it's allowing me to cook more food I just sometimes have to let the bottom layer cook a little bit longer one of the main concerns that I've heard from folks is whenever the 8 quart first came out people there was some issues with the fan we had heard from some crock-pot see members of weight don't buy your a quart yet because people are returning theirs because of their fan I will say I haven't had issues except for I will tell you I have noticed that I feel like the 8 quart is a little noisier than the six and a half quart now that could be that those are our units that you know that's just what ours does and that means that may not be everyone's experience but for our experience I have noticed it's a little bit louder they have my six and a half quart but for the most part I think it's doing just fine I haven't had any kind of alarming fan sounds come from it I've only had it for a few weeks but in those two weeks we've had it we've used it quite an intact this one's been a little neglected because we've been using that one so much I told Mike I said I bet it's wondering what is going on because we used it every day multiple times a day the entire time we were out and we got this one shortly when they got home so between using the foodie and getting reacquainted reacquainted with my oven back there I really have neglected my six and a half quart but those are just the primary differences from a pressure cooking standpoint it's your typical differences that you would find between any larger pressure cooker and smaller pressure cooker so a larger pressure cooker is going to possibly take more liquid to come to pressure than a smaller electric pressure cookers so I would say if I use a cup of liquid in this guy I typically bump it up to a cup and a half of liquid in this guy just to kind of get it up to pressure and and do its thing I haven't really noticed a lot of differences from the time I have it timed it but I personally haven't been like geez come on get up to pressure it's just that it's staying and I'm enjoying it I have not tested the slow cook feature in this one I have in this one and we pretty much we like it it's like if I'm gonna slow cook something I'm not I don't usually ever really go for an electric pressure cooker that's just not my thing because they cook so much slower than a traditional slow cooker does however in a pinch or if I wanted something to take longer in cooking I would grab these I think the slow cook feature works decently I would say even maybe just a little bit better than my instant pot slow cook feature that's just my limited perspective from the few times that I have used them as slow cookers but I haven't tested an 8 quart it's really not a top priority because we have so many slow cookers but if you are considering buying this as a replacement for everything just know whichever bottle you go with that the slow cook feature will take a little bit like if it's a recipe that calls for 6 to 8 hours to cook it probably is gonna take me 8 hours but those are just some of our initial thoughts of the differences people been asking pros and cons you know I think it just depends on what your personal preferences are and what you want to be able to cook and how you want to be able to cook I'm glad that we have them both so you test those those those sizes and all that kind of thing I will tell you that I really really wish and Mikey said this many many times like my only hold back on the foodie now is that I really really wish that we could get a stainless steel pot for that yeah because I'm so scared that we're going to scratch your ear you should have heard the conversation you know it's one of those where I like the fact that the ceramic coating on there doesn't make it nonstick so whenever you make something clean up really is a lot quicker because it usually just wipes off this one's get a little harder to clean now because this ceramic has worn off so much my bad but I mean if it was a stainless steel pot I think you could still make the same dishes in there you're just gonna have to use a little more scrubbing yeah I was think somebody was asking me about the stainless steel pots this week and I was just sharing that I don't really when we do use our instant pot and I don't really ever have trouble with stuck on food because you can throw the pot and the dishwasher if you want if anything ever does get stuck I oftentimes use Barkeeper's friends that stuff is well your friends well are we just using it to clean off one of those things yes I use this stuff all the time and it makes that stuff come off really really easy and so I don't really have like the nonstick is a con for me versus a pro that I think that the what they're intending I get what they're trying to do and I also from my perspective like I realized that we're using these like every day in a way that a traditional family wouldn't necessarily use all the time if you go to twice a month well or they might really enjoy it but I mean we heavily use ours because we want to test recipes for you guys and share it with you guys and telling you run it through its paces and tell you what we really really think so I think that we do really really work hard on them so do you know that as you listen to us but that's my only thing I really love the accessories that they do go ahead and give you in in the package with your units I find them extremely useful and I will tell you this sucker I use for air frying and broiling even more than I use these things so much so that basket will use that for like if we're doing Brussels sprout that yeah I'm doing bacon it's that straight done in the right that's what we do and I'll tell you it's so funny as we haven't used this ones basket in so long like since we've gotten home we couldn't find it for this video we were like where is it and it was packed away in a cabinet a big RV that we had to go get but if you guys have any questions about the foodies we'd love to I'm not sure that we can answer them but we would love to share whatever we've learned over over the course of the time that we've had them we absolutely love cooking with them we're hoping to be nekked back next week with some recipes we've been a little bit under the weather around here so kind of just ain't been much kissing in this house this week one of the things that we're definitely gonna try is air for our pork chops low carb air for our pork chops one of our patrons our dogs going crazy anyway our buddy James who is also one of our patrons over on patreon suggested doing a low carb pork chop using pork rinds and we definitely love so we're tracking right the peas right now so well mostly be back and I'm going to go back through I don't know if we told you this or not but we had a major foodie fail and I've perfected your story you go here so we're gonna tell that story in upcoming episodes and we're also going to share the successful recipe with you really but we hope you guys have enjoyed this video if you would give us a thumbs up if you like food you Friday if you are not already a member of the croc posse please click Subscribe it's a little red button down there got a big OS on the front of it says subscribe hit it and you can become a

click that dangle aim and you'll know as soon as we put up a new video and most importantly on whatever you do laugh often eat give fans big life bye guys I [Music] feel like we're telling those stories [Music] oh I don't know a lot of fun if you wanna see the [Music]", "gxY_QNpz2m8": "[Music] hey what's up guys East here with another informative video basically want to throw another video together because I wanted to explain everything that you're gonna need to know about ripping out your differentials and assuming the differentials what to do how to do it when to do it and whether or not you even need to do it so first and foremost I've got my car taken apart quite a bit here and ARMA is pretty awesome because one of their features for their 2019 version for models at least has very easy to access differential houses where it literally takes four bolts on all three of them to get into them and right now you're looking at the back end differential housing that's it of course you're gonna want to get the sway bar out of the way as well which basically just means popping it out and getting it up out of the way so everyone smile I'll turn the light on so you guys can see things a little bit more clearly okay so what I want to talk about is whether or not you need to shim your differentials and where to put those shims so in the version three in the version 2 version 1 version 2 version 3 Armas all three differentials needed shims on the interior and the best way to kind of show you here let me just show you with the instructions so you get a good idea so basically this is a blown-up version of the differential inside of the armor Creighton now I believe this might be the center diff but irregardless this section or this cup is the same on all three differentials and this little cross section here is the same on all three differentials now in the version 1 2 & 3 Armour cratons and what I understand they did not have these shims now it's common knowledge that if you've got an older version training to go in and put these shims in and in fact people were putting an extra shim like they were doing one here two here two here one here however in the v4 in the 2019 version for Creighton it comes with one shim already in place on all three differentials as well as this shim right here which wasn't in the older versions it's basically right after this this little gasket people were recommending that you put a shim to protect this little bar from spinning and damaging that gasket well in the 2019 version for it comes with a little shim granted the shims that were being recommended in in other people's advice was a much larger shim basically from the Mugen psyche was the brand that you pick up on like YouTube a bag of shams which basically came with this shim which was much larger and a bunch of these shims now again on the version for Creighton it's already shimmed except where if you want to replace these shims with the Mugen say key shims I might reckon recommend doing that because I don't know if the quality of these shims are as good and I think that the Mugen say key shims are slightly like a hair's breadth thicker so by putting in form you can say key shims you're in essence doing kind of what some people were saying 1 2 2 1 because there may be a hair's breadth thicker so if you're gonna do if what I would recommend doing is just getting that Mugen say key pack and when you're repairing your diffs get rid of these stock shims because they're not that the quality is not as good as the Mugen psyches and their again slightly thinner so then you can just put form you can say keys in one one one one and have a solid shimmed differential on all three of your gifts so the reason why I would suggest swapping to them you can say key if I'm even saying that right I'll bring in an image of the Mugen say key package so you can see the brand number for that you can say key ee o 206 this is a set of shims for inside the diffs both the the smaller shims for shimming the actual smaller gears and then the larger shim for going right behind the main gear and there I forget the name of it but either way this kit has both of those gears from what I understand the 2019 version for they did shim the inside of the diffs but if they failed to then you can get it done right and there's lots of YouTube videos on how to assume those diffs as long as well as putting the thicker do files in but if you've got the version 3 or older then you're going to want to put these shims inside your diff housing to tighten up tight tighten it up and to add to longevity it comes with sixteen of these to basically replace all the all three deaths and it comes with this but the the version of this is more like the size of a quarter as far as like size of course it's really thin I I didn't I don't I didn't end up using that one on mine because when I put that one in it was too tight because again the Mugen say key gifts are a little bit thicker and this one right here that comes stock is just fine and it's smaller and it covers up that gasket to protect it just fine so I would leave that one alone and just replace these four with the mute the Mugen say key dips to do like I said an upgrade and let me show you why that upgrade might be needed when I took apart my my Center which I'm not going to in this video I'm not going to go through the extreme details of taking these apart because it's super simple and all you have to do is see a blown-up version like in the instructions to put it back together just unscrew all four of these hit inside of it you are going to want to to get rid of all the diploid in there if you're going to be replacing the diploid and putting something different in you're gonna want to use this is a really good solvent for dissolving just basically spraying this stuff what I did was I sprayed this stuff into a into a jar and then filled it up like to about just basically that level and dropped all my stuff in there and shook it around and that really did a great job cleaning off all the diploid after that though I did do a quick spray down on all the parts with this too just because I'm not sure if that this stuff even though it does a great the other stuff does a great job dissolving the dead fluid I'm not sure if it's leaving any kind of a residue or anything on the part so I would rather just get everything cleaned off with a quick rinse of this stuff so anyway what I wanted to show you as to the reason why I would upgrade to them you can say keyed if sims is because this is what it looked like on the on my center differential you see how that's worn look at look how worn that is the actual shims themselves we're wearing literally wearing the side of that metal piece down and this is only happening in my center diff which is why it's highly recommended to increase the thickness of the diff Luud that if fluid stock is like 100,000 CST and you want to put something thicker in there yeah so here's another shot of another one of those look how damaged that is and look how warped that is this is what a good shimmer should look like so and this isn't the Mugen seiki this is the stock armor ones which are again I don't think as good quality as them even say key and they are actually a slightly thinner so I would show you an actual Mugen say key shim but they're all currently inside of my differentials so the first thing that I would recommend you do if you want to do an upgrade on your diff house on all of your differs is take them apart and don't put any more than just one shim per cross-section just one shim if you upgrade to the Mugen say key ones again they're slightly thicker so you'll kind of get that that effect I would say if you ended up having just the stock Armas shims then putting one two two one whatever like having two on on one of the bars because those are thinner that's why I would suggest doing that the next thing I wanted to talk about is shimming the outside of your differentials so here is where a little bit of light is going to be helpful all right so you'll notice I'm gonna take it out I've got two shims sitting on the outside right here and they are this part right here the techno TKR 1 2 2 2 pick up a little bag of those because you're gonna want to put just outside of this gear and what I would recommend doing is taking a tiny tiny dab of like diff Luud and just getting this wet a little bit wet and they'll stick to the side if you get them just a little bit wet they'll stick right here and then they'll kind of it's easier to put in but basically you do that actually that's that winning is super easy so that basically eliminates the the side-to-side slop so you want to do that here the other place you're going to you're going to look to do that is on the front end on this side again I think the front end has a seat yeah and kind of you can see that little wobble and hear that ticking that's because it needs to be shimmed and this one stock did not come with any shims there now on the on the back end however this does come with one shim I was able to put two in so you're going to want to put an extra one in there and that's the next place that you want to put a shim now as far as the mesh goes for your differentials the best way the best way for for me to determine the mesh ratio is by ear playing it by ear and also like Phil so when I drop so when I drop this in and again what's awesome is you literally just had to take off four bolts to get into the center diff it's just amazing love it so when you're when you unscrew these two screws it allows you to shift it's like an easy way to get to set your mesh and all you really want is just to hear this slight very slight movement between the gears just where there's just a hair that's a good mesh on the center one now another question that people have is should a shim be added inside on this main input gear when you get this thing often you pull out the input gear should you put one of these shims on the under on the underside of the of the gear itself to basically push this thing that direction a little bit and I've been testing around with it to see what I want to do and I'm going to tell you in my opinion it is not needed and here's how I'll demonstrate well when we get back to the back side so listen to the noise made when I spend this gear by placing my hand back here and holding this you can see that their same about the same amount of mesh that I set for the the main pinion for the engine I said it here thinking oh that should be what I want however after doing that you hear it a little bit of a noise while that may not be significant and it may actually not be a big deal at all shimming this is not as crucial the the closeness of those two gears as far as this one going this direction as crucial the the closeness of those two gears as far as this one going this direction is not as crucial as shimming this with this whole gear going this direction you want to you want that to be a little bit closer as far as to avoid shredding teeth and things like that putting those shims in is crucial so anyway listen to this noise imagine hearing that while the engines lay my wallet ready okay now I want to move to the front where I did not shim it it's just stock you'll notice here on the front that that ticking noise in the space slightly bigger so I decided that I am actually going to go back in and remove the grub screw from this take this back off and take that shim out because it's not needed okay so the last thing that I wanted to talk about in regards to this whole concept of pulling air your RC car apart and shimming the differentials and setting the meshes on the front and the center and the rear is to talk about the diff recommendations what kind of diploid 'zed you want in the front of the vehicle versus the center of the vehicle versus the rear of the vehicle and this is basically kind of determined by how you plan on using the vehicle the thicker the diff fluid the more protection you're adding to the gears and the more you're tuning it for being a basher where top end speed is not your number-one goal however it doesn't decrease your speed by any significant amount but naturally because the diff fluids that you put in these things are thicker you are increasing like torque and instability to your tires and also the reason why people put a heavier diff fluid in the front section then the back is because some people have issues when they gun it that their front tires balloon and the back tires don't and so to kind of mitigate that from happening to prevent the front section of your vehicle from ballooning and kind of offsetting the rotation torque of all four your tires it's recommended to put a heavier fluid in the front section and then then to have in the back section and so what some people do is they'll put like 80,000 in the back which is a huge jump from 10,000 to 80,000 and they'll also put like 80,000 in the front which again is a huge jump from 10,000 to 80,000 and they'll put like 500 thousand or even a million in the Front's in the middle section after kind of doing a lot of research and kind of finding that happy go-between where you want to basically protect your gears but stit and also take advantage of having the ballooning mitigated a little bit in the front I found a good recommendation is to jump from 10,000 CST to 20,000 CST in the rear and in the center to jump from 100,000 to 200,000 so doubling the thickness if I were to change anything I would maybe increase this to 500 thousand some people like to do five hundred thousand however 200 thousand in the centre is what I'm doing and then in the front section doing 60,000 and that is because and that's like the difference between the front the back is 20,000 60,000 if you wanted to go thicker I might consider doing something like sixty thousand five hundred thousand and eighty thousand but I digress I mean just to give you an idea of how thick two hundred thousand is and some people are doing five hundred thousand or million just to give you an idea of how thick this actually is you know we turn this light off because it's a little bit too bright but close this stuff like literally keeps its form you can squeeze it out and it like how thick it is super thick which people are saying when you jump from when you go up from two like five hundred thousand I had one guy talking about how we put five hundred thousand or five hundred K in his Center and then he decided to jump from that to a million and he didn't even know as a difference so I think the the curve of basically the curve of thickness as you get from past like you know 200,000 to 300,000 4,000 up to a million it's it's kind of a little bit less significant than when you jump from say a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand it's like literally double the thickness so the other thing that I wanted to make sure you guys are aware of is when you are removing your DIF houses and this happened to me on my front and give this out when you are taking these apart I put in new bearings which are from avid racing and these are these are rubber sealed bearings which are nicer also just to give you a quick overview when you buy this pack of bearings from avid it's the arm Italian this whole kit comes with all the bearings you're going to need for the entire vehicle which is basically two bearings for each of the four tires also it's going to come with the two outside bearings for all three of your diffs as well as this bearing which goes here on the inside of this and this little one so both these both of these bearings here go on the this bigger one goes on the inside and this one goes on the outside for that as well as this is the servo saver the steering setup you have one two and then on the flip side of this three four so four bearings they're all those bearings basically that's the summation of all the bearings your ever going to need to replace on your vehicle and these are all rubber sealed bearings so I wanted to point that out the other thing I wanted to point out is when you're taking this thing apart and you're putting the new defiles in it and you use those solvents that I said to get it all cleaned up and ready to go you want to make sure that when this cap is taken off and you're like putting it back together that there's a gasket in here you want that to be dry you want the surfaces on both the bottom side and the top side of the gasket to be dried off as good as possible seated as good as possible and then when you screw these down you don't have to go insanely tight once you get it down to snug you give it little turn and they're not so it's nice and snug that's as far as you want to go but the other thing that I would highly recommend is that you set all of your trend all of your differentials on the ground somewhere to sit for 24 hours and then come back and check out the bottom section here and see if there's any leaks or just inspect it for any leaks because I came back to find that there was a leak in my in my front differential and it was because I neglected to have a nice dry seating with that gasket when I put it back together so at least you know maybe five or six hours let all three of them just sit on their side and come back and inspect to make sure that there was note that there's no leaking because you don't want to have a leak the other thing I wanted to talk to you about is understanding if you've got these things put together right you basically grab both ends and you twist it now you're gonna you're gonna be able to know based on the knowledge of what type of thicknesses you're going with where this one's twenty two hundred and sixty this this one should be substantially easier to turn verses my Center one should be like you know a little bit slower and then my front should be like in between right and that is the case I do sense that when I'm when I'm playing with these I will say that when I put when I put when I doubled up on the shims inside the little shams as well as putting that top bigger shim in on this I was I would turn this and it was like it felt like the 200 k1 it felt way and I was also getting like like little snags like it wasn't it wasn't like super noticeable boat it wasn't a smooth this should be smooth when you're when you're spinning this it should be you should feel that resistance of the fluid where there should be absolutely no deviation in its smoothness that's how you're gonna know that you didn't over tighten or put too many shims in or incorrectly install something is because when you twist it it's gonna have a very smooth fill with no you know deviations in that smoothness if that's if that makes any sense anyway guys that is a wrap up on everything that you need to know about all three differentials in regards to their mesh and in regards to shimming check out my other videos I have a video that's showing you how you can fix your steering on your on your servo saver my steering was really bad and I ended up buying a new servo thinking that would be the the problem however the brand new servo with way more torque was I was still having the same issue and I couldn't figure out what it was found out that my servo saver was too loose and there's a really funky way that you have to tighten the servo saver on the on the 2019 version for that is different from the version three so check that video out also I have a video that shows you how you can create you can if you rip any of your boots on your shocks you can basically there's an easy fix to save you money and it works really well it's actually the fix is actually stronger than the stock boots watch that video and like and subscribe to to me I would greatly appreciate it thanks for giving me

sounds regularly to allow the musician to keep a consistent rhythm while playing music knowing this can we start a rock band now well well we have to take it slow first we have to learn the musical notes today I want to tell you about the quarter note eighth note and sixteenth note each one of these notes also has a recipe we will talk about that too look it's a quarter note and it sound lasts one beat here the quarter note between two ticks on the metronome okay and how do we do it the first thing we need is an instrument so we can play the quarter note should we try it with an electric guitar let's go for it pay close attention to the metronome so cool why do we see that when there's no sound it's the quarter note rest in music the rest notes are just as important as the music played and they last the same amount of time [Music] what do you think of the quarter note and its rest note now I will explain the eighth note look this is the eighth note it's like the quarter note but it has a bracket how else are they different an eighth note is played half as long as the quarter note that means one quarter note is equal to two eighths notes that's it when two eighth notes appear together they can also be represented like this let's listen to it with my guitar so that note that we see there when we don't hear anything is the eighth notes rest right that's right my friend and this one here is the sixteenth note which is equal to half of an eighth note and if we add up four sixteenth notes it will be equal to a quarter note the shape of the sixteenth note is like the eighth note but it has another bracket it's really short right yeah it's really short look here now I get it now I see that the sixteenth note rest is like the eighth note rest but with another bracket that's it did you get everything yeah the quarter notes and it's the rest last one beat the eighth note and its rest last a half beat the sixteenth note and its rest notes last a fourth of a beat well done did you like this video about music notes we have so many more videos click on the seal to subscribe to the smile & Learn channel and if you want to keep watching more videos click on the squares [Music]", "a_0cqFjg5PE": "alright guys I had a bunch of you asked me when I did the subwoofer video the other day I asked you if you wanted me to do a wiring video on how to wire up stuff so I'm gonna break this down into probably three sections so we're gonna start with the first section which is going to be a single dual voice coil sub so they usually kind of dual ones dual twos and dual fours [Music] [Music] and dual force a lot of people order speakers online and they really don't know what they're ordering or what own load they need so I'm gonna try my best to help you get the speaker that you need so because if you order the wrong one say you have an amp that does power at one ohm but you order a dual four and you wire it to a dome you're not gonna get any power out of that amp so you're gonna think this sub sucked because it's not gonna perform the way that you want it to like if you've got a dual let's see where you want to be like if you got a dual to sub and wired it to one ohm and it would put out the power that it Lawrence so anyway we're gonna go over these this is gonna be a single sub dual voice coil wiring configurations you can have three different or this is gonna be for door ones door twos and door fours so we're gonna jump right in so here you have one Dole one sub the voice coil this is for dole voice cuz you can see right here so I did the best I could I'm not an artist by any means as you can see it the best that I could so we have the sub right here and the amp right here so you have your sub you have door warnings so you have a positive and negative on one side positive and negative on the other side if you're gonna wire this in parallel which is your voice coils are gonna be wired in parallel or this this is how it works right here so you're gonna have this negative to this negative and then you're gonna bring those over to the aunt negative same thing with a positive so you're gonna have positive to positive then positive on the amp this is going to give you a parallel which is going to give you a half on load so this is not recommended for a lot of amplifiers most amplifiers the ideal with most of them are wired I meant rated and warrantied at 1 ohm some crescendo amplifiers offer a half Home Warranty if you want to pay extra for it so be careful right here because if you're not warranted or covered or if your amp isn't able to do that phone you do not want to do this you can blow your amp so just be very careful so the next option if you have the door Moines sub you can wire it in series which is going to give you a 2 ohm load and the way to do this you're gonna have negative to positive so from your ones so you have negative otherside you're gonna hook one positive from one side to the negative on the other side so that's gonna leave you a positive and negative that are left open so you're gonna run this positive to the positive on the amp and this negative to the negative on the amp so that's gonna give you series wiring which is a 2 ohm load with this subwoofer so again if you have an amp this ready to do say 2,000 watts at 1 own you may only get a too long you may only be getting 1,001 so again you're not gonna think that the stuff is performing correctly because you don't have the right on them so this is the new one we got that like knocked out so I'm gonna if you want to pause this and screenshot it I'm gonna hold it still for a second so that's how you do that and then moving on to the don't twos this is one to long double voice coil subwoofer so this is a very popular set up for single sub operation the reason why is it because most of the amps that I sell much the amps that are out right now do power and are warrantied at one ohm once again so if you're gonna be running a single sub and you want a one on both this is the sub that you want you want get a dual to so you can wire it just like this which is parallel and get a one ohm load and this is how you do it same thing with the other side so for parallel you're gonna go positive sorry negative to negative and then run those is you hook together you're gonna run this wire to the negative on the animal same thing with the positives positive to positive to the positive on the amp so that's gonna give your 1 ohm load for you amplifier so if you have an aunt that's doing 2,000 watts in 100 or as rate of 2000 watts in 100 this would be perfect for it so your so we'll be seeing 2,000 watts light - rise and all this and this can get very detailed and I'm gonna try to keep this as simple as possible so another although that you can get with your dual twos is forum so if you have two dual 2-ohm no I mean you have one double - so you're gonna get a sorry but if you have this one - OH - so and it's wired in series this is gonna give you a 4 ohm load so again if you haven't HAMP this raita to do power at 1 ohm and you wire this up to 4 on them instead you're not gonna get the power you're looking for so with it wired it's more on the hands you might be putting out 500 watts instead of 1000 watts it went on so anyway this is how you do this and if you I mean I don't know why you'd want to do this maybe if you're doing car I'm in a home audio a lot of home audio is wired at 4 ohm or a doe maybe even higher but in car audio this is not really a thing anymore most things or most setups where they won't on so to do this you can get negative to positive from this point spoil over this voice coil this is going to give you series so negative positive and then the ones that you have left your positive you're gonna go to positive on the amp negative you're gonna go to negative on the annum so this is how you wire this a dual boys pole to own subwoofer in parallel and in series to get a 1 ohm load or a 4 ohm load so moving over here to another popular sub or another popular own load sub is a 4 ohm so we got 1 ohm - own and dual 4-ohm so so option one's gonna give you your parallel just like I'm out there diagrams you're gonna get a 2 ohm load here so if your aunt those power at 200 and you're looking to get a to own load with a single sub some amps are rated it's you own so if this is what you're looking for and check this out so again parallel and you're going to be wired just like this negative negative to negative on the amp positive to positive then the positive on am so again so the door for to give you a 2 ohm load wired in parallel last but not least is I don't think I would ever recommend this for car audio for sure this is gonna give you an 8 ohm load if you wire a dual 4 sub in series it's gonna give you an 8 ohm load so to do this you're gonna get a positive on this like negative on one coil 2 positive on the other coil and then the ones you have left over you're going to Dave positive to the positive amp negative to the negative on them this is as basic as I could make this for a single sub wiring I'll do multiple subbers maybe next I'll do a single voice coil single sub and then move into a dual voice coil 2 sub setup so you can just get really complicated so I'm gonna try to keep this as basic as possible appreciate you

really really important to obey the mix ratios on your components for instance the Euroclear is a 2 to 1 mix ratio now the easiest thing to do is to think about it in parts and not necessarily volume it has nothing to do with a gallon or a quart it's two parts of clearcoat and one part of catalyst and it's really really easy to wrap your head around if you're using these mixing cups now what we have here is a division on the cup with almost every mix ratio that you would ever want to use and in fact there's one for the two to one mix ratio so we're gonna walk you through it once you find your mix ratio across the top stay within that column now we know we want about a half a quart of paint which this is a quarter cup so we're gonna come up to the five two two one two two one it's simple we pour up to the first five with our first component right there now two two one the math is done for us this is the beautiful thing about these cups now we're gonna come up to the second five and right there we have the exact precise mix ratio of a two to one formula now of course there's more columns here there's a half part and another full part so if you have more than two components like two two one two one half will go up to the next five with an additional reducer so just pour up to the next five and again we've got a precise mixed racial and of course always always blend your components before you pour it into the cup now if you're working on an all-over paint job or a larger project well there's larger tubs again with all the mixing ratios all you have to do is find your column and work your way like you read the book from left to right and you're in there's also caps that you can put on the cups to keep debris from falling in while you're between coats or while you're between sessions so hopefully this has cleared up mix ratios for you and as always get in touch with us on the forums or send us an email drop us a line [Music] [Music] you", "TrfVE03JGzg":

we'll continue with conversion of units and we will see how to convert liters to meter cube now as you know one liter is actually equal to 1000 cc we also say this is equal to 1,000 CC means centimeter cube so I hope you remember this 1 liter is 1000 centimeter cube now we need to convert this to meter cube one centimeter is equal to 1 over 100 meter well you know that 1 meter equals to 100 centimeter correct so if I have to get what is 1 centimeter equals 2 then basically I need to divide both sides by 100 credit so if I do that I get that 1 over 100 meters is equal to 1 centimeter that were justice so what I will do here is a replace centimeter by 1 over 100 meter so we'll get our conversions we have thousand times instead of seven centimeters I'll write 1 over 100 meters and cube correct so instead of centimeter I wrote the conversion factor one over hundred so that gives us one thousand times so when we Q we have to multiply by 100 times hundred times hundred so what we get here is six zeros right and the unit's will be now meter cube now it is simpler you could cancel three zeros and you're left with three so what you get here is one over thousand I mean meter cube great so if I divide one by thousand then get 0.01 meter cube so in a way one liter is equal to one over thousand meter cube which is equal to 0.01 so when you divide by thousand decimal moves right one two and three so it is actually 0.01 two zeros will be there I'm sorry for that so if you divide by ten you get one then hundred and ten thousand perfect or you could also write that one thousand liters is equal to one meter cube so anyway so that is how they are related so that is the way you could relate one thousand liters is meter cube or one liter is equal to one over thousand meter cube or 0.001 meter cube so I hope that helps you to understand the relation between liters and meter cube feel free to suggest your views in comments if you like and subscribe that'd be great thank you

and then we are going to answer this so let's say a ball is dropped like this now I'll just stretch it away to show you what is really happening and let's assume that the ground is kind of like this

that initially the height is 2 meters we need to find the total distance so clearly this is a geometric series where the initial value a is two meters for us and when it rebounds the factor by which is being multiplied as 75% 75% means 0.75 we need to find total distance so as you can see here distances coming down as well as going up so so the total distance is both up and and down distance this is important to understand so let us assume that this continues forever so it is kind of an infinite series so some of infinite series provides us the solution here and therefore we can use the formula which is sum of infinite series is the initial value over 1 minus R now the value of R is 0.75 so it converges right so it is converging series if R is less than 1 right so if R is less than 1 it can be applied perfect so let's apply this formula and find the sum so somehow infinite series will give us a values 2 over 1 minus 0.75 and that is equal to what 2 divided by within brackets 1 minus 0.75 which is equal to 8 well 8 is one of the options however do you think it is right answer well it is not right I'll say because this only gives you one way right so it is telling you that it was dropped in the second time again it is only tried telling you some of these distances coming downwards so how much is the total distance well the total distances that it is also bouncing back so we have to add those distances which are going upwards also do you see that part so so total distance has been has to be taken so except for these all of the distances are repeated great this is only once so how do we find the total distance covered so total distance will be 2 times 8 minus 2 meters since it is not going up 2 meters it it only Falls 2 meters all of the distances have been covered twice right it goes up and falls the same distance so twice it is covering from here to there so 2 times this minus 2 should be the correct answer we have 16 minus 2 which is 14 meters correct so 14 meters is the right option which is option D so this is very important as most of the numbers here may relate some way or the other your values in the solution how I should be very clear that when you have a question like this you could use the sum of infinite series but remember that twice the total length minus the initial distance since it is not going up the same way right that has to be incorporated to get the right answer I hope makes sense feel free to write a comment share your views and if you like and subscribe to my videos that we great thanks for your time and all the best",

out the website really really does help so thank you guys and let's get on with this video so i get asked about nugs versus shake and shake in general or shake versus trim all the time and kind of wanted to make a video where i can go through my thoughts on it and see what your guys's thoughts are as well i had an ounce of some american pie which had some shake in the bottom of the jar so i separated out the nugs for this video got out the shake so that way i could show you guys what shaker's looking like but before we get into the nugs versus shake i feel like we need to talk about shake versus trim so this is what shake is it's when you have a large amount of bud and the nugs are rubbing against the side of the container or against other nugs and bits of nug will fall all the way to the bottom of the jar and the reason it's called shake is because if you take your container and you shake it about you're gonna create more of it now trim is totally different not to be confused trim is like the excess bud that you don't really want like you know bits of leaf maybe little bits of stalk like you know the reason it's called trim is because you know you're trimming up the nug and then it's the stuff that comes off you know after the trim job now you don't want to be smoking that and it's kind of weird because when you say to some people shake they'll think of true and when you say to some people trim they'll think of shakes so yeah definitely don't confuse those things ever or you have a really bad time so i rolled up that shake into this joint and we're gonna spark it and we're gonna talk about shake in general and my sort of thoughts on it damn that is tasting absolutely wonderful so also i wanted to talk about when i was living in california and my experience was shake out there because it was actually my first time really experiencing shape so there were some times in california when i was pretty broke and you know i wouldn't have like the craziest amount of money but i would still want to smoke and you know i had a medical condition that i'd want to smoke for and there was this local dispensary which had shake on their menu and i think at one point when i just didn't really have too much money i was like you know what i'll try out this shake and see what's going on the way this shake was advertised was it was og shape so it was literally just the bottom parts of the jars of every single og strain that they had all just mixed into like this one sort of shake back and it was actually really good it was super cheap and to be honest it kind of looked how the shape that i'm smoking on now did you know had little bits of popcorn nug in it had all the shaky bits in it but the main thing is that it had loads of trichomes in it but i find sometimes shape can come in like the perfect way where loads of trichomes will fall to the bottom on top of the shake and sometimes the shake can be stronger than some of the actual nugs themselves just from how much trichomes fallen on top of it so you've got all the ones that are you know regularly there plus extra and i think that's why this is tasting really nice right now like if anything i can see because i've been smoking on this american pie literally all the time this joint is tasting slightly stronger than some of the other ones that i've had before and yeah sometimes i would find that i actually preferred smoking the og shake to some of the other strains that i got and there were some times when i would try and get some shake from other dispensaries say i was traveling and i would see a similar thing and i swear like sort of seventy percent of the time it was just trim like it wasn't even like actually shaped the way they were saying like it was straight up just like some trim it was very very strange but the main point of that story is me saying that you know shake doesn't necessarily have to be bad sometimes you can get shake which is really good especially if it's coming off some really good strains and it is genuinely just what real shake is where you've got the jar it's just the bottom bits that are you know falling off hello it's me in the future after i've actually already finished the joint but i wanted to cut myself in here so i could give you guys my thoughts on like the shake versus the nug after i actually just smoked that joint so like i said i did actually kind of find the taste ever so slightly stronger i think it was burning pretty much just as clean it maybe it was burning ever so slightly worse but i mean it was still really really clean so i can't really knock it or anything it's just like you could visibly see it was slightly different to how like a normal nug would just be burning but overall i really liked it and i think that really came from the fact that the nug had a really good trim job on it beforehand like if your nug doesn't really have the best trim job on it beforehand then you know the shake that comes off it is going to be worse quality because it's going to have more leaves like you know more sugar leaves rather than like actual parts of nug that's fallen off so when i was in california for example i was having a good experience with a lot of shake because you know the nugs out there are trimmed really really good however in england a lot of the shape you're going to see is going to be really awful because half of the bud is barely trimmed like you know properly at all so that means the shake in the bottom is obviously going to be worse quality than what i ended up having here and sometimes when you've got like a half ounce or an ounce of some really good trim bud like you know when you get down to the bottom and you get to the shape it can be one of the best joints out of the job but anyways this has been me from the future wanted to give you guys my thoughts on the joint and that's what it was so i want to pass the question off to you guys what's your opinion on shake have you ever had some really good shake have you ever had some really bad shake i know there's some people who religiously only smoke shake because it's so much cheaper and they find that it smokes exactly the same and i mean to be fair if i could still get that same emoji shape that i got back in the day i would probably still smoke it every now and then but yeah i want to know how you feel have you had a good experience have you had a bad experience let me know in the comments down below yo people if you like these videos make sure to hit the like button hit the subscribe button down here and also hit that notification bell make sure it's on all and not personalized because youtube changes that every now and then just automatically but yeah people safe one and i'll probably see

about ratio you can have a look at the playlist on the YouTube channel or please visit Matt's Rako UK and there's a couple of examples and also a quick test that you can download and have a go at some of the questions for yourself and all raise your questions generally tend to be round about C grade at GCSE they're relatively straightforward because all we need to do really is find out the value of one part which I think I mentioned in the previous video and then use that value in order to calculate the answer to the question so this particular question and I will put into the description box below and also if you visit maths rap it'll be on there as well ok so this particular question deals with making a pizza and this particular person is going to make pizza in the ratio of 2 3 to 5 I'll just refer to my notes here so it's 2 lots of cheese 3 lots of topping and 5 lots of dough ok and with this particular pizza this person has used 70 grams of dough ok and what they want us to find out is how many grams of topping will this person use as persons called Jared I believe ok so i'm 5-8 if it's the ratio to 3 to 5 what I mentioned is is that in the last videos that you need to find the value of one part well the information we've got is that they use 70 grams of dough well if the ratio is 5 parts of dough then really to find the value of one part then all we need to do is divide 70 grams I five well if you divide 70 grams by five that will give us the value of one part so value of one part equals seventy divided by five or if you prefer seventy divided by five well that's going to give the value of one part as 14 so in other words each of these parts here would be 14 grams it happens these five parts of them so in other words 70 grams of dough well now we've got the value of that it will allow us then to work out the value of the topping and also if we want the value of the cheese so let's just put that up on the board we're sharing in the ratio to three to five we know this is 70 grams and we also know that each part is 14 grams so for the topping it will be three times forty or three times fourteen I'm going to work that out on the side here is two ones carrying 42 so that's going to be 42 grams and two grams of topping is two grams of cheese is going to be 28 grams okay so really as I mentioned in the previous video providing you work out the value of one part then it should be fairly straightforward in order to answer a question like this now this particular question they've asked how many grams of topping what the answer is going to be 42 so to answer the first the question you need to write 42 the grounds of topping okay and I hope that's okay for you please do add a comment below have a look at the master up channel math website and the YouTube

3 and that can also be written as 2 by 3 we have seen that 2 by 3 can be written in different ways we can multiply the numerator as well as the denominator by 2 and get 4 by 6 or we can also multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get 6 by 9 all these three ratios have the same value if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same value the ratio remains unchanged even if we divide the numerator and the denominator by the same value the ratio remains unchanged let's consider the ratio 12 by 18 we can divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 6 the numerator will be 12 by 6 and the denominator will be 18 by 6 12 by 6 is 2 and 18 by 6 is 3 12 by 18 and 2 by 3 are the same 2 by 3 is called the simplest form it means this cannot be reduced further but how did we know what number we're supposed to divide them by the number 6 is actually the highest common factor of the numerator and the denominator if we divide the numerator as well as the denominator by the HCF we get the simplest form say we have the ratio 30 by 50 let's assume that we do not know what their HCF is if we do not know what the HCF is all we need to do is look for the common factors of the numerator and the denominator 30 and 50 are both divisible by 2 so we divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 2 30 divided by 2 is 15 and 50 divided by 2 is 25 if there are no common factors of the numerator and the denominator it leaves us with the answer in the standard form but 15 and 25 both have 5 as that common factor which tells us that this is not the simplest form we divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 5 15 divided by 5 is 3 and 25 divided by 5 is 5 the numbers 3 & 5 do not have any common factors apart from 1 so this is the standard form of the ratio 30 by 50 the product of all the numbers which we divided the numerators and the denominators by will be their HCF here 2 times 5 which equals 10 is the HCF of 30 and 50 i would recommend you to first find the HCF and then divide the numerator and the denominator by just once instead of performing division several times", "ybbS5_qlkaQ": "Shelby Shelby hold on Clary's getting you some juice

graphics solution so if I was given this inequality mean X plus 8 is greater than equal to negative 64 and then I get a saddle minus ax it's greater than equal to negative 70 not okay well our first step here is on the solve each inequality individually so I'm going to subtract with 8 to both sides here giving me 8x + is greater than or equal to 90 64 - and it comes out to be a negative sent me - okay then I'm going to divide it by 8 to both sides and divide by 8 to both sides X is by itself here is greater than equal to negative 72 divided by 8 is a negative 9 so nowadays solved this one I'm going to add a 7 to both sides by adding a 7 to both sides a must have negative eight X is greater than equal to negative seven nine plus seven is negative 72 and then need to divide by negative 8 to both sides divided by negative each both sides gives me X by itself here this one's in I'm dividing by negative over the inequality that Grandon equals sign turns into a less than or equal to sign so it's less than or equal to there and negative 72 divided by negative is a positive not again our answers has AZ and it's this and that X is greater than or equal to negative 9 and X is less than or equal to none so I'm gonna flip this one over the smaller or a Bentley smaller to one the starts with a negative 9x is greater than that okay I'm gonna flip it where negative x was first and that's less than or equal to X these two statements are the same X is greater than equal to negative 9 negative 9 is less than equal to X but now I can combine it because we said X has to be this and that XSP or negative nice be less than equal X and X has to be less than or equal to none so I can kind of toss this down here giving me less than equal to 9 and there we have I have a compound inequality combining the two parts here that negative 9 is less or equal to X which is less than equal to none so now let's graph it okay let's go back through this three six nine twelve negative three negative six negative 9 negative 12 okay well we started negative 9 and X equal negative 9 so I'm a closed circle right there X cannot equal positive nods I'm gonna put a closed circle right there as well and X can exist everywhere in between so I draw a line between negative 9 a positive line and there we have it we have a graph here that matches our final answer which is negative and it's lesser to X which is less we know it's a positive number so it's pretty cap we're given our two inequalities eight X plus eight is greater than equal negative 64 and at negative seven minus eight X is greater than equal to negative seven not solve each individual yeah that's remedy to both sides here and divide by 8 to both sides give me X is greater than equal to negative nine on this one here I added a certain book slides and then I divided by negative 8 to both sides cause of my inequality to flip and give me X is less than equal to now a positive nine I then combined that to here I've flipped the negative nine so X is greater than or equal to negative nine but negative nine first so I have negative nine is now less than or equal to ax was those mean the same things brought down this part here but it's less or equal to none so now I have negative nine it's less than equal to X which is less than equal to a positive nine by graphing it I have a closed circle at negative nine and a positive because X could equal both of them and X is in between lies in between them I have my line here in between them so now my graph here matches my final answer which is negative 9 is less or equal to X which is less than equal to a positive", "HJ7D-1hi4uE": "how do you mix 42:1 fuel mixture for two-stroke engines like string trimmers weed whackers chainsaws so on and so forth well it's pretty easy its afforded to one mixture now don't be don't be discouraged or run away or stop the video because I'm putting up 120 fluid ounces or whatever I will show you all the possible measurements that you will that you can do right down to cups for mixing four to one fuel mixture right so 128 fluid ounces equals one gallon of gasoline now seeing that it's 40 to 1 128 fluid ounces divided by 40 is what 128 divided by 40 3.2 fluid ounces I'm only going to show you this one time google has conversion doing 3.2 fluid ounces equals 0 of 4 tenths 4 tenths or 2 fifths of a cup now you get go and convert every what you can even get a measuring cup that measures fluid ounces not very useful that's why I'm going to show you other ways to measure the fuel mixture okay ii nonetheless a thousand milliliters equals one liter you can get syringes large syringes and sort of that the mix the fuel if you really wanted to do it that way a thousand milliliters divided by forty is what twenty five milliliters you forty cups is equal to 2.5 US gallons 40 cups divided by 40 is what well it's 1 so you would need only one cup of two-stroke oil per 40 cups of gasoline or 2.5 gallons that is by far the most easiest way to do this you could you don't have to measure out the 40 cups at you know with a measuring cup you can actually go to the gas pump make sure that the gas can is empty and pump 2.5 gallons of gasoline into the gas can because I'm pretty sure that they're not going to give you anything over 2.5 gallons if that's what you're putting it your guests gas can because they're pretty tight about all that stuff so 2.5 US gallons per 1 cup of oil so I'm going to basically the cups is the absolute best way to do this here's a fifty to one filled mixture 50 cups equals three point one two five or a three and an eighth of a gallon so 50 cups divided by 50 you would still need one cup of oil for a fifty to one fuel mixture all right so that's just my little video thing stop for watching stay tuned for more exciting videos on more interesting subjects", "pniUNqBaPZg": "- The GORUCK MACV-1 is a\nlightweight combat boot and GORUCK's first shot\nat creating footwear. I'm Tom, the founder of Pack Hacker, where we use our expertise\nand real-world experiences to provide practical\nresources and honest opinions, guiding you towards smarter travel. So, if you're new here,\nconsider subscribing. Nathan and I have been\ntesting the GORUCK MACV-1s, both the black version\nand the coyote version for a cumulative of five months. We're excited to dive in and\nshare our thoughts with you. Let's check it out. (upbeat music) The big draw of these boots for travel is that they're extremely lightweight. Despite the boots\nlooking rugged and heavy, the smaller sizes come in\nat just under 14 ounces. Our black, 10.5's come in at 16.4 ounces. So you could hold one in your hand and it's about the same\nweight as a soda can. At the time of this review, the MACV-1 comes in two\ndifferent color ways. So the black and the coyote version. Nathan has been testing the coyote version for about two months. And I have been testing the black version for about three months. From a branding perspective, we have the GORUCK tip of the spear showing up on three different\nplaces on each shoe. So the first is on the back left heel. That shows up here. And one little detail that I like going on is that on each side, they are reversed. So they are always pointing forward, and that is a nice little\ntouch in this boot. You're also gonna have\nGORUCK on the tongue with that same mark that\nwe've seen on the heel. So that's going on there. And then, you just have an\nimprint on the rubber sole, again pointing straight forward on each one of the shoes as well. We think these boots look pretty great in a polished and urban environment, but beauty is always in\nthe eyes of the beholder. That's why we polled\nour Instagram audience over @packhacker to give their thoughts. Feel free to follow us there if you wanna be involved in future polls. Wrapping up some of the materials, we have this full-grain leather\ngoing on on the outside. We have molded TPU at both the\ntoe and on the heel counter. So on the heel counter, it's basically a stiffer part of the shoe that helps prevent friction\nas you're walking around. There's 1000 grade\nCordura at the top here, and then some reinforced\nnylon webbing at the top. It gives that upper a\nlittle more flexibility while the bottom is pretty\nstiff and reinforced. We have a thick EVA midsole going on here and then a thicker rubber\noutsole going on there, so those two come together. The EVA foam kinda pads\nas you're walking around, and then, that rubber outsole\nis there for added durability. Overall these boots are comfortable, well-designed and just\nfeel comfortable to wear. Now, we could just stop there but we wanna drill into a couple\nof components and features that help with that\ncomfort and versatility. Kicking it off with these speed laces. Basically, these are thinner, three millimeter laces that are used here that end up lacing and\nde-lacing, if that's even a word, a little bit quicker\nthan five millimeters so, the eyelets are a little bit larger. The string, the shoestring\nitself is a little bit thinner. And you can just see that\nreally quickly becomes de-laced just by pulling the shoe apart. They're also triple-stitched in certain places for added durability. So especially down here, where the upper attaches to\nthe lower part of the shoe. You could see we have three\nrows of stitching going on here. And GORUCK is always trying to make the most durable products possible. They make really high-quality stuff. And with this triple stitching, it shows their attention to detail to weaker points on the shoe and the areas they're reinforcing. There's also a wide toe box near the top, and what that does here, is\nit allows your toes to breathe and spread out a little bit more. If you're familiar with\nminimalistic shoes, these are in no way minimalist whatsoever with that huge, massive thick padding that we have going on here at\nthe outsole and the midsole. However, if you're familiar\nwith minimalistic shoes, they typically have a wider\ntoe box towards the top. It gives your feet a little bit of room to spread out inside of the shoe. Just feels a lot more comfortable overall, especially as your feet get used to that. These shoes are not waterproof and GORUCK is really going\nfor breathability here instead of trapping\nall that heat and sweat inside of the shoe,\nfeeling like a microwave, as they do say on their site. They have these shielding\ndrain holes here at the bottom which not only help with breathability, but they also expel any water\nthat's been collected inside, and they are guarded drain holes so that they have a little bit of this kind of mesh material going on here, and that is going to keep dirt and sand from getting inside the shoe, but it's still gonna\nallow water to drain out. And the water just drains right out, it's actually pretty handy. Overall the height of these is great, but if you want something\na little bit taller, you could check out\nGORUCK's eight inch MACV-1s that are in preorder at\nthe time of this review. From a break-in perspective, Nathan was able to hit the ground running. He has narrower and flatter feet. And from a break-in perspective,\nthere was virtually none. He was just able to\nput these on right away and they were comfortable for him. For me, on the other hand, it took a little bit of time to break in. My feet are a little bit\nwider with a high instep. And it probably just took a couple of days before it felt comfortable. The wideness itself was not\nan issue for me personally. But I did feel a little bit\ntighter towards the top here as I have a higher instep. So that took a couple days to feel a little more comfortable. Neither of us had blisters on break-in or anything like that. Our testing has pretty much been urban. We haven't gone trekking\nin a jungle, in Vietnam, like the GORUCK marketing video shows. Just been wearing them around\nDetroit, New York City, as well as Minnesota. We have seen a couple of\npermanent marks and scratches that have developed on the black version but nothing really affecting\nthe durability quite yet, just the aesthetic. Generally, they've been\nquite weather-resistant and also dry quickly, especially if that insole\nis not on the inside. Plus, the materials in\nthis boot are designed not to hold water so they\ndon't use any Spacer Mesh, which can retain a bunch of water. Generally, these dry pretty quickly. If anything does go wrong, GORUCK will cover manufacturing defects under their Scars warranty. And the Scars warranty is one of the best warranties out there. They don't cover ordinary\nwear and tear on the soles. Just like tires on a car, you know, these are gonna wear down as you walk on them more. I mean, that's just how shoes work. And they're definitely not\ngoing to replace anything if there's fire damage, but they might give you a discount if you email them a cool story. And they're usually really\ngreat with their customers. They have pride in their product and they stand behind it really well. So to wrap this thing up\nwith some pros and cons, starting with the pros. These are very lightweight and are a great option for travel. The speed laces keep things\nrunning smoothly and quick. GORUCK uses some high-quality\nmaterials and craftsmanship to develop the MACV-1s. On to some of the cons. It can take some getting\nused to and breaking in if you have a higher instep. And on the black version we have seen aesthetic\nscratch marks show quickly. The lighter weight of these shoes is what makes them\nreally great for travel. They look solid when you're\nin an urban environment and perform well in the wilderness. We liked the high-quality\nmaterials and craftsmanship including the fact that they're breathable and not waterproof.

Only using these buckets, and\nan unlimited amount of water, obtain exactly four gallons of\nwater in two of the buckets. So, I hope you have already\nattempted this problem. If you haven't, I hope\nyou'll pause the video and give it a try. In our solution, we actually\nwon't waste any water. We use exactly eight gallons of water to obtain four gallons of\nwater in two of the buckets. And we use this table here\nto keep track of our steps where each column represents\nthe amount of water in the eight gallon, five\ngallon, and three gallon buckets. For the first step we'll fill up the eight gallon bucket\nwith eight gallons of water. So we'd have eight gallons\nhere, zero gallons here, and zero gallons here. Step two, we're going to\nuse these eight gallons in the eight gallon bucket to fill up the five gallon bucket. So in the next step we'd have five gallons in the five gallon bucket. Which would leave us with three gallons in the eight gallon bucket. And we still have zero gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. Next we're going to use the five gallons in the five gallon bucket to fill up the three gallon bucket.\nAnd when we do this we'd have three gallons in\nthe three gallon bucket, which would leave two gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, and we still have three gallons\nin the eight gallon bucket. In our next step, we're going\nto take the three gallons in the three gallon\nbucket, and pour them into the eight gallon bucket that currently has three gallons of water. That would give us six gallons\nin the eight gallon bucket, we still have two gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, and now we'd have zero gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. Next, we're going to pour the two gallons in the five gallon bucket\ninto the three gallon bucket. So we'd have two gallons\nin the three gallon bucket, zero gallons in the five gallon bucket, and we still have six gallons\nin the eight gallon bucket. Next, we'll fill up the five gallon bucket using the six gallons\nthe eight gallon bucket. That would give us five gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, one gallon left in the\neight gallon bucket, and we still have two gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. Next, we'll use the five gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, to fill up the three gallon bucket, which currently have two gallons in it. So we'd pour one of these five gallons into the three gallon\nbucket, that would give us three gallons in the three gallon bucket, four gallons in the five gallon bucket, and we still have 1 gallon\nin the eight gallon bucket. And for our last step, we\nwill pour the three gallons in the three gallon bucket\ninto the eight gallon bucket which currently has one gallon. When we do this, we\nwould have four gallons in the eight gallon bucket. We still have four gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, and now we have zero gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. And we've completed our\ntask, we now have exactly four gallons of water\nin two of the buckets. We have four gallons in\nthe eight gallon bucket and four gallons in\nthe five gallon bucket. I hope you found this explanation helpful.", "H2MEMquWVIc": "The easiest way to distinguish whether\nyou have a 2-cycle or a 4-cycle engine, is to identify the number of fuel\ntank and/or oil sump fill ports. 2-cycle engines have one fill port 4-cycle engines will have two fill ports. A 2-cycle engine's fill port cap will\nhave a fuel pump and an oil can icon. It will usually state the oil to fuel mix\nratio. A 4-cycle engine's fill port caps will separately identify the fuel\ntank from the oil sump. The fuel cap will have a gas pump icon and the oil cap\nwill have an oil can or oil drop icon. Common mistakes you'll want to avoid in\nfilling the fuel tank on a 2-cycle engine are, running your engine solely on\ngasoline, pouring only oil into the fuel tank ,or not pre mixing the fuel and oil\nbefore filling the fuel tank. These actions can cause the engine or fuel\nsystem damage. When choosing an oil you'll want to use a low smoke oil that\ncontains fuel stabilizer these features will lessen emissions and prevent fuel\nsystem gumming. It should also be an easy mix and ashless formula to prevent\ncarbon deposits within the exhaust system like Briggs & Stratton 2-cycle\noil. The most common mix ratios are 50 to 1 and 40 to 1. 50 to 1 means there are 50\nparts of fuel to one part of oil when mixed. 40 to 1 means there are 40 parts\nof fuel to one part oil when mixed or quite simply the lower the mix ratio\nnumber the more oil per volume is in your gasoline. To mix properly first pour\noil in your gas can then add fresh fuel from the pump. When using a 1 gallon gas\ncan you'll want to add 2.6 ounces of oil for a 50 to 1 fuel mix\nor 3.2 ounces of oil for a 40 to 1 fuel mix. Always agitate\nthe fuel mix before fueling your equipment.

is something everybody fears because what we have to do is we have to take a text like this and turn into an algebraic problem and how to do that well that can be very confusing sometimes and the reason why it's confusing is because there's a lot of different kind of word problems here I have on the board a mixture problem which is one of the many different types of problems and because there's so many different types and each type has to be handled a little bit differently from the others people get really confused so what we're going to do here is we're going to walk through a lot of these different types of word problems and then we're going to start with mixture problems and as the lecture goes on we'll go ahead and do a lot of different types of problems so you can see how they're all handle all right let's read this one one of the things you need to do when you do mixture problems or any kind of word problems you need to read the problem very carefully so here goes it says how many gallons of a 30 percent acid solution must be added to how many gallons of a 70 percent acid solution to make a 50 gallon Oh to make 50 gallons of a 40 percent acid solution so you read that and go wow I don't even know where to start well there's a very handy little technique that liked it that I like to use and that they can eek is to turn something that is like a text that's very confusing into a graphical representation that makes it really easy to figure out what's going on so when I recognize is that I'm mixing two things together two different kinds of solutions one that's the 30% solution to once it's a 70% solution and that will produce a mixture that is a 40% solution so what I'm going to do then is I'm going to write that this is a 30% solution this is a 70% solution and this becomes a 40% solution all the sudden this problem is not so complicated anymore I cannot clearly see that I'm mixing two different kinds of solutions to produce a third solution with a particular concentration of acid also in these boxes we want to put in there how much of each that we have now it doesn't tell you how much use of this solution and it doesn't tell you how much use of this solution matter of fact that's we're just supposed to figure out but it does tell you that you have 50 gallons of dissolution alright so we put 50 gallons over here so how many gallons do we have here and how many gallons do we have here now if there's two different kind of solutions you're adding and you don't know how much of each you use you typically let X be the amount you have of the one solution and the total - X be the amount you have of the other solution so this you write in X gallons that solution and the total 50 - X be the amount of the other solution and now you're ready to start solving the problem the product of the amount of gallons that you have with the percentage of acid that you have in the solution that gives you the total amount of acid so if I multiply these together I get the amount of acid I have in this solution if I multiply these two together have the amount of acid I have in this solution and if I multiply these two together I have the amount of acid I have in this solution and the amount of acid in this solution plus the amount of acid in this solution equals the amount of acid in this solution so simply put in algebra or in algebraic terms we write 30% times X plus 70% times 50 minus x equals 40 percent times 50 and all we have to do now is solve this algebraically like solving a linear equation to figure out how much of each solution we need all right so now we just use our techniques that we've learned before of how to solve linear equations first of all we change a percentage into a decimal so 30 percent is the same as 0.3 times X plus 70 percent is the same as 0.7 times 50 minus X and 40% is the same as 0.4 times 50 okay now we have an equation that has decimals in it then we don't like decimals so we're going to multiply both sides of the equation by a number to eliminate those decimals and it looks like all I need to do is multiply both sides by 10 because I'm the 0.3 to 0.7 0.4 turn into a 3 a 7 and a 4 so multiply the left side and the right side by 10 of course remember if you're going to multiply something on the left side you must multiply the right side by exact same thing okay let's do that now so 10 times 0.3 is 3 so I have 3x plus 10 times 7 is 10 x plus 7 is 7 multiply that times 50 minus X and 10 times point 4 is 4 times 50 ok now we just simply go ahead and get rid of the parenthesis so I have 3x plus 7 times 50 is 350 seven times minus X is minus 7x equals 4 times 50 is 200 and of course what we do here is remove all the terms with the X to the left side all the terms that don't have an X to the right side so I have these already in the right location 3x minus 7x equals 200 and when we move the 350 over the other side remember we change the sign it becomes minus 353 minus 7x is minus 4x 200 minus 350 s minus 150 divide both sides by PI minus 4 - 4 cancels in 150 divided by negative 4 that gives me X is equal to that goes in there 37 and 1/2 times quick check to make sure I did this correctly 4 times 30 is 120 4 times 7 is 28 hundred twenty and twenty eight thousand hundred forty eight four times four and five is two 140 a plus two is 150 all right I have the answer here so that tells me that I need thirty seven and a half gallons of this solution and fifty - thirty seven and a half which is 12 and a half of this solution so the answer is we need thirty seven point five gallons of the 30% solution and we need 50 minus that which is 12.5 gallons of 70 percent solution so quick recap we read the problem carefully you recognize you're adding two mixtures together one mixture is thirty percent the other mixture is 70 percent and you want finally to end up with a mixture that's only forty percent they tell you that you end up with a 50-gallon mixture they don't tell you how much of each of these two mixtures you have to add so you let X be the amount for the one and the total 50 minus X be the amount for the other when you multiply them together you get two mana facet you needs mixture that should add up to the total amount of hassle when you put the two mixtures together and then else your break will solve for X and you put down your answer and that's how you solve a mixture problem", "GFjCb-vhdhM": "the following is a selected video from your teacher comm where you can browse over 450 complete math lessons with example videos interactive practice problems self tests and more try a complete lesson today at your teacher comm Martin has a total of 19 nickels and dimes worth a dollar sixty-five how many of each type of coin does he have let's start this problem by setting up a chart down the left side we'll have our different types of coins in this case nickels and dimes across the top we'll have our formula which we talked about in the previous example number of coins times the value of each coin equals their total value now let's fill out our chart for a number of nickels and dimes we know that Martin has a total of 19 nickels and dimes but we don't know how many of each he has in fact that's what the problems asking so if we represent our number of nickels as X we can call our number of Dimes 19 minus X the value of each nickel is 5 cents the value of each dime is 10 cents our total value based on our formula is going to come from the first column times the second column so the total value of our nickels is x times 5 or 5x and the total value of our dimes is 19 minus x times 10 or 10 parentheses 19 minus X our goal in this problem will be to find X because X represents our number of nickels and the problem asks how many of each type of coin does he have if we know the number of nickels we can easily find the number of dimes and we'll have our answer but we need an equation in order to find X and it's important to understand that the information in this equation will always come from the last column of your chart the total value column so what do we know about the total value of our nickels and the total value of our dimes well we know that the total value of all of our coins is a dollar 65 so if we add the total value of our nickels plus the total value of our dimes that should equal a dollar 65 so down here we're going to add another box and inside we're going to put a hundred and sixty-five notice I wrote a dollar 65 in terms of sense because our value of nickles and value of Dimes is also written in terms of cents and we need to be consistent so here's our equation 5x plus 10 times 19 minus x equals 165 if we solve this we get x equals 5 going back up into our chart remember that X represents our number of nickels so Martin has five nickels to get his number of dimes we take 19 minus X which is 19 minus 5 or 14 dimes and that's our answer", "9ipkEmwxT5k": "we kept hearing rainfall totals from Saturday ranged from about five to seven inches of rain but you might be wondering how much water is that really meteorologist Chris Franklin gives us a visual of the total amount of water that actually fell over the city this is two inches of water this is also two inches of water two inches is two inches right well that's where you're wrong clearly there is more water in this bowl than there is in this cup and what you need to consider is the volume and that is what is key in talking about the flood waters from Saturday we might have had five plus inches of rainfall across much of the area but we need to talk about the entire area that was covered by the heavy rains so to get an idea of the area that was covered the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the city of New Orleans on Saturday that covered roughly 18 square miles we'll use that as our area the u.s. geologic survey has a formula that they're able to calculate the amount or volume of water based on area plus the number of inches of rainfall so using 18 square miles plus roughly six to seven inches of rainfall as a rough estimate of our total we come to two billion gallons of water fell in the metro area here at the U n O Aquatic Center their Olympic sized pool holds five hundred and fifty thousand gallons of water so to put that into perspective if about two billion gallons of water fell over the city of New Orleans on Saturday that roughly estimates the 3600 pools full of water fell over the city Saturday afternoon in a roughly three hour time span summertime thunderstorms always have the potential of dropping heavy amounts of rainfall the problem with Saturday storm is that it just remains stationary and of course some city officials had stated that more than nine inches of rain had fallen across parts of the city here's Chris again checking the facts rainfall totals from around the area from either the channel for weather observing stations or the national weather service saw in excess of five and a half inches of rain radar estimates that an additional two to two and a half inches of rain fell over mid-city which means totals approaching eight inches is possible this appears to be the greatest amount nowhere are we able to verify nine inches of rain in the city", "zoifk5jDDHY": "Put sixteen ounces on a scale; It\u2019ll weigh one pound without

to set a true scant seam allowance on your machine first you need to know there are four seam allowance truths that never vary truth one the stitching line will always take up a threads width of each seam line truth to the fold line will always take up a smidgen of that same line true three both the thread width and fold smidgen must be allowed for truth for every sewing machine sewing foot and personal style of sewing is different start by cutting three two-and-a-half inch fabric squares in three different colors mark a quarter inch seam line down one side of two of the fabric squares set your machine stitch width setting to drop the needle directly onto the marked line so the three squares together stitching directly on that line press and turn right side up measure the distance between the two center square seams it should measure exactly two inches wide between the seams the entire zone section should measure six and a half inches wide edge to edge the measurement between my first zone segment is less than the needed two inches move your needle one thread width to the right and without adding a marked seam allowance so press and measure three more squares my second zone segment measures exactly two inches wide between the seams the entire song block piece measures exactly six and a half inches wide edge to edge once you have your exact two inch measurement make

"FXJmufgZ31s": "today we are going to show you how easily clogged drain can be unclogged I apologize for the sound quality a little echoey because we are in the bathroom where we have a clogged drain we are going to use Drano max gel this stuff is excellent it'll unclog your drain if it doesn't it's free so here we go to prove you the drain is clogged we're going to run a little water here and then wait for it to go down we're going to do this in real time so it may be a little bit longer here we go alright so there's a little bit of water you can see it's kind of slowly draining its puddled up it does well with small amounts but if we were to fill this tub it would stay forever [Music] okay so we put some water in the top now you can see here along the edge of the tub there's some lines this because when someone takes a shower in here the bottom fills up because it just drains so slowly and then that line there is the scum line never after every time someone takes a shower so we're going to unclog this right away with some Drano gel basically all you really have to do is just pour it down so we open it up here take this gel and we're going to use about 3/4 of it because this is a pretty big clog I'm just gonna dump it right there on top of the drain save a little bit for a sink and then all you do is let that stuff go look at how it sucks it right down into the drain this stuff is specifically designed to go right into a clog and practically just attack it so that's it now you wait for about a half an hour and then flush the drain with some hot water so we're going to let this sit for half an hour and flush this drain when we come back so now we just flush this with hot water and let it work okay there we go that's some really hot water the steam is coming up and you can see it is draining really fast it's keeping right up with the water you see that soap lying there moving down and that is how you unclog that drain with some Drano it's a huge difference a very significant difference the stuff works so I won't be getting my money back on that one but if you have a clogged drain check out the link in the description below to pick up some of that Drano gel", "TngE-umS36k": "[Music] hey this is Tony with salt strong and in this video we're going to be talking about how to properly size your in line replacement hooks with your treble hooks now this has been a pretty popular question lately because people aren't too sure as to what size inline hooks they should be using when replacing their treble hooks now the best way to do this is to actually do it visually now a lot of brands and hook manufacturers they all might say they're a two OTT or a one ought size hook but from brand to brand it's going to vary a one on owner hook might be a little different in size than a one OTT let's say VMC or Gamakatsu hook so the best way to size these hooks up is to use the original treble hooks that came off of your lure and the gap when you lay these down flat on a table the gap from one point to the furthest point of that treble hook that gap should be equal distance to the gap on the hook or the inline hook that you're replacing it with so as you see here this treble hook from one point to another that's about the same distance of a gap as this replacement inline hook as you can see from the shank to the point you have the same distance there from the shank to the point from point to point so again the best way to do this is visually I don't rely on just looking at the hook size and then going with that because what can happen is like I said an owner replacement hook might be a little bigger than a VMC replacement hook or vice versa even though they're both wanna hook so just when you do go to the store I highly recommend bringing a hook with you just pinch off the points pinch off the barbs so that obviously you don't want to poke yourself but just bring that original treble hook with you and try to size it up with the inline hooks that are in the packs at the store now the ones that I am using here these are the owner in line replacement hooks I prefer the owner hooks because I have used the VMC in line hooks and what was happening with those was the very tip of the hook was actually snapping off without me even knowing it if I got it hung on structure or after I caught a bunch of fish on it the point of the hook was pretty much gone it was just left with a blunt flat piece on the end there there was no point there was no barb so these owner hooks are definitely a lot more durable than the VMC hooks and I highly recommend them when you are replacing your treble hooks with these inline hooks and again these are the hooks right here these are the only owner single replacement hooks for hard baits you have different sizes you have one ought to OTT they also sell a lot of different other sizes but the one on and the two OTT seem to do the job for most of the baits that I use as you can see here this is a head and super spook junior it's about a 4 inch bait and I replace the hooks with a 2 ah owner hook that seems to be a good size for those 4 inch to 5 inch baits and then this mirror lure over here this is a mere lure mirror Dean and the one ought looks seem to work very well for those smaller profile baits anywhere in that 2 to 3 inch range so just a little general rule of thumb there as far as replacing your treble hooks with inline hooks so that will wrap up this video if you have any questions or comments about replacing your treble hooks with your inline hooks please feel free

lot of times a question of I would like to know how much to water my garden so I'm not either under watering or over watering so look how much water should I be giving my garden and simply put it's very impossible almost it's nearly impossible to give you the right amount to water your garden however there is a kind of industry standard that we like to say how much water should the garden beginning per week and that industry standard is one inch of water however very few people know what one inch of water even looks like how much is one inch of water where does the one inch of water go I mean is it right around the base of the plant is it the whole bed is it the whole garden how much is one inch of water so let's talk about that right now you guys I think it's something that is very crucial I've used it in the in this past year and I've found that it is very very accurate to keeping the plants healthy and thriving because oftentimes we like to during the hot summer we like to kind of ration out the water you know say oh I only have 10 gallons water I'm gonna give it to every single plant and you know it's okay I mean an emergency situation it's okay but if you have water to spare and you want a lush vibrant garden if you can afford to use the water that's required to get one inch of water per plant or to your beds that's going to give you a lot of success so when it comes to one inch of water where does the one inch of water go and where do we draw the line when they refer to one inch of water they're talking about one inch of water per square foot and that's very simple especially when you can kind of round it off with a single plant here you simply just take a ruler and boom one square foot as simple as that 12 inches by 12 inches and then all you have to do is take 12 times 12 and get at 144 and since you only need one inch that one is it's redundant you don't need to multiply 12 times 12 times one because that's how you find the volume of something you find a volume of a object and how much it will hold so you imagine drawing a little pool here that's 12 inches by 12 inches by 1 inch and you can simply just make it easy on yourself by taking 12 times 12 and that's how you can find the volume of that space and since you need 100 and you one inch of water over those 144 square inches I gave you a in the description box below a conversion that actually you could plug how many square inches you have all right your cubic inches right into the right into the little converter and it will pump out a number for you and how many gallons of water you're going to need now it is in US gallons so for Canadian people I am very sorry you're gonna have to do an extra conversion for that convert gallons to liters but I'm sure there's something for that as well so and I'll even put a link to one I'll find one for you guys but yes so the the amount of water to fit in that 12 inch by 12 inch area is actually point six gallons so it's shocking how much water is actually required to sustain a healthy plant and a lot of times we find ourselves as gardeners under watering like I said and it's surprising when you give it that one inch of water how much they grow and how fast they grow because I just put these in the ground about three weeks ago and they've grown about probably almost man at least eight inches so they've been really responding well to it and also during the hot season they go through a lot of stress but what do you do if there's no you know what do you do if there's no definite space here like my lettuce bed where I just have plants throughout the entire bed what do you do then so let's go talk about that so we're here with my lettuce bed and obviously I cannot take my you know my individual measurements of my plants because it's just all plants so what do you do in this case and the miracle of raised beds is if they're in are in a rectangle or a square you can easily take the dimensions of them by simply taking the measurement of the raised bed and mine just so happened to be 3 feet by 10 feet equaling 30 square feet so there you go that is your answer that is what one inch of water is referred to as one inch of water per week in the gardening community and so hopefully I helped some people out hopefully I answered some questions and if you have any more put them in the comments box below I'd be glad to answer them but yeah I will have all the links to those converters in the description box below for the my foreign friends that use the metric system and and then the my US friends that actually use US gallons and yeah so there you go so hopefully that answers some questions and until next episode this is my garden reminding you to grow big or go home I'll talk to y'all later see ya

self tests and more try a complete lesson today at your teacher comm notice that the figure shown here is a cylinder to find the volume of a cylinder start with the formula for the volume of a cylinder which is volume equals pi times the radius squared times the height or V equals PI R squared H here notice that our cylinder has a radius of 7 meters and a height of 16 meters so we have pi times 7 meters squared times 16 meters start by simplifying the exponent seven meters squared is seven meters times seven meters or 49 meters squared so we have pi times 49 meters squared times 16 meters now 49 meters squared times 16 meters is 784 meters cubed so we have 784 PI meters cubed so the volume of the cylinder shown here is 784 PI meters cubed remember that pi is approximately equal to 22 sevenths or 3.14 so we can estimate the value of the volume by plugging in 3.14 for pi so we have 784 times 3.14 which is equal to two thousand four hundred and sixty one point seven six so the

smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't show you my personal information yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so um I got to know the weed stranger who for you guys in this video um let me know if you guys like me join these like weed videos like the car review video is the weed training videos the dispensary video the concentrate videos just like you know what I mean these videos in general let me know if you guys I've been enjoying these otherwise I'll start making like other content I mean so make sure you guys let me know down below in the comments but this video I actually got um I don't know that's just weird I was actually just driving um we were just driving around and then I got a text because I I'm I'm signed up um for like notably a kid like text notifications I'm like all like the dispensaries locally around me so we were driving around like we were like a mile away from there like a mile away from the dispensary that I always go to and I just randomly got this text and they have like a flash Co going on while supplies last on these $60 ounces like they're originally I think originally they're 140 or you know originally their 127 plus tags so I don't know what that comes out to mean they're on sale for $60 so an ounce 28 grams a weed for $60 so sorry about that the battery in the camera started that was flop it out real quick like I was saying though um I was driving around got a text seen that like a deal going on while the supplies last and I was like rabbi I said [ __ ] it let's go I'm gonna pick this up um this is kind of a lot of weight for me I normally [ __ ] barely smoke weed if I buy we it's gonna be like the top shelf 8th or something like that and I don't know I prefer concentrates way over we like oh I don't know I just like Devin you know I mean so this is like the first time I bought it I want smooth dispensary in a long time I don't know what that means I don't know I'm kind of just rambling at this point but um he was the receipt like I was talking about you guys can see you right there you also got a free P pre-roll leave when I review on weed knavish so that's why you guys see that breeze right there well I came to a hundred and thirty four then after the discounts it was 60 so yeah after the discounts it was 60 to 72 with a [ __ ] 400 and the stream I got to is brillig loose so I got an ounce of Gorilla Glue for [ __ ] $60 so right here you can see the price point again 127 so um so the budtender at the shop sky dispensary home when I like close friends but I know her pretty well we follow each other hunting and instagramming that I mean so she's pretty cool she helped me out and she picked me out like one of the best like looking like packages you know I mean that they had so yeah I appreciate you see I appreciate that a lot she gave me one of the ones like the bigger nugs and stuff know what I mean so um here's the first look at that and a little bit here um I'll get some close-up shots for you guys so that's just a little peek at that's just a little look for you guys and then um I'm gonna get some close-up to that yeah after this I'm gonna some close-up shots for you guys and then I'm gonna load a little boy out of this little park right here get like a little taste test or something you know I mean I don't know and then I rope a little joint we'll go out back and with Smokey's so I don't know what also save really a great an ounce of gorilla glue for 60 bucks that's kind of like crazy I don't know what this is actually tested at it just says um I don't know it doesn't really say the test results but all you guys that are curious or like interested or know [ __ ] I don't really know what these like I know I know a little bit but I'm not like a professional I don't some you guys youtubers are like professionals oh you [ __ ] all you guys that watch my video is like a [ __ ] scientist or something no [ __ ] that's what it seems like but um are you guys like here right there you can see all the additives so let's just hop into this I'm gonna get some close-up shots now for you guys and then a little Bowl after that and then we'll go out back and roll a joint oh I'll probably get a little time lapse and me rolling a joint - so let me know if you guys like like these like little time-lapse videos that I do so I know if I should keep doing them in future videos or not so when I do a little time lapse video down below in the comments if you guys look like that little time lapse cuz if you don't I won't do them in future videos and if you do all keep on doing them yeah make sure you tell me down below in the comments but I guess it stopped into these a closeup shot yeah all right so I hope you guys like my bad I'm trying to pick up this bud right here I hope you guys like those forceps loss I think they came out pretty good but I don't know you guys tell me you guys are the [ __ ] viewers you guys are the judges but right now I'm just grinding up some blog right now so let's grind this up and then I'm gonna load a little Bowl like I said a little do a little taste test or whatever see what this tastes like it's like $60 ounce I don't know if it's gonna taste that good I just I just did a stranger you wanna go on this [ __ ] compared to that I mean that wasn't the best I got that for free I was there when they had but compared to a $60 ounce I don't think it's gonna really compare to that I guess we see the close-ups though like the money shot when you break it in half you know I mean you see but in the UH underserved pride home just like a little [ __ ] fire it's pretty frosty for 60 bucks and I'm saying I wish I said the test results on the package I wonder why it doesn't make me wonder what its tested at but I forgot the ass they probably knew what the shop I should have asked Bucky I mean griller glue and now it's for 60 bucks oh it looks like a some decent but the main reason I wanted to make this video is it's a $60 ounce you know what I mean like that's kind of like crazy price for an ounce and just the kind of um show you guys like I don't know you guys live like a legal state some of you guys I live in a legal state you probably seem like these deals before they have like outdoor grown but that's cheapest [ __ ] like this you know I mean but before you people out live and let the states where it's not like recreational or medical legalized I just want to kind of show you guys what our cheap a suite looks like compared to me I don't know what your as it looks like you know I mean as this weed looks [ __ ] decent like you know I mean like if I didn't have my card I just seen this on the street I probably paid ten bucks for a ground I don't know that's if I was like desperate though no I mean like desperately I didn't have my card desperate type [ __ ] but [ __ ] grinded up a lot more than I meant to so this should have some clearly fool so we're just gonna we're gonna get a little taste test out of this pipe like I said so just a little tiny little pinch a little bit and you guys are smoking along with this because if you guys are smoking along while you guys are watching this video at home Cheers we're gonna do a little taste test and I'm gonna roll the drawing like I said well that it's mug that [ __ ] and then get a full rating so let's get a look there's a little stem on top let's do a little taste test and then we'll do what I said so if you guys are smoking here's the skillet [Music] yeah just like I mean I expected it just like the compared to that like that state I just smoke even though that wasn't the best ad that was only tested at 17% that tasted stupid fire compared to this but let me show you just in case you guys didn't see that video I got this for free like this they were to having a deal where you spend 100 bucks about this for free like I just think our time affording that video so compared to that this doesn't taste like [ __ ] but $60.00 I mean this doesn't taste thank you I thought was like I was expecting a lot worse for 60 bucks to be honest like come on so like I'm pretty satisfied I'm not complaining I mean $60 I suspected some [ __ ] to be honest that pretty much as a god of the video forever cities quick mister I don't know I don't that makes you I think like that makes me wonder how cheap the dispensaries are getting their weep for buffets if they're selling this for 60 bucks an ounce they're definitely still making a profit off that you know what it means they're probably getting that [ __ ] like 20 bucks of [ __ ] ouch that's kind of crazy to think about but [ __ ] I don't know this [ __ ] is not too bad I don't want to UM this videos like already a little bit longer than I wanted it to be so um me like hit this one or two more times and I'll go back with that joint and hey I mean it doesn't taste too bad though like I've had weed that he says a lot [ __ ] worse that's for sure like it's pretty clean like it's pretty smooth like the taste out of the pipe I'll give it like a 3 out of 5 for sure oh it's not the best but not the worst he's average $60 for 60 bucks an ounce though definitely not complaining so far looks fire tastes decent and for that price I mean it so far it's [ __ ] fire so let's get a little time lapse between rolling this joint up and then we'll go out back as pokey so see you guys in a second all right so we're all back now so I decided to bring my phone out instead of my camera I don't know why I just it'll be a lot easier for me so sorry that the ideal sounds different and the quality looks different but uh yeah I started sorry but let's just get this lit like I said it before if because I smoke long hope you guys just hoping something dank and let's just get into this so I'm gonna light this up give you guys like a little smoke test I'm not a smoke test a little smoke review tell you guys how it smokes how it tastes how it tastes through the papers how it burns and I mean at the cherry how it runs and all that good [ __ ] you guys came for so so yeah what's happened to this and uh smoking along here is let's get it like I said I just got them record in that other video sorry sorry the [ __ ] light is off [ __ ] like I said I just got done recording other videos so and I've been smoking all day even before that so I'm already like a lucky little lit so I didn't feel like a little on the biggest joint I just wrote a little personal you know I mean just to get the taste and the vibe and feeling for you know I'm saying so not the biggest but you get the feel or you get the you get the point unless I first like Dawson opinions or impressions or whatever the word is you want to use [Music] you know like when um you guys ever had weed that had at that I like little bit kind of like grassy taste to it some I know some of you guys know what I'm talking about where you get like weed as like a little kind of grass taste it doesn't taste like that 100% but you got a little tiny hint of it but it's not terrible so it's not too bad I'm glad it doesn't have that almost like overwhelming taste that shit's terrible when you have weed that tastes like that but you can definitely take it definitely has a little hint of that in there somewhere but besides for that like it doesn't taste too bad who's that I just fell off but the ash is like a it's not black black but it's like pretty dark so I'll show you guys in a second and like I said it guys like these videos and want to keep on seeing I'm like we need trained videos part reviews concentrate reviews um and any kind of like when you relate a video you guys want to see make sure you guys tell me you guys like them and coming like which ones you want to see down below in the comments alright so I know how to keep doing them you know I mean but this we it isn't too bad I mean 60 bucks for an Allen so I'm pretty satisfied there's that for you guys you know it's kind of like yeah so well I'm not complaining for 60 bucks and ours you know like last me like a whole week or so 60 bucks but like I said I'm just wrong I'm really interested in on how much they [ __ ] pay for it like is if they're able to sell it for sixty to always you know they're you know damn well they're still making profit at 60 bucks in that one so and they're selling it at a hundred and thirty an ounce so that means they're probably paying twenty bucks and Alex get it for 130 so they're making like over a hundred bucks profit per hours it's like but I mean hypothetically I don't know I'm just saying like maybe I don't know I don't know how much lucky I'm just saying they have to be making a profit off sixty an hour so know where the the I thought they would have a sale where they lose money you know what I mean that wouldn't make sense they ought to still be making a profit and the fact that they give away a free pre-roll tool like I don't mind that's why that's crazy out sheet we just kidding it's so cheap so almost some of the jointly by like halfway so so also giving you guys might like final opinions and thoughts and stuff on it and I would like to finish moment Emily finish smoking it while I wrap the video up you know what I mean so the price point five out of five six books and elements you can't really beat that I think I've seen this deal before like a few times I don't think about risking I'd be old I had a cheaper ounce in this and if they did I don't know if I would trust it $60 is kind of it was about as low as I will go it's kind of like me it's a little bit lower than I want to go but as low as I will go for an ounce of weed that's [ __ ] cheap but if you're ballin on a budget you know what I mean like you don't have a lot of money to spend you're not rich like a lot of people meet like me myself - it's perfect snowball we smoked all month depending on your tolerance for sixty [ __ ] dollars can't [ __ ] beat it like I'm saying the taste Taysom I give it like a 2 2 point 8 out of 5 so really close that 3 out of 5 it just has that little weird [ __ ] like grass tastes like I was talking about you guys know I'm talking about a few people but the overall score for this but I think are getting like a three point two out of five I know it's like a really worth like it's a really words for I mean if you K if I got I paid the full price of a hundred and thirty bucks for this I'll give it a two out of five it's like not the best at all that's kind of terrible to be honest but for 60 bucks it's like you're pretty good you're not I mean for 60 bucks so I don't know tell me what you guys think of it down below in the comments I'm always curious to know what you guys think for sure but like I said it does have any other video ideas there's constructive criticism constructive criticism requires ideas anything anything at all you guys want to tell me just do it and leave it down below in the comments and I read every single comment with the size for that the overalls for for the blood like I said three point two out of five the price point is perfect that [ __ ] is dope I mean the looks is it looks weird kinda like lurks the looks on all the way there with the close-ups you can see the crystals you know what I'm saying so it looks alright so three point zero to five I guess besides for that you guys like this video go to big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] you know what to do beside for that it's from Ronnie ray peace

The longer piece is 8 inches\nlonger than the shorter piece. We want to find the length\nof the shorter piece of wood. Let's see if we can model this. If this is the piece of wood, we\nknow the total length is 32 inches. [ Silence ] We're cutting it into 2 pieces so that 1\npiece is 8 inches longer than the other piece. So let's say we cut it here. We don't know the length of either piece\nso we're going to have to use a variable, so if we call the length of the shorter piece x and the longer piece is 8 inches longer we\ncould represent this length as x plus 8. The units of both of these would be in inches, but now with this information\nwe can write an equation. We know if we add these 2 lengths\ntogether it must be 32 inches. So we can write the equation x plus, x plus 8\nmust equal 32 and now we can solve this equation for x. We'll first combine our like terms here\nx plus x would be 2x, 3 of 2x plus 8 equals 32, now we have a basic 2-step equation, in order to\nisolate the x we'll have to undo this addition and undo this multiplication;\nwe'll undo the addition first. The opposite of plus 8 is minus 8 so we'll\nsubtract the 8 on both sides of the equation. This would be zero, so we'd have 2x equals 32\nminus 8 is equal to 24, divide both sides by 2, we have x equals 12, so if x equal 12 the\nlength of this piece would be 12 inches and x plus 8 would be 20 inches\nand notice how the sum is 32 and this length here is 8 inches longer than\nthe other piece, but to answer the question, we want to know what the\nlength is of the shorter piece; the shorter piece does have length x\ninches so the shorter piece is 12 inches.\n------------------------------4445bde2ee86--", "NlZCVZFbTzA": "hey this is Luke Simon's with salt strong today we're going to be testing the casting distance between a 20 pound braid verse a 10 pound braid all else considered equal we have a 20 pound braid mounted on the same exact reel same exact rod combination same weight same lure which is a weight in this case the same everything the only difference is the actual line so again this is a 20 pound line first a 10-pound line what we're going to do is we're going to test two different weights first off we're gonna do a 3/16 ounce weight which is on the light spectrum then next we're going to do a 1/2 ounce weight which is a little bit heavier to see again how the the actual distance the casting distance differs between one line versus the other a lot of people you know they they look at the braid and see a 20 pound braid and it shows on the package that it's equivalent to like a 6 pound mono and think that oh I'm just going to go ahead and use a 20 pound braid but that is that is going to be losing some casting distance compared to a 10 pound braid how much that distance is I'm really not sure and that's why I decided to go ahead and do this test because I typically use a 10 pound line and I'm confident that that the fact that I do that I can cast further than if I was using 20 but at the in this video I'll share with you the exact difference between the two whether using a lighter lure verse a heavier lure alright so how this contest is gonna work is I have everything ready and I'm gonna cast down the shoreline and then we're gonna measure each cast with one of these flags we have pink flags and gray flags we have ten of each and then we also have the distance measure where we can actually walk out the distance and then we're going to measure the difference again on the casting distance from the ten pound line first a twenty pound line with the different weights alright so the first test so I'm going to cast with the ten pound braid we're gonna cast down this Beach and I have Jacob here and he's going to to measure the distance so I just did the five tests with the the ten pound braid and now we switched over to the 20 and we're going to cast that same direction and we're gonna see what the difference is all right so I'll have this zeroed out I'm going to go ahead and walk it down but as you'll see here as we get closer is the the ten pound braid was noticeably longer than the 20 pound [Music] so the braid so the braid was the was the gray and if you can zoom in here this is a 102 102 feet 103 it's just over 100 feet so that is basically all those all five of those casts we're really close to one another so again 100 will say 103 and then further down here is the is the braid and so if I'm throwing lures which I typically do if I know I can get an extra looks like 15 plus feet if I know I can get an extra 15 feet I'm gonna take it I think that's a huge advantage so now we're at 120 123 124 yeah so 128 and we actually have some little bit further so we can just go ahead and move around that one up to 130 so that is a again a 130 feet for the further the braid it's all nice here and compact versus a hundred and 15 for the the 20-pound braid so for lighter lures using a ten pound braid versus a 20 pound braid gives a significant advantage again that's a 103 verses 130 that's that's over 25 percent further distance with just simply by using a 10 pound braid versus of 20 pounds so what we're going to do is we're going to recreate the same same test we're going to use a 1/2 ounce weight and as see if the if the percentage change I'm sure it will it's just a matter of how much I think it'll be a little bit closer but we'll let you know here in a second alright so I just switched over to a heavier weight this is a 1/2 ounce weight and we're gonna do that same test and see what the difference is alright just did the 5 casts with the the heavier weight and the 20 pound braid and it was significantly further than the prior test so we're gonna you do the same same weight just with the 10 pound braid all right we just finished the test and that the 10 pound line went significantly further based on sight but we're gonna go ahead and measure it out we have this year [Music] so we're right now we're at the spot where the 20 pound braid was landing with that lighter the lighter weight so now we're at 174 really 175 feet that's right here in the middle we'll say even 176 to be right in the middle of where the 20 pound braid was cast and that's a long cast and typically I would say that's really good but you know as I said before we did the 20 pound a test and then we did the 10 pound line afterwards and you know all the 10 pound line or all in these these pink these pink flags so we're at 176 we're going to go over to the pink and see how much further the pink line you know the 10 pound line got further than the 10 pair that 20 pound so this is 211 211 feet to be in the middle now maybe we'll do an even 212 that's 36 feet further than what that 20 pound braid was doing that is significant you know although it's not quite as high a percentage as the first test with the lighter you're the lighter way there was like a 30% difference at that point this is more in the in the 20% range I didn't bring a calculator so up to do the math later but whether whatever the percentage is again in fact that it's over 30 feet that is a big difference so if you're targeting fish and you're casting if you're casting a lot of lures are doing a lot of casting you're targeting fish that can be successfully caught with a 10 pound line as well as a 20 pound line I'll recommend going to the 10 because that you're gonna get a lot more casting distance which is going to mean that you're gonna catch more fish given that you're gonna be able to cover more area with less effort because at the end of the day it's really a numbers game if you're throwing a lot of artificial lures it's really a numbers game it's he or she you can get their lure in front of the most fish is gonna catch the most fish and if you're able to get an extra 30 feet of casting distance on average every cast you're going to be catching more fish and if you're curious on what lines I was using I was using just normal power Pro for for both cases just to have an apples-to-apples comparison I'll leave a comment down below if you have any other questions at all otherwise I hope neat on the water soon and catch some big ones please all by yourself or with you leave self strong in wetlands a day", "NvXO_AoUTqA": "[Laughter] hey everyone this is Justin from amplified parts today we're going to show you how to wire up a 212 speaker cabinet in both series and parallel configurations this is handy when you're building the new speaker cabinet and you've got to match the impedance of your amplifier to the speaker cabinet itself so we need to the point of speaker selection for your speaker cabinet you're going to want to make sure that you match the amplifiers output impedance up to the cabinet itself just because this helps with overall performance of the speaker's working together with the amp and also it prevents output transformer damage if you have such a bad mismatch so we've got our 212 speaker cabinet that's loaded up with two jensen electric lightnings at 8 ohms we're also going to be using these little harnesses that I made up using our number twenty cloth-covered wire and our switch craft mono jacks I also threw some steak on Spade connectors whatever you want to call them on the end just for the ease of you take them off put them back on again if I were going to make this more permanent I would probably just solder the connections so we have our speakers mounted in this cab with the terminals up that's mostly just for the ease of showing you how to do this you can mount them with terminals down whichever way you prefer works alright so what we're going to do is we're going to wire up the two 12 cabinet first in series now this should give you with two 8 ohm speakers a 16 ohm load we'll start by putting a single wire from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the other speaker so this is your first connection your second connection is going to be the harness that has the jack on the end of it you're basically just going to hook the negative wire up to the negative terminal on this speaker and then you're going to hook the positive wire up to the positive terminal on this speaker and there you have it next we'll show you how to wire your cabinet up in parallel so we're going to use this twisted pair of wires to connect your positive and negative terminals on each speaker to each other first so once you have disconnected this connects the two speakers you're just going to run the other wiring harness twisted pair from the mono jack - this speakers positive and negative terminals respectively and there you have it this wiring should give you at with two eight ohm speakers a four ohm load so that's about it we showed you how to wire up your to 12 speaker cabinet in both series and parallel configurations you'll see from the diagrams that we flashed up on the screen that you have a few different options in terms of impedance based on the impedance of your speakers and how you choose to wire them up be sure to subscribe to our channel because next week we'll have another video and you can also visit us at amplified parts comm and check out our tech corner articles on speakers and speaker wiring you can also find us on Facebook Twitter and Tumblr if you're feeling so inclined that's all for now folks

Been prototyping for over a year now, been very happy with the results and it's finally here. So, wanted to make sure, like Baron said got my start here at Arnzen Arms. Happened to be in the neighborhood, so wanted to make sure that the Arnzen customers got a first look. One of the few to get a first a look at the new gen three. - It's who ya know right? So I gotta tell you guys this thing is super cool. I'm really excited about this. So this one, I'm really\ndiggin' the reticle on it. Doesn't have ridiculous weight going on. Form factor is basically identical to the Razor Gen two. Eye box on 10 is still good on it, so you're not having to line up perfectly behind that to actually take advantage of that 10 power. So, I know I was asking Adam a little bit about what all he's done\nwith it the past year. I know he mentioned he did a swat sniper competition with it. - Yep! - What else have you run this through? - We've been running in 3-Gun obviously, since I think, traditional\nnationals last year. But you may have noticed that the Vortex, in-house Vortex 3-Gun guys haven't posted a whole\nlot of videos this year. We've been secret squirrels\nshooting this for quite a while. I've had it at some DMR Swat type stuff, so had it on .308 GAT's guns, shootin' out 1100 yards. It's been good man, really it's everything\nyou came to know and love about the Gen two, carried over. So we weren't, we didn't wanna come out with the Gen three until we could bring those things to the customers. So we wanted the same eye box, we wanted the same weight. If anything, I believe\nwe shaved another ounce off of the E model, going to a one to 10. We wanted a daylight-bright\nilluminated reticle. Which was probably one of\nthe harder parts to do. The technology that's used to illuminate the reticle is different, and that had to be developed a little bit to get it as bright as it is. But yeah, really digging it. Now the sexy part of it is that it goes up to 10 now, right? But really what excites me more probably is that it's our first focal plane scope, and we have a floating\nreticle inside there. So we have essentially, a reticle that grows and\nshrinks with magnification. So when we zoom it all the way out, you have a very subdued side picture. It's almost red dot-ish. There's just a very concentrated reticle in the middle, nothing really around the outside obstructing your field of view. And then when you start to need those artifacts in there for point of reference on holds at longer ranges, those explode. It's almost like opening the map. Those things become more\napparent as you zoom in. So that's the part that I really like even though for most of\nthe shooting we've done, I pretty much live in the one to three power range when I use it for 3-Gun, but I mean it's a fully capable scope. You're not going to be wanting for more magnification in anything that you would reasonably\nuse a low power variable for. A lot of the same things carried over. One of the things that\nprobably are undersold features is that the turretts\nare actually engineered to disappear behind the eye piece. So when you're looking through the scope you can't see the turrets. Things like that carried over, locking illumination reticle. Still goes up to 11 'cause\nthat's just how we roll. Yeah man, we're just super excited about this for 2020. I know it comes with a sun shade, I think it comes with the\nswitchview throw lever. - Sweet. - Don't quote me on that,\nbut I think it does, and it's going to be hitting the streets for about $1900. - So really competitive pricing considering what gets close to it in the market right now.\n- Right, right. - The other thing I want to comment on, since they've pushed that\ntop end so much higher, everything under 10 is\ngonna perform better. So your six power, like\nyour current Razor Gen two, it's gonna be more performance at six because you have so much\nmore top end on this optic. - Yeah. Think of it as a one to\nsix that goes up to 10, instead of a 10 Bauer scope\nthat goes down to one. It's a low power variable scope that has the higher\nmagnification capability, not necessarily the other way around. A lot of folks wanna look at it as like a DMR scope and they start ask about parallax adjustment,\nthings like that. Not what this was really intended for, but it's giving you that capability in your intermediate\nrange carbine type optics. - Which for its closest competitor, that this is much more oriented toward a carbine as I see it, or that SPR/DMR, whatever\nyou wanna call it. - Yep, yep your Mark 12 type-- - Exactly!\n- Yeah. - It does that I think, better. Just looking at it here, you know I've been talking about doing PR's gas gun coming up in 2020. That, I'm sold on, I'm gonna\nend up with one of those. I just gotta decide on a reticle, so--\n- Yep! Very excited about it. Two reticles! So one is a military\nthemed MIL based reticle. So we have a dot matrix underneath with MIL-dots, Christmas tree type thing that you become accustomed to. And then there's going to BDC based 3-Gun style reticle with a 200 yard zero, and it has dots at three, four, five, six. And then windage dots five,\n10, and 15 mile per hour. It's a little bit cleaner\npresentation of a reticle, but those are the two\nreticles coming to market. Working on some others for some customers, especially the LE market. We're working on something. A little bit different for those guys, that's gonna be forthcoming though in the coming months and years, but for now, two reticles. The EBR-9 and the EBR-11. And then I guess the other thing too, for those of you who\nstill like the one to six. This optic is not getting discontinued. So this is going forward, the one to six E model\nis still in production. The same three reticles are currently slated for 2020. So anything that you knew\nand love in this scope, still going forward not\ngoing away anytime soon. This is just augmenting the line with a little bit more capability, and you're jumping about $500 in price. - And one other thing I\nwanted to ask on here. Your magnification dial here is, - Yes! - Very easy to move! Is that something you did, or is it gonna be across the line-up? - I can't take credit for that one, but yes that is standard. I've seen several samples of these and all of them have had a much easier to manipulate\nmagnification ring. That was definitely feedback that we got - Mhmm.\n- Out of the old scopes, put it into this scope so currently yes. They're using a completely\ndifferent lubricant in there, and so it is much easier to turn. On most of my samples\nthat I've been using, I haven't installed throw levers on 'em. - Okay. - Some of the other guys have. I believe it's the SV-5 that fits it, but there are throw lever options for it. I guess that's another question a lot of folks are gonna give. \"Why didn't you integrate the throw lever \"into the ring?\" That's intended as a\nfailure point, so to speak. So something has to give at some point if you exert enough force on it. If the throw lever externally breaks, you can put another one\non or we can send you one. You don't have to send your\nscope back the the factory. The next failure point beyond the lever would\nbe inside the scope, and that's something that's\nnot user serviceable. So that would be the reason that it didn't come with a throw lever integrated as part of the\nsystem, but like I say, I believe OEM packaging is going to have the throw lever included with it, and it's a fully warrantied part earned in the VIP warranty program. - All right, so if it were integrated and you ended up ripping\nit off on something. You do damage to your dial here or that, just the stud is still stuck in that threaded part. I mean most people aren't gonna have, sitting in the their garage, what they need to fix that. So that's what Adam's talking about. - Yep.\n- Having that throw lever, if you catch that, it rips off. - Yep. - Your scope keeps working,\n- Just like the shear bolt on your snowblower. - Exactly! Yep, so. - For you, you southern people you probably won't get that but... (both laughing) - So anything else we\nshould know about this guy? Cool fun facts?\n- Like I said, (both laughing) drop in, you're probably seeing this January 10th or so. It's gonna be on display at SHOT show, for those of you who are attending that. Certainly at NRA, and I believe it's gonna start shipping I've been told early spring, and I'm confident in that date more so than I usually am. - Cool! Well there you go guys. The new Razor Gen three, one\nto ten, first focal plane. So get ready to check this out, I'm really excited about this optic. - Yeah, come on down to Arnzen Arms and check it out! (funky rock music)", "uBnl5FlJsxQ": "hello and welcome to the next brain teaser in our series so in this problem you're given eight balls which all look identical and one of them is slightly heavier than the other so you can't tell just by looking at it but you can you know that it weighs a little bit more so you're given that and you're given a scale and the question is to find out to see if you in how do you identify the the ball that weighs slightly more than the other seven in as few scale measurements as possible so I recommend if you haven't ever tried this problem to know now that you know the problem go off and think about it maybe take a few days think about it and when you want you either you've solved it or you've come up with some solution you want to check it come back and watch the rest of this video I'll also try to give a few hints in the and as this video goes along as to how to go about solving this problem okay so here I'm actually now going to start giving hints and solving the problem so one hint is to think about trying to divide up the balls into different groups and if you if you're coming like a computer science background you might think oh I could divide this in half and then keep dividing in half and that's a good idea so however that's not going to be the optimal solution there's even one that's better than that so let me walk you through that solution that walks through the actual optimal solution okay so if I have a scale let's just say I put I take them as is here and I weigh this group against this group you know it's gonna tip to one side because one of the balls are slightly heavier so once I've done that I'll know that let's just say the left-side tip so like let's say you know these guys are all heavier so I take I take these four and I I then do again I weigh them I split them in half okay if I do that I will then find out oh maybe this time you know all the way these two against these two so this is like this is a b c d e f G H and so look here I'll have a and B and that's it here C and D so maybe it turns out that C and D are the heavier ones so this is heavy heavier this is also have u so if I go do that and then I go and finally I measure C versus D and maybe it turns out that C is the heavier one I've identified in three weddings Oh C is that is the everyone so that's actually you know that works you you're able to get down to the to the correct one it's the one that doesn't match the rest of them in three wings but you can actually do better than that so let's let's go ahead and do that so let me clear this see probably the fastest just to do this if I wanted to do that let's just say I did that so now let me actually go label these again so now I have a b c d what if i try like you're white why do it exactly have what if i I pick like three and three so let's just say I sort of ignore these guys and I put my balance here okay so I'm gonna weigh ABC against de F if they're exactly identical then I know that all these six balls are the same and it's G and H which one of them is heavier so I just have to measure I just have to measure G versus H okay so and then whichever of those two is the heavier one so let me write that down so so case it case a or maybe I shouldn't use the letter A like case one a plus B C equals D plus E Plus F okay then I measure G and I weigh it I compare it to H and whichever is that every one is then the the oddball out so you might maybe it's G okay so I then know it works in case let's think about case two what if like you know the the heavier ball is among the six here so maybe a plus B plus C weighs more than D plus E Plus F ok well if that's the case I've identified now that the heavy ball is among these three it's it's either a B or C so if that's the case what I can do is I could pick any two of them let's say a and B and I weigh them against each other if a and B are identical now I'm going to do like another kind of like sub case it's like if a and B are identical then we that implies the answer is C otherwise you know a is bigger or B is bigger which case you've identified the one so a might be bigger or B might be paper and then you've identified the one so in this case you see I've only done two measurements I took I took a random set of three I labeled them ABCDE F and then I have G H after work take a random so three and other end up sort of three weight up against each other if they're all the same then I just measure the remaining two if they're not all the same I take the heavier batch of those the heavier three and then I pick a random two and then if one of those is heavier then that's the right ball otherwise if they're identical it's the ball that I didn't pick so this way I'm able to determine the heavy ball in exactly two measurements quite cool okay so neat puzzle now if this excites you and you want to see slightly harder one look for the puzzle of twelve balls and you don't know if it's a heavier or lighter ball so in this case notice that we were taught you were told that the one one of the walls was heavier okay so that's that's all", "Hq5JIjWeTGc": "a fruit basket

toner for our hair after we've big steel or lightened it and at this time I want to go into the kind of Practical behind it and actually show you how to mix a toner and it's quite basic but there is a few little kind of like nuanced ways of making it that kind of different from other color so I'm going to go through that today and now first thing we need is developing lotion you can buy it in just about any cell supply shop I don't know about regular kind of hair stores but you can definitely get it and any salad supply shop something like Sally's or something like that you need 6% they come in different strengths you get three six nine twelve percent for today's purpose between 6% then I'll go into a little bit more about that whilst we're actually mixing and by only six percent of that or 20-volt they come in different most of them will say both of the ways of measuring it but it's either six percent or 20 volume and yeah that's the same thing six percent or 20 volume developed knows you need to color that you can use permanent tube I've got gold well today it doesn't matter if it's gold well or not that's just what I use and it needs some scales we need to set scales just to be quite precise with our ratios and it is quite important and and you'll see why in a minute but and it's not just it's it's best to use scales if you've got some needs it's a little jug or something you can put some water rinse on the end of the world and you need a brush and a mixing bowl and that's pretty much it for all the things you need and so yeah what I'll do is I'll get on to show you how to mix that now a little bit about through the boys we mix it the way we are what we're doing that okay so first thing we want to do is you got the scales and we've zeroed it with the mixing bowl on top of them now the ratio we're gonna do today is we're going to use one water one color for one developer takes one two one two one now and the example I use is 10 mil because I'm just going to right away so I don't need that much so what I mean by one to one to one is we can use 10 mil of water ten mil of color and ten mil of developing ocean now by using 6% developer so first we stick that in and then I'll carry on sorry so there's a ten meter wall there now we're going to use 6% developer now the purpose of using 6% developer and mix it down with water is that by using one to one of developer and water what we're doing essentially is we're creating a 3% developing nation because we are diluting it one to one with the water so by diluting with the water we're actually creating a 3% now 6% for lifting hair 3% for depositing tone so you could you can ask the question so why don't you just you know use a 3% developer to start with and the answer is the reason that I wanted to show you this video like this and that's the answer there is that you get a much it's much more fluid it's much more watery it's the consistency is just not so cake mix like and and when we're making a toner that's incredibly important because when we're making a toner we need to get it on as fast as possible so the point to get in with the water one of the big bonuses of using it this way is in six percent and then bringing it down to three percent with the water is that we are allowing it we're making a much more watery consistency and then when we're putting on our hair we can do it much faster somehow I'm losing the millimeter every time I'm doing it so we're just going to carry on now in ten mil of color to that be honest normally I do it the other way around but I want to show you the the consistency of the lotion or this it's not such a big deal so it's fine so yeah ten mil up the color to that and then just give it a good stir together and that's basically on such stirred up that will be our timer now this is a bit of a pig to mix in with the water and such but you just got to keep going and keep going because once you start breaking it down it will mix in with the water completely because you don't want it to have those you'll start to see in a minute it will get quite stringy but you don't want that you need to get it quite consistent to be honest using a brush it's not the best way I had I adapt I don't have any little kind of egg whisk things that we use to hand at the moment so I'm using a brush but it does work so it's fine yeah if you can get a tip to use as those if you get those espresso mixes and little kind of expressed our egg mix egg whisk type things there they're really good for this but yeah I don't have one hand at the moment so I'm choosing my brush but yeah so we're gonna we mix it all together and then say that one to one to one with the water it just really helps it to get a better consistency to put on your hair because when you're making a toner as we said in the last video you need to get on as quick as possible now if you're doing it without the water and just using a 3% developer with one to one with the color it's it's much it's it's it's less less runny so it becomes much more of a chore to get it into the hair and then but with the water as well you can really just throw it on the hair a lot quicker and that's a great help when you're trying to get it on fast so that's pretty much it we've mixed our toner so that's your toner really and then you just bang out on the hair as fast as possible now it's unlikely that you're going to be using one color for a timer so obviously you need to mix that with your own mixture first and in terms of amounts now you take 10 mil of each 10 mil color 10 mil of develop an urgent mo of water that and probably do someone's hair that's about my links but I don't really want to give you exact numbers of what you should be using for your own hair because it's very difficult it really depends on what your hair is like if you've got porous hair you'll need more longer hair you'll need more obviously but what I will say is you probably want to overshoot and because you don't want to get halfway through the all the develop on all depending on the hair to find out you've got to mix up a load more and do the other half of your hair so it's better to overshoot the number shoot when you're making a toe nose I know it's a waste and it's a bit of a shame but it is definitely better to overshoot we do with your amounts then under shoot okay that's about mixing at the time it really it's quite simple say it's just one one one one two one two one say so ten mil to mil and ten mil or if you're making more it's like 40 mil of water 40 mil of color forty minute developer so it's quite easy to remember and it's quite easy to do best of luck if you have any questions feel free to get in touch me in the comments below or you can visit my blog at lemon soda hair

so fumes as as well as pressure what is the pressure part of the story well what I want to fights pressure air pressure yeah and that air pressure needs to be eliminated as the water makes its way down by natural gravity okay oh and not only does it eliminate the Tia fumes it also eliminates the air pressure and this is what was here's the trap we had a sink here last year thanks a and so this was the waste that went down and this is the vent it goes up from here now can this will be replaced with PVC absolutely not not in New York City why not uh code and anything on the three stories as I am sorry over three exactly has to be the case nine all calves and I still MSP see you I think that's a good call okay so you've already started cutting it over here so we're taking everything up everything out and last week of course we took out everything that was decorative and this was the world's pinkest bathroom which which had an amazing pink bathtub and or in wall tile and of course we saved the sink I'm not sure what we're going to do with the sink what happens next here we are we took the liberty of supporting everything to make sure it's safe and we're literally taking everything

35 liters as an example so 35 liters times 2 point 5 equals 80 7.5 so then we're just going to move the decimal place over 1 that gives us 875 milliliters so you're going to add 875 milliliters to 35 liters of fuel to give you a 40 to one ratio so let's use another example yes let's use 5 liters so 5 liters times 2 point 5 equals 12 point 5 move the decimal place over that's 125 milliliters so

So, it's gonna get smaller. But, how much smaller? About a quarter\nsmaller, right? So, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna\nfigure out the, I guess, how many units you have on the original part first,\nright? So, if I count it on the middle line right there, that's about 8 boxes in\ntotal. And the high here is just gonna be 2 boxes here, and 2 boxes here. And from\nhere to here, it's just going to be 1, 2, 3, 4,\nlooks like a 5, okay? Now, we're gonna take this whole...every\ndimension here and we're gonna divide by 4. So, let's look at the center line\nfirst, because it's easier. 8 divided by 4, what do we have? We've got 2. So\nit's gonna be very small. So I come over to the center line right here. I'm gonna\ndraw a center line and that's gonna be a new shape right there. If I divide this 8\nby 4, right? So, I've got 2 right now. Now, it's gonna go from the center down to\nthis one before. Remember, you're multiplying by a quarter, which means\nyou're dividing by four. So, what's 2 divided by 4? It's gonna be a one-half and\none-half is 0.5. So from the center line I'm gonna go down 0.5 so, about here I'm\ngonna stop. Go up 0.5 and I'm going to stop. Because I've got to figure out how much\nis, how long is here and how long is here. Well, this is 5. From the center of\nthe figure here, this is 5 so, if I take this 5 here and divide by 4,\nI've got 1.25. And it's like this,\na 1.25 is the total length.

luckily some people already thought it through dating back to Archimedes and his studies about levers fast-forwarding to today nearly every available stepper motor comes with a datasheet that readily tells us the torque of it torque has dimension force times distance and the official SI unit is Newton meter one Newton meter is equal to the torque resulting from force of one Newton applied perpendicularly to the end of moment arm that is one meter long well our scales usually do not measure Newtons so how do you calculate whether a given motor is strong enough to lift a certain weight we can use conversion factors to either convert to one kilogram force meter or one pound force inch the u.s. is slowly moving towards the metric system inch by inch now we are equipped to convert these specification values to something understandable let's take a look at a NEMA 17 I am flying around and here is a typical daily sheet I got this one from the National Instruments website that contains a stepper with similar values to the one I was showing now although this says 0.44 Newton meters in the table the top horses speed graph tells us that it's actually more like 0.36 at low rpms so always keep in mind that the achievable torque is dependent on the speed at which you drive to stepper in general the higher the speed the lesser the torque so for this one let's assume torque of 0.36 Newton meters to find out how much weight it can lift we use the constants from above that means if we attach a weight on an arm one centimeter away from the center of the motor it should be able to lift nearly 33.7 kilograms this is a linear relation so for every additional centimeter we move away from the center of the motor we have to divide a buff values by the number of centimeters I quickly plotted this relationship for you guys we can see the nearly three point seven kilograms centimeter one which is already half two centimeters now if we move to 10 centimeters it will only be able to lift one tenth of the three point seven kilograms meaning 370 kram at 50 centimeter it is already down to just 70 grams let's put this to the test I printed the small level that fits right onto the D shaft of the motor and placed some holes at the distances of one five and ten centimeters away from the motor centered the motor is driven by a BLT B 6600 version 1.2 board that can handle up to 4.5 m/s and this is controlled by an Arduino Nano with an attached joystick now let's attach some weight to the lever and see if the motor is able to lift it here we are in the testing rig corner these are some bars I have around from project here's our NEMA 17 stepper motor with the attach lever and the cradle that contains a full can of some chocolate drink which weighs around 300 grams so we are on a safe side regarding the specifications here and now we'll see whether it's able to lift it or not it's fixed at 10 centimeters on the level and I move the joystick beautiful well well this is certainly cool it's not really that impressive so let's step this up a notch lifting cans of chocolate milk it's all good and fine but as a proper German I'm interested in the question whether it can lift a beer so with this 550 creme weighing can here and I got a new motor it has a NEMA 17 the same base as before but this one has a metal gear attached which has a ratio of 27 to 1 and now we'll check how far we can go with this so we'll start off with this kind of here and see if it can lift it this looks fine I think the the lever is skipping a little bit you can see it here the plastic with the reinforcement Cruz is not that strong but let's put on some more weight now we still have the same motor configuration NEMA 17 27 to 1 gear ratio metal gear that instead of the 550 crane can we attach to 2.5 kilogram weight to the lever at the distance of 10 centimeters from the motor let's eat as connected it was at this moment that he supported the motor yes scared neighbors but I want to make sure no motors and microcontrollers have been harmed during taking of this movie the takeaways of today's lap stream are how to select the motor based on your needs of lifting power stepper motors have less torque at higher speeds and you can drastically increase the torque of motor by using gear ratios greater than 1 have an awesome day in pipeline if you had as

right into it but those of you in the collecting community know what this is i can't believe i got him i am just so thrilled and lucky although i did work really hard communicating directly with the mint and various distributors around the world and i moved on it really really fast these are extremely highly desirable the 2020 one ounce gold germania four nine proof and bu and uh i don't think i need to tell most people that germanian mint is really one of the most exceptional mints in the world and and their products are incredibly popular and in high demand because of the quality the quality control the design the packaging the marketing everything is just as high-end as it gets so anyway i'll just uh they're beautiful uh you know black cases and these wooden boxes gold embossed um this is the bu and this is the proof and it's gonna join it's the second edition i got the first edition of these so this is the coa of course and uh i'll just show you the proof here here it is folks this is it these are really hard to get you know these sold out in about a second just like the first one did so awesome i'm so happy with this they're all individually numbered on the edge and they have uh you know holograms on the coas to verify it so this is the feminine personification of germany and it's cool the double-headed eagle landing on her arm it's a dignified pose with a wind-blown cape and her laurel so cool the reverse of course is their famous double-headed eagle which is just epic and they actually embellished it a little this is a refreshed design you know a few more details on the eagle feathers etc but the precision and workmanship on on these make each coin really unique only 100 pieces in the world you know i don't have that graded and here is the bu version of it 200 of these have been issued it's beautiful too man just stunning super super awesome look at these designs detail 4 9 super high end pure pure pure gold double-headed eagle so i'm a happy camper i hope you enjoyed these it was really worth the effort of what it took to acquire these all right hope you all doing really really well stay healthy bye", "4dDHTAtq01I": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I wanted to show you a very simple video just like a tip so you guys have been asking me how many box cake mix boxes do you use for 1/2 sheet cake I use 3 boxes umm I'll insert a picture here so you guys can see which box I use I use a double split cake by Pillsbury and for just one sheet I used three boxes sewing total to do the top layer of the cake I use 6 boxes in total I hope I made sense yeah some people when charging for a cake they will you know ask for more money since it is a thicker layer of cake I I guess I don't charge it anymore this is just how I offer my cakes I like them to be nice and fluffy and thick when I am using a cake mix that's how many boxes I'll use and then I'll just do one change which is instead of water I use all milk this really creates a different taste to it but like better and yeah I definitely don't over mix just until everything is well incorporated I stopped mixing because like most of you will know if you over mix you know your cake will get very tough it wouldn't be fluffy moist as it should be and this cake mix really really comes out super moist I love it I always use it I use it for a choco flan which is the cake and then um swans when you bake it together they come out together yeah I hope I mentioned yes yes basically what I use and then you also you guys also had another point which is how do i grease my pants for this kind of cake since it is a little bigger this is what I mean by one sheet one sheet of these I use three boxes well I just use vegetable shortening to grease my pants I feel like it's cheaper then using Pam since the bottle like the regular sized bottle you will definitely almost pick it up since you do I mean I use two sheets in total since you know it's two layers of the cake I hope I'm making sense but yes this is what I do I use I just use a napkin to grease the pan and that's it and then I'll just pour in my batter and then you do have to be careful when using a rectangle cake sheet just because one side could come a little uneven and you guys have been requesting a lot of like cake videos like baking like decorations of cakes and stuff like that and I'll definitely have more videos of those um just little by little I want to put them up I also want to start translating the videos I already had in Spanish to English just I feel like that would help you and especially in other delicious recipes I wanna you know share with you just sometimes I don't have the time to record them because I definitely all the recipes I show on here I always do them again are just that sometimes I don't have the time to record it just it does take longer when you're recording you know the recipe yeah I hope you guys like this video and if you aren't already

let's start with an example problem so let's say that this triangular prism has a height of 20 centimeters and let's say this part is 12 centimeters and here this is 10 how can we calculate the volume of this triangular prism given the following information the volume of a triangular prism is the volume is the area of the base multiplied by the height and that is amuse capital H instead of low case H so 20 centimeters is the height of the prism 12 is the base of the triangle and 10 centimeters is the height of the triangle so capital B represents the area of the base or basically the area of this triangle to calculate the area of the triangle it's 1/2 base times height so in this case is gonna be 1/2 the base is 12 and the height is 10 half of 12 is 6 and 6 times 10 is 60 so the area is 60 square centimeters so that's the area of the base so the volume of the prism is going to be the area of the base which is 60 square centimeters times the height of the prism which is 20 centimeters so 60 times 26 times 2 is 12 and then we need to add the 2 zeros so the volume is going to be 1,200 cubic centimeters and so that's a simple way in which you can calculate the volume of a triangular prism now let's work on another example so let's say the height of the prism and this example is 10 inches and let's say the base of the triangle is 4 inches and the hypotenuse is 5 inches go ahead and calculate the volume of the triangular prism so once again we need to calculate the area of the base first so we've got to calculate the area of the right triangle so we have the base of the right triangle misson is the height and so we need to use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the height first so we know that C squared is equal to a squared plus B squared C is the hypotenuse which is 5 we could say that a represents H in this example and B is 4 so 5 squared is 25 4 squared is 16 and 25 minus 16 is 9 now we need to take the square root of both sides so the square root of 9 is 3 so the height of the triangle is 3 so now we can calculate the area of the base which is the area of the right triangle so that's 1/2 base times height so 1/2 of 4 times 3 half of 4 is 2 and 2 times 3 is 6 so the area of the base is 6 square inches so now we can calculate the volume and it's supposed to be capital B instead of lowercase B so the area of the base is 6 and the height of the prism is 10 so 6 times 10 is 60 so the volume of this triangular prism is 60 cubic inches and so that's the answer now let's try a different example so let's say if you have a prism that looks like this and let's say the height of the prism is 12 inches and the side of the triangle is 8 inches and you're told that it's an equilateral triangle so with that information what is the area of the prison I mean nothing area but what is the volume of the prism rather so if we have an equilateral triangle that means that all three sides have the same length so each side is 8 inches and we know the volume of the prism is base times height so how can we calculate the area of the base what is the area of an equilateral triangle the area of an equilateral triangle is the square root of 3/4 times s squared where s is the side length in this case s is 8 so 8 squared is 64 and if we take 64 and divided by 4 that's 16 so the area of the base is 16 square root 3 square inches so now we can calculate the volume of the prism so capital B that's the area the base that's 16 square root 3 and then the height of the prism is 12 inches so 16 times 12 that's 192 so the volume is gonna be 192 times the square root of 3 and it's gonna be cubic inches so this is the final answer it's actually the exact answer and if you want the decimal equivalent of that answer it's about 300 32.55 cubic inches let's look at another example so let's say this time we're given the values of all three sides of the triangle let's say the height of the triangle is 18 centimeters so everything is in centimeters calculate the volume of the prison so we know first we need to calculate the area of the base so how can we calculate the area of a triangle if we're only given all three sides and it's not a right triangle we need to use Heron's formula so first you need to calculate s which is basically half of the perimeter of the triangle it's a plus B plus C divided by two we can call this a B and C so it's gonna be 9 + 10 + 11 divided by 2 9 + 10 is 19 and 19 + 11 that's 30 30 divided by 2 is 15 now once you have s you can calculate the area using this formula so it's s times s minus a times s minus B times s minus C all inside of a square root symbol so keep in mind that s is 15 so the area is gonna be 15 times 15 minus a so that's 15 minus 9 times 15 minus B and B is 10 and then 15 minus 11 so 15 minus 9 that's 6 15 minus 10 is 5 15 minus 11 is 4 so now how can we simplify what we now have well we can take the square root of 4 so that's 2 15 I'm gonna write that as 5 times 3 + 6 is 3 times 2 now we can take out 25 the square root of 25 is 5 and the square root of nine is Street so we're left with 2 times 5 times 3 times the square root of 2 2 times 5 is 10 10 times 3 is 30 so the area is 30 square root 2 and I'm just gonna check that with my calculator make sure I didn't miss anything and I got the same answer so now we can calculate the volume of the prism so it's base times height the area of the base is 30 square root 2 and the height of the prism is 18 so 30 times 18 that's 540 so the answer is 540 square root 2 cubic centimeters or we could say that's approximately 760 3.7 cubic centimeters", "LhL59Ipehms": "okay for the coordinate P we're going to find the coordinates of P Prime when the angle of rotation is PI over 4 and it's rotated counterclockwise about the origin so we have the point P that has coordinates 0 comma 6 this is just going to be a straightforward application of the formula so in this case our x value was 0 our Y value was 6 and the angle fee that was given by PI over 4 so now it's just going to be a matter of again just putting all those values in and simplifying so X prime will be 0 times cosine of PI over 4 minus y which is 6 times sine of PI over 4 well the first term is just going to be 0 sine of PI over 4 is the square root of 2 over 2 and that will give negative 3 times the square root of 2 y prime will be the y-coordinate which is 6 times cosine of PI over 4 plus the x-coordinate which is 0 x sine of PI over 4 so in this case the second term will be 0 we'll have 6 x cosine of PI over 4 which is root 2 over 2 and that will be 3 times root 2 so the point after going through the rotation its new coordinates will be negative 3 times the square root of 2 comma 3 times the square root of 2", "sU4A3FX-mTo": "[Music] so today I'm going to demonstrate how to properly mix s khalaq and k mark-- which are tuned powdered milk replacers in order to mix it you'll need a whisk else in the bowl i have a bowl of distilled water as well for mixing I also have my bottle and funnel for transferring and I have a blender as well even though it does specify on the label not to use a blender you can use it on a pulse setting just slow intervals so s black and km/hour goats are mixed on ratio of one part powder to 2 parts water so I only one use one tablespoon of s black and I'm going to mix two tablespoons of water this can take a moment you just want to slowly mix it make sure that you incorporate all the formula with the water you wanted to use a blender you would just go at a slow pulse setting at 5 seconds intervals just when you're ready to transfer your formula to the bottle you want to remove your lid either a funnel and then transfer your formula into the bottle now once you've done this you are going to want to prep your nipple so the nipples do not come with holes cut you actually want to make what's called a cross cut so if there's feathers here and there we make an X cut at the very top so I'm going to make my small cut here and then a small cut across so this is here to get X at the very top you don't want it to come out all at once you want to tip the bottle and have small droplets of formula not a large straight coming out you", "kxta2KKrhaY": "alright guys I just got to this lake in South Jersey it is approximately 7:15 a.m. trot season to start into 8 so I'm gonna take this time to do a quick intro a rain quite a lot yesterday out of that shut them off now but a foot is rolling through it's actually being a warm front so it's actually hopefully it's good cross my fingers but as you guys may have seen since the beginning of the video I've been holding this guy right here okay try to bait the flashback mini so I'm see if I catch some shot here and the key thing about today's video is that they're our brood socks in here brood stock trout what that means is East stock trout are farm raised and what they do is they keep these breeder size trout up to about 2 to 3 years primarily I don't think to go over 3 years but I did get really big over 18 inches so that's my goal now going to try to land some of these big guys so I don't have a map of this place so I think there is a way to hold up trail cursor go through clear cursor overlay options structure Genesis life I believe Genesis life is this whole thing is life so as long as I pad a little bit you says zero feet because I'm very low what it technically should save me time to keep battling it looks like everyone's going deep side and this is relatively shallow that's a few the pads here you can see the pads here but I need to get to the channel I think the channel it swings out this way here we go you got some deaths oh you see that it's colored up that sounds like heat pad like this it's got color did entire Lake do that it's coloring so I think the key is being figure out where those channels are at and there was a pride where those fish are at so yeah guys I have my Genesis live update for my Laurens elite ti5 my 5ti sorry and uh this is amazing like any place is that I mean I checked the maps on their database repository as seen at Genesis you guys can check out top right hand corner where you get those social map they're all free if you have a glorious product but yeah there was no database of this Lake and right now I'm actively live charting this whole thing so right now it is 7:30 and I really don't know where the trout are at because I don't really do a lot lake pond fishing for trout but being able to map this I kind of know what channels are at so I least had fish toast a lot of people today some kayakers some boaters some duck hunters some people in a shoreline but guys I've completed the map I guess you say that looking good eight o'clock there we go time to go everyone story oh those hitting oh those hit guys man oh did you guys see that oh I think I found a pole dude god yes whoo dude all right look at that first shot on a mini ChatterBait that's what I'm talking about fish on there you go Oh Adam [Music] got on them all right I'm being silly fish is underneath my feet now all right what's the limit five six six less the fishy-fishy come out wherever you are I got it work right that's edition that's fish dude that's efficient come on hit harder yeah harder than that oh dude he yanked my pole got him god there we go God let it pop it up the drop down yeah without guys it's a debate the heck dude guys you see this the clip on us came off holy smokes chata bait come on guys got to give it good clips a little scared of this right now I said let's do it yeah I'm just gonna do it yeah I'll try it's okay it's okay hold on take your time take your time that's far out sir here look that's a little far out I don't want you to fall over this being safe now you know I'm saying you can take the net I'll come right back for it yet and take that and you just cut the line or something okay yeah you might have to it's just on it go float thank you take care man hey let me see if I could get up give me a second one look at that hey young man yeah I'm great dating their I hope so get that bridge stock good karma let's go see that strike that a few times bhishan god No mmm [Music] I got hit right when I landed another hit right there got hit right there come on smashing got him got him oh yeah Pam now a jig that done this a long time ago guys just super glue super glue this lure right back onto here that should be good to go there's a little bit of butter shank I just got it right on here hopefully that's just a I mean it's wet and everything but I hope it works so I know there's fish right there I know there's a drop-off right right by the dock over there let's take down it slow roll it I'm gonna do a couple twitches but you had a chat abit guys Pond Lake fishing for trout stock trout is a BFS bait finesse system basically ultralight bait casting is from cear\u00e1 noia to xf 50 l it also got a sarah noia bait casting ultralight rod it's the c-47 2 UL got from aliexpress and I got this from eBay you guys could check out the link in description below I got Tesla and mono but I think since I lost some line here I'm povery spool I will put on some casting floor coat because I kind of want to sink a little deeper faster mono floats a little bit so having like copolymer or fluorocarbon it get down deeper quicker so some low that's a fish bite right there come on smash it that's enough fish bite right there come on got him god I'm got him not a small guy on a charter beach yeah one of them came off huh I don't know what happened all right guys so it's 11:30 the bite died my battery died is Bluebird sky ah I mean I've got a good amount of fish let's take a look all right did I lose another one I didn't lose another one what's going on dude I had another fish and it came off again something is not right guys something's not right you guys I don't want to go off a strainer I must have they must have small jaws or something or maybe I just drag them over lily pads and they ripped off but well I got three men three on a stringer I hope you guys enjoyed this video I definitely wanted to do a little bit more kayak fishing on lakes and ponds for trout and of course I always loved doing at streams so you guys leave me a comment below which one you guys want to see more of you guys want to see me catch trout and lakes like these maybe I'll get AB rootstock hopefully that was my goal for today but it seems like only two broodstock were pulled out since this morning or you guys want me to do streams just let me know in the comments below once again guys thank you for watching tight lines", "E5Vmy1QZccs": "what's up guys Dan here at Presley's we're a slow day in the blind right now and show you a slow-mo between a two and three-quarter three inch and a three and a half inch so here we go two and three-quarter three and a half last three-inch next so here goes let it eat", "Rq5pwRITcNw": "hey guys Brandon here with all about DIY looking at a video on how to tell how many gallons an aquarium is if you don't know these two I got for my local fish store I had no idea what they were and so there's a really easy way to figure out how many gallons an aquarium is what you do is you multiply the length times the width times the height and divide that number by 231 don't ask me why I don't know but it works so this tank is 36 inches wide by I don't know about 17 inches tall and ten and a half inches wide which comes out to be about twenty seven point four gallons so they figure that out and so that's nice as a good sized tank it's kind of a weird dimension I haven't seen one like this in a while but yeah it's a good sized little tank and then this one is sixteen by eight and a quarter by about ten and a half inches tall which comes out to be roughly six gallons so if you have any square or rectangular tank this formula will work again length times width times height divided by 231 and that will give you exactly how many gallons it is and I would also like to add that this formula does not work on both front tanks or cylinder tanks or any tank with curved edges on it it only works on square and rectangular tanks like this so yeah so if you want to figure out what your tank is as far as gallons use that so pretty easy works well it's pretty damn accurate too so that's also nice and yeah let me know you think thanks again for watching later", "_TnDr8cKums": "hey everyone the Sears register nurse re and calm and in this video I'm going to go over how to read syringes in this video I want to go over five basic syringes that you will be using as a nurse and show you how to read each of them now as a nurse you're going to have a lot of different types of syringes at your disposal and you want to select the correct syringe for the amount of medication that you want to get for instance say that the physician has ordered 0.5 milliliters of morphine the 3 cc syringe is the best for drawing that medication up to get the most accurate dose however on the other hand if you're going to give point 2 5 milliliters of a medication the 1 milliliter syringe is the best for that so let me show you the basic parts of a syringe here is a basic 10 milliliter syringe and anytime you have a syringe you always want to look at its total capacity it can hold and this one holds 10 MLS now as a side note 10 MLS is the same as 10 cc's so if you hear someone say let's give 2 cc's it's the same as two MLS just to let you know that now let's go over the basic parts of the syringe okay so here at the top this is our adapter part and this is where you would screw on the needle if you were going to give an iamb injection and now in the hospital we use needle list devices so we would just screw this adapter part on to the IV the hub of the IV or the line and then we would just give our medication that way now the other part that's important is the barrel of the syringe the barrel has a scale on it and this scale tells us how much of a medication we're gonna give based on whatever the doctor ordered now every syringe is different and how it measures that's why I say get familiar with how much your syringe holds which we're going to go over in depth here in a second with each individual syringe and you have a scale so at the top it's zero then you have a line in between that and then you have one then you and then you have a big - and it measures onward now one thing that you want to keep in mind is how to actually measure the fluid that you're drawing up with this plunger so let's go over the other part the plunger I'm going to take it out so you can see it the plunger has a top part and a bottom part and it also has a beveled area and whenever you're actually drawing up the medication you're going to line the line up that's on the scale of your barrel with this top part of the plunger not the beveled part the top part now let's go over how to read each syringe first we're going to start with the easiest syringe which is the 10 milliliter or 10 cc syringe and as you can tell on this picture each area is measured out so the top part where the top line is 0.5 milliliters then it goes to one then the next line is 1.5 then it goes to two then the next line is 2.5 and so on so this syringe based on how its scale is set up in its capacity it measures by 0.5 now let's test your knowledge based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe and the answer is 4.5 MLS now let's look at the five milliliter syringe and as you can see on this this has a little bit more lines in between the main measurements than the 10 cc syringe and that very top line is zero and then below zero you have 0.2 then point four seven point six point eight and then the huge line is one so that is where one milliliter is at then after that you'll count by twos the point twos so to be 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 and 2 and then so on it would keep measuring that a male until you hit 5 MLS now let's look at this syringe based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 2.2 MLS now let's look at our 3 no leader syringe this syringe even further breaks down the measurement so you can really draw up a smaller amount of a medication for instance like I said at the beginning of the video this syringe is really good for drawing up a medication if you just have to give point five of something so that top line is zero then as you pull the plunger down this syringe goes down by point one so you have 0.1 ml 0.2 0.3 0.4 and then you have half 0.5 then you have point six point seven point eight point nine and then one and then so on until you get a total capacity of three MLS based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 0.7 MLS our next syringe is the one milliliter syringe and this syringe if you don't have good eyesight you really have to squint to see the little lines but it's really good for giving those medications where you have to give just a little bit like the 0.25 MLS okay on this syringe as you can see and the top line will be zero and then this particular syringe will measure down by 0.01 so you have point zero one point zero two point zero three onward until you hit point one ml's and then it'll just keep on going until you've hit a total capacity of 1 in MLS based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 0.25 MLS okay this is our very last syringe and this is a syringe that you will be using a lot whenever you are giving diabetics insulin and it is a syringe that holds a total of a hundred units because insulin is measured in units and it looks a little similar to our one milliliter syringe that we went over but it's not measured in milliliters it's measured in units so as you can see with this we have our top line which is zero and this is going to measure in increments of two so the next line would be two units then four units six units eight units and then ten units and then onward until you would give a total of a hundred units based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 72 units okay so that wraps up this video on how to read the common syringes you will encounter as a nurse thank you so much for watching and don't forget to subscribe to our channel for

probably the most popular and that is converting from liters to gallons and then I'll do additional videos and I'll include a link for all of them okay before we begin let me start by saying 1 gallon and this is a English gallon not an imperial gallon is equal to three point seven eight five four one liters kind of an odd number and one liter is equal to point two six four one seven two gallons okay so obviously a gallon is larger than a liter so let's go ahead and start with one say you have a five liter beverage and you'd like to know how much that is in gallons because say you don't think in terms of leaders you think everything in gallons okay so step one what I do is I i'll put liters on top i'll create a fraction and then i do a multiplication and I put always put the unit I want to convert to on top and that is gallons and therefore I'm gonna put leaders on the bottom okay so I next ask myself which is larger gallons or liters and gallons is larger so I'm gonna put a 1 there and I know my conversion one gallon is three point seven eight five four one so I'm gonna do write three point seven eight five four one leaders the leaders will cancel and I just multiply straight across so I then get five divided by three point seven eight five four one and if you do the math that is equal to one point three 2:08 six gallons okay so there's the first one again I created a fraction put leaders on the top placed it over one did a multiplication placed a one by the larger unit did my conversion that is a three maybe the world's messiest three let's look at another example of that this time instead let's go with 15 liters is equal to how many gallons so I'm gonna put gallons on top I'm gonna place this over one I'm going to then put leaders on the bottom I always ask myself which is larger gallons or liters gallons are larger then I put one gallon is equal to three seven five four one leaders the leaders cancel and then I multiply straight across so that will be 15 times one is 15 one times three point seven eight five four one okay and then it's just a simple division problem 15 divided by that and the answer is three point nine six two five eight and obviously gallons okay so now let's do another example let's go the other way and that is let's convert from liters now to gallons so let's go ahead and from excuse me from gallons to liters so say I have seven gallons and I want to know how many liters that is so I now place leaders on top because I want to go to leaders and place gallons on the bottom I then ask myself which is larger gallon is larger one gallon is equal to three point seven eight five four one I'm going to place this over a one gallons cancel seven times three point seven eight five four one is equal to twenty six point four nine seven nine gallons have pants holding them left with leaders let's do one more of those twelve gallons is equal to how many leaders okay so again I'll place twelve gallons over one multiply place the unit I want to get excuse me the unit I'm converting two on top which is leaders place the other unit on the bottom ask myself which is larger gallons or liters gallons are larger one gallon is equal to three point eight five four one liters gallons cancel multiply straight across and you're left with forty five point four two four nine okay anyway that's how you convert from gallons to liters and liters to gallons hope that helps please look for additional videos on converting anything in volume thanks for watching moomoomath uploads a new math video everyday [Music] you [Music]", "i9hfpOCnzEs": "now today we're going to be talking about fiberglass repair and not just your typical run-of-the-mill little chips and dings we're going to be addressing structural repairs you know the kind that affects the integrity of your boat this kind of damage can happen in a number of different ways you know maybe you're you know coming along and you hit a rock a deadhead or well maybe somebody hits you but the the end result being you've got damage that extends through all the layers of your laminates from the exterior all the way to the interior now when I'm a prime looking at a fiberglass project I will break those down into I guess one of two categories either they're cosmetic or they're structural and although the the repair process for either one is relatively the same there are some key differences you know when you break them down into their basic steps or their basic you know process what you're looking to do is remove damaged glass lay up your new material and then go over top of that with your finishing surface whether it's paint or gel coat now with when you're looking at a structural repair that process needs to be done on both sides of laminate both exterior and the interior faced with a cosmetic type repair that can almost always be done on one side typically the exterior side so looking at our test panel here you can see that there's a there's there's a pretty visible hole right here and this hole extends all the way through the laminate and comes out the back yeah so just for argument's sake let's uh let's just call this impact damage yeah that sounds good something definitely hit it but so the so this is something that would definitely be considered a structural type of here because it goes all the way through the laminate now structural repair doesn't always mean a hole it could be cracks heavy cracks you know from impact or you know really severe delamination you know whatever whatever that the cause is the I guess the the general definition is that the damage extends through the full thickness of the now the first thing I'm going to do when I'm looking at I guess putting together a plan for repairing this is I'm going to I need to determine what the overall thickness is of the laminate I'm going to be repairing generally speaking I guess a good general rule of thumb is you you you operate on a twelve to one basis meaning that for every inch of thickness you know that you're going to be repairing your actual repair area extends 12 inches now for this let's just call this let's just call it a quarter inch whether it's this size hole or even smaller if it goes all the way through I'd always do a minimum of a six-inch diameter so we're going to come out three inches come out three inches and this is actually going to be the size of our repair area even though this this hole is only a half inch I want to make sure that all of our the new glass that we're going to be laying up extends far enough over so that it is a very strong and solid repair and we're going to be running this same taper on both sides of laminate now on this side because this was the exit side the exit side of the damage I'm going to actually I can see where the cracking extends out to so I'm going to start from the edge of the each edge of the the damage that I can see I'm going to extend that out three inches and then this will actually be the size of repair whichever side is bigger that's decided that's the that's going to determine the size of repair so for putting in these tapers if I were if I were working outside or if I know the repair area was much larger than this I would definitely be using a I guess a high speed grinder with a very very aggressive grinding head on it but for this because it's a relatively small area and I'm indoors I don't want to fire up my grinder and get glass floating around all over the air I'm actually just going to use my and ER that is hooked up to a vacuum and I'm gonna be using 36 grit paper I want to remove this you know move it as fast as possible nobody likes sanding I really do not like sanding so I want to get it off as quickly as possible one one thing that I want to mention here is because we are going to be grinding glass glass and your lungs do not mix very well they they don't like each other so you need to that you need to take some safety precautions and first and foremost make sure you are wearing some sort of protection whether it's you know one the little paper masks I don't really recommend those I I think like a full-face respirator is a much more effective way to I guess keep this stuff I'll call it stuff for the kiddos to keep this stuff out of your lungs and also Tyvek suit and if you're going to be using a grinder a high speed grinder make sure you've got some eye protection on all right I'm going to do a little change in plans because well it's actually kind of nice outside so being this is a small panel I'm just going to take the whole works right outside and I'm gonna actually use my grinder because it'll be much much faster well that was fun mmm no not really granny glasses never fun but it part of the process I guess let me let me zoom in so you can see a little bit better what I did alright so looking at this here you can see what was initially just a little half-inch hole by time you got all the damage removed it actually you know got a little bit bigger right now this is about two inches across give or take a little bit maybe a little bit bigger and this surface was tapered on both sides of the laminate and I guess looking at another one of my little fancy diagrams here this is kind of a cross-section of what what we did here with that with the grinding with the top in the bottom of the laminate and then this part through here would be the hole and essentially what we did is ground it down to a nice taper to a fine point on both sides so now we're going to start coming in we're going to clean this up and then we're gonna start laying in our glass the first the first patch that we're going to do is going to be just a little bit bigger than the actual size of the hole and then each successive patch is going to be larger and larger and larger until we've got enough glass built up to where we're at a finished thickness for the rest of the surrounding area and we're pretty much right out to the edges of our tapered area both sides well the first thing we're going to do before we start even thinking about laying up glass is we're going to clean the surface everything that were everything that's going to be getting new material laminated on top we're going to wipe that down really really well with acetone till we're not getting any any kind of smearing or I guess anything coming up on the rag we want a good clean surface so that we get a good bond and then then we can start tearing our glass if it's not if it's not clean you'll be able to see some streaking when your I guess after the acetone evaporates on here if you're seeing any kind of streaking then it's not quite clean enough so just keep flipping the rags and get new ones and just keep wiping it down now the glass that we're going to be using on here is where aliy use two different types of glass almost exclusively for repair work and that would be one point five ounce CSM or chopped strand mat II and then also 1708 biaxial fiberglass the reason I use a combination of the two is I want to use the 1708 for the strength you know that that has a lot of a lot of strength there's a lot of material a lot of glass there it's very very strong material and the top strand matting I use that for two reasons one because chopped strand mat has a tendency to hold a lot of resin think of CSM as kind of the the glue layer between different types of laminates it makes sure that there's plenty of resin there so lets you get a good solid adhesion and also it is the it's the type of fiberglass that sands very very smooth so when we're laying this up the first glass or the first layer that I'm gonna put on here is going to be chopped strand mat II and then I'll do a layer of 1708 and then depending on where we're at with thickness at that point then I think I'm just going to go with two more layers of chopped strand mat so that when we're sanding this down we get a good smooth surface we're not going to get any print through from from oh like a weave or a fabric weave it'll sand nice and that'll give us a good smooth surface for for finishing and that's that's the process that I'm going to be doing on both sides so one layer a chopped strand Manning first 1708 over that and then two more layers of chopped strand mat over top of that both sides you", "icD1yRTQtNM": "good morning

everybody this is Eric and Chad Moss spawning gun and today we want to do a special video for you we're going to test out some slugs and see exactly what kind of things that they'll penetrate reliably and essentially try to determine what you would be safe hiding behind or what you wouldn't be safe hiding behind so on this side right here we have a cinderblock wall and a lot of commercial buildings would be constructed I have cinderblock walls like this and you know we want to see if a slug will penetrate here we also have a brick wall just a standard little brick wall just some mortar in between them now there's nothing on the other side of this like a conventional wall like you would normally see in construction because in our opinion if a slug goes through a brick wall and pretty much go through whatever's on the inside as well that's the theory anyway now right here we do have an actual exterior wall constructed we have some 40 siding which is a cement board type siding we have a layer of plywood between that and then just a regular studded wall with insulation and then a piece of drywall on the inside of replicate a just a standard household exterior wall so I don't think it's Lowe is gonna have any trouble going through this all right we're gonna give you a list of the slugs we're going to be using today we're going to use three varieties we got a two and three-quarter inch one in 1/4 ounce Bernake Special Forces short Magnum 12-gauge that can be used in smoothbore and rifle barrels velocity at the muzzle 1476 with around 2500 foot-pounds of energy at the muzzle so it's definitely a stomping slug it's moving the second variety of slug that we're going to use is the maximum barrier penetration Magnum it's also the Bern ich Special Forces load it's a two and three-quarter inch slope of 1 and 3/8 ounce variety okay and it's set up especially for barrier penetration at the muzzle is traveling at a velocity of 1650 with a foot-pounds of energy of over 3,500 so it's definitely moving the third variety of slug that we're going to be testing today is the burn ich tactical home defense it is a reduced recall 12-gauge slow it's a one ounce two and three-quarter alright and again rifled or smoothbore doesn't matter their muzzle velocity 1378 with the energy of around 1850 foot-pounds of energy at the muzzle so this is gonna be the weakest variety but let's see what they will all do so let's test them out all right we're gonna use the browning bps for these tests just to keep everything consistent well we're gonna do is start from the weakest wall to what we think is the strongest wall so we're gonna start on the hardiplank on the right panel here and see what happens with these home defense slopes I can see daylight through the other side all right well the home defense slug went right through they had a hardiplank wall so we know the other two are gonna have any trouble but we're going to go ahead and just shoot them for a fact this is the Burnie Special Forces short Magnum slug no problems there oh yeah alright and the third and final slug is a burning Special Forces barrier penetrator slug that one's got quite a wall to it all right so pretty much we can determine that you would not be safe pretty much any slug would penetrate a standard house wall built to code here we have a 1 ounce home defense slug a 1 in 1/4 out Special Forces short Magnum and then we have a 1 in 3/8 ounce barrier penetrator Special Forces Magnum so you know there might be some slugs of inferior design or inferior quality that may not penetrate as well of course we didn't hit a stud each time now granted yeah the slug would probably go through the stud now how much force that would have after that is hard to say this is you know relatively informal testing but this is just a show you know you're not safe behind a standard wall if someone's got a shotgun with slugs in it definitely not yep all right let's move on to the cinder blocks all right well we saw that the exterior home wall and inner wall wasn't exactly going to help you in a slug fight so now we're going to step up to a cinder block wall one ounce tactical home defense burn each slug and then we're gonna step up to the different slope all right that's definitely a bad day alright we're gonna step up to a 1 in 1/4 short Magnum special-forces alright right in the middle yep went right on through alright one in 3/8 outs special-forces maximum a barrier penetrator on the left side there oh yeah [Laughter] that's a bad day I don't care who you are well we can obviously see that any of those slugs would have ruined your day even if you're behind the cinderblock wall it's just one more reason you don't mess with a shotgun somebody with slug can really ruin your day again we saw that the 1 ounce load really seemed to do the most damage you know it could just be that it's moving slower hard to say but the 1 ounce load definitely not a pushover one in one in 1/4 ounce load again it pushed right on through no problem and then I didn't hit directly in the center of the block with the one in 3/8 ounce load but it definitely went through so you wouldn't be safe behind any of this no matter how you cut it well you have to figure if a 1 ounce slug will go through you know getting well that a 1 and 3/8 ounce slug will definitely go right on through that's right all right all right well we're gonna step up to the brick wall this is the one I'm curious about oh yeah me too alright let's run it alright so we've stepped up to the brick wall we're going to start with the home defense slug see what it does that looked like it went through let's move on up to the Special Forces short Magnum that one went through about the barrier penetrator right on the lower left quadrant Chad and looked pretty strong still think that did the trick well I believe it's safe to say that the brick wall was probably what she'd be the most protected behind although not very protected the one out slowed it pushed a brick out and it did to the the wall did stop the one out slug it barely didn't stop the one in one quarter and then of course the one in 3/8 made a nice clean hole punched all the way through now how much carrying energy those slugs have after they go through the wall is you know hard to speculate however it be safe to say you don't want to be on the other side of that wall regardless all right let's see if we can use my saiga-12 to put another brick in the wall I say it worked you don't want to be on the other side of that wall [Music]",

ammunition to do different videos on and I stumbled across something pretty unique the 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch broad head shotgun slug now on the box it appears that it expands and stays intact just like a broadhead arrow it says it is 1 ounce 435 grain field load and on the back it kind of gives you a rundown of how it works and this is what the shell itself looks like you can see it definitely looks unique so it kind of caught my attention and it looked pretty interesting to me so I decided to pick up a box and shoot it into the ballistics gel and see how it does now I don't know if it's gonna stay in the gel block a lot of times like shotgun slugs and rifle bullets will leave the gel block because I just have too much power and they're going too fast so we'll see it since it's an expanding slug it says I assume that then maybe it'll slow down and stop a little bit sooner than just a regular bullet would but I'm not sure it is gonna be probably moving pretty fast so so we'll just see and see how much damage it does to the gel block now the reason I wanted to do this is because I haven't seen anything on these on YouTube at all I'm sure there's probably some videos on them but as far as like big youtubers and you know people that I'm subscribed to I just haven't seen any videos on broadhead shotgun slug so I figured I'd go ahead and buy them and give it a shot and make a video for y'all and see what they do so the gel block we'll be using as always is my clear ballistics 20% ballistics gel block and the shotgun we'll be using is my Benelli supernova 12-gauge pump-action shotgun now this this shotgun also has a longer barrel it's a 28 inch barrel I believe so it's going to have even more velocity than it would in like an 18 and a half inch barrel so like I said I doubt that we're gonna be able to trap this slug I am gonna set up a metal backstop so that at least maybe it'll bounce off that and we can retrieve whatever's left over when we get done so I'm gonna head out and we will set this up and see what it does [Music] [Applause] so here's our entrance hole and you can see those broad head parts of that slug came off and kind of shrapnel doubt and the sinner core went all the way through that block and hit our metal backstop so this reminds me a lot of the g2 r.i.p pistol and I didn't think it was gonna be like that I thought it was gonna stay intact and open up but does broadhead pieces definitely came off and created six separate wound channels alright so I know there's a lot going on in this job lock now I went ahead and did a couple other tests while I was out but you can see that those petals that came off that broad head slug stopped right at about four and a half inches but remember this is 20% gel so and 10% gel or in tissue or in an animal or something like that it would probably go a couple inches deeper and those are big enough pieces that came off of that to actually cause some damage unlike a lot of people think the g2 r.i.p would do because they're just so small and they don't really have anything behind them but those are fairly big pieces of razor-sharp steel that came off that slug and then here on the end of the block you can see that little red piece hanging out the end this is at the very end that it came out of and it left behind some of that polymer wadding it looks like this is a completely different hole that's from a different slow gunshot but that red pieced area is from the broadhead slug alright guys so this is what we recovered from the broadhead slug this here is the steel core that penetrator all the way through the block I found it down on the ground right by our metal backstop so it appears like it didn't have too much velocity left on it when it did leave the gel block but it did go through 16 inches of gel and went off the other side and then these here are the three pieces of that broad head slug that came apart when it hit the gel there was six total but the other three left the gel block these three here stayed in a gel and stayed in perfect condition really these things are are pretty crazy looking and like I said these are big enough to do damage these things were pretty big I mean those are the size of probably a 22 caliber bullet if not bigger so they definitely could cause some some damage and it's pretty nasty a little slug well that's it for me today guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed the video like I said it wasn't really what I expected it to be I thought it was going to open up more and stay intact kind of like a broadhead arrow does but nevertheless it was interesting and it's definitely cool and devastating shotgun round so there's anything else you guys want to see you go ahead and let me know I do have some more stuff coming up that you guys have suggested in the comments I really like doing the videos that you guys suggest it just lets me know what you guys want to see so if there's anything you guys want to see you let me know and I will see you next time thanks", "ebDPivG16HE": "Kitten season is here It's the time of year where kittens are entering shelters in huge numbers Often times without a mother. Most of the time this is because well-meaning people find kittens outside and assume that they've been abandoned When really the mother is usually right down the block. So if you find a kitten outside And they don't appear to be in immediate danger Please wait at least two to three hours to see if the mother does return Nobody's better at taking care of a little kitten than their own mama, but if you found your kitten And you're sure that she's an orphan, she's going to need special care and that includes bottle feeding. Whether you found kitten outside, or signed up to foster for your local shelter, here are my top tips for safely bottle-feeding kittens. Are you hungry? Tip number one; \"Get the right supplies\" Motherless neonatal kittens have sensitive systems that require a special kitten formula Not just any dairy product you have in the fridge. It's extremely dangerous to feed a kitten the wrong thing So please NEVER feed a kitten something she won't be able to digest Never feed a kitten cow's milk, condensed milk, soy milk, or other dairy alternatives Human Baby Formula or even cat milk Cat milk is a product that's sold at stores as a supplemental treat for adult cats But it's not kitten formula Instead you want to pick up something that says kitten formula such as one of these products Kitten formula is specially formulated to provide a proper balance of vitamins, minerals, Probiotics and a caloric pattern that mimics the content of a mother cats milk. I have links to some of the products that I like at kittenlady.org/supplies While picking up your kitten formula you'll also want to pick up a kitten bottle and perhaps an extra set of nipples Most nipples will not come pre-cut, meaning you'll have to cut a hole in them yourself There are a lot of different ways that people do this, including cutting an X or cutting a V into the nipple. My preferred method is to cut the nipple on an angle so that just a small hole is visible Cutting a hole properly it's important because it will determine the flow of the formula while the kitten is nursing To ensure proper flow, test the hole by turning the bottle upside down The formula should slowly drip out, one drop at a time if the hole is the correct size If you turn it upside down and nothing flows out You need to enlarge the hole. If you turn it upside down, and it flows too quickly Then you'll have to try again with a new nipple. Because there's so much room for human error with traditional nipples I like to recommend a product called a \"miracle nipple\" A miracle nipple is a specialty product you can buy online It's a hard rubber nipple with a hole already cut into it, and it can attach to a syringe for smaller kittens Or get popped onto a bottle lid, like this These are great because the hole is already cut, so it offers a steady flow and they come in a few different sizes for different ages of kittens. I have links to these on my website at kittenlady.org/supplies Ok, so once you have your supplies, it's time for tip number 2 \"Preparing the bottle properly\" In order to prepare the bottle properly you want to make sure that you're making your formula fresh, clump free and comfortably warm You want to make your formula fresh every one to two feedings, to ensure that the formula is safe for consumption So don't make a big jug of it to serve throughout the day. Follow the preparation instructions for the formula you purchase and make sure that any powder you don't use get sealed and put in the refrigerator right away If you're using a powdered formula, mix the powder thoroughly with more water according to the instructions Until it's completely smooth You might benefit from using a product like a smoothie shaker which will break up the formula's clumps it's important that the formula is clump free, because a clump can clog the bottle and result in a lot of frustration for both you and the kitten Finally make sure that your formula is the right temperature. You can mix your powder formula with warm water But if you're using an already mixed formula that you've saved in the fridge You're going to want to get it to the right temperature before you feed Some people do this with a quick 8 seconds zap at the microwave And other people use a teakettle method You can pour boiling water into a mug Place the bottle in the mug and let it float for about 20 seconds Shake up the bottle thoroughly and test it on the inside of your wrist to ensure that it's comfortably warm Remember that if the temperature is too hot or too cold for your skin It's definitely not the right temperature for a tiny kitten Once you've got your bottle ready It's time for tip number three \"Properly feeding your kitten.\" Before you reach for a bottle make sure that it's safe to feed the kitten Because kittens cannot self regulate their body temperature Hypothermia may occur in kittens who are orphaned if the kitten feels cold to the touch or has a temperature of 95 degrees or less It's not safe to feed her, focus on gradually increasing her temperature before attempting to feed Once the kitten is the appropriate temperature, it's time to bottle feeding When you're getting ready to feed a kitten, find a comfortable place to put her in your lap or on a table Always feed the kitten in a natural belly down posture The kitten should be comfortably lying or seated with her belly towards the floor May have seen images in the past of kittens eating on their back like a human baby, but this is very wrong and very dangerous Feeding a kitten on her back will be like hanging a human from her feet and feeding her a burger It just doesn't make any sense. Feeding a kitten on  her back can cause aspiration Which is where a kitten inhale fluid into the lungs. This is so dangerous, so please Never ever feed a kitten on her back. Think of how a kitten would feed from her mother on her belly Laying down or sitting next to the mama. Sit the kitten in your lap or on a table Holding the head steady with your non-dominant hand and introduce the nipple to her mouth with your dominant hand Don't be scared to really hold the kittens head, this is how you're going to help direct her towards the food Invert the bottle so that the formula can slowly flow into the kittens mouth but never forcefully squeeze the bottle into her mouth Instead you want her to suckle at her own pace Ideally the kitten will latch. Latching is when a kitten makes a U shape with her tongue and suckles to drink the formula You'll know she's latched when she looks like she's very engaged and active maybe even with telltale ear wiggle Place a finger on her throat to ensure that she's swallowing and she eats You'll be able to feel each gulp which will let you know that she's eating properly. Here's what a good latch looks like So hopefully that's what you're going to get But just in case here's tip number four; \n\"How to feed fussy kittens\" Getting that perfect latch feels great, but it doesn't always happen here's a tip for what to do If you have a fussy kitten that just doesn't want to cooperate If the kitten doesn't latch, don't panic Eating out of the side of the mouth is something that some kids may do at first And that's okay as long as she is definitely swallowing and as long as she doesn't have her premolars or molars yet Kittens who are five weeks or older will have teeth on the side of their mouth that can easily shred a nipple and they could swallow it and cause a blockage But younger kittens don't have teeth on the side of their mouth yet So if they do chew on a nipple on the side of their mouth It's okay as long as your finger is on their throat and you can feel that they are swallowing if the kitten is fussy and doesn't seem interested in eating Stop what you're doing and try to figure out what the problem is Sometimes it's just the posture, or the flow of the formula So make sure that you're feeding in a comfortable position, and that there is something wrong with the bottle Is it too hot? Is it too cold? Is the hole in the nipple big enough? Is there a clump blocking the formula for coming out? All of these things can cause a kitten to just not really know what to do So make sure that everything is working properly. If the kitten is squirmy or disinterested, remember this okay to really handle them Some people are scared to handle a kitten because of how fragile they are But you have to remember that the kitten doesn't know what you're trying to do You have to show them So hold the head and body stable with one hand You can even wrap them in a blanket if need be, using the barbershop technique Like this This can help the kitten stay focused and protect your hands from tiny claws at the same time You can also help the kitten feel ready to bottle feed by brushing her with a toothbrush or by cradling her face in your hand This simulates the experience of being nozzled against the mama's fuzzy belly and being groomed, which can help encourage them to eat Most importantly remember to be really patient with your kitten. If they're being really fussy, just remember to take it slow and help solve the problem It's so important that you get some food in these little guys every couple hours And you're the only hope they have, so try to be patient with them Okay, so tip number five; \"Feed the right amount and the right frequency.\" Young kittens require frequent feedings, so be prepared and care for them around the clock until they're about five or six weeks of age and weaning onto wet food For the first few weeks of life That will mean waking up in the middle of the night to feed Try not to be intimidated by having to wake up in the middle of the night Even though the care is frequent it only takes a few minutes of your time And it makes a huge difference for the little guys. Having small amounts of food every few hours is going to help keep them hydrated and keep them balanced with nutrients and fat that they need for rapid development and weight gaining You'll see that as the kittens get older, the amount they eat will increase but the frequency of feeding will decrease That means that the older the kittens are, the longer of a break you'll get between feeding. You can use this feeding chart to determine how much your kittens should be eating and how often Just remember that each kitten is different, so this is just a guideline, not a rule book. Some kittens vary in weight and development So use your best judgment while keeping this guide in mind as a helpful baseline. Tip number six; \"Monitor the kittens progress.\" Make sure that you have a small digital scale on hand and weigh them daily So that you can monitor how they're doing Having their weight will help you determine their stomach capacity and how often they should be eating But it will also help alert you if something's going wrong Keeping track of the kittens weight is a great way to ensure that the kitten is making the necessary gains Weight the kitten at least once a day and write down her weight in grams She should be gaining at least 10 grams per day. If the kitten is not gaining weight or if she loses weight Seek immediate veterinary support My last tip is to remember that it doesn't stop a bottle feeding You will also be tasked with stimulating the kitten to go to the bathroom Atending to her medical needs, keeping her warm and clean And otherwise providing her with a safe and secure environment until she's old enough for adoption After feeding, wipe down the kittens face so that no formula is sticking to her fur Gently rub the kittens genitals with a soft tissue to stimulate her to urinate and defecate Do this at each feeding being mindful to wipe up afterwards so that she stays clean and comfortable Once the kitten has been fed, stimulated and cleaned up It's time for her to go back to her warm safe space until the next feeding Repeat until the kitten is weaning onto wet kitten food Good luck with your bottle feeding and thank you for helping to fight for the little guys", "GsL3CjuUUVw": "what's up guys it's either a with shade 420 and today I'm gonna be doing and all showing you my weed home I went to a dispensary yesterday one that I've never been to before I got some pretty cool first show I got these two pre-rolls they were free because it was my first time and they're pretty dense I'm guessing they have at least point seven grams in there so that's not bad and I don't know what the quality of the weed is but they were free so yeah this is called a pineapple Chloe quarter of this haven't tried this one yet so I'm gonna try some of it I know I couldn't find the Leafly information on this one no really Vince well let's break off you don't squish at all I've tried two of these strains so far one last night and once morning but this strain is the one that smelled the best to me looks pretty good I know it's a sativa I think it was 70/30 maybe you know take a hit of this hope you guys are smoking a lot Cheers tastes pretty good I think this pipe isn't my cleanest so it's not the best for tasting but yeah the next one this is start time this is the one that I tried this morning I've got the leaf Lee information here I know this one is oh it's more of a CBD strain I believe this was 12% CBD and about six percent THC so it doesn't get you that high but it's nice for relaxing or sometimes when you need to stay focused and you don't want all that THC or this morning I've used it before my workout and that worked out really well no that's also a quarter ounce and this is really moving number four have some of this last timing from the other dispensary and everybody liked it so I got some more than yeah really blue is yeah it's a good string for me anyway I think a lot of people like it choose you're gonna smell us you know I'm not very good at describing what they smell and taste like because I haven't tried that many straining here's the next one this is 1/8 of cheese quake it is an indica I hadn't heard of that one before so so the 60/40 indica and supposed to taste like cheese and earthy flavors so kind of interested in this one it smells very earthy almost like flour recon so yeah and then I got one more feat here Death Star they're pretty big nothing then I'll take that out this is a huge knob it's gotta be almost three grams so this is what I tried last night and the Daejeon Leafly said it was a hybrid look at it it's across a sense I yeah Cinci star and Sour Diesel and yeah has a really powerful buzz you can definitely feel both to the sativa and indica effects I like that so that's all the weed in there so I'm just gonna smoke a little nice Bowl Cheers so yeah let me know if you guys want to see a review on one of these strings like I said I'm not the best determining taste and smell and stuff but I can only get better at that Cheers notice that my head quick has been harder to put out I don't know why but yeah I guess that's about it might make a video with one of these join it sometime I'd be cool but yeah thanks for watching guys hope you enjoyed this video and peace", "LlnB4rw0GaY": "so I would say the most tricky part about this integral is knowing what to substitute because if you try to solve it with u equal to 16 minus x squared you quickly come across problems that make sense horrible so what do you do is go to a reference table like this one and we see that the oppression is similar to the first row where we have a 16 squared minus x squared so we will be concentrating on the first row only so in this case our a is 4 so we let X equal to 4 sine theta so now we substitute x equals 4 sine theta into our integral we get 1 on the square root of 16 minus x squared so x squared will be 16 x squared theta yep so we want to get the X to change into beta terms we find the derivative of this x times 4 DX d theta equals the fold hospital so we have DX equal to 4 times beta times D theta so rewriting our integral we have changed the XD 4 cos theta D theta we have all called Trail D theta over the square root of 16 minus 16 sine squared theta so do you see how we have a common factor of 16 or now denominator we can factor out or called theta D theta over square root of 16 bracket take 16 ounce of one minus sine squared theta so remember looking at this reference row if you're using the substitution X equal to X I feel you expect to use the identity 1 minus x squared use cos squared theta so we have a 1 minus sine squared beta here we can replace it with consequent fatal so we would get 4 cos beta D theta all the square root of 16 cos squared theta and if we take the square root of this whole denominator we get square root of 16 is 4 and square root of cos square theta is just called fatal so we're left with these two cancelling out so we're just left with D theta which is getting the great part it would simply be theta plus C so now we need to find theta to make it through out in the closed in terms of X's again so what do we have here we we said before X use the small sine theta so we have sine theta equal to excellent for temple theta equal to the inverse sine of X on 4 so we substitute this in we get sine sine inverse X 1/4 plus C and as I talk to this integral", "Hro5_guB2hA": "all right so we're going to learn how to do us double crochet stitch so firstly we'll start off with a slipknot and a foundation chain so that we can practice on okay so a slipknot you'll just wrap the yarn around your finger like that pop it off grab the working end of the yarn push that through the back of the loop pull it up and tighten it and there's your Slipknot now you just get your hook and pop it through there tighten that up a little bit and we're just going to do about 10 chain stitches to practice on practice our double crochet stitch on so wrap the yarn around the hook draw it through wrap the yarn around the hook draw it through and you just keep doing the same for 10 chain stitches and that'll make a foundation chain up the owner on the hook pull it through wrap the yarn around the hook pull it through so I've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay so we're going to start the first row into the foundation chain now now with the double the us double crochet stitch it's a longer stitch so we'll need to start working into the fourth chain from the hook so you count this loop on the hook isn't a chain stitch so the loop down one two three four now we'll wrap the yarn over the hook and pop it through the top loop of the chain stitch wrap the yarn over the hook draw it through the chain stitch wrap the yarn over the hook pull it through two loops on the hook wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through the remaining two loops and there's your first double crochet stitch now later on that those three chain stitches we left there will be counted as a double crochet stitch as well we'll talk about that later okay so second double crochet stitch wrap the yarn over the hook push it through the top loop of the chain stitch wrap the yarn over hook draw it through wrap the yarn over the hook draw it through two loops wrap the yarn over hook draw it through the remaining two loops and there's your second double crochet stitch so just so you know there are two double crochet stitches in the crocheting world one is us and one is UK the UK double crochet stitch is half the size of a u.s. double crochet stitch there's just they're different stitches in UK in us so that can be confusing when you first start I got caught out there reading patterns so just make sure you have a look at whether you're reading a US or UK pattern because you'll need to determine which stitch you're actually going to be doing okay so I'm moving on wrap your yarn around the hook push your hook through the top loop of the chain stitch wrap the yarn over hook draw it through wrap the yarn around the hook that through wrap the yarn around the hook and pull it through the last two loops alright so I'll just do one more here and then I'll quickly do the rest and then I'll move on to the second row and show you how to do a crochet turning chain as well so wrap the yarn around the hook push it through the top loop of the chain stitch wrap the yarn around the hook draw it through wrap the yarn around the hook draw through two loops wrap the yarn around the hook and draw it through the two remaining loops okay now I'll just do the rest here okay so when you get to the end of your work you're going to need to turn now how I do that is I hold my hook like this and I spin the work on the hook around that way and with your working end of your yarn I push it in between the work and the hook and up to the back there alright so now we're going to do a crochet turning chain for a us double crochet stitch and you'll you'll need three chain stitches so we'll go one two three and why you need three chain stitches is because you you need to bring your yarn or your work up to the height for one of these for the double crochet stitch so three chain stitches equals the height of a double crochet stitch okay alright now we'll move on to the second row and we're going to wrap the yarn over the hook and we're going to insert the hook from front to to the back into both loops of the stitches now and we'll start in the second stitch because we've already got the three chains counting as one double crochet stitch in the first stitch there so that's why we go into the second stitch alright so wrap the yarn over the hook and we're going to push it through those two loops of the second stitch wrap the yarn over the hook and draw it through those two loops of the stitch wrap the yarn over the hook draw it through the two loops on the hook wrap the yarn over the hook draw it through the two remaining loops and so that will count as your second double crochet stitch so we'll move on to the next one wrap the yarn over the hook push it through those two loops up over stitch wrap the yarn over the hook draw it through the stitch the two loops of the stitch wrap the yarn over the hook pull it through there wrap the yarn over hook and pull it through those two and you would just continue on doing this same stitch into each stitch on on the previous row and that's how you would get a double crochet fabric so I'll just finish this row here so if you wanted to continue on after the second row you would basically just repeat this row two that we've just we're just doing now alright so into the last stitch now see that that that's the chain three crochet turning chain and remember we count that as a double crochet stitch so we do need to crochet into the third or top chain of that crochet turning chain and it's slipping away from me here so you do need to get a stitch in there if you can get it in there that's why it's a good idea to make your crochet turning chain stitches a little bit looser so you can actually get in there and I've made it too tight and voila I did it phew", "_CpOr3HHUEI": "it's all about the crochet I'll put you in welcome to the game show hey everybody welcome to the Jayden stitches show I get asked this question all the time how big do I have to make my granny squares and how many do I need in order to make a regular-sized blanket well there's a lot that goes into that question so let's unpack all of the elements that make up this query in order to answer this question for yourself you're going to need a few things you're going to need a pen and a pad of paper because you're going to have to make some notes you're going to need a calculator and you're going to need a measuring tape how big is a regular-sized blanket well that depends do you mean throw something you can cuddle up with on the couch a baby blanket something you maybe want to give as a gift do you mean a twin-sized a double-a queen or a king well just so happens I have the average sizes of those blanket shapes right here okay now you've decided on the size of the blanket you want to make now you need your granny squares this is where a little bit of math comes into play my best advice is to make the granny square that you like you can make it five rows or three rows or four rows you can use whatever colors you want make the granny square that you like and then measure it once you've decided on the size and the number of rows and all the color patterning that you like for your granny square take your completed granny square put it down in front of you grab your measuring tape and measure it from one corner to the other this is a six inch squared granny once you have that number take your pen and paper and write it down granny square equals six inches squared now that you've measured your granny square and you've written that down time for the calculator write down the size of the blanket that you've decided on so I'm making a blanket that's 60 inches by 80 inches what does that mean 60 inches are the short sides 80 inches are the long sides it looks something like this this is 60 inches going this way and this is 80 inches going this way take the short side first enter that number into your calculator 60 inches now divided by the size of your granny square six oops 60 divided by 6 equals 10 I know that I need 10 granny squares up and down the side of my short side blanket now you do the same thing take the long side measurement 80 divide it by 6 inches or the size of your granny square and you might get a fractional number that doesn't matter take the closest one so since it's a point three I'm going to round down so 13 is the number that I want alongside the long side of my blanket so now I know that my blanket will be 13 squares by 10 squares remember you will probably be putting on a border and that extra couple of inches that your border gives you well beef up your blanket to the approximate size of the whole blanket you're going for you don't have to err on the side of too many squares you can always err on the side of a couple too few and I'll tell you why when you join all your squares together no matter how you decide to do it whether you sit them together or sew them together there's going to be a little stretch and that stretch will happen because the weight of the blanket on itself will pull your little squares out a little bit and it'll be even so worry about it but that stretch is going to give you a little more length and a little more width and like I said when you put the border on you're going to have a little more length and a little more width across the top bottom and the sides so your blanket may not be exactly 60 inches by 80 inches but it'll be close to that and if you're making it to cover a bed then you can always go a little long if you want to go from floor to floor but most of the time these sorts of Afghans are folded up or folded in half and draped across the edge of a bed or if you're just using in the sleep just make it sure that it's long enough for someone to get underneath and stay warm so remember choose the size of the blanket you want to make first write down your measurements make the square of your choice measure it write down those measurements and then take the long and the short sides of the blanket divide each of them by the same size of the square and that will give you how many squares wide and how many squares long you need your blanket to be so if it's ten by thirteen or two by six you know exactly how many squares long and how many squares deep you need them to be and remember there's one more math step to this so if you have a blanket that's ten squares by five squares I guess that would be five by ten multiply those two numbers together five times ten is fifty you will need 50 squares to make a blanket that size if you need a blanket for a baby and the size of your square winds up that you only need it to be three squares five six squares take three times six that's 18 you'll need 18 squares to make that blanket here's how it looks on paper so once again how many squares do I need well in my little diagram I figured that I needed 10 up by 13 long so I take 10 as the width times 13 which is the length grab my calculator 10 times 13 equals 130 I will need 130 squares at the six inch mark that I made to make this great big blanket here now obviously if your squares are much bigger you will not need as many of them that's why it's a really good idea to go through this little math program to figure out exactly how many squares you need for your blanket and there you go that is how you figure out the size of the blanket you want to make and the number of granny squares you need in order to make that blanket that's it for this week everybody thank you so much for tuning in and if you have questions about crochet projects that you might be in the

or sometimes in Fahrenheit you may need to make your own cake flour or bread flour or self-rising flour and the recipe may specify that you use one package of instant dried yeast then again you may need to use two fluid ounces of milk now how much is that or maybe some two large egg whites and these and there are so many such conversions and we end up going to the Google Gods again and again to find out how much I need to use or what temperature I need to set my oven at so these and lots such conversions will be of great health when you start baking I made a baking chart for my own reference
