{"FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so

barrel guns now there have been some other designs of single shot shotgun other than break barrels but the break barrel is the most common and ubiquitous so that's what we're going to be talking about now all the ones we're looking at today your H and ours well kinda sorta and I'll explain that in a moment but there have been quite a few other manufacturers that made break barrel shotguns and the biggest of those was Stevens which is part of Savage and there was also Iver Johnson made a lot of them Winchester made a lot of them and there were a few other smaller brands and then there were also a lot of store brands hardware store and Montgomery Ward Sears and so on I think Sears their name brand was revelation which was actually produced by either H & R or Stevens one or the other Stevens made a lot of different store brands for various hardware store companies and so on but they're you know there's no telling what you're going to run across out there but probably H & R is the number one brand you're going to find number two as far as the inexpensive ones will be Stevens and number three as far as the inexpensive ones it's probably Iver Johnson and and then like I said you'll you'll find your Winchester's and so on which the Winchester's I've seen some that were quite affordable and pretty much overlapped the process of used H and ours and Stevens but they tend to be a little bit more expensive than some of these so I guess you would say lower grade brands which are still good brands so first we're going to look at this one and this is the reason I said all RH and ours for the most part this actually is still in H&R but it's called New England firearms in EF which is the name that h and r went under for a while after they were still etching our 1871 but when they first in 1986 I think it's when the original ownership h and r ended and they were bought out by some other entity that was called New England firearms and they still sold the H & R brand but then they also sold some that they called any F and then I think later on the NEF name went away and and they became just H & R again and then eventually Marlon bought them out and Marlon actually produced some of this same gun under the Marlon name but it's the same gun and they also H and/or when they were still under original ownership they came up with this exact design the SP one partner and so you will find some pre 86's that are this exact design and then you know they continued this design all the way up through their demise just a couple of years ago I guess at the hands of Remington I might add enough about that but anyway these are good guns good reliable guns they have the push button release one weak point I guess you would say is that the trigger-guard is plastic and also the trigger itself and some of the mechanism in their rods in that plastic piece it's so there's one piece that's pinned in there and it holds the trigger trigger spring and maybe one or two other small parts and that you know contrary to what people are taught in school plastic does break down it doesn't last ten thousand years it it becomes brittle and breaks down this is an older one and this was made I think this is a topper forty-eight and I think that it came along and it might have come along in 1948 anyway up I was going to look that up I used to know but it's been a long time since I've read anything about it and I don't remember for sure but I think the top or forty-eight came about in the late 40s and then was produced through the fifties and maybe even sixties and at some point it was either supplanted or replaced by the topper 58 but or maybe they were different different grades of basically the same gun I don't know I'll have to look that up but anyway it's it has the the top swinging lever top barrel latch and it does it moves in either direction to open that's the type of latch that a lot of the stevens guns have also and the stevens model 94 is one to look for in fact my first ever single barrel shotgun when i was a kid was I I guess I was eight or something like that was a Stevens model 94 in 410 but oh this one the latch now this has though our had to pull away you pull away the forearm and it's it's a spring-loaded catch in there you pull it away and it allows you to break it down these later ones you have to actually remove a screw and remove the four end and then you can break it down but with these it was a spring-loaded latch and that latch is missing from this one so there's a piece of duct tape on there holding it and this gun also had the plastic trigger guard slash trigger housing and just like the later ones and you could see what's happened here it's it's broken and I've had it out and it's breaking up and I can get a new plastic one they're available for about $15 and there used to be a metal one available for I think it was about $40 but I don't think they've been available for a while but I've thought about actually making my own out of aluminum or something but I probably should just buy a plastic one you know I'm sure it'll if I bought a new plastic one it would last you know rest of my life anyway but I like that when it's you know the actions typed and everything gets kind of beat up but it'll it'll be well worth fixing and it does shoot as you'll see in a few minutes okay now this one is I'm not sure what this is a hundred percent but I believe from looking at that it's the the latch is missing but it's got you know the pin is there but I believe this is a model 1900 H&R and you know what's the deal it opened a little while ago oh the firing pin is down well I've never fired this one and there it goes who knows I might not be able to today firing pin fell back that time though but you know these originally had a head a little latch right there and you flip that out and you could pull the pin out and then take it down with the forearm still attached to the barrel that's how that worked and because that is the way of an H & R 1900 is made I believe that's what this is even though it has no markings of any kind that I've been able to find but it's a pretty neat gun and as far as that firing Bend looks like though the firing pin retainer has probably had probably been out so it might have had a spring in there and that spring gets missing or broken or something that retracts the firing pins that's probably what the DOAs now this one yes it's almost the same gun it actually does have some markings on it it says special I don't know if there are any other words or not but I did ascertain from researching this when researching the markings on it and everything I did ascertain that it is indeed an H & R and I believe it's a model 1908 so it would be the next newer version of this one assuming this one is an H and are and I believe it is but anyway I actually have far this one this is a rough looking gun but one thing about this one is the stock is in but stock is in terrible condition on it it's all split and everything and so I can't shoulder fire it I need to drill through it through the wrist right there and put a put a dowel through it and and epoxy it and you know reinforce all that and everything can make it so that it's it's fully usable again but like I said I have fired it I just held it like this I believe or I might've just fired it with a string but we're gonna fire it today we're gonna fire all the things and I'll see how they do so let's move on to to firing them now we're going to start with the newest one the NEF and we're using just basic low brass number eight dove loads three DRAM equivalent will go in the same order as we looked at them so next it's going to be the top or 48 by the way I forgot to mention but you can buy all manner of barrel inserts to use in these things to shoot 357 Magnum smaller gauge shot shells 44 Magnum or what have you or of course you can shoot buckshot slugs small game shot and so on so you don't have to if you want to use it like a rifle you know for deer or whatever you don't have to have a sub caliber insert but it does provide you the ability to use some other form of ammo and and those inserts are fairly easy to build yourself to so with that let's par around from the top of 48 this one and the Pardoner both have ejectors as opposed to just extractors an extractor just lifts the shell up so you can pluck it out an ejector actually throws the empty clear but I always put my thumb there to catch it because I don't want to have to pick it up off the ground so I save all my holes okay this is the one I've never fired before the one that I believe to be an H&R model 1900 there it goes it looked like the firing pin was back but it wasn't wanting to open huh I need to take a closer look at that and see what it's going to take to fix it but it probably works we're about to find out [Music] there it goes okay that one has an extractor not an ejector interesting it made a pretty crazy indentation on the firing pin indentation on the primer - which doesn't surprise me because it's got a pretty big hole for the firing pin it's a cool gun though I wouldn't want to shoot it every day because especially with that big hole for a big firing pin hole so I don't know I might just shoot it occasionally and call it good enough all right last let's shoot up the shoot the beat up one the one I believe to be a 1908 H&R now as I mentioned before I mean this one does work smoothly and it's got a normal sized firing pin hole - so I really need to fix that because this will make a very useful shotgun its ugly and beat up but it seems to be mechanically fine but as I said before I'm going to just hold this one in my hands and fires I'm not going to shoulder it because that would be sure to do more damage to that buttstock and I need to fix that it's missing the butt plate - by the way I'm sure I could get a new old stock or reproduction buttstock for it but it will probably also cost 100 bucks or more and I only gave $20 for the god I'm not saying it wouldn't be worth a hundred bucks for a new butt stock but I just don't want to do that I would rather he poxy it up put a dollop in through it and then maybe wrap some rawhide around it to boot that would look like a look like a a period repair something you would have seen back in the 20s or whatever or earlier or later yesterday or whatever you know wrapping it with rawhide has been around for a long time that's a that's a pretty common repair for stuff like this I probably should do that to the the four end on the on the top of 48 but I guess you could say duct tape is the modern rawhide okay let's quit talking and shoot all right the extractor or ejector neither well okay I think it's supposed to be an ejector yeah anyway like I said with a repaired buttstock I think this will be a very useful shotgun okay let's pop off a few rounds from the most modern God I've got a round chambered and in my left hand here I've got a high-capacity magazine [Music]", "gi1NXWVdQwY": "hi I'm Martha Lally owner of a state gymnastics academy in north dartmouth massachusetts thank you for your interest in group gymnastics we're excited to bring to you some of the benefits of group gymnastics and how it can be an exciting new program for your gym when people hear the words gymnastics competition the first thing the usually picture is the lone gymnast on the mat uneven parallel bars are flipping over the vault by themselves and being judged on their individual skill level there is a twist with the traditional sport of gymnastics that has been gaining popularity and it is true team gymnastics team gymnastics is fun develops a team spirit and as an added bonus there is less time spin at the gym the camaraderie of team gymnastics develops differently and the students feel less pressure to perform and have more fun at competitions hi my name is Rachel I am the gym manager and head coach of the team gym program here at baystate gymnastics academy team dream is a great way to get a bunch of kids in the gym at the same time being active we have four teams in the gym at a time ranging in sizes from eight to twelve kids we practice on four events they are group floor which is a synchronized floor routine tumbling vault and mini  which are all rapid-fire streaming rapid-fire streaming is when all of the kids line up in a single line behind each other and they are running a few steps behind each other quickly and a line towards the apparatus that they are competing on this has beneficial to team gym because all of the kids are moving all at the same time in a straight line as one unit and no one's ever waiting in line each practice includes a 30-minute strength and conditioning class that is mandatory for all of our team gym participants these conditioning classes start 30 minutes prior to their to our team practice we start each practice with inline tumbling which we do to eight counts that this way we make our students move as one unit we do this back and forth across the floor and as they're doing this we fix their form and their technique so that every child looks the same as they're doing skills after a basic tumbling we split our teams up into their individual events where they have approximately 30 minutes with an instructor to work on their level specific passes with and without their streaming in addition to their weekly to our team Jim practice each gymnast is only required to attend one additional gymnastics class a week our competition schedule runs about from a January to June we go to about four meets a year one which is including team gym Nationals which is usually some time at the end of June team gym competitions are fast-paced and fun for both the spectators and the gymnast the big difference between artistic gymnastics and team gym is that you can compete almost a hundred kids in under two hours team gymnastics is on the move and bay state

based a second this is the new ejector it's a new manufactured party but the catch is is that it's pre-much universal it will fit a bunch of different guns and it is not specifically designed for this gun it's always available what I've done is I've had to ream out the hole that it goes into it's pretty damaged you can look down underneath there and see some of the scoring down in that channel and that is where this goes I'm actually gonna have to ream it some more but you all can see you see how small how narrow that channel is down there the gap in the barrel look at the size of the ejector and reference to that you can see there behind there how small that is compared to this objector so what I'm going to have to do is custom machine net or I'll actually probably miss no more I'll just grind it to fit so you'll see here this is still pretty tight I'm gonna have to I got to get a different reamer of a different size go up a couple thousands on my reamer size make sure that we've got it reamed where it's gonna right now I mean yeah it'll go in there but it wouldn't operate smoothly so what I'll do is I'm going to hit this with some dye Kim and I'll scribe where I need to grind to first time I ever heard someone talk about Dyke him I thought they're saying Dyke um like Dyke them like tonight them where are you guys talking about what's it mean to be Dyke I don't want to know come to think of it just don't tell me now once I get that cut down to the right size the right width I'm gonna have to put a channel in it so it will excuse the shakiness there because the shotgun shells got to be able to drop down in there and you see the channel the groove the rim from that shotgun shell sits in well this has got to match that so we can sit flush in there because that will actually sit underneath the rim of this shotgun shell while it's in there so a good bit of hand fitting that has to be done here I had jigs and properly you know tooling on the mill and all that stuff I did a bunch of these wouldn't be a big deal but since I'm going to do it all by hand it's gonna be a little bit involved not too bad though but anyways with that Dyke him once once it's dry I'm just gonna go in there by hand and I'll make my marks I'll have a scribe handy so I just use this razor blade right about there now I've just got some witness marks and I'll square those off and except for the mark there and mark there that gives me a general idea I'll measure and I'll just go ahead and pull these out now what we'll do now I'm sorry about all the shakiness I'm trying to hold it where you guys can see try and do this where you all could save but it's gonna be hard to you thing to do is going to be measured there and measure down here on the bottom and see if we've got a little bit of a taper either way I'll grind this down just on the outside of those two marks square and then the rest will be just hand fit process elimination because I'm just looking at it and some preliminary measurements this hull is not centered in between there that's one of the things about some of these over guns it's one thing if you've got you can have the best equipment in the world you can have you know 14 nexus mils there's not really such thing you can you can have elaborate machine stuff and it won't do [ __ ] for you if you're dealing with a gun like this where nothing can this concentric it's not on a center axis this was done by hand or someone on a hand machine and so jobs like this a lot of times the only way they can be done is by hand and that's what we're gonna do here here's the measure the mark is about 76 there 76 I don't know if you can see the marks I described on there and will grind to just on the outside of those first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to see how we'll see how well they file be if it'll file nice and easy that's what we'll do is just file it by hand sometimes that doesn't work too good see where I'll stop there just short of it and I'll switch to a double cut file cut something faster you see there we definitely narrowed it down a good bit use that just to make sure the bottom is fairly level all right and see here after filing it to the marks that I set forth and then I tested it and then I tapered it on the top edges of each side there gave it a little taper there and a little taper there just check my sizing and that's what I've got so far so that that's that's pretty good for just preliminary now this part down here is gonna have to be angled to help it to close it and push against the spring whenever the breech is closed we'll worry about that in a little bit err if after filing it again and now it sits flush now the next two things that I've got to worry about are going to be matching the contour of that groove right there and getting my angle right here to make it close in the breech and allow it to lock part of what I'm going to do to get the height of this down a set of grinding and use my ball team hammer and paint it down P that'll end up making it stronger than if I just wants to grind on it file the back side a little bit now we'll test there you can see they did protrude up pretty far but by taking that and just painting it sit a grind in it and redo some metal I'm compressing that metal in together mushrooming it out where it fills in the gaps from filing and getting it the size I want all in one you don't have to be in any hurry to do it you just take your time while that backside down Wow fit in there all the way I'm not worried about only fouling in one direction for this see how it fits looking pretty good you need to come down on this left side just a little bit right over here slowly getting there I'm gonna move it a hair now we'll look into cleaning that up a little bit better and the thing to check for here let's look and see how far that shell protrudes with your ejector in there look and see now you see right there see it actually sits in farther without the ejector so we need to look at addressing that you know got a little bit more grinding to do hopefully this will be the final rendition yes it is a live show and that's good enough for me that'll loosen up a good bit here just just with getting it seating and everything and so for all practical purposes that part is done now I just need to shape the bottom so whenever it closes it will match it now and I'm going to do that by starting out sorry I'm just giving you the bevel and then it'll be a process elimination because I don't have the old one at that Park to go by I'll just had to bevel it and put the gun together see if it works and continue to file on until I get it right you can see here I'm filing this bottom edge down so it will clear block that goes right here we got this back together Clem they're test-fitting seems to be going just fine it does catch down there so we'll see how it does you you can see here where I'm continuing to adjust this and pile it right now I'm putting a round bevel on it so it will clear the latch just doing this with a single cut bastard file and that is modeling clay that I've got pressing around there to keep it from singing while I'm filing on it like that a lot of the place cheap I mean it doesn't matter oh I got metal plates in it doesn't matter now I'm gonna hit this with the wire brush on the grinder smooth it all out and we'll test it out again that's after hitting it with the brush or the extractor there and does closed it does open back up now what I'm gonna do here [ __ ] hammer I want to make sure that this time when I close that the firing pin is sticking out there you see it in there and the reason is because you want to make sure that your ejector is going to either push the firing pin back in or at least not cause the problems ideally it will push it back in so it doesn't interfere with the shell coming down there and it is doing that everything appears to be just fine so now I'm gonna pull it back out and glue it and put it together once and for all all right what I'm going to be doing here for this part I'm actually going to be using the birchwood casey plumb brown barrel Brown you swim there cleaner degreaser doesn't have to be there cleaner degreaser there's any number of cleaners and degreasers out there that work just fine so it just so happens to be that what that's what I'm going to use right now it actually comes a little sponge but again you can use whatever you want and it's been sanded to the finish that I'm looking for I'm not trying to get it I don't want all of the imperfections out of this I wanted to have some striations and some just some impurities and no impurities but just imperfections because none that it's going on is not pristine I just want to make sure that you've got the scrub good and clean walls greases anything like that it's on it I've got to get them off there I'll let it sit and work for a few and we'll come back to it and we'll rinse it in some water we move on to the next step come back to us have been sitting there for a minute a little bit of water in there just rinse it you got running water now you can rinse it and flowing water I don't have flowing water out here so I just use that's actually distilled water doesn't have to be but anytime that I'm messing with coatings and stuff I prefer to use distilled water now this is a heat process and so what I'm gonna do here is clean off a spot throw the heat to it and get some pliers all right that's appliers we're going to use now what you do is you heat up your part to about 300 degrees a little under right at and then while it's sizzling hot you rub the brown all over it got it a little over 300 degrees I believe it's starting to turn colors on its own map gas will do that for sure you see it it rusted basically what it looks like it looks like it's just uh quick heavy rust and that's basically what you're doing here is you're doing a form of rust rust browning bluing those terms can be used interchangeably now I'll rinse it off and I'm going to repeat so what I'm gonna try and do here see if I can just heat it while it's down on the table let me move the camera for a second you might be able to do that around the table real good and I mean you want to rinse it off in between your cycles you want to take a little steel wool or something you can kind of scrub it some we'll leave it at that and I'm going to coat it a little dry it off and I'm going to coat it with some water is placing oil that could be wd-40 if you need oil oil it because it will do a hard rust if you're not careful and treat it that way it won't corrode once we've done that we'll see what kind of color it gives us what I usually do after I've glued something or been working on it I want it coated with some oil I have this container it's just got some paper towels in the bottom you can see it's saturated and I always try and coat anything with oil or spray it down while it's in here that way I'm catching all the excess if I need to I can take something like say these pliers here I can dab a screw or something like that down there on that and now that's it's coated so I'm saving a bunch of the excess spray if I want to take this and roll it I can you know like if you got a pin or something makes everything keeps everything for being so messy the majority of it what I've been using is barricade what I just sprayed on this is some of the q20 glue this is I'm doing this is a teeny gun lube and this other the Black Diamond Keith morning sent these to me to test and evaluate actually in response to my affinity for frog loop and I'm finding that it's not so much in competition with FRA glue it can be used in conjunction with FRA glue so anyways I just wanted to show you what I'm doing there and maybe you'll see this on tip coming up here's our part finalized my head and browned on the inside of the barrel get that where it looks a little better in there now what we'll do is push this in and now go ahead and catch it and then we'll put our that last pin out take your hat off so it doesn't get in the way there we go now that we've got that through there we can drive this pin through to replace that yeah and put a touch of wicking grade on each side they're a touch Lord that was more than a touch wasn't it now the only thing you have to watch out for with the wicking grade is that it'll wick into your internal part and seize it in there and that's just something that you know it can be broke free it's not a mechanical lock so you can break it free but it's it's just something you gotta watch for something that I don't like and I have not seen this before you know maybe on some of these older type shotgun the stuff and some of the older repairs this is more common but it appears to me that this has been the epoxy Don it's loved maybe I'm wrong but it seems that maybe it was braised and then epoxy or just epoxy I'm looking at uh chit I'm not gonna do anything with it but it was a little fishy maybe I'm wrong just taking her to the fact which is not a you know I'm not above being ignorant something this I actually and took it back apart because now that I haven't back together I'm finding another where spot I don't know if you can see it right there that little divot that's from the firing pin catching on it whenever I was going to open it and so I'm going to file that and give it a bevel kind of to funnel that firing pin into the groove when it's going past it this way and then when we Brown it we coat it with all and hand put it back together again there we go little divot in there now zoom in down here a little there we go try and get it on camera see if I can give you guys a better view there that I'm down firing pins out and now that firing pin is pushed out of good ways you'll see them I don't know how much you guys can see sorry for all the shakiness I always it hits that groove and clears now when you open it up you see if you guys can see in there well either way that grooves doing its job just wasted a whole bunch of your time in my time trying to show you that oh well I need a camera crew anybody that lives around Knoxville Tennessee that wants to work for free on a moment's notice anytime let me know that you work filming that's a mermans silent india in a marinara dish better anyways that's the bass state h and r 12-gauge new ejector on it and i say we throw a shell in it see if we can't blow a hole in the wall here that works just fine looks like we may need to work on our spring tension just a hair it doesn't seem like it's got too much too much yeah that's moving it out but not much I don't know I'm gonna look and see if it seems like it's supposed to move a little farther or not you", "8n8lolisOFs": "hey everyone lynn is reaching out again want to give you some updates here on what is going on with him today before i get into that please head down to the comments section and also please head down to the description section if you are watching this video on the main alternative news channel that channel is at two strikes so it is one strike away from being completely removed from youtube so if you can head over please subscribe to the alternative news 2 channel i can still get these messages to you i can still get in touch with you all if anything happens to that main channel so please head down there and check it out lynn today is busy he says fighting the battle against the enemy he says anything happening other than joey bribes biden falling down and facebook and instagram shutting down spring arrives soon it says for those interested in the ongoing demand by the communist bar of georgia that i submit to a mental health exam before an unidentified professional for unidentified reasons below is my most recent letter to chris steinmetz the bar's chief judge jury and executioner one hour after i sent the letter chris told me to go take a hike in response to my continued request for factual justification for the examination crickets if i was not fighting for every other lawyer in georgia and clients who have the right of counsel of their choice as matter of principle i would tell chris to take a hike but i will keep fighting back so he's also including some led or sorry some emails here so there was an email from chris steinmetz which he mentioned here and he says mr wood thank you for your letter of today as indicated in my correspondence of march 15 2021 you have until march 31st 2021 to respond to the board's request for a medical examination for your challenges to the participation of any board members and until march 31st 2021 to respond to the notice of investigation in the board issued notice of investigation two one zero zero one zero you have previously been advised that you are entitled to the advice of counsel in these matters there are many lawyers who have considerable expertise in representing lawyers in matters such as these if for any reason you are unclear as to your present obligations i urge you to seek the advice of learned counsel he says your responses are governed by rules 4104 4204.3 and rule 11 of the internal rules of the state disciplinary board any timely response submitted in conformance with the rules will be considered but in any event the board is obligated to follow and will follow these rules i urge you to read these rules and comply with them as will the board when it administers your matters again if for any reason you are unclear as to your present obligations under these rules i urge you to seek the advice of counsel i will look for your responses detailed on or above march 31st thank you christian j steinmetz member state disciplinary board of the state bar of georgia so yeah it looks like they're you know lynn has sent a letter off and chris at the state bar of georgia is responding and again it looks like they're requesting this medical or this medical health examination again so lynn shared i guess the response first but later on here yeah i think he shares his image his initial message to them um len says maybe he was too harsh in describing steinmetz's response as a take a hike response but he thinks it was accurate in his description but will let us decide lynn says despite my 43 years of practicing law all over this country with a few notches in my trial lawyer belt old chris felt the need to tell me that i needed to read the rules and engage learned counsel chris needs to read the constitution and learn about due process and free speech and the state bar of georgia better get a real trial trial lawyer if the bar wants to do battle with me these are some pretty good points here i mean lynn has all these like 43 years of experiencing practicing law like he says all over the country and you know they're telling hey you need to read the rules and you need to engage you'll learn to counsel um but you know like a lot of people that are attacking lynn right now and a lot of people on the left you know they don't really understand what's in the constitution they don't really understand laws in this country or the laws that make this country great and they also don't believe in free speech because um you know if your free speech is not or what you're saying does not align with a liberal agenda then you're just getting cancelled you're getting kicked off of social media like um so yeah we can clearly see that like what the liberal agenda is or what the liberal narrative is and free speech is only something that exists for the left right now in this country um so here's i believe the email from lynn to chris he says you and the state bar of georgia continue to be unreasonable and violate my constitutional rights i will secure council and i suspect i may have a role to play myself i have considerable experience in defending victims of witch hunts i wish you luck signed l lynn woods so i guess this is len's response to that of email from chris he says by the way all of my life i have believed that there are no coincidences after i surrendered my life to god i realized why there are no coincidences our lives are planned by god our creator thus when i wish someone luck i am politely suggesting they are in deep trouble because there is no such thing as luck a plan is a plan period so once again for good measure good luck to the state bar of georgia and chris steinmetz so yeah clearly see he's uh not being serious a little bit of sarcasm there with uh wishing the state bar of georgia and chris good luck he says the agenda he bets that the agenda-driven lawyers slash communists in the hierarchy of the state bar of georgia thought they could railroad lynn in the darkness of their confidential kangaroo court do they not know that my first name lucian means light when the light shines on the state bar of georgia nazi tactics freedom loving lawyers in georgia will demand change out with the old and with the new stay tuned and be patient it will be like watching a movie i will keep you informed so that you may feel like you are in it many of you may recall when the low life mercer law school dean kathy cox publicly discussed my relationship with my children to advance her political agenda to smear me and yeah these are you know lynn's talking about this again and we know there's a lot of smear campaigns on him right now one of the smear campaigns was that investigate supposedly he was being investigated for voter fraud like he was living in a different state outside of georgia and then they claimed he voted in georgia well that was the story right and then it all turned out to be a fraud it all turned out to be a lie and a joke similar to that washington post story about what trump said when he had the call with the georgia secretary of state office lin says thanks to her now i have a lower life reporter at the propaganda rag law and crime and disgruntled fired employee who i later learned is a con man and a fraud trying to use my children to smear me i warned him not to do so i will not publicly discuss issues with my children i have only said that i believe they result from a difference in our faith i pray every night for reconciliation lynn says he heard rumblings this week that the state bar of georgia may be planning to do the same thing with his children in its unconstitutional efforts to force me to take an unjustified mental health examination i have also heard that the lawyers with whom i formerly shared office space may be planning to do the same thing with my children in a fee dispute case the former colleagues are nicole wade jonathan grunberg and taylor wilson of the atlanta law firm of wade grenberg and wilson what do you think of these people i know what i think so he also has some verses from the bible here he's also asking do we think he was right in his december 2020 remarks at wills park in alpharetta georgia when he described our national and world crisis as the battleground between good and evil i think a lot of people that follow this channel do see that right now we see what's going on with the left in this country and just the destruction of the constitution and the destruction of our rights you know they're trying to take away our guns they're trying to take away our freedom of speech they're trying to take away all these great constitutional rights that make this country great so you do have this battle between good and evil right now so that's a good point that's a good message there from lynn i don't think he was wrong um i think he's spot on right there and not just that as a nation right because typically the us is you know the leader of the free world so whatever's happening here is going to shadow down to other you know free countries in this world so he says it's at a national and a world level which i agree lin also says it seems like forever since the lie of november 3rd i know as it is extremely disturbing to freedom-loving americans to see what is happening to our country under the fake administration of joey quote unquote bribes biden and i don't keep spelling biden with an a there in his last name i don't know if that's on purpose or if that's another uh joke there but uh he already calls him joey brebs biden so but it's by dan now in the battle between good and evil we know god has already won we are on the victory side like you i want this twilight zone movie to be over yesterday but since i know the ending i will continue to still be and wait on the lord this is a time to grow and strengthen your faith also says that truth is that only god can save us he will you know walk by his ways or walk by his guiding light so he signs that lin um yeah i think a lot of us probably feel like we're in a twilight zone movie right now too things are just really crazy right now um the things that are going on uh in dc with uh biden and his 50 bazillion executive orders he signed since he's been in office we got this border crisis going on now there's just like a lot of bad things happening right now and i think a lot of people that follow this channel uh agree with that and can see all of the terrible things that are happening so i think lynn is just saying here even though the world is getting really crazy and things are pretty wild right now that the truth is that only god can save us so please like this video please also subscribe to the channel if you are not subscribed hit that notification

ingredients and colors so let's get started state of massachusetts abbreviated m a joined the united states on february 6 1788 they've got a couple of different nicknames here first one is the bay state it's called this because of its proximity to several large bays it's also referred to as the pilgrim state in reference of the settlement of the pilgrims in 1621 the first thanksgiving was held

their economy based on their natural resources is based around dairy products greenhouse plants cranberries hay scallops sand gravel and crushed stone now before i end our little lecture i'm very quickly going to mention the boston tea party i'm not into politics and the boston tea party is a very political piece of history but in a very very very short summary december 16 1773 the boston tea party was an incident in which 342 chests of tea belonging to the british east india company were thrown from ships into the boston harbor by american patriots disguised as mohawk indians the americans were protesting both a tax on tea taxation without representation and a perceived monopoly of the east india company okay this turned out very pastel colored do our first little slice here ah okay looks like a modern art let's see how it changes as we get farther i probably should have done a little more stirring with my stick oh that looks pretty cool i like that that looks nice am i a little too close to you scoot back a little bit that looks nice i like those wispy things oh there we go that's a nice swirl in there so everybody continuing my movie reference little women which is originally a novel written by louisa may alcott and this was a book published in 1832 therefore i believe it would be considered public domain the story is a coming of age classic telling the story of four sisters growing up in civil war america and it some of the topics are struggling with poverty pressures from society and the pangs of first love and this story takes place in concord massachusetts which is also the home of alcott the author joe is the name of the sister that is followed the closest i guess you could say she is the main character but really they're all the main character but joe gets a little extra attention i suppose you could say so this book in addition to at least 12 adaptations made for television the book has inspired six feature films that's a lot of movies the first one was a 1917 british silent film look at this beautiful swirls does this make you think of massachusetts it really doesn't make me think of massachusetts it makes me think of candy so that british silent film the actress who played joe was named ruby miller and the second feature film was in 1988 american silent film and joe was played by dorothy bernard boy those are some old movies over 100 years old everybody the third feature film was italki as you would call it from 1933 filmed during the great depression so the movie greatly resonated with the audience because of the poverty aspect of it and joe is played by catherine hepburn then the fourth movie was made in 1949 and it was the first technicolor movie not first technical movie first technicolor little women movie and joe was played by june allison then the fifth movie which is the only one that i have seen and it's also the movie clip the movie that i'm going to get a clip from is the 1994 movie and joe's played by a winona writer then last year in 2019 was the sixth movie the name of the actress who played joe is sorry say ronan i have no idea how to pronounce her name look at that beautiful swirl this looks like this is the bar yep okay all right so here's my question that i ask my people who watch my state soap videos have you ever been to massachusetts i have not ever been to massachusetts sure i would love to go i'd like to visit at least every state once alrighty my dear viewers have a wonderful day oh josh i'm sorry i don't understand it's not bad hiding places you see i don't uh know anyone so i feel hulk we're just standing and staring at people all hail to massachusetts the land of the free and the brave for bonker hill [Music] and the shot heard round the world hail to

couple of things you have to accept when you walk into these laws and one is you may not walk out a prison what correctional officers are locked in a deadly fight for survival stepped into basically a real trouble prison I'd like to stab people that was my feet I heard the razor start to cut and it's a better grab the razor and I tried to get him off me at the time I didn't realize I was being stabbed I was covered in blood Jane oh god right here that's gonna stop it you know now inside the prison code from a distance cala patria state prison could be just another dusty Mirage in the scorching California desert but the men and women who work at this maximum security lockup have no illusions about the threats they face it's a very hostile and dangerous environment officers come to work every day they put their life on the line vastly outnumbered and carrying only pepper spray and batons correctional officers are constantly prone to brutal attacks from hardcore inmates armed with an arsenal of homemade knives there's a couple things you have to accept when you walk into these walls and one is you may not walk out if you come in and you're not scared then there's something wrong with you anywhere cala patria sits on desolate bone dry ground 140 miles east of san diego when the prison opened in 1992 it was designed to hold 2,100 level 4 inmates the most dangerous in California today more than twice that number are jammed into every corner of this sprawling facility the inmates are very intelligent men and they can be very creative in how they want to get it staff warden Larry Scribner is a former CEO a correctional officer who's worked his way up he took command of cala patria in early 2006 i came into an institution that had gone through major attacks against staff by different inmate populations and I stepped into basically a a real trouble prison I like to be recognized I like to do things I like to stab people that was my thing I like to be sticking people in the stomach or wherever this inmate is a former member of a powerful prison gang known as the sure\u00f1os or Southern California Hispanics after getting stabbed himself he sought protective custody and must remain anonymous I know we'll go around and say at certain times certain day you know get your things ready get you nice way to get everything very cool start establish you know seals when gang leaders issue attack orders against cos they can happen anytime and quickly escalate whether it's a code of conduct to believe they call it their regulations that if one member of that gang is involved in an incident with a staff member all the other inmates and that the meeting area have to assist you have to do it you have to do it and even if you don't even know about it or you don't know what what it was all about and at cala patria there's no shortage of shanks or homemade knives circulating among the inmates that's one thing that's gonna keep you alive one day what's your weapon without your imprison a lot of these weapons probably found on the yard and cell searches a lot of times you'll find a women walking across the yard acting suspicious he may look nervous and be trying to avoid eye contact it's basically being observant seeing what they're doing or does he doing something out of the ordinary is he not talking to you is he acting like he's got to go some really quick several officers have found weapons just by being observant you suspect everyone has it you never know who's gonna have it the one you least suspect is gonna have it it's gonna be the one carrying it but in addition to gang violence officers also have to worry about random assaults I just hit him in the mouth I was he convicted murderer Jesse Mangia attacked an officer just to make a point I hit the co because he disrespected me whatever they give me I give them they give me respect I give them respect if you come in here looking for a fight I guarantee you there's 4,000 guys here that are more than willing to give you one and you can really get hurt around here and things can go from from zero to chaos in about two seconds all it takes is the wrong look the wrong day getting caught up in somebody else's madness any number of things can happen here nobody knows that better than kal Apache is sergeant Pickett some people were willing to say that I've had the most assaults at this prison myself I've been punched kicked it was sticks I got stabbed about a month ago that attack happened while Pickett was on duty inside a housing unit I saw an inmate that was acting suspiciously followed him up on the tier I told him to stop he didn't stop he pulled a knife out and attacked me with it he stabbed me in the back of the neck cut my eye and cut my arm and I fought with him for about a minute and then my responding staff helped me and we got him down with no warning at all Pickett was victimized by another gang rule that virtually guaranteed he'd be attacked there's unwritten rules within the walls where if an inmate is found with the weapon he has to use it on the cop that finds picots wounds were relatively minor but the scar stay with him I have a little one right here on my arm and that's kind of scraped me there and then this patch of eyebrows that I lost is where he got me in the eye and then the other ones on the back of my neck it's just a violent place and bloodshed and there's something that it's a shame but you get used to it it's the reality of where we work it's this reality of prison in California at a level four I heard the razor start to cut and so I just figure I'd better grab grab the Rays and they tried to get him off me the attack on correctional officer Malcolm was even more chilling he was working the processing desk located in one of the cell blocks I was only regular on the floor that day I think it was Monday I let one guy out two had a shower and it still II came down you know think much of it give me a 6 or 2 she's in him making play for him and stood on the podium on the town's like what's this that's when he reached up and grabbed me by my chin pull the head back in the drug eraser across my throat it's a razor blade that we give them just so they can shave we broke it pull the razor out and for hundreds I think he melted it into something like a toothbrush handle and like wrap the string around there for a handle Malcolm will never forget the sensation I feels like a dull pain like dull here to here cutting cutting your skin you guys have you shave you shave you here the you know the razor scraping the hair off yeah I started cutting into the skin yeah I knew I was happen because I heard it yeah I mean I didn't I didn't feel it yeah I think just cuz the adrenaline was gone that adrenaline probably saved Malcolm's life as he managed to fight back yeah I was able to grab the razor with my hand and kind of fight him off and why don't over by those stairs right over there and a pepper sprayed him he kind of shocked me at first because you know I've been in you know five years I had been assaulted and it's like oh this sucks Malcolm knows he's lucky to be alive and he has an ugly reminder of how dangerous his job can be 26 stitches oh my throat right here that's part of the risk you take I mean that's part of the job description you know you could tell me Harry could get assaulted could get killed it's just the story it is but in spite of this many officers have found that being attacked has only strengthened their resolve to stay on the job it's a lot like the military in the sense of I have a crew I have a good group of guys that I work with this can't leave we take care of each other so and that's like it carried out I don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon coming up it's a cat-and-mouse game it's a matter of trying to catch them when their guards down the CIO's unleash a late night raid in the battle to control alla patria warden Larry Scribner inherited enormous problems when he took over Calipari estate prison in 2006 just because that's how we want to run there is a population of inmates out there that have a different idea of what the day should go like and they actually dictate the date despite officers best efforts the inmates seem to be calling the shots we got to live here they just work here so we have to make it as best as we can for ourselves for many inmates making it means following the convict code which dominates every aspect of prison life with what the convicts present me with first before I follow the rules of what the ministration give me back home in LA inmate Antonio Jones was a member of the Crenshaw mafia part of the notorious blood street gang Jones says when he's forced to choose whose rules to follow the decision is clear the administration they can take me and they can put me into hold and lock me up but on the yard somebody can come up to me and kill me so at the end of everything that didn't happen I may be in the hole but I won't have no holes in my body loyalty to the convict code creates a world within these walls where anything can happen and today is no exception an alarm sounds on one of calop Atria's recreation rods as the staff races to the scene of an inmate fight armed officers watch from towers above what it was I guess Amy got sliced the apparent weapon is a homemade knife found lying in the dirt near the wounded man you don't know if the weapon was out here prior to the incident if it was brought out from the building he was brought out from another location they may could have picked it up from someone else received the weapon that's there's so many variables having worked these yards for more than 13 years officer Hernandez is never surprised to find weapons because inmates never stop discovering new ways to make them this basically shows a lot of what inmates here at Cal catcher have used for weapons weapon stock the creativity they used in creating some from piece of metal or a toothbrush one of the ones we have right here just a couple of pieces of a desk handle actually as a before and after piece right here what this is a desk handle from some of the best here the institution they'll take that off sharpen it down and turn it to weapon looks like this all that's missing is a handle any kind of material that they can find they'll turn it into a weapon common toothbrush right here just a regular toothbrush sharpened down melted turns go up and with the handle on it these are really hard to detect because a lot of times we do use metal detectors and maids passed in the middle detectors a lot they won't go off with the metal detector obviously it's made out of plastic a lot of this material is actual material made leftover from construction on the prison it's back from the maintenance areas like we have portions of an L bracket right there used to be four carbon turret there they've taken it down cut it and sharpened up as a weapon for some inmates the prison kitchen is a virtual weapons manufacturing plant if getting ready for war you have somebody that's working in the kitchen that bring you pants you mean and you have they'll be some to Daniel's as an assembly line making making the weapons and passing them all out some of these they're meant to kill like this one right here all it is it's a folded can lid from the kitchen with plastic melted onto it and sharpened down this is a common weapon the metal carts that we have to transport the food they'll break the material off of that sharpen it down aluminum a lot of the minute rips before in the past wouldn't pick up aluminum they still don't but we're working on trying to get newer metal detectors that will pick up a lot more so something like that that's meant to do some damage if that weapon needs to get to his destination it's gonna get there regardless of what and whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen regardless of what you know ain't ain't no God right here that's gonna stop it you know it's our job to try to stop them but we'll never stop them it's been going on since prisons were started though the odds of eliminating all inmate weapons is against them the correctional staff isn't about to give up the fight facility receive information that could be a possibility of inmates it could be in possession of a may manufacture weapons these officers all part of Cala patria Special Investigation Unit have been up all night planning a weapons raid on one of the prisons housing units Italy conducted searches on Tuesday the search just came up negative I notified the Charly facility captain and advise them we're going to go ahead and do cell searches in Charlie five housing unit inmates Cuba it's a great possibility inmates could be in possession of manufacture weapons and also narcotics any gang material we're gonna go ahead and confiscate let me go and get you guys the cell assignments it's called be cool we are confidential information I'm stating that they may have weapons and it's 4:30 in this morning the team walks to the housing unit fearing the sound of vehicle engines might wake the inmates and alert them to the raid we like the element of surprise most the time these guys will be asleep if we try to do so searches anytime after this hour their bills they'll be awakened expecting this as the raid team approaches the housing unit they stay close to the wall to avoid being seen from windows beat open at the entrance they signal an officer to open the gate once inside [ __ ] yourself heads up pull your hands up the surprise works the startled inmates are led to holding tanks while the CIO's tossed the cells they search every conceivable hiding place meticulously examining anything an inmate could turn into a weapon this is a razor but they broke it in half and this is typically what we're seeing on the yard these flashings from the razor like this it's being melted down into a toothbrush and used as a weapon the raid team even checks the toilet using a technique they refer to as phishing officers don't hook weapons in this cell but they find other contraband a plastic bag full of homemade prison alcohol made from bread and fermenting fruit they also turn up an inmate manufactured syringe it's a cat-and-mouse game we know they have it they know we know and it's a matter of trying to catch them when their guards down you're always on your toes some people say you know are you afraid to go to work I say in a way yes I used that fear to keep me on my toes keep me on the edge yeah it worries me the next guy I'm gonna pat-downs gonna have something on them but I rather I find it and get it off the yard than it be used on either another inmate or another staff member coming up they said I was the one who started a whole like all right you know I mean the worst riot in Kalapana history zone were kicking they're like soccer ball and hitting up the torso ribs at the time I didn't realize I was being stabbed nobody ever told correctional officer Garza that prison jobs were easy every day when I come in I come in with butter place on my stomach every day I don't know what's gonna happen when one day is very different from the next Garza worked see yard one of four recreation areas at cala patria state prison in California I responded and on this year alone to numerous stabbings staff assaults I was involved I've been involved in couple of altercations with inmates myself knowing the risks the keepers of cala patria are geared to deal with even the most extreme assault scenarios much of this increased training and firepower has been implemented in the wake of the unbelievable events of August 18 2005 on that day a seemingly routine incident on si yard touched off a full-scale prison riot inmates no talking about the riot could lead to an attack by a prison gang but one is willing to take the risk because he's the one that set it off they said I was the one started a hole like right you know I mean they accused me a star a whole ride inmate Marc Gracia is a gangbanger with a reputation for fighting with correctional officers but on the day of the riot he claims exercise was the only thing on his agenda always a yard and worked out ran little bit I like to keep my endurance we've been getting anonymous reports of problems with a Hispanic inmates population saying that they were gonna sold staff that afternoon officer Harbert is working si yard padding down inmates as they file back to their cells as Gracia walks by Harbert spots a homemade weapon in his shorts correctional officer pulled me over and he was like in church and when I did I grabbed onto that object which I knew was a weapon it was a rod it was about several inches long and had a handle on it when he started to me he said was this nice it's a phone book in a pen so he said get down so I smell what are you talking about well it's gonna be relatively simple he started to bring his arms down when he got to about here he reached with his right hand and grabbed on to my right wrist when he did that at the same time he swung his left arm back and in attempt to hit me I used his body weight in his momentum to spin him around to the left and I placed him on the ground right here in the prone position on his stomach he slammed me to the floor within seconds several other inmates in the yard converge on harbor's who is Gracia pinned to the ground they began kicking me in the head stomping me some of them I could see stomping me in a downward motion some were kicking me like a soccer ball and hitting up the porcel ribs at the time I didn't realize I was being stabbed as other officers rushed to Harper's aid the remaining Surenos gang members of unit C are compelled to join the fight or else you can't just be right there and have a co come and get you is that true they know both have to seal automatic you're gonna have you gotta jump in you have to jump because if you don't jump in they won't get at you with that inmate rule in effect the staff on C yard is in need of major reinforcements they call the code 3 which means everybody and their mother comes from the other yards to help out with all hell breaking loose on the yard it's not long before officers Melendez and Ritter are under attack as well I looked over and I saw several staff members fighting with inmates as I start to run across the yard I see officer Melendez get physically thrown to the ground the same one that that slammed me on the ground started hitting inside of my head just I don't know how many times he hit me just kept hitting my head just kept going back and back and I remember thinking wow you know I need to get back though I never I was mad I was angry it was like you know these were my workers and it was just like I was pissed off it was either anywhere between three to five inmates involved all Southside Southern Hispanics we were wrestling with them on the ground trying to get them under control and then all of a sudden can this here you know shots being fired up around shooting about them and then everybody just I guess everybody just got down and it was over with was it thanks to the sharpshooters it seems the staff has see yard under control but the violence spreads like wildfire I left that area came down the yard and got to the front of building five when I got to building five the alarm sounded [Applause] I was in first my partner more was in behind me what I thought was strange was normally during an alarm there's a lot of yell and a lot of commotion disruption but it was quiet eerie quiet you know I just just weird didn't make sense Ritter is joined by sergeant Pickett and they brace for the worst pretty much just fought together to try to get the inmates off they were using mop handles and eyes and sticks in the head and stuff what went through my mind was I'm not gonna get home to my kids tonight I'm gonna end up in the hospital I'm not gonna come out of this well I remember seeing an inmate coming towards me and broke push boom on the top of my head once you break it it looks like a spear realizing he's in a fight for his life officer sander ball goes for his baton I have to do what I do I have little ones at home it's either them or me it was just like a warzone in there pepper spray was everywhere blood was everywhere broken steeps we just stayed on our feet we knew if we went to the ground we wouldn't make it out the inmates continued the onslaught until the air is shattered with a reminder of who is really in charge I distinctly remember hearing a loud crack and after being around weapons as many years as I've been around I recognized it as a rifle shot from the security control center high above the main floor of the unit a single shot from a high-powered rifle effectively ends the riot I kind of saw him go down but I didn't realize he had been shot as soon as that rifle shot sounded the fight was over the inmate who's been shot dies instantly what the gunner saw you know I can't answer what he saw but he saved a lot of people's lives because it could have been very very ugly with the riot finally over officers could tend to their own 27 would be rushed to the hospital I was covered in blood blood had ran down through my jumpsuit into the lower parts of my jumpsuit I was dripping all over the place officer Harbert whose attempt to confiscate an inmate's weapon set off the revolt had been beaten kicked and stabbed well this is one side of it then it would take weeks for the injured keepers to recover from their injuries even longer for them to return to work my family understands where I work the children I try to make him seem like I'm invincible so they don't think anything could happen to me and I didn't go into total detail with them they seen the injuries I explained to him and something happened to me at work it was rough for them for a while but they're doing a lot better now I know it would have been bad I mean four inmates on me I mean come on you know I'm sure I could have you know done whatever I could to protect myself but it would have been bad and they could have probably killed me the man who allegedly started the riot mark Gracia continues to claim he wasn't carrying a weapon that day because he was so close to serving out his time I was short I was going home why would I carry a weapon I mean why do I need to carry with but Gracia didn't make it home his attack on Officer Harvard bought him three years in solitary confinement soon talk of revenge swirled throughout the prison we immediately got a rush of intelligence that the inmates were going to retaliate in a two-for-one manner because they were going to attempt to commit you know atrocities or seriously injure two staff members at least for every one inmate that was injured coming up this is a very hateful environment the prison braces for retaliation from the riot in the aftermath of the Calipari state prison riot the battered correctional staff faced yet another threat that still persists today there's always rumors and there's always talk of a green light on staff they're gonna they want to kill two of us for one of them with some of the most violent prisoners in California seeking revenge against the officers the prison had to mobilize to protect its own we removed from this institution a lot of those inmates we almost changed over the Hispanics on CR probably 95 percent of them so we have very few of the initial inmates that run that yard there so our hope is by doing that that the remaining inmates don't feel that they're driven by that initial by those initial threats by those initial promises that they were made after getting rid of the ringleaders prison officials beefed up other security policies lockdowns have increased and there are new restrictions on how inmates move about the facility such as walking in single file lines to chow hall I believe that the walking in a straight line gives officers there better visibility of what the inmates are up to I have a lot of experience and watching inmates walk side by side or or in little groups and attack and when if you have every walking in single line loss and they bunch up something's gonna happen something's wrong but in single line it's easy to identify it very quickly boy there's something going on but the restrictions don't stop at single file lines new security measures have been taken at the cell block desk where officer Malcolm had his throat slashed come in to the yellow line but they cannot pass the red tape it's out of balance once they pass this the gunner from above is gonna put the building down their mates or take it down the alarm will sound any inmate that crosses that red line has no other thoughts other than to try and injure a staff member and that's the message I'm putting out to the population there is no need for them to ever get that close to that podium they get a warning line before the red line to say hey you need to stay out of there back off since the riot inmates must also strip down and pass through metal detectors before going out to the yard while the goal is safety it might be pushing inmates to the boiling point they don't understand the things that we go through ourselves you know I mean how much anger we carry inside us and how we just don't talk to people you know a lot of a lot of people they don't see that these that we go to and how will just snap anything the unrelenting threats posed by the inmates here can affect officers in more than just a physical way this is a very hateful environment and if you're not careful it can change you it can change your character it can change the way you look at people it can change many things about you it it affects my ability to be out in public I'm very wary of crowds I don't like being around a lot of people I definitely don't like people getting behind me people should be thankful that we have prisons because I'm telling you some of these guys are never gonna change and even though we call them institutionalize you know they're criminals and all this this is pretty much the only place they can function but some inmates hope to change that attitude we come together as a nation they see that it's real common inmate Jorge Armenta is an active member of the Surenos prison gang but he's also the inmate representative to a prison Advisory Council that helps set policies Communications so there's communication between administration you know and the inmates there's always gonna be some type of even though Armenta represents the inmates grievances he's still bound by gang rules one of them is never talked to the media coming up our Mendte pays the price for breaking gang rules we had a two-on-one with weapon with serious injury last night at cala patria state prison there is only one constant no one is safe from violence we had a torn one with weapons with serious injury last night it may a Demento was the victim yeah he got 11 puncture wounds to the chest area and at this point time he's in central house Jorge Armenta is a voice for the inmates but that didn't spare him as a member of one of the prison's largest Hispanic gangs he spoke too much and to the wrong people one of their policies is not to speak to reporters not to speak - correction officers so since he was interviewed by court TV we can only speculate that he was assaulted for that purpose our mentor was attacked within hours of giving our camera true and interview prison medical personnel expect him to survive but prison gang members who speak to the media are not the only ones in the crosshairs when inmates become targets calop Atreus correctional officers move them to SNY the sensitive needs yard the inmates on the other yards they would just soon come over here and take - all these guys out we're over here for various reasons maybe they had testified against someone and they're here for that reason there's a hit out on them we have quite a few sex offenders we don't ninety ominous real night rapist I mean we we ourselves we fight against that and a lot of times when people get on TV they want to they want to uh they want to put everybody as a group or there's a murderer there's child molesters there's a robber right there it ain't even like that I mean that makes us look bad I mean though that we want to be around them type of people we don't want to be around them more than anybody out there wants to be around them they don't want to child molesters they don't want to know rapists they don't want no no snitches they don't want nothing because it's our trash in the mainland it's our trash but officer Bishop a 12-year veteran at cala patria prefers working the SNY yard because inmates aren't ruled by the convict code I feel more more comfortable I'm not constantly looking over my shoulder and these guys over here if something's going on chances are you're gonna find out and on the main line someone's going on you'll find out when it happens the main line they're in it for themselves and if they want to go against staff they will and they have been there done that on this yard here they don't normally go against staff they'll go against each other they'll though so to speak clean house some inmates are on the sensitive needs yard not because of what they've done but because of who they are especially in here yeah you think you automatically go have sex or Richard Maury serving time for murder requested the sensitive needs yard to escape the dangers of the main line try to use your whatever is that's what he could see rest like a dope on I just have to you know be tough and I've had a friend of a slice in the face in the farmer she was gay wasn't a pretty sight we're raised away all you see is the skinny opening up in the blood coming out so we here we don't have to worry about none of that in fact Maury has found some peace of mind here gonna sell it draw huh make cards I'll turn keep myself occupied most people they like because for gay people we do laundry we could summon like that Andrew Williams serves his time on the sensitive needs yard as well Williams was 15 years old when he shot and killed two classmates at his high school he came to Cal apatrida when he turned 18 and was placed on the main line with the toughest prisoners a couple of white guys came to my cell and tell me what would be expected to me because I was young and white he's basically giving me like the 60-second rundown like alright this is you're gonna run with when you go out to the yard you're gonna hold our weapons when if you get visits you're gonna bring our dope to us therefore if we need you to and like if we jump on somebody you're gonna jump in with it and First Avenue em you're gonna pick up an ice and stab Williams says the inmates left no doubt what would happen to him if he refused to cooperate soon after he was transferred to the sensitive needs yard I'm really fortunate that I never got putting it in that circumstance and I never got put in a situation where I would have to go do this stuff away from the threats of other inmates Williams has plenty of time to think about his crime and his sentence of 50 years to life I've seen people yawn I've seen people get stabbed and it's definitely gloomy and it kind of puts everything in perspective I did this to myself do you ever think back on that day yeah it's easy to let like all this negative stuff creep up and say oh I'm a rubber person because I've done this but is it was a tragic tragic mistake and I've not move on but I just I can't let that define who I like what I what I've done isn't Who I am some of the men in sensitive needs have committed heinous acts but officers can't let their personal histories get in the way of the job you might want to react different if you know why they're here and on the sensitive need yards you have a good idea of why a lot of these guys are here you can look at it you can see it the less that I know about their crimes the better it is for them and for me and for my partner's officer Bishop will soon be looking after one new inmate on the sensitive needs yard George Armenta is about to be released from the prison hospital he has requested a transfer to SNY and has denounced his gang affiliation they give all that up when they come over here they know that we know that and if they decide they want to act upon their their gang instincts then we have to correct that my family you know they asked me about the job all the time and you know you know I had a good day nothing happened coming up your fists aren't only gonna work three rookies join the keepers of cala patria the best tool you have is that hole between your nose and your chin learn to control it we're going to make it work for you being a correctional officer at calop at Rio State Prison seems like an undesirable job officers are constantly surrounded by some of California's most violent convicts men who frequently attacked without warning and yet there are plenty of job applicants one inmate claims to know why that's a good paint job for I mean for the most part it's a high paid babysitting job you know sure incidents happen everything isolated incidents officer Ritter finds comments like that hard to stomach it makes you angry I just no other way around it I mean there's no way to sugarcoat that I have nice things because I work hard I've earned them I didn't come here to be a punching bag I didn't come here to be a pin cushion I came here to do a job that the state says needs to be done this is yard this is as good as it gets today Ritter is training three rookie officers after a major staff assault in May of 95 they built the fences now as you can see right along here the fence used to be this high right here after the 2000 riot or inmates were jumping the center fence to get involved in the fight they decided to extend it and put the razor wire up on top Ritter does his best to make sure these new hires know the harsh reality of their jobs and if there's one thing one piece of advice I can give you that will save you your baton is only a tool it's only gonna save you partway your fists are only gonna work part of the time your pepper spray may give you some distance in the fight but the best thing that you can do the best tool you have is that hole between your nose and your chin learn to control it learn to make it work for you given the history at cala patria it's likely that these young men will be heating Ritter's advice sooner rather than later but despite the dangers they're eager to meet the challenge I can come to work every day no no no who's on my team on the other side that's the main reason why I joined I just tell my staff that they'll never get hurt alone if they look over they'll see me laying in the bed next to him that's really all you can depend on while you're in here is each other because nobody else is gonna help you in here you're always gonna be a outnumbered there's always gonna be more inmates than officers it becomes a family thing he's got my back I got his back that's the way we we we make it through the day for many like officer Melendez injured during the 2005 riot quitting was never an option I told my family would you know they were like you see we told you you know are you gonna quit now and I told me no gonna quit now I can't if anything you know this makes me even stronger you know it's stronger as a person you know knowing that you know I can do this I can't do this when I left every day for work I always have my kids and always my wife he could kiss and told her I loved her because I didn't know if I'd be [Music] freeze em on dusty desert ground just outside the prison walls officers injured in the line of duty are recognized by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation when the call came they came when there was a need for a deed to be done they did it this is a Medal of Valor award ceremony and I want to thank all of you for coming here today to honor the men and women and say thank you to them sergeant Pickett Senate sitting over there he's getting an award today December 19th of just this last year was stabbed in the back by Tim 8 he's here today and he's working ah Sir Malcolm you out there ah Sir Malcolm doing his job and ma walks up behind him and slices his throat this is these people do this every single day they come into work not knowing what's gonna happen today there are a few smiles at this ceremony because everyone involved knows it's only a matter of time before the next officer is injured in the line of duty just a fact of life for the keepers of cala patria I always carried two notes in my pocket for my family in case I never came out just saying goodbyes and telling them I love them tell them I went out fighting that's pretty much my theory on life as always go out fight [Music] [Music]", "cT-zesM0y9c": "good morning from the shores of Moosehead Lake this is site 21 at Lilly bay state park campground in raoul cove and this will be a review though the GCI outdoor road trip rocker I already owned a GC I freestyle rocker and so this was my chance to try something else when I had an opportunity through the rain dirt Ranger program the road trip rocker is larger than the freestyle rocker with the larger back and the legs and the rocking mechanisms are slightly different as well this gives a better view of the size of the two of them you can see that the road trip rocker does have a much deeper seat the freestyle rocker tends to stop about the middle of my thighs the back is higher it's a little more inclined when the road the Freestyle is more upright so I realized that these tend to rock much more smoothly when the front end is significantly off the ground then you get a nice smooth rocking mechanism fold these up they also fold very differently this folds more like those camping chairs and go into the long bags a long bag to carry it not to mention the feature of the pouch to hold your phone or", "CDj1imCAtZA": "patriots who are telling me they can't receive texts i'm great how are you today clay well brother i'm excited you know we've got a lot of background ambient noise here we've got some great energy uh general flynn is gonna be here for the the town hall tonight and all the major media is covering it and uh so i'm on the phone with you we got general flynn there's so many great patriots out there uh sir there is this thing called a retraction being done by the washington post uh tell us about the great retraction i'd like to refer to it as the admission of uh wrongdoing for the listeners that aren't familiar with it just generally the background is that there was a funeral raised when president trump did an interview with brad ratkensberger's office and an investigator where there were claims that president trump had made statements that were reported by the washington post from an anonymous source in the secretary of state's office and they claim that he has said he wanted the investigator to quote unquote find the fraud and that if she did so she would be a quote-unquote national hero those quotes were lies they told the washington post or the story to the public was that there was no tape of them of the conversation with the investigator and the president well they found the tape they found the tape and the tape revealed that the president did not say that at all the president said that he wanted it reviewed because they might find some dishonesty and that her job would be important so they grossly misrepresented what the president said in a way to try to suggest that he was obstructing justice now the fulton county district attorney's office has got an investigation going to empower a grand jury based primarily on the false statements that were published in the washington post one lab begets another lie all designed to advance an agenda against the president of the united states they got caught so it's a big deal and it's a bigger deal than the washington post because untold numbers of members of the mainstream media reported the same lie right you see the media doesn't check anymore to find out if the stories are true yep the media doesn't follow basic journalistic standards on confidential or anonymous sources they get somebody that says what they want them to say they call them a confidential source so the person's not outed where they could be tested and then their statements verified right and they want they run to the press boy that's not the way they used to do it that's not the way journalists are supposed to operate under their own cannons of ethics and standards lynn i've never been an attorney uh for multiple reasons one i i know i could not pass the exams needed to become an attorney but you you have unbelievable memory and you've actually gone after cnn uh three times i believe and you you've won um you're one of the most legendary attorneys well-known attorneys in america why can't you in a court of law cite un uh what can't you say unknown or i guess like un specified sources why can't you in the court of law get up there and present evidence and say that you have a source that you're not going to name and then use that as evidence why can why can you not do that in the court of law and then why can they do it in the the court of public opinion but why can why why can the media do that but you can't do that in the court of law well the media has legal accountability for false statements okay so here i am joe citizen and they publish a false statement about me yeah and they attribute it to an anonymous source how am i going to go find out who that anonymous source is to test the credibility to test the accuracy to see whether that's not somebody just out there with an agenda a bias right against me well if they claim confidentiality they say well they only agreed to speak on condition of anonymity they give themselves complete immunity from wrongdoing and that is not the law i can remind the listeners and maybe i'm dating myself but there was a a minor incident that said facetiously called watergate yeah watergate was busted open historically by two reporters at the washington post woodward and bernstein they also had an editor there that new journalism standards named ben bradley bradley drove old woodward and bernstein half crazy because they had a source they called deep throat and they wanted to publish what deep  said and bradley said i'm not going to allow you to do it under the standards unless you can come up with two independent corroborating sources it tells me that deep st deep throat the anonymous source has a measure of credibility before we'll publish it now they were able to meet those standards but when you turn somebody loose in the media in today's environment on television or in print or online and you're simply going with one source who is anonymous everybody's at risk they're at risk that one source is anonymous because they're biased and they're advancing a false agenda there's no accountability for that person and then no accountability for the publisher that publishes their statements that's a lack of rule of law that's the violation of fundamental fairness it violates decades of journalistic standards so you can run with your anonymous source you don't the fact is the anonymous source is supposed to be the exception right not the rule it's become the rule in recent years in the media the reason that it's the exception is that the duty of the journalists is to undertake every effort to get the source to go on the record and it's only an absolute last ditch where you'll give them an agreement of anonymity but even then you've got to look around and find other corroborating evidence that supports the believability of the anonymous source otherwise it's just defamation by accusation from an unknown source and that's a slippery slope that we've gone down in this country in recent years in our journalists and media world because they've turned into propagandist and that's the that's their classic working tool now we'll say whatever we want to we'll say well it's an anonymous source anonymous someone close to the president right someone knowledgeable about the investigation who are these people call them out put their names out there so we can check out to see what's really going on and whether we're getting the truth or a lie so this is a big deal and it highlights a lot of problems in our media our propaganda media right now and the political agendas of people trying to overthrow our government now one of many problems but it's a major problem that's highlighted by what happened to president trump in this washington post story and guess what clay yesterday i gave what i'll call an educated guess based on information that i've developed over the last several months i said i bet you that we got to go find out who the anonymous source was that lie right and then she he or she in all caps needs to be fired there's got to be accountability i suspected then that it was jordan fuchs the deputy director the deputy secretary of state the washington post came out today and outed the source it was jordan fuchs jordan's the deputy secretary of state who has a job that didn't exist under georgia law until brad i call him brad jordy rathensburger created the position of deputy secretary of state and gave it to jordy fuchs who's involved with dominion voting machines who calls the shots at the secretary of state's office even though she's not qualified experienced or competent to do so because brad rappensburgers doesn't do his job he's got a lot of family money he does not actually perform his job as the secretary of state lynn huge and a guy named gabe sterling he's got ties to dominion too yeah i want to bri i want to bring this up here linda uh you mentioned dominion voting machines now dominion shares shared office space with george soros up there in toronto dominion the election machines shared office space with george soros that that's a fact we know that the software used the smartmatic sequoia election software that was created by communists in venezuela these are all these are all facts but yet somehow lynn you're being silenced because you're sharing the truth meanwhile the mainstream media can quote uncited sources and i think what's happening is a lot of patriots feel like they can no longer sit on the sidelines people feel like they need to get involved they want us they want to stand up they want to fight they want to get involved and if it's okay sir what i wanted to do is i wanted to bring in some people who are here for the general flynn uh a town hall tonight and i'm sure many of which are gonna come see you in tulsa oklahoma on april 16th and 17th and they had a few questions for you so is that okay if we begin to begin our linwood interrogation it's absolutely fine i love to be asked questions even if it's in the form of interrogation let me make one point yes yes sir look at look at look at what's happening my free speech is being censored and suppressed right with a national campaign to smear me and a campaign with mercy university the state bar of georgia the lawyers club of atlanta to punish me for exercising my first amendment right of speech and for exercising my right to petition for grievances to file lawsuits lawsuits by the way that were validated by clarence thomas's dissenting opinion so they're trying to keep me from speaking truth and they're letting people under the guise of anonymity go out and speak lies correct that's just that's just plain and simple propaganda 101 that's part of a color revolution where people are trying to overthrow our government and to do away with our rule of law so when you say people are upset they are they should be i believe in the rule of law so to draw an analogy not to get someone to claim i'm trying to stir up violence because that's not what i am and that's not what i do i'm a lawyer and i have to go in and fire my bullets in a court of law so i'm going to be suing the state bar i'm going to litigate these people uh through the rule of law until we learn once again that perhaps sadly it doesn't exist but i'm going to fire my legal bullets because if we don't try to fire those bullets legally god forbid somebody's going to start firing them in the streets we can't let that happen in our country so i'm going to fight in a court of law and i'm going to fire my bullets there and i've got some pretty good bullets to fire just like now we've got bullets in the court of public opinion to fire once we have learned that there was a campaign to lie about the president to ultimately get him criminally prosecuted and it's all a fraud this one masterminded by jordy fuchs and i think a few other people in the state of georgia when a treatment that's been safely available to treat malaria for over three decades now but now we're gonna we're gonna shift directions we're gonna do kind of go into the town hall mode and these are great people and lynn many of these people are gonna come meet you here at the event on april 16th and 17th uh this young lady used to work in a prison uh lin so watch out watch out man will you introduce yourself to to lynnwood hey lynn this is chrissy uh yeah i used to work at a prison um in cushing oklahoma you know small town small town girl um i just want to say thank you for being a patriot to us and sticking up for the american people i'm honored to be able to ask you this question and i just want to know are you excited to come to tulsa and um speak to the american people here christy the answer that is unequivocally yes i am excited listen don't demean the small town small town america is what makes america great it's the big cities in america that's creating the the problems in this country right now but america the heartbeat of america the heart and soul of america is rural america it's the small cities it's the small businesses it's the family units it's our communities so i'm thrilled to come to tulsa well we're very thrilled now do you uh uh have when you when you now work in the office up here how is it different working up here than working in prison i mean is there less fights is there more fights you feel more dangerous less dangerous it's actually thrive actually changed my whole life you know i love it here the the vibe here is amazing um it gave me a lot of opportunities to make my life better and do better for myself and get to meet amazing people like you lynn and a bunch of other people that are going to be at the conference so i'm actually thrilled to be here and it is a lot different than a prison so lynn it's a lot different than a prison up here that's the best endorsement i've received all year on the show all right now we have another listen she was she was in prison i was born in north carolina my grandfather called me a north carolina tar heel and then i moved with my family at age three to georgia he called me a georgia cracker now i'm in south carolina i'm not sure what i am i'm just a southerner but you could call me a redneck you can call me a deplorable i'm just an average citizen i've had some success financially in my life thanks to my hard work and the opportunities america gave me yep but i identify with the rednecks i'm not part of the global elite i don't want to be i'm i'm luckily i've taken opportunities in america to advance myself that's what's great about america it allows you to upwardly advance yourself based on your hard work and the exercise of the freedoms of this country recognizes the freedoms that were given to us by god almighty so i'm looking forward to meeting my fellow american citizens in tulsa knowing that we are all with the heart and soul of this nation and the heart and soul of this nation is not going to allow it to be taken over by the communists the global elitist or the cia and the deep deep state that exist in this country we're going to get rid of them oh absolutely and i stand with you lynn all the way so amen well then we have our next guest here this guy he looks like he's not part of antifa i know it's an audio only broadcast today he appears not to be part of antifa i'm gonna get him on this mic right here uh uh parker i'm gonna put him on that mic right here so sir come on down to this mic he's got a he's got a red tie on what appears to be a blue sport coat he's got some great khakis on lin i don't know he's not a member of antifa we're not prepared for the question he's gonna ask but uh sir why don't you introduce yourself uh to lynnwood and then what question do you have hey lynn this is michael paul i do not i am not and never was a part of antifa i'm just a roofer which oftentimes i get a bad rap but not that bad of a rap i guess my question for you lynn is you know the big picture that i keep hearing clay talk about is this fight for truth that is it seems like sometimes we're losing but i don't want to be discouraging or negative how are we continuing to fight so that the truth can be revealed so that we don't have to continue worrying about some of these issues that you've been talking about so far well let me say this our time on earth is limited by faith our time is unlimited we have eternal life through the grace of god almighty and the sacrifice of jesus christ but i'll tell you when when your time on earth is over and you were part of living in the history that we're living in right now do you want to be remembered as someone who fought to the end for truth or somebody who gave up and surrendered to the lie i think we all who are patriots want to be able to put on our tombstone that we fought for the death to the death for truth we never surrendered to the lie so what can we do i've said this and i think general flynn is probably the best spokesperson to describe it the way i see it is we've got to rebuild our country from the ground up right now to get back to what we were when we were founded a nation under god a nation of communities that combined together through states to be the united states of america so you've got to go out and you've got to start being active at the local level your boards of education your city councilman your mayors then you got to expand that into your communities where you're talking about your state officials your state board members your state legislators and yes your governors your lieutenant governors you gotta find people who love america that are willing to go and serve their fellow citizens citizens statesmen that's what we need we i think our founding fathers did not ever envision that we would be governed by officials who were there to be career politicians to fatten their pocketbooks and build their own personal power they envisioned that people would go and serve their country for a limited uh finite period of time try to do good work good laws for their fellow citizens and then return and live under those laws that they enacted so we've got to go back and that's what our goal and our model has to be we got to rebuild it from the from the ground up and it can be done i know already in south carolina i'm talking to people that want to do and are doing just that you got to do it in your political party too i don't know if i disagree or agree with george washington i think i agree with him that political parties two political parties were going to be the death male of of the country because you end up got one side getting what they want one side fighting for what they want and they forget the people in the middle i'd like to see president trump's model followed we don't need necessarily now to form a third party we need to rebuild from the ground up the republican party to make it the party of patriots the people who believe in what donald trump believes in freedom and patriotism and what i think will eventually happen is you're going to find they were almost a one-party country a party made up under the name of the republican party a party of patriots a party who loves freedom a party who loves the fundamental principles this country was founded on i've always said bring in the immigrants if they want to come here and they want to be part of an american experience love our constitution work hard play by the rules we were made up as a country of immigrants what we have now is a country where they're flooding us with people that don't care about our constitution they want to change it they don't want to play by the rules they want to come in illegally we've got to get back to the fundamentals isn't that true in life fundamentally in life we've got to get back to the fundamental rule of life and that is that we're created by god almighty and he gave us a set of rules to live by our constitution is supposed to have been based according to the people that wrote it on god's law we got to simplify our lives we got to simplify our laws and we got to pursue simple truths simple truths are simple truth we got to start being good to each other we got to be civil to each other we got to recognize that we're all different but we're all alike and we've got to focus on the similarities because right now they're trying to get us to focus on the differences and that will divide us so we need to focus on the basic things that we all share in common we ought to be good to each other and be civil to each other and respect the right to disagree so we've got to get back to fundamentals in politics and government and in our own personal lives lynn uh we have another uh person here who's here for the town hall event this person i don't know if she is a member of antifa or not i i there's no real proof we don't have lin we don't have proof that she's a member of antifa but i'm trying to practice to be on be a member of the washington post here be careful now some anonymous source will come out and say that she is yes i'm saying i have an anonymous source very close to the source it could be in this room it could not be we don't know uh but i'm trying to get a job willing at the washington post so i'm trying to practice so here we go uh folks we're here here on the thrive time show we have an anonymous source close to the source near the source on we can't name them right now to keep them safe who thinks that our next guest might be a member of antifa don't research it don't look it up just assume it's true uh and then we'll print it okay that okay then i'll i'll keep practicing okay uh ma'am what is your name and uh uh what question do you have for lynnwood yeah so my name is parker and my question would be i know you've had lots of years of experience and a lot of followers of people what's one piece of information you would want them to walk away knowing after talking to you one piece of information based on my life's experience that's a good question let me take two seconds or three seconds and think about it because i don't want to get this one wrong i want to be honest with you if i had to give someone starting with my children my friends and my neighbors one piece of advice i would tell them to start at the fundamentals figure out what is the purpose of life why are we here ask yourself the question is god real because once you ask yourself the question you're going to learn that there's only one answer that god is real and then i would say follow god's laws the most fundamental law that we were taught by jesus who was both man and god is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you if we lived our lives like that if we conducted our business like that if we conducted our government like that think about what a wonderful world this would be so that would be my fundamental piece of advice to people on how to deal with their lives incredible ma'am can you prove that you're you're not a member of antifa i am not a member of antivirus lynch sounds like a teenager i know your identity i know her identity if i want to investigate whether she's a member of antifa i can do that see if they both were anonymous i wouldn't know what to investigate to find out the truth wouldn't there be i don't think we're talking to anybody that's a member of that okay that's fair that's fair with you i know she's not okay i'm just practicing lynn if this whole uh podcast thing doesn't work out i want to get a job at cnn or washington post and i've got to learn to say the things you say a shocking headline you don't verify the sources and you just print that thing you just just print it we don't have time to be accurate hey thank you parker for being here and lynn we have another guest who has a question for you but before he asks you the question i want to bring up we're approaching uh essentially your one year anniversary lynn it was five days ago so one year ago in five days so five days and one year ago you were meeting with the president of the united states and you so i met with i met with him on march the 11th march the anniversary was fast okay yeah i met with him at his request i met with him in the oval office and it was march 11 the day that the worldwide pandemic was declared so i i had the uh let's just say i had to i'll call it like it is i had the misfortune of having to look across the room outside of the situation room where i was waiting to go see the president and i saw an old fountain i call him faustian frog voucher and i want to tell you god gave you instincts he gave you common sense boy i tell you i took one look at that guy and i didn't like what i saw my instinct said this is not a good person instincts turned out to be right hey just because fauci told us that we shouldn't shut down the borders and then we should shut down the borders and we shouldn't wear a mask then we should wear a mask and just because he is the one who used us dollars to fund the controversial wuhan lab where the covet 19 virus came from folks if you don't believe me type it into google right now type in type in fouchy funded controversial wuhan lab and you can find it right now on newsweek so just because lin just because he's the one who funded the actual laboratory where the kova 19 virus came from just because he flip-flops and just because uh he he without being elected has ruined the lives of so many um lin is there any other reasons why we shouldn't trust dr fauci i mean because you you picked up on it i mean you have a great sense of uh you know well let me let me try it back to where i started yeah what if fouchy was going around espousing fouchy's agenda under the condition of anonymity and everything fauci was saying person close to the investigation a close person close to the vaccination development a person close to the national world health organization what if we didn't know who he was you wouldn't know whether to believe what you were reading or not but the good news is we know about old fountain and we can investigate pouches and we can find out whether we want to believe old fouchy and you don't have to do a whole lot of investigation on the internet not in google don't do that do duck duck go you can go in and you can invest you have duck ducks in i'm sorry i can't i'm not that skilled in the names but you can go in and you can investigate find out his ties to bill gates find out his ties to the national world health organization or who find out that he said one thing on one day and another thing on another day find out whether he's really got any medical training and experience as a medical doctor i believe if anybody takes a 30 minute or less search about fauci in a legitimate search engine you wouldn't trust spouchy any further than he can throw a baseball and he can't throw one very far and he can't even throw it in the right direction you are correct your homework think think for yourself do your research find out who you really want to believe and trust and who you do not want to believe and trust i wouldn't trust fauci i wouldn't believe him he's inconsistent he's contradictory he's biased he's got financial agendas at work and he's calling the shots now under the so-called biden administration you've got to wake up america thought she's not your friend you know lynn i will point this out if if all the listeners will go to time to free america time to free america and you click on the truth about dr fauci you can see that he's the one who funded the controversial wuhan lab with millions of u.s dollars you can see uh dr david martin created this this document called the fouchy dossier which is incredible you can see his years of conflict of interest you can see where he has served on the bill and melinda gates foundation for years you can see that this guy is not on our team now lynn we have another great uh guest here for the town hall tonight this guy i can tell you he's definitely not a member of antifa he seems to be a great american uh sir what's your name and what question would you have for for lynnwood my name is ken juan fulso that's kind of hard keen one folsom kin one yes okay what question do you have for me hello hello hello gen one ken one getting one what the goat i got yes thank you lynn um i got one question who is running the country is it president trump is it president biden or is it the military boy abcd i guess we could say none of the above but i don't want to do that one i don't know okay i don't think that i think that's i think that's the issue that's burning in americans minds right now we're not sure now i can give you what i believe looking at the situation as i perceive it and learn it through trying to research i can look at the laws i can look at some of the executive orders that have been passed and i can give you what i would say is at least my own educated analysis i guess that's my opinion i do not believe that the biden quote unquote administration is real i think it's fake i believe that president trump did not walk away from his commitment to america freedom and patriotism and the people that supported him tens of millions maybe 89 focus on the people that share your values work with them and build relationships that'll build a strong bond fundamentally in our country that will it ultimately be a strong bond of the united states that's what we've got to go back and get i love that ma'am any follow-up question that you want to ask lynn again linda he's a crazy man he actually cites his sources he refuses to just spout generalities sources and you could never be a reporter for cnn you could never be on the washington post with that level of detail they don't want that stuff any question you have for lynnwood man i guess actually yes i love that idea of local i grew up um in a very small town in kentucky you know farmers we ate food from our own dirt which i think has been a big problem um recently we're eating too many things from too many other places and i agree um so but what i guess then my follow-up would be what should we do once we've established kind of that local and taking care of um what can we do perhaps i guess on a state level to truly affect with elections or that kind of stuff or to be more involved so that we actually know what's happening where it would be a first step exercise your right of free speech free speech now social media has kind of become a plague on our society a place where people profane they insult you they demean you they lie about you but you know actually social media could be a very positive beneficial tool for our society to use to communicate to people outside of our locality outside of our cities outside of our states outside of our country so i would say get on social media and stand up for yourself and express your free speech get let people know what you stand for do it in terms of when you see something wrong you got a politician or an official that's taking actions that clearly do not support the values of your community speak out inundate that person with emails even go out and exercise your right of peaceful assembly take to the streets in a peaceful way let people know that your voice is not going to be drowned out in america so if you get enough people vocal enough writing enough peacefully assembling enough you'll start changing this world i i lived at a time when i started practicing the law cnn didn't exist right i guess it was a gleam in ted turner's eye the internet didn't exist i guess as i jokingly say it was a glean in al gore's eyes he takes credit for it but he didn't invent it the world changed and i've seen over the course of my 68 years i've seen it change and change is a good thing if it's changed in the right direction true you got to have you got to be fundamentally centered you got to have fundamental principles you got to have common goals and so can we advance and and to do better in how we actually live with each other and communicate with each other sure so the technological advances don't have to be bad they can be an instrument for good but it's at the end of the day life is about a lot of things but in terms of the real world it's about communication yep how you communicate with your spouse your boyfriend girlfriend your children your neighbors your officials you got to communicate freedom of speech is the fundamental first amendment right if you lose your freedom of speech you're going to lose your freedom of assembly you're going to lose your freedom of religion you're going to ultimately lose your right to bear arms you're going to lose your due process rights you've got to exercise your right of free speech don't be intimidated don't let them suppress you if they sense you in one place find another binder so that would be my advice in terms of trying to tell you what to do outside of organization of things speak up let your voice be heard thank you so much true honor hey thank you i appreciate you being here now then we have two final guests here who are here today to attend the the in-person uh town hall meeting by hosted by general flynn here at the riverwalk my office is here and then on april 16th and 17th those of you who want to see a sydney powell general flynn linwood and a host of great speakers you guys can go to thrivetimeshow.com and click on the conferences button and lynn i've seen you i've watched you uh deliver some speeches do you i feel like you kind of feed off the energy of the audience there did you do you like speaking in large audiences i mean i feel like i get myself all fired up just watching you lin well i mean the answer is yes uh as a trial lawyer i love a captive audience i got to listen to it but but i do feed off of the people that i speak to yeah i like to communicate with them i like to have a conversation with them sometimes i'm hot blooded on things i really care about i'm okay with that i hope you all are too but but i believe that it's the fundamental of having a conversation sit down with i get in front of the judge he or she's done a black robe and they look important i try to have a conversation with him yep i get a jury i try to have a conversation with him with a witness i'll try to have a conversation sometimes on cross examination it's a little bit harder on the witness than they like but that's the way it goes they're insisting examination to elicit the truth but but i believe that in the people i i think donald trump uh i'm not i'll say i'm a little bit like donald trump i think trump feeds off of the people because he loves the people i love talking to your guests even though i don't know i like to talk to people so yes i love to speak i don't do a lot of it but when i do i relish the opportunity i'm looking forward to doing so in tulsa amen uh maybe maybe with time goes i'll speak to more people but i know this the reason i love to talk to people is because god created us to be with each other and have fellowship with each other to talk with each other to enjoy each other that's why he created us a major reason then we have a a young lady here to my right again i have no proof lynn i have no reason to believe that she is a member of antifa also no reason to believe she's not a member of antifa you see that lynn i can't it's you know even though we have irrefutable evidence that ballots have been shredded that is a is a conspiracy theory and that when you see the evidence of shredded ballots that's a conspiracy theory um and anybody who is not a part of antifa out anybody who's not outwardly sp speaking in favor of antifa is a crazy conservative conspiracy theorist so i guess our guest here might be a crazy conservative conspiracy theorist uh ma'am what what is your name and what question would you have for lynn wood hi my name is kristen schumann and my i have two questions the first question is what are your thoughts on term limits how can we get to a point where we could begin term limits so you got first you got to get honest officials in government and right now if you put that vote to the people up in washington d.c even in your state legislators they probably vote it down quickly because they're looking after themselves and not you so i think you've got to re-establish honesty and government with honest officials who are looking after your interests and not theirs and if you stop and think about it what i said earlier about citizen statesmen send people men and women send them to government to serve the people let them serve for a limited period of time and then return back to being part of the people who have to be governed by the rules they enact so i'm a proponent of term limitations in our legislators and our state officials uh i'm a little bit torn on the question of term limits on the presidency uh if i haven't studied that i know why they did it back with uh fdr and i can see where it may be that you just can't we don't want to have a king right we broke away from the king back when we had the first the revolutionary war i said first because i feel like we're in the middle of one now but we broke away from having this type of tyranny where one person could run us and tell us what to do for too long a period of time we've absolutely gotten back into that same mindset where the king george today is the people in the senate the people in the house and the people in our state governments the bureaucracy that is unknown and yet exist no matter who's the president the same bureaucratic people are there they're like miniature king george's you've got to seize back control of our government i think term limits helps us get that done lynn our guest has a follow-up question i believe for you this is coming from my son he wants to know what is your favorite client or who was your favorite client and what was the strangest case you've ever been a part of oh my favorite client uh i've had so many wonderful people that i've represented i hate to to single one out but i but i've done it repeatedly because it's simply it's the truth and i speak true my favorite client was richard jewell the man falsely accused of bombing centennial olympic park in 1996 at the olympic games of atlanta i love richard jewell he taught me a lot about life he changed my legal profession he changed me as a person he died way too young he was a victim of the deep state the fbi and he was a victim of the media and he was used he was a scapegoat they threw him out there so they could finish the games of atlanta and make all the money they wanted to make on it and the fbi wanted the world to know oh we we're the fbi we got our man our man that's richer jewel they wanted people to think the park was safe and so they scapegoated richard jewell and ruined his life without one shred pick my words carefully not one shred not one iota of evidence that that man did anything wrong wow they they told you they told you in the newspaper the atlanta general constitution he fits the fbi profile of the lone bomber they wanted you to think it was one person so they think that he was captured and you would be safe but we know that richard jewell was in the park at the precise time that the real bomber placed a 9-1-1 warning call saying there's a bomb in centennial olympic park you've got 30 minutes they knew where that call was placed from they knew the time it was placed they knew that richard jewell was in that park that night so even if you were to hypothetically say richard was somehow involved which he was not he could not have been a lone bomber the richard jewell story was the story of lies by the media and the fbi and i'm proud to say when somebody went back and wrote a book on in search of eric rudolph the man that was the bomber they had a chapter in that book and it was about richard jewell and one of the quotes in that book written by henry schuster who was part of the reason i sued cnn back in 96 he said that lynnwood was loathed by the fbi the fbi loathed know why they loathed me then and they loathed me now is because i went out every night and i told the truth about what they were doing to the sentencing man and they don't like the truth lynn richard stands out in my mind richard there's a lot of other people i'd love one day to tell you about some of the other great clients i've had both in the past and in recent times i've been blessed with some wonderful people but richard jewell stands out in my mind i still have not given up i hope that one day richard will receive posthumously the presidential medal of freedom because richard jewell stands for what america stands for hard-working man trying to follow the law in fact enforce the law to help other people and he was falsely accused and they destroyed his reputation i think he contributed to his early death at age 44 wow i never forget richard i never forget him lynn uh we have time for one more guest i believe and uh before we have our next guest on here i know a lot of our listeners want to support you because you are fighting to defend this republic uh you and sydney powell and general flynn you guys are really putting in the fight here um is there a website where people can go to support you sir or to learn more about the efforts that you are making right now to defend the republic well i want to put in my disclaimer i'm not antifa and i'm not a grifter i i'm

Trevino had backed away from the door and that the round ricocheted off the floor and struck him which is just 100% false and you can see it in the video as we continue you can you can see that when he fired at him he was right up against the door completely unnecessary Sheriff Chris NACO in a statement called Trevino a man with a violent history whose failure to comply dictated their actions Trevino has no violent crime convictions were these deputies aware that he had an informant I don't know how you wouldn't be aware of it he is absolutely having a schizophrenic break and the statements he's making a result Trevino's attorney said none of the officers have been disciplined for the incident there was a finding essentially that because there was no actual policy in place on

tell you all about the oyster wars a really fascinating chapter in maryland at chesapeake history that i bet you didn't know anything about so sit back hopefully throw back a few oysters and a cold beer and let me tell you a little story about the oyster wars so hang on one second and i'm gonna get my presentation up okay so a little background um this is all taking place immediately after the civil war but before the turn of the century so this is an incredible time of innovation and transformation in the chesapeake bay all because of technology um you know really around like the turn of the 18th to the 19th century there was a oystering in the chesapeake they'd been oystering for millennia but there was no way to preserve oysters or really get them anywhere um we didn't have any methods to preserve oysters besides pickling which i do not recommend although george washington really liked it so what happens is the new technology of canning is introduced to america from the french and then it goes to new york and it's brought to baltimore by new york uh oyster interests who are interested in accessing the very bountiful oysters of the chesapeake bay and this happens at the perfect time because lo and behold baltimore has also developed the new technology of railroads so add that with these incredibly sort of plentiful oyster stocks and this other technology that came from new england these big oyster dredge boats and you've got what creates what we call the oyster boob all right so let's talk about the oyster boom and how it created the oyster wars okay so in this image you can see you know these fleet of skip jacks and imagine the fleets of skipjacks and bug eyes um and other really large sailing bateau that are out harvesting oysters and bringing them into you know huge packing plants not just in baltimore but in solomon's in cambridge and st michaels in oxford um in cris field all over the chesapeake you know the the industry around the oyster uh industry is really booming and exploding and of course if you've been to the bmi then you've seen some of the exhibits there uh that talk about these sort of industrial packing facilities and how they hired immigrant workers or they hired recently emancipated african americans and you know this is you had towns like crispfield that was like literally built on oyster shells and so this there's so much money to make in this time period that you know as you can imagine there's just it's opportune for conflict you know there's just tons and tons of money if you can get out there if you can oyster then you can make a mitt and you could make a fortune now the state had attempted to regulate the oystering industry when in 1865 right after the civil war it you know set up a whole licensing system so you have all these you know people coming back from the civil war this is a way to have jobs but they wanted to set up some type of regulation and the idea was that they wanted to protect shallow waters for tongers and tongers are the people in the in the left-hand photo so they're going out in smaller boats they're harvesting you know 20 bushels of oysters a day it's a much smaller venture and largely this is something that's done by poorer people or by african americans so we're often prevented from getting loans to get bigger boats now on the right hand side we have an image of an oyster dredge being used on a skip jack or a bug eye a really large oyster fishing vessel and these uh bug eyes and skip jacks they had to use what was known as sort of county waters or estate waters state waters were specifically it's deeper water you know where you could go out and harvest more oysters but then counting waters were to be limited to only tongers with the idea that you know they would have shallow water oysters available to them within reach of their tongs the problem is is that a oysters were worth so much money and you could make you know so much money off of them and to get to the deeper water you had to get over the shallower water so there's going over those county waters if you were a dredger you might drop your dredge and then you might do it more regularly and then somebody else sees you doing and they start doing it and so what you have is basically and the initial conflict is not between regulators and and you know oyster minutes between oystermen versus oystermen what happens is these tonguers are like hey those are our oysters and they start you know getting rifles and shotguns and taking pot shots whenever they see these skipjacks especially skip that skipjack captains would go out at night these oystermen would go out at night to harvest under the cloak of darkness so that they could go out and harvest as many oysters as they wanted so you had these gun battles breaking out of all these like you know not just baltimore but all over the chester river and the chop tank river and the potomac and anywhere that you had these like big oyster populations you have immediate conflict and so this conflict is happening so much that it starts getting picked up in national headlines um and they're not you know if you think like okay okay oyster poachers you know that's that's not so great now if you're a newspaperman you're like i want to sell newspapers how do i do it these are oyster pirates and the conflict it's not just you know inter oystermen conflict it's the oyster wars and so this that starts getting picked up by national level newspapers across the united states what to do about it so in 1865 when they set up all these regulations the idea was they were all supposed to be enforced by one one body that's called the state fishery force which would become known as the oyster navy and on the right hand side this is hunter davidson he is the head of the maryland oyster navy the state fishery force and he has it as a wit's end it's gotten so bad with the conflicts between a lot of these you know individual oystermen and smaller vessels and larger vessels that the state fishery force has gotten involved and what happens then well then the oystermen retaliate against the state fishery force especially the captains of these larger vessels that were going out and harvesting illegally in the shallower waters they had also started to devise some of these new techniques where oystermen would work together in these large bands of pirates and they would sit at the mouths of waterways so that a couple could go out at a time and keep a lookout while the rest of them were further up the river and harvesting as many oysters as they wanted so if a state fishery for steamer happened to come up the river then they would alert all the other ones and then the ones that were keeping watch might you know start take opening fire at the state fishery force so that and they only really had a couple vessels to begin with so hunter davidson in 1877 goes in front of the state legislature to beg for more vessels to beg for more support more crew more people to be out there managing these lawless fisheries that were just you know you people were getting killed every day gun battles were breaking out all the time and it's you know there were casualties of these you know this bitter conflict so he ends up um in this time period actually lobbying for and getting um a bunch of new vessels including the mclean a vessel a steamer um that now is you know off the the water the water line there at the baltimore museum of industry so he's successful but one of his first conflicts is in 1877 on the chester river what happens is and this is such a great story so there's one guy gus rice who's the head of this band of oyster pirates and he's notorious he's a fighter he's a brawler and you know he's always looking for a loophole so he's there at the mouth of the chester river and he's waiting for the state fishery force and he sees a steamer coming up the river and so he and his band of pirates just opened fire on this thing it turns out it's just a passenger steamer full of women and children and they're screaming and crying and you know they're hitting the deck and uh he realizes he made his mistake but it was too late and the news gets back to hunter davidson who decides that he's going to send the mclean out to deal with this issue and so he sends them a clean out and as you can see in some of these images it's you know it's nighttime and they're headed up the chester river and they come into this band it's a rafted up uh entire sort of floating flotilla of of skipjacks and bug eyes and oyster boats and they've got metal plates on the the bow of their ships all connected with the idea that every you know all the crew could get hunker down behind these metal plates with their rifles and their shotguns and they start opening fire on the mclean the mclean of course is armed with a howitzer so and it's not afraid of some you know small wooden skipjacks so what they end up doing is they just open her up full steam ahead she just plows right into this you know this entire rafted up flotilla of vessels and almost immediately one of them the mahoney sinks and so the mahoney's sinking and all the crew on the mahoney are like jumping off and they're trying to get onto the steamer and the steamers not having it the mclean backs up and goes full steam ahead again and ramps into the flotilla a second time and again it's just all hell breaks loose and you know you have crews swimming away and it turns out that later on that there's a bunch of shanghai crew that had been you know found drunk in a bar and they stuffed them into the hold of one of these skipjacks to impress them as you know to work on board as oystermen for later and maybe not get paid and maybe drown um and what happens is they all drown in the hole that the ship that sunk and so that's just one example of the types of conflicts that happened over and over and over and you're you're looking at these these newspaper headlines from all around the country and you know people are opening up their newspapers in the morning um you know in new york and chicago and baltimore and washington reading all about these headlines and they're accompanied with images like this this could be of the mclean um and it's showing that nighttime gun battle that you'd see happening on the waterways of the chesapeake now why don't we hear about the oyster wars anymore well largely it's because at the turn of the 19th century the oyster population started to drop precipitously because of over harvesting and this is really a time period when there was so little regulation you could well besides the oyster you know the state fishery force you could harvest almost as much as you wanted um this also happened at a time period when the oyster population starts to drop but new technology like refrigeration makes it easier to catch crabs instead of only oysters or also fish instead of just oysters so this is a time period when oystermen become watermen and the fishery becomes more diversified and so there's less pressure to go out and shoot and kill to get as much access as always to oysters as you know as you want um now that you have the ability to go out and harvest something else to make money so just as a side note what ends up happening to the mclean's and the mclean goes on and is used in the oyster navy up until world war one when it's pressed into service as a coast guard vessel um during you know world war one for the us government after that the vessel ends up working out of the chesapeake again and spends her last days there docked at the bmi bulkhead and you can see what remains of her today the last remnant from the shadows of the oyster wars of the chesapeake so thank you so much for listening today i hope you learned a little bit if you want to read more stories you can always check out my book uh chesapeake oysters the beys foundation in future i really enjoyed telling you all about the wild and wooly adventures on the chester river where i live and thanks so much enjoy the rest of your bowl and oyster roast", "TAw1RuUHibc": "THEY ARE

that i've bought i've bought two aluminum ones identical specs both 14 gauge hard anodized aluminum this is american metal craft it was about 14 this one is a lloyds that my mom gave me for my birthday thanks mom this one uh when i was shopping for it was about 23 but i think my aunt found them a little cheaper than that and then this is the steel one from bobby owens at bay state restaurant products in brockton steel aluminum aluminum i have to retract the statement i had a theory that all pans needed to be seasoned and that they would work better this is the hardest one to get the pizzas out of and i seasoned it so i don't recommend doing that i think it would have worked just as well as this one which last night the pizzas came out of this one pretty easy i still had to go around the edge and cut the burnt edge away from the from the sides so that i get the pizza out of there but the lloyd's released pretty well uh this has become a nightmare and this one you can see the oil in them on this one it kind of sticks to the texture of the pan this one is beating up because the slick coating on this is amazing i was able to shake the pizza in the pan and it just it was just moving around in there like it didn't adhere to anything and it had actually shrunk back away from the edges a little bit while it was cooking which made it super easy to get out of there i already put one little scratch in it so i do not recommend using a steel spatula in it like i had to on the aluminums but this one this one was like 13 bucks which was about comparable to the american metal craft i definitely this this is hands down a much easier to pan to use and it's also the ones that the restaurants use and they're all using steel i worked at four restaurants they all use steel pans so that gets my recommendation cheapest one also the best one and yep it's the easiest one to use there you go american metal craft lloyd's and bay state restaurant products", "enrB32-PfYg":

story of race and resistance due out this coming may please join me in welcoming dr baite good evening everybody thank you so much maureen for that introduction and and thank you to the clay county historical society for inviting me i'm excited to talk to you about my new book i would like to share my screen with you because i have some good images so just give me one second to get my powerpoint up so let me start out with a story um when african-american minister joseph k bowler traveled the south south of the mason-dixon line during the first decades of the 20th century he always brought along what he called a jim crow traveling kit its contents illustrate some of the practical obstacles that face black travelers in the segregated cell the kit which bowler described to a reporter for the chicago defender in 1922 was designed to allow the minister who was a massachusetts resident to travel through the south in relative comfort it included a pair of soiled overalls purchased from an auto mechanic a supply of salmon and other canned goods a miniature gas stove and a small table top about the size of a scrub board balor would wear the overalls to avoid soiling his good clothes and the dirty chimp jim crow coaches where white conductors and news vendors often spat tobacco juice on the seat and white farmers transported their chickens and hogs but the key component of his kit addressed the distinctive geography a distinctive retail geography that african americans were forced to negotiate when traveling jim crow he carried food supplies along with his tabletop and stove to make sure he could make and eat his own meals the dining car is a closed corporation as far as our people are concerned he said white people below the mason-dixon line maintain that we are animals virtually camels and can go without food and water for several days now jim crow kits is elaborate as bowlers were likely rare but throughout the segregation era african americans rarely hit the road without well founded worries about where they would be able to buy food and other necessities moreover such worries were not limited to the south or alleviated by the advent of new forms of transportation such as long-distance buses personal cars and airplanes african americans initially hailed the development of all these new forms of transportation as offering an escape from jim crow but all would prove deeply disappointing both bus lines and airlines adopted forms of segregated seating and even traveling by car did not guarantee black travelers access to roadside accommodations of any kind a problem that was also faced by those who travel by plane and bus indeed rather than offering genuine alternatives to segregation these new forms of transportation complicated the jim crow map navigated by black travelers adding new way stations where african-american travelers could find themselves unable to purchase food drink or other necessities a distinctive feature of black life during the segregation era traveling jim crow shaped african-american perspectives on both mobility and consumption in ways that we have yet to fully recover and are in the danger of forgetting uh the experience of jim crow travelers dramatize the racial geographies in which both 20th century american social history and 20th century american consumer culture took shape and they show how such geographies persisted even as the changing technology of american travel made them increasingly difficult to maintain and all but impossible to navigate um i explore these geographies and black resistance to them in my new book which is coming out next month from harvard university press here's the cover um it's it looks at the rise and fall of racial segregation on america's roads buses railways airlines and other travel services and it fleshes out a history of segregated transportation that has often been dealt with primarily in works that talk about the legal evolution of the plessy versus ferguson decision about railroad cars or the story of the freedom rides of the 1960s and other protests that finally actually did desegregate buses and other common carriers these are subjects that my book takes up but what i'm really most interested in recovering um is the broad social history of segregated transportation how it developed how it was practiced day to day the everyday resistance it engendered and how it shaped black's struggles for civil rights it's an important it's important to that story bitterly resented by blacks travel was a flashpoint for racial conflict and violence as well as black resistance and civil rights litigation it mobilized blacks across class lines because it was at once an affront to black middle-class gender norms uh a leveling force that put all blacks in the jim crow car an inconvenience that made it hard for african americans to keep up with the demands of an increasingly mobile world and an unending offense to black consumers whose travel dollars were really never equal my book discusses and explores these all of these dimensions of this subject but today i really want to sketch out um the broad outlines of the traveling black story largely with reference to consumption a subject that offers a good illustration of the kind of detailed uh history of travel segregation that my book recovers this subject as others in the books underscores that segregation modern transportation and modern consumer culture all grew up together although there was various forms of travel segregation that existed during the antebellum era racial divisions on common carriers first become widespread during the golden age of american railroading which extends from approximately the 1880s to the 1920s and these are decades that are also the high point in the history of jim crow and in fact railroad cars are one of among the first places where southern state governments mandate by mandate segregation by race um and the system of segregated seating waiting rooms roadside services and um other forms of segregated accommodation that develop on the railroads do then provide the model for segregation that black americans will later experience traveling by bus aeroplane and automobile the jim crow car i mean there's there's a sort of complex history about the beginnings of segregation which i really won't go into but i will say that the jim crow  comes into its own at a time when southern whites are really bent on drawing a color line that will effectively eviscerate the civil rights that blacks gain during reconstruction and reassert white supremacy prior to the 1880s as i said there was some racial segregation on trains but it was uneven largely informal and usually consisted of conductors refusing to let black passengers ride in what was known as the ladies car which was sort of the earliest distinction in railroad cars ladies cars were special cars set aside for women and their families which had a variety of features that were designed to make rail travel more appealing to women most important they were the only place on the train where um the smoking of cigars and pipes and other forms of tobacco was not permitted this is an era in which smoking is all but ubiquitous among among men and women don't don't smoke that much um so that this is an appealing point for women then if and then if you look at the diagram at the bottom um the smoking car is kind of a smoking car in a couple of different ways because it rides directly behind the engine and if there's cold the sort of tender that supplies it so it often was a car where a lot of smoke from the actual train itself is ending up in the smoking car um which was also known as the the forward um so the ladies car spared female travelers for exposure to either kind of smoke they also offered amenities such as padded seats um ladies restrooms [Music] and sometimes you know a sort of changing room for children um and they they were they were a success among women um but as emancipation opened up the travel by rail to an ever-growing number of american women uh gender would prove to be an increasingly problematic sort of criterion for admission into this car middle class black women and sometimes couples sought admission to the act mission to the ladies current when they were refused they sued achieving enough success in the courts to inspire southern states to begin to pass a series of colored or separate car laws uh that would actually transform this system of gender segregation to a system of racial segregation the new laws were designed to give segregation a more secure legal fitting sitting footing excuse me and required virtually no change in the actual facilities offered by offered to black and white passengers instead um what had been the smoking car and sometimes the baggage car as you see in this in this diagram would become the colored car and this i should add would be typical of the kind of segregated facilities that african americans would end up with they would always be substandard this um compare comparison photo from 1937 um kind of shows the difference between a car for whites and a jim crow car on the same train and literally the jim crow cars were always older and had less comfortable facilities in this particular case this got this this car does not have air conditioning it um it doesn't have uh the big modern seats it lacks a lot of the amenities uh that the white car has um so this set up the separate but equal that was then uh vindicated in plessy um and this would remain the condition on american railroads um plessy as you all know was a kind of challenge to this which was then lost by black activists who hoped to um overturn the new separate car law in louisiana they failed and instead the court ruled that um accommodations could be separate but equal in a really sort of important decision that set the precedent for a wide variety of municipal and state segregation laws maintaining separate but equal schools toilets restaurants hospitals hotels theaters and cemeteries ironically given the case's origins the separate but equal legal doctrine and shrine and plessy had somewhat more limited application to travel segregation than it did to other forms of racial segregation its limits were largely honored in breach but it actually only applied to the enforced separation as applied to the internal commerce within a state because the supreme court has no authority over the regulation of interstate commerce which is in fact controlled by congress i mentioned this because this is one reason why travel would become a kind of central uh would be contested again and again in the courts by um by black activists because the the sort of grounding for interstate the segregation on interstate transportation was in fact something that could be assailed in a court of law um though it would take a long time for people to break break it down so with with the with the plussy versus ferguson decision in 1896 um the 20th century then opens with black travelers navigating a complex geography of formal and informal segregation that covers trains um and then it begins also to cover not only trains but you know where they ate where they can buy and all of this is very important especially in traveling segregation was required by state law not only on trains and other common carriers in the southern states but it was also required in things like dining when it came to dining segregation's legal complications were compounded by the fact that railroad services were sometimes covered by both restaurant and railroad laws which were not necessarily compatible or even complementary um restaurants could be and were often either for whites or for blacks whereas plessy versus ferguson specifically mandated that railroads and other common carriers had to provide both black and white carriers with black and white passengers with separate but equal um just what that would look like was something on the ground that was sometimes covered by laws some states required separate entrances as you see in this cafe in durham it wasn't specified with railroads but railroads really struggled to figure out how to maintain any kind of separate facility it was very difficult to supply dining facilities on the train let alone something like the complexities of this cafe with separate entrances um so what in effect happened is that none of the railroads would be willing to operate two dining cars and instead they adopted a wide variety of ways of dividing up black and white diners that ranged from excluding blacks from food services entirely um to creating segregated seating within dining departments to feeding african-american diners only after all other white passengers had finished eating on railroads as elsewhere separate was usually far from equal and the worst of these arrangements often prevailed as a result black travelers could never be entirely sure whether they would be able to purchase food when they traveled or under what circumstances when black uh journalist thomas fleming traveled cross-country by train as a teenager in 1919 for example he rode on a train where black passengers were not admitted in the dining car his aunt and uncle who put him on the train seemed to have known this would be the case they said sent him off with a huge wicker basket filled with food four days worth of sandwiches and during his journey he noticed that black passengers did have also have the option of ordering food from the dining car um but it had to be delivered to them they had to eat it where they were sitting and they were charged the same as white customers who got full table service and this was another complaint that was very common about segregated transportation black passengers frequently got less service for the same money they rode in they paid the same to ride in the jim crow car as whites did to ride in the more comfortable cars they paid the same to eat terrible food this is something that black educator william pickett also found out when he traveled from lynchburg to norfolk virginia in 1920. um he really couldn't get food or water there was a dining car on his train but it offered no service to black passengers whose only hope of food came when the train stopped in petersburg for 20 minutes um and they were offered some leftover food that could never be sold to white customers in an effort to get rid of it among the colored passengers the food they sent pickens noted bitterly only added indigestion to insult for 75 cents you could get a quarter of impenetrable dried hen fried the day before yesterday old bread and a slice of musty pie whereas white passengers could get hot drinks fried eggs for a few cents so that's an illustration of the sort of inequality that really galled people um and then when restaurant when dining cars began to open up to black passengers as a result of a series of legal challenges um they did so on distinctly unequal terms they had a variety of arrangements the last one of the last of which was this arrangement where black passengers could sit in the dining car but they had to sit behind a curtain and if you look at the back of that photo you see a curtain and a little compartment and that would be where black passengers would be directed other options included sort of different um different seating times um african-americans who experience these arrangements tended to find them truly humiliating um martin luther king would say in his autobiography the first time i was seated behind the curtain in the dining car i felt like a curtain had been dropped on myself hood it was kind of a revelation to him he realized that he would never adjust to segre separate raiding rooms separate eating places separate restrooms partially because separate was always an equal and partially because the very idea of separation did something to his dignity and self-respect um similarly humiliating was the sort of phase thing where blacks would eat later because um the announcement that negroes were now being seated in the dining car always came only after train officials had been seeding whites for several hours um not surprisingly a lot of african-american travelers brought their own food rather than even try to eat in railroad dining cars and also not surprisingly blacks were very eager to find alternatives to jim crow welcoming each new form of transportation that emerged over the first half of the 20th century as an opportunity to invade the indignities of the colored car so you see this with the advent of buses for example um which start out as sort of large cars and the teens um and these and they're initially on the municipal form of transportation that competes with the streetcars and in many cities especially in the south um blacks formed their own jim crow jitney services in which um in which they would um serve colored and usually white passengers as well they were sometimes excluded from they were they were actually routinely excluded from white jitney services um and and they would hope they hope to kind of create their own separate sort of transportation network but in this it this they just wouldn't have the kind of infrastructure or municipal funding to kind of do so so buses would increasingly become an arena in which blacks faced widespread discrimination um this becomes evident as early as the 1920s when there's an expose in the chicago defender that reveals that some bus lines refuse to carry african-american passengers while others carry only small numbers the story is broken by albert liberty a white journalist who researched it by posing as a white passenger who was reluctant to travel next to people of color and was told by one bus company official that we sit the n word in the back was told by another that we'd never ever under any circumstances sell tickets to negroes others told him that they sold only a very limited number of tickets to either blacks or mexicans um and told most people who wanted tickets that they were all sold out so there were all these different ways that bus companies discourage black passengers during the early years of bus company service so many that actually the naacp and other civil rights organizations had to challenge these practices and aside from racism itself bus companies were eager to discourage black customers because they often actually did not have roadside services that served black passengers at shoreline bus company which discouraged black passengers also didn't really have anywhere for that they didn't permit them to get off the bus um they had to kind of agree to stay on the bus for the entire trip and it's included on an 11-hour trip that had three or four scheduled stops in which white passengers could seek refreshment and comfort first oh as a result some black entertainers like ma rainey would end up getting their own buses duke ellington a lot of the other jazz greats ended up with their own buses and this is one of the ways that they would kind of avoid jim crow ma rainey is very early here we see a picture of her bus in 1927. um first available though not all that useful in the 1910s and 20s automobiles offered a far more attractive alternative to african-american customers who wanted to avoid travel and jim crow as early as 1924 atlanta's black newspaper the independent was encouraging readers to buy a car of your own and escape gym crowism from the streetcar service likewise arthur raper's study of um blacks in rural georgia found african americans using automobiles as a way of breaking away from the irritations of unequal transportation facilities a finding confirmed by later investigators who visited black communities across the south however cars were beyond the means of many black travelers and never even allowed well to do blacks to fully escape segregation for all that some claim that effective equality could be achieved at 25 miles an hour driving presented a variety of problems both old and new um in the jim crow south um jim crow etiquette could extend even to the rules of the road um according to historian gerard packard at many four-way intersections in the south in the early days of automobiles the right-of-way was determined not by who reached the intersection first but rather by the race of the drivers and when confronting a white driver who was female black male drivers sometimes faced a life or death decision passing white drivers was also problematic in mississippi local custom uh forbade black drivers from overtaking white drivers on unpaved roads unless they sort of kick up dirt in their face and this really surprised me um throughout the south parking was often subject to segregation and here's one picture of a direction to colored parking i've seen other pictures of parking lots outside workplaces and again it's sort of like the best parking is preserved for white so african americans negotiate this system in which um they're encountering these kind of the limitations in almost everything they do um their most ubiquitous challenges um in dr and traveling by car as by train really come to consumption traveling any distance by car for all that we think of it as something you do that gives you independence it requires stops for food gas and accommodation and it would take african-americans out of their own communities into terrain where they could never be quite certain what kind of retail discrimination was in force they were not always sure and this was another thing that surprised me they were not always sure they'd be allowed to buy gas at service stations in southern states um and some northern as well um and reported that some stations do not want us to buy gas or oil an example of retail racism such lights had an economic risk rationale black consumers were far from the first the primary target of the service station that industry that developed alongside the automotive industry instead um oil companies faced with the challenges of selling largely indistinguishable products such as motor oil and gasoline sought to create welcoming home-like environments um that would ensure consumer loyalty in an era when most car owners were white and many um many people in the automotive industry were eager to court female business um and you see that uh especially starting in the 20s all the big gas and oil companies start building these kind of english style cottage stations complete with chimneys gabled roofs shuttered windows and their trade magazines have articles that say things like dress your station up with flowers here is how to go about it um one of shell's advertising campaigns uh emphasized that its stations were home clean and that they had a white patrol of 48 inspectors traversing the country making sure the facilities were spotless unfortunately the kind of domestic ideals that the white patrol police were white blacks had little or no place in the sheltered home home-like environment that these early service stations thought to create accordingly even when they could buy gas black customers were often barred from using the lunch counters soda fountains and restaurants and service stations in the south these kind of prohibitions were imposed by law but such arrangements were not uncommon elsewhere um at the the restaurant at the stan at standard oils myers station near joliet illinois for example um greeted travelers with a large we do not cater to colored sign until 1948 when illinois state representative uh corneille davis finally persuaded them to have it removed so whereas white travelers during this time period off and return from long car trips talking about the pleasant incidents connected with their travels as one black raider wrote black travelers came home with memories of the jim crowism that they encountered on at rest stops and service stations like african-american travelers such as the minister just balor black drivers learn to assemble jim crow kits before driving any distance they loaded up their cars with food water maps um which they carried so they did not have to stop and ask for directions they also brought along amenities such as toilet paper and pecans on the assumption that they might not be able to use roadside restaurants some even filled their gas tanks before they left home and put additional gas in the back of their car so they wouldn't have to stop for gas and they tried to time their trips to make any kind of any stop for gas in major cities this all gave black travelers an unusual travel experience um which is most um comes across most clearly in a story that african-american historian john hope franklin told looking back on a trip that he made from charleston south carolina to rally north carolina on december 7 1941 the day of pearl harbor although the day that the japanese attacked pearl harbor the attack was broadcast shortly after 2 p.m but that day franklin and his wife aurelia knew nothing about it until they arrived in rally in the evening their car had no radio and like most black families motoring through the jim crow south they had packed a box lunch to avoid the humiliation of being turned away and were relieving themselves on roadside ditches because service station restaurants were closed to them so they drew drove in sort of a surreal bubble where they did not know what was going on the challenges faced by the franklins and other african-american drivers gave rise to a series of guidebooks if those of you have seen the movie the green book will know about the green book but one of the interesting things things to note is that the green book is neither the first or the last of these kind of guides there were a whole bunch of them hackly and harrison seen here is the first of them uh there were others included grayson's guide the go guide to pleasant map motoring and travel guide um and all of they differed in some ways but all of them kind of performed the same function of trying to guide black travelers to places where they could be welcome hackly and harrison's um was the brainchild of edward edwin hackley a lawyer and journalist and sarah harrison who was the secretary of the of connecticut new london's uh negro welfare council um and it opens with a illustration of the services provides that makes reference to wb dubois who had actually written harrison uh looking for a place to stay when he was traveling through new england um he uh he had gotten her name from a friend uh who lived in new haven and what we see in the whole anecdote is that even someone like du bois who's very at that point in his life you know well known highly regarded he cannot get in a car and drive somewhere and simply assume that he'll be able to find a place to stay instead by the time he writes harrison he's already been circulating inquiries about colored boarding houses in new london to someone else and he's just sort of having to write several letters to go anywhere and when you look at what the entries are and things like hackly and harrison's you see how difficult it was how to find some of these places um it did list hotels but a lot of the list its listings were for rooms just sort of um individual individuals who had extra room that they could stay with so this guide tried to help help people locate such rooms it was short-lived it came out just as the just just on the cusp of the great depression and um harrison died shortly after it was published so uh after 1930 it did cease publication but subsequent guides would prove more endearing we have of course the green book which was published regularly for almost 30 years it started in the 1930s and it was established by victor greene a new jersey mailman who ran it with his wife and brother he modeled it on a couple of different publications one was the automobile green book which was a road guide to the east coast and the other was new york city's organized cash ruth laboratories kosher food guide uh which was designed to serve the observant jewish community who wanted to uphold dietary laws but in addition to listing packaged goods it also enumerated hotels summer resorts and camps that cater to jewish travelers the green book combined features of both of these publications it listed not only hotels but also places like night clubs barber shops drug stores anywhere where victor greene or other company members had found that people were welcoming to blacks so and then other subsequent ones include grayson's guide which was directed at business travelers and travel guide which started in 1947 and ran for about a year its motto was vacation and recreation without humiliation all of these sought to help people in various ways um travel guide also included information on the civil rights laws of each state trying to get give people a sense of what they could and could not do um however even when they employ these kinds of guides african-americans still found road trips difficult um and potentially dangerous uh john williams the the writer used travel guide to draw to drive cross country in the mid 60s and found some of the accommodations he was directed to unhabitable after arriving in yet another dilapidated hotel in jackson mississippi he had coffee in what he called its dingy little dining room and rushed out overwhelmed by the place segregation he wrote has made many of us lazy but it's also made many of us rich without trying no competition therefore take it or leave it and you have to take the slovenly restaurant keeper the uncaring hotel man the parasites of segregation only provide superficial utensils for her their dismiss um more problematic was also that often the information in these guides was not necessarily up to date or accurate um in the same way that we often find information we find on the internet not entirely accurate it was actually worse obviously in these print publications so with these driving difficulties it's not surprising that flying which became an increasingly common form of civilian travel after world war ii was initially welcomed and hailed as a decisive escape from jim crow air travel will squeeze jim crow out of transportation out of the transportation system in this country predicted african-american air force pilot william ellis in 1945 there's there's not enough room in the air for back seats people will simply have to travel closer together um but ellis who also anticipated that he and other african-american airmen would be hired to fly planes proved overly optimistic the first african-american pilot was not hired until 1963 and only after african-american pilot and air force veteran marlon greenwin won a landmark supreme court case against discrimination in the airline industry and discrimination also applied to passengers on planes most of airplanes early routes were interstate so segregation on board airplanes was really never legal but various forms of jim crow nonetheless occurred scattered evidence suggests that in the early days of flying some airlines simply refused to carry black passengers at all so for instance when african american clarinet player william wilton crawley was told by the united artist com theater to fly to el paso fly from texas to los angeles to play in one of its productions crawley was initially unable to buy a ticket he was informed that the company drew color line and it was a challenge that he was ultimately able to overcome by putting on a turban and traveling as a hindu gentleman carrying a clarinet case and this is something that black sometimes did to escape travel segregation if you could persuade people that you were part of some other group of color like um south asians or sometimes uh latin americans you would be exempt from some jim crow regulations this kind of outright exclusion gave way by the 1940s but it was replaced by various systems of segregated seating for instance the chicago and southern airline admitted in 1945 that it practiced jim crow seating on its dixie bound flights it is true that negro passengers are requested to sit on the forward seats of the airplane an official for the airline wrote to theodore allen a black federal official and government employee who had protested after he had been moved to the front of the plane and separated from the white man he was traveling with um the airline's representative was unapologetic about the practice and instead maintained that from the point of view of personal comfort these forward seats are the most desirable seats on the aircraft um and that negroes were being offered accommodations in facilities that were equal or superior to those offered by other passengers black travelers often chose to disagree especially when they were forced to move and it's forced to not travel with a white travel companion if they were traveling with someone else um by the 1950s however this practice seemed to have given way to less obvious forms of segregation um prior to 1951 when a former employee successfully challenged the practice in new york courts american airlines would use a secret code to ensure that that its small number black passengers were seated in the same row of a plane and likewise several airlines trained their phone operators to identify negro voices as they said in order to assign them specific seats on specific flights blacks who braved the largely white world of flying um encountered other indignities as well they tended to be first in line for any kind of travel disruption they were sometimes bumped to make room for white passengers this actually happened to ella fitz ella fitzgerald when she was traveling from san francisco to sydney australia for concert she was traveling with her accompanist and secretary seen here in this photograph and when they got when they they got off the plane in honolulu when it stopped to refuel and they were just simply not allowed to reboard not even to retrieve their clothes and other personal items that they had left behind in their seats instead they were stranded in honolulu for three days they had been bumped to make room for white passengers um and she missed her concert and ultimately sued pan-american airlines tried to complain tried to claim that they had been bumped through inadvertence but fitzgerald won she received 7 500 in damages other slights experienced by black passengers included segregation on the ground um congressman charles diggs michigan congressman charles c diggs who was an early flyer was one of the many african-american travelers who was sort of disappoint initially excited about and then disappointed by flying he initially thought that he was going to escape old patterns of segregation and discrimination established on railroad and bus lines but he was soon disappointed to find undemocratic practices common in air airports as he reported in a 1955 letter to the president of continental airlines specifically what he finds is that there are colored waiting rooms the arrow in this photograph is pointing to a colored waiting room there's color um separate restrooms and water fountains there's also and this is particularly difficult for air travel there's segregated cabs so blacks who had decided to fly so they could move very quickly from one place to another would then sometimes be unable to get a cab at the airport because cabs in the south were typically um served whites or blacks and um in many cases there were very few cabs serving blacks coming to the airport diggs succeeded in pressuring harry truman to desegregate the federally owned washington national airport as early as 1948 but other facilities were slow to follow suit the complete segregation of american airports would not be accomplished until 1963 after a long series of public protests as well as department of justice lawsuits likewise many months of freedom rides federal pressure and a supreme court order would be required to bring about the 1961 desegregation of interstate buses and bus stations in the south while segregation remained in effect in many roadside restaurants and hotels until well after the passage of the civil rights act in 1964. as all these examples show travel segregation would prove difficult to overturn um despite the sustained opposition it generated among blacks and the shaky legal ground upon which it stood as well as the complications that it imposed on travel on transportation related businesses that had to come up with these kind of double facilities um invented on the ground as well as in the courts travel segregation had deep roots in regional customs and also in the travel industries in which it was practiced whose proprietors often saw it as a commercial necessity indeed in the book sharing the prize on the economics of the civil rights movement gavin wright whose economic historian gavin wright suggests that the segregation of public accommodations was fundamentally a business policy by profit-seeking firms after all it was practiced um not only by southern businesses but also by national hospitality chains and commercial carriers that observe segregation on their southern roots as well as by northern businesses that did not welcome black customers the owners of all such businesses right suggests um segregated their services at least in part because they fear that serving blacks particularly in socially sensitive activities such as sleeping and eating would result in the loss of white customers in other words travel if traveling black was a deeply demeaning inconvenience for blacks traveling white was an amenity that business owners believed was highly valued by white customers offering better service to african-american customers might have held potential profits but such customers were rarely seen as valuable enough to offset the white business that they might discourage and the second class services offered to black customers could be very profitable african-american customers provided a lucrative market for the common carriers worst seeds leftover food and other substandard travel goods and services so in the end it would take not just the interest not just interstate commerce commission rulings and changes to federal and local laws to desegregate roadside race and retail but also sit-ins freedom rides boycotts and other forms of protests that threaten the economic well-being of segregated establishments the colored car over time was an artifact not only of southern segregation laws but also of a national travel industry that encouraged whites to whites to see train compartments seats on common carriers and even filling stations as safe home-like spaces where blacks and other people of color were either not committed or relegated to separate and inferior accommodations not just required by law in many southern states travel segregation was promoted by many businesses in these in in this region they marketed their whites only facilities as clean safe and superior to less exclusive accommodations as can be most graphically seen in this sign from lexington county uh south carolina which is advertising for um gulf a golf station um in terms that really promote segregation as one of its assets um and suggests that racial exclusivity uh stands in for the concrete provision of superior services so little wonder then that civil rights activists such as ella baker would insist that retail racism was about something bigger than a hamburger for blacks during the segregation era such racism was an inescapable mark of second-class citizenship never limited to the south retail racism could be found on common carriers and public accommodations across the country and it affected black congressmen celebrity and ordinary folk alike moreover if jim crow travel practices made white travelers feel much more at home in the world they had the opposite effect on african americans black travelers often confronted unanticipated difficulties and painful embarrassments that underscored their limited rights as consumers and as citizens for them travel was never associated with the freedom celebrated by white bards of america's open road from walt whitman to jack kerouac african-american travelers instead confronted an uncertain road never quite sure of what kind of welcome to expect they were not always able to purchase the most essential goods and services needed by anyone far from home such as food drink and accommodations thank you very much i'm happy to take questions and i will stop my share we have many many questions i have to tell you um we haven't been quite we have inquiring minds that's great um are you familiar with uh candicey taylor and gretchen thoren's books does your work differ um i focus on a sort of longer stretch of time and more um vehicles um both candidacy taylor's book and gretchen soren's book focus above all on automobiles soren's book is called driving while black um and uh hennessey taylor is really it's focused also on driving i was really interested in in sort of i actually start to some degree with stage coaches and steam ships i was interested in exploring the ways in which segregation and transportation kind of start to gather and the ways in which segregation moves from one form of transportation to another which was very much in part of how african americans were experiencing it um african americans were always making sort of choices am i going to drive am i going to fly which is going to work better for me so i wanted to sort of capture the entire world in which blacks were traveling and i also thought it was important to really emphasize things like trains and buses because um african-american levels of car ownership are historically lower than white at levels of car ownership so for much of the segregation era most black travelers would not actually be traveling by car they would be traveling by train or bus and that kind of leads into the next question were some railroads railroad companies more notorious than others did uh did folks avoid certain routes um were there some that were more usable from to some degree um they were notorious for interesting things like um the pennsylvania railroad was notorious for segregating putting blacks in the colored car as far north as new york city um so and and there was also a chicago railroad that would sometimes do that as well as a california railroad that would that would do it um um [Music] and in the deep south segregation was pretty much uniform across the railroads but perhaps worse in some states and others blacks particularly hated traveling in texas i don't think it mattered what railroad it was simply that texas was so big that you could you know you would you could travel in a jim crow car and have to sit upright in a wooden seat for 30 hours at a time and also in a car without air conditioning because these two things were likely to happen in a jim crow car and so that's uh sort of the interesting one one question was on the geographical air area um are we talking the eastern keyboard to texas um or the gulf to the mason-dixon line what was the territory involved the mason-dixon line was was the cutoff point for the most part um buses often would segregate beyond those spaces um but they would also sometimes i mean there would be court cases in which black travels would sometimes win but the mason-dixon line was the point at which um black travelers would have to move to the colored car washington was what was known as a big change station so was cincinnati um uh i can't remember what the texas station was so it was sort of the boundaries of the south but it was also you know also that wasn't always true there were companies that would sort of for convenience decide that blacks had to ride in the colored car well before they actually reached this boundary um langston hughes uh in one store in one of his articles talks about being put in the colored car in los angeles when he's going to louisiana so these kind of things did happen um did colored only mean that whites did not have the right to dine there they would actually face consequences for for dining or or shopping in uh colored only establishments um that could vary one thing it didn't i mean especially like in jim crow cars colored cars on the railroad whites routinely sat in them and would never face any kind of consequences i know that in one of the pictures i showed you there was a um what looked like um either a store or a bar that sort of said colored only by police or order i i think in some restaurants or and especially things like dive bars there was a real attempt to keep whites out of perhaps some colored spaces but in general it was a kind of two-way it was in general it was not an egalitarian relationship whites routinely went into the colored car whites went into black restaurants it was blacks who were not allowed to use white facilities much more often than the other way around okay um we've seen in movies and books specifically musicians and baseball players segregated were there any other occupations that were particularly targeted um any kind of thing where you're traveling so um i mean it's not so much they're targeted but they are they're moving around in this segregated world so they're encountering segregated transportation um so this this occurs for um a lot of black leaders who sort of address national audiences they travel across the country they encounter a lot of segregation black federal officials found it particularly difficult because washington was often segregated or if they if they went south of washington they would be segregated um so any kind of profession in which blacks experience mobility they would they would encounter all these kind of things and musicians in particular because they traveled a lot and counted a lot some of the travel guides were actually established by musicians uh for instance the magazine travel guide which i showed you was established by billy butler a musician victor greene one of his brother-in-law was a magician some of these guys had their roots in kind of informal lists kept by musicians um is it possible to pre-order your books online absolutely you can you can pre-order it on amazon i think also the press is taking orders so yes please please pre-order it great um what a couple of people ask this what comparable treatment did other non-white people races receive asian americans native americans latinx you you kind of alluded to that that sometimes people would would um dress differently or or try to be appear to be in a different racial category um how have they treated them um that's another really great question and the answer is really complicated one could actually write a probably an entirely different book about it because it really varied um by region like in texas for instance mexicans usually had to ride in the colored car that had to do a lot with the texas economy and the way in which texas had a lot of mexican sharecroppers who tended to be treated more or less like texas black population um but in florida for example hispanics were which was which was sort of marketed itself as the gateway to latin america and had a hispanic population that included people of influence as well as commercial ties with latin america hispanics weren't subject uh to discrimination so blacks in florida such as uh james weldon johnson who would eventually had the was it james weldon johnson i think it was james wedland johnson the writer um would um would in in encountering segregation in florida start speaking spanish and avoid getting um thrown into the colored car um other people who kind of encountered this level of ambiguity were definitely south asians there were occasional diplomatic incidents in which traveling um dignitaries or leaders from india and other places would be segregated um according to most southern state laws it really was african-americans who were supposed to be the subject of segregation so um this is why you would have people doing things like donning a turban and if they could convince people that they were not african-american this this ruse would work opposition to social equality was a big part of the justification for segregation could you comment on that in relation to gender and the treatment of black women in particular yeah no that's another really good question the opposition to social inequality and the way that this sort of it all kind of mobilizes around these black women in the ladies car is really interesting and it it shows i think a kind of fear of social equality um because part of what happens with the advent of travel segregation is you have respectable black men and women going into spaces that are sort of regarded as um you know spaces for middle and upper class whites when trying when train travel first starts you sort of bite you know if you're not actually walking you're probably a person of means um so that early black travelers are kind of who are not actually there as serpents for their um you know for whoever they're traveling with are regarded as a sort of um stark symbol of the ways in which blacks are somehow achieving some kind of social equality that whites find threatening and um this is one element of a lot of the early travel segregation it is it is really about um um re-establishing the kind of social hierarchy that had traditionally existed between blacks and whites that went back to time you know that sort of came out of a society in which black most blacks were servants or slaves um and as you move toward move towards emancipation first in the north and then in the south you begin to get these middle class black travelers who are these sort of two whites these sort of scary symbols of the ways in which um blacks could be sort of overtaking whites or or pulling even with them and um they're just kind of a specter of social equality that have to be discouraged so how is the transportation treatment of blacks different in northern states like minnesota and the dakotas compared to the south um minnesota had no kind of you know no kind of jim crow laws of any kind um there's a there's a there's a relatively smallish history to my knowledge i was kind of looking around to see if there was any incidents i could talk about in minnesota and i couldn't find anything there's you know there's not a large black population um it it you know what i did find and what was what um blacks during the segregation era did find is that um segregation or this or the ways in which blacks were unwelcome at things like hotels and restaurants occurred basically everywhere and i would assume that minnesota's in that category but actually as a state it did not generate a lot of complaints okay um during this research what was your most surprising discovery oh gosh um i felt like each chapter i learned something that really surprised me i was surprised by the segregated parking i was like really yeah really you need to segregate parking um i was also surprised by something i didn't talk about in this talk but i do talk about in the book um i came across a lot of stuff about um blacks dying in car wrecks and it took me quite a while to realize that what was happening was not just ordinary train wreck facilities but what happened is that over the course of the segregation era as they updated all the trains and began to use all metal passenger cars for all the good you know all the all the first class cars and the whites only cars they continued to use wooden cars for the jim crow cars so what would happen around the turn of the century is when there were train crashes which actually happens a lot around the turn of the century you would have these train crashes where most of the people who died were black um you know because what happened was that when the train crashed um the the colored car would be sandwiched between the engine which was made out of metal and the all-metal white passenger car behind it and it would just collapse like an accordion so that was something and that was something that um black travelers and black journalists were very aware of talked about um sent complaints about but never got taken up by the government or ever officially acknowledged in any way and it actually took me a while to even reference it it was sort of so inside knowledge that it took me a while to even figure out what people were talking about this may be beyond the purview of your work but um was this kind of racism practiced in any other countries than the us and and south africa um never to the same extent um and um that was that was one you know at at various points i thought of doing a more international history but one of the reasons i didn't was that um europe was often presented by african americans who wrote about it as sort of the the alternative where black travelers never encountered any segregation that was not true um that and that was i think you know that was sometimes made to make a political point but the fact was that segregation wasn't systematic in europe it wasn't required by law people had very different experiences the same was also true of canada people traveling cross country would sometimes travel north of the border to escape segregation the niagara movement and early civil rights organizations met in niagara falls because they couldn't get a hotel on this on the niagara falls ontario because they couldn't get a hotel on the american side of the border so yes it did exist at you know outside the us and south africa but it was i don't think as ubiquitous anywhere else um were all the places that were welcoming uh to black travelers owned by black people or or would some whites also be allowed to to serve african americans yeah whites could serve african americans that they chose to and um in fact um you know where serving african americans was profitable when for instance blacks um established profitable travel travel resorts or beach areas you would often have white businessmen trying to sort of get in on it so there was no there was no kind of limitation on who could serve who it just how you just had to like follow um segregation rules and how you did it okay um blacks have the the uh halfway and harrison and the green guide and uh you mentioned um a book for jews gays and lesbians had the damron's guide where there similar guides for other people of color other groups that were facing discrimination asian people for example um who wanted to find where they might find supportive people um i have never seen anything for asians who were who were subject to similar discrimination certainly in some areas um but i think asians were less i mean the asian there were less asians and i i as far as i know and i've never seen or read about any guides for asians uh the photo of the dining car showed uh an african-american waiter did or could they help african-american passengers um agitate against jim crow well that was you know that was challenging because what um african-americans worked on the railroads in various capacities they were waiters a lot of them were pullman porters um sometimes they could help african-americans who were traveling waiters and other train workers would do things like you know serve food to people sneak food to people sometimes provide them places to sleep but they were also sometimes charged with enforcing segregation being the one to tell you know to tell black passengers they couldn't go here or there being the ones to kick people off the trains um so they were in a in a difficult spot and there's no sort of one one way that they did though i did see a lot of reports about people who were like snuck into a sleeping car by the pullman porter and allowed to kind of you know spend the night there you know um you know off the books so um it was it was a complicated relationship okay and uh the last question that we have in our box anyway is are there any examples you know of of companies or businesses that tried to integrate either due to their beliefs or to try to earn more money from black travelers what was the result were there businesses that tried to use the lack of availability of facilities for black travelers as a way to earn more money um well in in the early days of segregation both the streetcar companies and the railroad companies actually did try to resist it because they were terribly afraid that they would have to run entirely separate vehicles for blacks like um what railroad companies were concerned about in the early days of segregation is that they would have to have first clark class cars for blacks first class cars for whites first you know second-class cars for blacks second-class cars for whites and likewise uh streetcar companies thought they would have to run two sets of streetcars and they were they thought this would be prohibitive in the end they didn't have to do any of these things and they found that they could you know just sort of skimp on whatever they offered african-americans and they settled into that quite comfortably um i'm having trouble thinking of transportation companies that really did try to take advantage of the black market and it's i mean greyhound would begin to market itself to black consumers after desegregation and also as it be as as it lost a lot of its um white consumers to car ownership it would finally turn to a black market but one of the striking things to me in researching this book is the extent to which a lot of businesses um underestimated this sort of size of the black market or really thought that black people didn't have money and often actually sort of acted not necessarily in their own self-interest in terms of um exploiting this market um blacks tended to be somewhat underserved and um i think part of it had to do with almost like a sort of knowledge feedback a lot of a lot of the decisions made by made about who to go after in markets was really made by people who were kind of thinking with their ideas about black people and i think you still see this today there's um there's a lot of evidence about how you know things like high-end supermarkets and stuff won't set up in black neighborhoods even in black neighborhoods where um you know where you have affluent consumers because there's a

handout and take it back to your office there are a couple of things though I want you to know if you do want to tame the nine miles that Houston there's a free CL lead it's going to be on March the 12th so there's a doctor in Houston about an Inca lucky chocolate like he's a really good guy has a really incredible medical practice and besides being a good doctor is also good business and he has like 30 restaurants of useless and one of them is the place called mr. Peebles people to eat the l.e.s with the peoples and at that restaurant he liked to have especially people that do p i-- because he then tries to get those attorneys obviously to send appliances diagnostic clinics and so each year now he's put on a what's called the advanced healthcare seminar PID file attorneys there's about six hours of credit CLE one hour of ethics and a good thing about that is it's free and so you want to drive to houston on I think it's Thursday marks the 12 there will be this CLE program put on we've had some really fine speakers come and speak for that I've good line up on that thirsty too so do any PII or you know somebody does just trying to keep that in and by I want to plug that for you okay so what we're going to talk about today is the material in your hand out and talk about three different cases and really talk about what happens if there is a fee dispute with client the first case we'll be talking about is one involving Patrick Smitherman and his case involved rule one point one for safeguarding property of what to do if you get a cell to check in and there's an issue of whether you think the fee is disputed or not and what's your obligations with that we're going much more detail about this but basically what happened mr. smitherman is that he got a large settlement about half a million dollars he had a contract with his client that contract is one of the items there your material so you can see the contract he put together compared your contract and see whether you want to change things in our but in settling the case he knew from the beginning with this particular client that there was going to be a dispute there's gonna be problems that they longtime friends and longtime enemies and long time somewhere in between so when the soda check yet pack we wrote a check to his father who's one of the clients would check to himself as an attorney and then a notified mr. Perry immediately that the money had been was the name of the county and said you know as well as I do that we agreed that there would be a bonus and that's an important point because there's never been a dispute that there was a bonus to be paid exactly how much that bonus would be was an issue then what happened and all this is all pretty well factually driven there mr. that the client whanau got another attorney wrote a letter desmet have been saying you need to pay me and if you don't pay me immediately I'm going to sue you and your firm I'm sorry I'm going to sue you personally what he's saying is affirmed the contractors of the ground I'm a city person mr. Smitherman took that to me that all the settlement the two hundred thousand or so that was to be paid to the client was in dispute and since it was in dispute under one point 14 he kept it into a trust account until about a year later there was a arbitration resolution selling during this negotiations the client contacted this attorney as I said and the attorney got him to file a grievance against mr. smitherman and it was the bars position that because there were some emails talking about what was disputed and what wasn't disputed that the money that was not disputed should have been paid immediately to the client and then you could tell the rest of it out so that's kind of the factual context of this case what's also sort of interesting about this case is procedurally both the office of chief district council and the judge appointed to the case for whatever reason drag this takes up about three years and when it finally went to trial smitherman himself as pro se attorney tried the case to a jury and the two jury issues that were presented there were both ruled the decision was in favor of mr. Smith ago so you think that well the facts were the air jury was right we want well lo and behold the Disciplinary Council by the name of Timbers clouded judgement it will be the court granted it mr. Smith iment then having been found guilty of official misconduct by the judge and to go next to sanctions hearing the judge para didn't like mr. smitherman and gave him two years suspended of three-year sentence luckily that case could be appealed and so he stayed that sense in that case is now on a hill we'll talk about maybe what could have been done differently in that particular case but that is an interesting situation where there is a dispute over amount and what does what does that mean there is a dispute and if the client says if you don't pay me immediately I'm going to sue you for all the amount i don't care if you have any attorneys fees does that then kick it into the arena of a total dispute and so you don't have to pay anything until some resolution the other interesting part about this is that there is actually a guideline to handling trust accounts so the State Bar client trust fund brochure and in back row sure it says that if the attorney pays the amount when it's not clear as to do that the owner it is you do so at your own risk that's great i want to say first if anybody has a question even the smallest of the group and give here you have a question of any point please actually nothing then whether you go to the State Bar site and it's right there and the name of that is think bar of texas trust account information yeah it's okay here so you'll write this down I don't know what I put it the material I don't think idea it's called a lawyer's guide to client trust account a lawyer's guide to trust accounts if it says specifically if it is unclear to whom the phone's belong or a dispute among claimants exists than a lawyer pays this is the language out of this state are document a lawyer pays that is own peril a lawyer should not assume the role of deciding fun ownership in the case of dispute whether whether the dispute exists between the client and a third party or between the client and the lawyer okay so according to this brochure if there is uncertainty as how much is owed whether it's in dispute or not whether it's real clear as to the amount or not whether it's the third party involved you have the responsibility to hold on to those funds until it's resolved now in the case of Middle Smitherman what's interesting is that there was an arbitration agreement and that paragraph is it material you have a descendant contract so smitherman was saying well you're trying to sue me for the map we have disputed here we have facial treatment I'm going to wait until it do with the arbitration agreement well that wasn't the position of the office and cheap discount it's also interesting about this is that give all this hullabaloo that was going on neither the office of chief district councillor Smitherman case nor mr. Smitherman using expert witness okay so the jury did not have the guy of someone who can say well this is the way that rule is interpreted or talk about what an attorney's responsibilities work I think that is mistake to let me back up to two things that you can do in a situation before the grievance gets filed hopefully given again there haven't you sometimes this problem is never having any attorney in this room you have a dispute little client over something maybe that's only happens it and using art in that but if that happens there a couple things prophylactically include with the one you can call the ethics hotline save our texts well I follow the State Bar ethics hotline 800 number and they will not give you a written opinion so what I do that back to document well there two things number one regardless of the night giving you written opinion evolves into a memo to the file on februari the fourth by talk to the same our ethics opinion was told this or another way to do it is to simply send an email to the straight bar I talked to the ethics opinion for some reason last person I talked about there was remember a name which he said to me for eight hours a day and she advised me this way about what was going on so that's again something that you can do to protect yourself that I tried to find out a calm state bar I got this opinion I made a memo of it there is also what's called the save our tific State Bar of Texas ethics committee and you see those opinions come out to a bar journal you want to help us get there and if you have maybe two or three years to wait for an opinion you get opinion layer and of course the final resolution is to call someone like Bob sure village hardware actually broke text books about this and you can even call I'll bet whatever that's worth so those are some ways eating with a fee dispute as you can know how to protect yourself and make sure that this doesn't get to the level if the bar sends you the ominous letter that a complaint has been filed against you want you to respond in that response you can say one I try to explain this to my client to call the ethnic hotline three this is the memo that I wrote information about what i should do these fun so all that is something that if you have an issue or you see you mean I've had clients and say well why should you get any of this p I settlement because all the money was mine and you didn't have to go to try well I know I signed a contract with you but etc I want all the money so you know situation like that or occupations like they ever situation where you're negotiating try to get the feed wait why all those are ways to approach that so a letter about snippet cases of glutamate material and hopefully you'll find that helpful the document again the State Bar of Texas lawyers guide client trusts the camp sits on the website just go there and look it up if you have a question okay so that's a little capsule of the smitherman case the next case is the case involving Clarissa grow hard oh and Clarissa Ricardo was an attorney that does mainly an immigration practice and in that practice she had a client who came across the border to marry American citizen they stopped at the border she had a lot of money with her there was a question about what her true intent was was she trying to come in on a visa at finding shoes on your very good steak she made a lot of statements which you stop by the Customs and Border Patrol and she was sent back to Mexico her fiance then when I hired mrs. Ricardo to represent him and her and try to get her status change okay so that's the start of the Clarissa gora hard okay there was a five-thousand-dollar retainer paid for instance started working on the case unfortunately there is no contract signed giving the scope of the representation that might be the first concern that there was no contract as to what services were to be rendered as they proceeded with the case larissa lose an experienced immigration attorney decided that what was necessary was the file a habeas corpus action again I don't believe a bration but if it's my understanding that has to be filed in Washington DC she took some of the funds filed in him see try to find local council tried to get something done that proved to be fruitful it did work out even though the purpose of that was trying to suppress the statements of her clients mate when she was arrested coming to the United States there are some funds left over that she then took these funds and applied them to other activities with the case so there there's money that I was in the trust camp after the money was used she then build some more funds to the client supply paid those but a year in hampered by no action was taken and the client finally terminated her and said you don't give me all my money back I'm gonna file a grievance against you Melissa said I did everything I was supposed to I try to get you a status it didn't work out I'm still working on it but I'm not going to give me any money back grievance was filed and then the position of the bar was that you didn't have permission of the client to take these monies and use them to do this habeas corpus and that was the basis of their finding that there was a will 1 15 d violation refunding of any advance payments of fee that had not been earned now I see this as an incredible stretch that case went to a jury trial in Houston after the opposite cheap this many accounts have been on their case the judge instructed a verdict and for this hard oh and in that case the office student council healed the case of the decision is enmity a year of Appeals upheld day so that had the case we've been talking about ultimately a very good outcome of course the issue then is that Clarissa had spent hiring an attorney spin probe into six figures to represent have representation and of course under our present bar rules there's no way that she can be reimbursed to getting that money back even though she won the case so the bottom line on that case or the two things number one if she had had a contract that specifically said everything that we do in pursuing a trying to get the status change when we learned the services rendered or phraseology like that would have been helpful second there apparently was not alack there was a lack of communication explaining to the client why she was doing habeas corpus what was going to happen to the buns held buns are going to be used and the client was not made knowledgeable even though the client I had approved do anything that's necessary to get the status change of the fiancee", "vt8Ks-vt4mk": "Baystate firearms and training is a full firearms retail

surprise for sure i i know we you weren't expecting that at all not in the least you know i think that there was a very um active sense of not expecting anything you know uh uh you you didn't want to to to get your hopes up you know and and i mean frankly getting nominated was was just such a great honor i was perfectly perfectly satisfied with that but um i mean winning winning was was just a thrill and and leading up to that night at the liberty you know you started to get a little a little sense that something something might be happening but even even you know a friend coming up to me and saying i smell victory in the air and you know it's like ah he says that to everyone you know yeah yeah that doesn't mean anything what gave you the little sense what what what what was it that gave you that little sense that something was in the air well i i mean that was that was one of them that uh that comment um uh i wasn't sure if um if this was just if well i i got a a a vip pass and an artist pass instead of just the regular uh regular ticket and and i don't know if that was just uh you know someone sending me the wrong passes but you know kind of looking around and realizing that my friends who were also nominated didn't have the same same you know tags hanging around their neck as i did wow little little signs okay um so you'd be a hard person to throw a surprise party for wouldn't you you'd and i'll bet you knew what all your christmas presents were when you were a little kid too no we're talking to barrett anderson on wa face day rock and um tell us a little bit about um what led up to this have you a little bit about your your career here in boston well i grew up i grew up in uh in central mass in a small town out by the um by the quabbin and and uh and started playing guitar when i was um about 13. and my dad quickly you know got me into into blues music he said you know i think it was buddy guy he said you should you should listen to this guy and and um and i did and and uh you know the proverbial world changed from that point on um my first experience playing professionally was uh at the old house of blues in harvard square getting to back up some members of muddy waters and bands um when i was 15 and and uh wow there's there's a real community to blues you know i feel like all of these kind of connections these people that i've met and bands that i've gotten to to play with or be a part of can all be kind of traced back you know um to to like that first time at the house of blues um but i got to know some some people and you know and and the web kept growing and uh i got to spend three years playing with ronnie earl and the broadcasters which was a real honor ronnie was a hero of mine and um is a brilliant guitar player holy cow after that i spent three years with the monster mike welch band and um then you know was ready to uh to start being a front man instead of a side man so this was at this point after after the time in ronnie with uh ronnie and with mike um i was in my you know kind of mid-20s and um that's a lot of living in music world that really is for such a a young guy well and it's it's a good area to to to be in the blues you know there are a lot of a lot of a lot of great musicians live here there are a lot of great clubs here and and especially you know when i was growing up there were a lot of national acts coming through it was easy to go out and to hear people and and get to get to to learn every night of the week you know um but i i went down to north mississippi first and and spent some time down there and um recorded my first album with some musicians down there um i got uh jimbo mathis to produce the uh the record he um was part of that swing revival in the 90s uh he he was the leader of the squirrel nut zippers and um and so we recorded all the way down and then i came back up here and hooked up with um with ron levy and pear hanson who uh recorded the new album the long fall we've been playing together now for about five years wow you know the more we got to play together for i'd i i had been thinking that i needed to make a new album for a little while and and playing with ron and pair i started to get a vision for uh you know i started to be able to imagine what what the new album would sound like and and so we got the great dennis brennan to uh to produce it and went into the studio about a year and a half ago and then in september released the long fall which i think really captures well what we've been doing in the uh in in the the clubs up here that's a nice um you you just kept moving forward and and uh building and that's really really nice and that's i i'm glad that you spoke of this and gave a little bit of a actually a good history of um where you came how you came into it and where you are where you are now and a major transition to playing with major you know established artists and then going off on your own i mean that is a major transition to leave all of that and start your own your own projects it is it's a good education you know when you're um getting to getting to watch what these people are doing from you know from a few feet away and and and you know if you pay attention you can really really pick up you know pick up little things every every uh with every note that's something that's just amazing so what are your plans now you've got the you've got two cds out i do and um and yeah the plans are you don't keep keep playing i've been um been been working booking more shows i i this month had some some great nights at uh some of my favorite spots in cambridge um toad and porter square and um atwoods outside inman square yeah love atwoods last night i was actually just down the street from uh from where we are here at smoke and joe's uh barbecue smoke and joe's yes and um yeah uh you know those those are some of my very favorite spots um and i try to always have a date on the books with them and so there there will be shows there coming up um and ideally especially you know the boston music award i think makes this this a little bit easier there's some good momentum and energy right now i'd uh i'd like to record a live album in the uh in the upcoming year i think the studio records are are great and very representative of one side of things and there's um and the live thing is is something else and so i'd like to capture that and uh and uh and keep keep moving forward you know keep on keep on keeping on as keep on keeping up where would you like to what what is your ideal spot to record a live blues album have you pondered where you'd want to do that i mean you as a musician you have to know and and doing a lot of the local um venues you have to kind of you must have a feel of what the best sound is absolutely and so right off the top of your head you know i'm partial to atwoods and and that's as much for from a uh an emotional point as as anything else you that was um when i came back from mississippi and was was you know getting getting the solo thing going up here atwoods was uh the first spot to to get me up on stage and i feel like they really kind of jump started a lot of uh a lot of the uh the the the solo stuff the career and um so you know that club holds a very special uh spot in my heart and uh and emotionally i think that would be a wonderful wonderful room to play at and it sounds good they have good people working there i feel similarly about the lizard lounge as well oh yeah you know and i certainly there have been some great live records that have come out of that room too so uh you know knowing that it it it sounds good on paper on on disc um you know i think those one of those places is uh it will most likely be so there i have my answer and now we have a little heads up on one of two we're talking to barrett anderson right now at 97.7 107.3 waf base state rock and and you also have your bass player tonight is here with us yes jim uh jim haggarty's here on the upright base and how are you it's good to see you oh that's right jim's jim jim's uh behind the stand up base over by the um well bass players are usually you're quiet over there there you are so so where where can folks see you next where are you planning on uh when's your next show see the next show um i have a couple of shows coming up out in central

right now no this is the first time this is happening at 9 30 tonight now one bar goer i spoke to says she plans to spend the night in honestly i'll probably start binge watching some of the shows the main concern baker has for closing food establishments early is to limit gatherings and prevent private indoor parties rose mcgaffery does not plan to invite people over to her place at all once bars that serve food and restaurants no probably not i'm trying to be really cautious with all of that stuff still so unless it's like one or two close friends probably not the owner of sophia's sports bar says he does not think shutting down food establishments at 9 30 every night will stop the spread of coronavirus he thinks if people want to have gatherings and continue partying they will people are going to leave the the establishments and they're going to go to somebody's house so i really don't know how they're going to control that now this order went into effect tonight restaurants can still

to marathon Long Key Bridge connects Long Key with conch Key roughly halfway between Miami and Key West it is the second longest bridge in the keys at two and a half miles the older bridge now a pedestrian bridge and bike paths carried the overseas railroad from 1907 to 1935 it also has fishing platforms it is part of the overseas heritage trail a multi-use bike path that is currently 90

grouper and eels sea stingrays or snorkel in the saltwater lagoon we now move to the final leg of our journey from marathon to Key West where some of the history of the keys can be seen through its amazing bridges the 70 mile bridge among the longest bridges in existence when it was built in 1982 most of the older bridge is still in existence a 2.2 mile section to pitch a key on the east end of the bridge was long used as a fishing pier but was closed to pedestrian traffic in 2016 however it is undergoing a 77 million dollar restoration and is expected to open by late 2021 the west end of the subway bridge has been restored and is open to pedestrian traffic [Music] at mile marker 37 is Bahia Honda State Park this is one of the best rated beaches in South Florida unlike many of the other state parks you can camp here cabins are available campsites available for small tents up to large RVs there are two boat ramps plenty of snorkeling swimming and fishing in crystal-clear waters fee is currently eight dollars per vehicle the state park also maintains the easternmost section of the old Bahia Honda railroad bridge it was here that Henry Flagler had his most challenging crossing for the overseas railroad the bridge had to be built taller than any of the other bridges on the railway after battling three hurricanes in four years the overseas railroad was complete in 1912 that is until the 1935 Labor Day hurricane ended the overseas railroad however it helped to complete the Overseas Highway the top of the Bahia Honda bridge was reject for automobile traffic [Music] and the complete overseas highway opened on March 29 1938 we are now just 30 miles from Key West as we cross the Spanish harbour bridge to Big Pine Key outside of some coastal areas of Miami the Florida Keys are the only areas in the continental US to never report a freezing temperature never has the temperature fallen below 41 degrees even in winter expect highs in the 70s and lows above 60 [Music] this will be our last shot with a drone at mile marker 13 due to the Naval Air Station and Keywest International Airport as we go over the Boca Chica channel we are now arriving in Key West before we take you on a tour of Mallory Street in the ball street I wanna give you a tip on a great place for lodging the Ibis bay beach resort rates are very reasonable although three miles to Mallory square it is an ideal location in my opinion with the grocery store and mcdonalds across the street in a restaurant with waterside seating on property rooms with a nice patio beach view relaxing pool area rentals for jet skis mopeds and likes in a parrot that says bye-bye when you leave also very convenient that you can park your car right next to your room as we move to Mallory square in Duval Street you will find lodging around here more expensive and less parking less space so I think it's an advantage to be three miles away and just take a moped to downtown mallory square is the center of Key West with restaurant shops theater museums a cruise port in various entertainment it hosts the sunset celebrations which begins every evening two hours before sunset with various street performers magicians live music circus acts and storytelling check out the furry water adventures where you can tour the waters around Key West on a jetski parasail or glass-bottom boat where you can see a living coral reef or take a catamaran or sailboat for a snorkel adventure under the sea with sunset watersports in plenty of options for fishing charters for a tour around the island try the old town trolley or the famous conch train the Key West shipwreck museum combines actors films and artifacts to tell the story of 400 years of shipwrecks and climb a 65 foot lookout tower for a great view of Key West the Key West lighthouse also offers a great view next to the Custom House Museum there are several statues which make great props for pictures [Music] the Key West aquarium the famous Duval Street starts at the Gulf of Mexico at Mallory Square and runs for one in a quarter-mile ending at the Atlantic Ocean named after the first governor of Florida it has many of the restaurants and nightlife of Key West Key West is also proudly known as the conch republic which goes back to 1982 under Mayor Denis Wardlow declared the independence of Key West from the federal government in protest to a u.s. Border Patrol inspection point on US Highway 1 which was hurt and tourism the name stuck and has become a banner for this free-spirited city we have put website links in the description below of the

rebecca roy i manage the park interpreter program for vermont state parks and today i'm here at beautiful kingsland bay state park 274 beautiful acres right on lake champlain kingsland bay is a gathering place responsible for our freedoms and holds our living memories and it's been a gathering place for over 12 000 years so when this property was purchased to make a state park in 1976 some archaeological test pits were dug around the property to see if there was eviden any evidence of indigenous people living here and they found some really interesting things they found points and bone shards and some other historic artifacts two different nations lived here it was the western abenaki who were in this area and a mohawk nation who also came here so those two nations would meet here exchange goods and exchange news and share stories with each other and they continue to live in this area today this property was purchased by gideon holly in 1780 who was the first european white settler in this area and he built the holly house the holly house is built from stone taken from fort ticonderoga and fort ticonderoga had a long history of battles where over 3 000 people died and in 1777 the british abandoned the fort and what they did is they destroyed it as much as they could so that no one else could take over the fort and use it so at that time people were taking the stones to build different structures in the area gideon took the stones and brought them across the lake champlain ice and used it to build the holly house lake champlain was a major travel route because there were no roads in this part of vermont it was just wilderness and so people relied on lake champlain for transportation gideon holly started a ferry business from here over to grog harbor in new york state his holly house which was his way home was also occasionally used as an end for people in inclement weather and the whole upstairs of the holly house was built as a giant ballroom and they had huge parties people would come from all over to come and celebrate and be together and have a dance party as you can imagine it was very festive here at that time during the war of 1812 militia were housed here because u.s ships were being built in virgins and so the militia were here to protect the ships that were being built before the battle of plattsburgh the militia were stationed here to prepare you can imagine malicious staying here and the smell of gun oil and the nervous talk before the battle as they prepared and gideon holly was 50 years old at the time and he and three of his oldest sons went and fought in the battle of plattsburgh and the younger children hid in the treed swamps here at kingsland bay and hid during the battle and they would have been able to see the battle from here gideon was hurt and came home here to the holly house and then about three months later he unfortunately died of his injuries from the battle freedom was hard won by gideon holly and his family but because of him and this place because of kingsland bay we enjoy the freedoms that we have today travel on lake champlain was less important because a lot more roads were built in the area the hollies ended up closing down their ferry service and selling the property and this property became a family farm for about 50 years one of the main families that farmed here was the kingsland family and their name stuck to the bay and that's why it's called kingsland bay today and they lived in the holly house and i wonder if they experienced some of the mysterious things that we do today after it was a family farm a priest pierre cambo came here felt god's presence here so he bought the property and made it into a monastic retreat which meant that it was a place where catholic priests could come and rest and rejuvenate and reconnect a bell tower was built on the holly house the priest stayed in the holly house and every evening at sunset they went up underneath the bell tower and chanted vespers as the sun sunk down behind the adirondack mountains [Music] after the catholic priests left this became a expensive private girls summer camp it was a french summer camp and jackie kennedy anastas the former first lady went to camp here it was a prestigious beautiful summer camp so after it was a summer camp the summer camp closed in 1974 and then the state purchased it to make a state park in 1976. the state saw the value in protecting such a beautiful piece of the shore of lake's champlain and preserving the memories here this place is open to everyone and it's a place where everyone can come and visit so it protects those special memories that still live on here and new memories that can be made by us and you visiting the state park today such a long history of people no wonder there are some mysterious things that sometimes happen here at kingsland bay state park a photographer took a picture of the holly house and there was a face looking at one of the upstairs windows and at the time the holly house was locked and closed and so no one was really in there there are some a few stories about things moving mysteriously on their own like once a water bottle flying across the room and landing on the floor and then some people talk about voices being heard in some of the other buildings when no one else is in the building and so these living memories can carry on because we have a state park here and so kingsland bay is a gathering place responsible for our freedoms and protecting our living memories and there's room for everyone

then they're not hauling me up and he won't show us what we're doing and I said it's brilliant let's do this so let's talk about this in terms of the foodie scene what I love is that you're gonna start doing progressive dinners yes I can't wait and this is one of the things about Traverse City they have so many great establishments should I just go to one play record you can call the pedicab go somewhere for drinks and then somewhere else for appetizers yes you see us weenis now the oddest thing on this place you can go to be front petty Capcom or a Facebook page call us at 231 307 4900 you can download the pedicab Go app and select Trevor city and all the drivers are listed so you can get histories and backgrounds and where we're at and what we're doing are you gonna go into October what about the seasonal as long as we can go so we'll have blankets we think it's cold not to be happy while you're riding up yeah did you just feel happy for as long as I can remember I've been hanging out with these two at this place this is our family night this is what we used to do together is hang out have some drinks have some dinner and we called it family night so tonight we're gonna call it BFF @ff best friends forever a firefly foodie senior ready let's go why do we love the Firefly you ask let me tell you let me tell you I actually love Firefly because it's kind of your neighborhood restaurant it feels very cozy but it's also first of all there's it's you know fun at night cool lights when you drive by it looks cool you sit in the window up front look outside watch all the action you can get cozy in the back and get cozy and the sofas great lighting to sit outdoors in the summertime and there aren't that many places to fit outdoors in a summertime right so lots of reasons to love life a lot of good natural light look at this guy over here I mean it's hard to be everything to a lot of people I think just keeping it casual affordable you can come out to eat multiple times a week at our establishments small plates small plates sushi the small plates you can get a variety of food with just one look at all these advertisers the pita and hummus is the classic from Firefly of course you have the spider roll and the spicy tuna when it comes to the sushi and other classic with Firefly and one of my personal favorites the beef skewers and it comes in a bed of the sweet potato fries with the garlic aioli sauce it's perfect and I don't know what you guys are having not dinner happened there oh my gosh we found our table with a beautiful view of the water here at the firefly wood we used to do family nights here and this is when I was single mom and so maybe kids were with dad for the evening and I would hang out with these two and this was what we called family night and it was kind of hilarious though because Garret was always taking care of ladies at that point how did you get through that Garret a lot of beer we're really gonna be honest like we could go to another restaurant and have one glass of wine or we can go to bars like 100 I have the Thai peanut stir-fry which I love because this kind of is a lot about my personality here it's just a little bit of everything in kind of messy but it tastes delicious so we have the New York Strip over here with some red potato and the parmesan Brussels sprouts which look delicious by the way it looks like some salmon over here with Meredith I think consistency quality and then you want to be able to come here different experiences but the same reliability as far as the consistency of food that's I think that's a huge factor we've got Oh after a lovely night at the Firefly now let's take a nice walk by the river so it's a great night at the Firefly in Traverse City wonderful food great service great wine great drinks great atmosphere great friend look at you guys hey still friends still friends no friends at sixteen years of doing that man what are you got there Garrett the leftover how did you get the leftovers I just took them everyone else's life oh so you're so endearing you guys are like oh my gosh what are you doing now fine so", "90WTW__euHI": "everyone everyone

and i decided to see if we could get reservations kind of late in the game but we really wanted to see if we could come up to saga hawk i always pronounce it wrong maine and um we've camped here a couple of times it's really pretty it's right on the bay as you can see behind me this bay fills up when it's high tide the water comes all the way up i'll superimpose the video clip so you can see what it looks like i mean it's like really really cool and when the tide goes out you can see it's just it's like a little bit of mud flats in the very beginning but then it goes into sand and way yonder is a lighthouse sequins lighthouse i believe it is and um it's just really it's a really pretty walk it's like a mile and a half out to where a dead low tide where you get to the point where the end of the bay reaches the kenny back and the atlantic ocean so it's where the river and the ocean and the bay kind of merge together it's really cool out there it's a long walk a mile and a half one way so you want to time it correctly i'm gonna try to go out a little bit today it's late because low tide was about two hours ago three hours ago it's actually starting to come back in but it's just really cool so we made a last-minute decision to come up here we have a tandem site which is really one site chaired by two rvs so we're up here camping with friends so our setup is like really different um but it's kind of cool because we are close friends so we do camp a lot together so we're sharing a yard we're sharing we each have our own plug-in for utilities and all that but we're sharing one spot which you only want to do if you have friends you really like and i'm at the edge of the campground you see somebody has a can of budweiser there but they're probably out there walking in the bay and this is really set up really cool on the one side of me here is a gazebo not too sure if you can see that gazebo it's really awesome and then up in the field that's pretty well where the campus sites are at least the rv sites the hookup sites i should say in the woods that they have they have like woods up there um where they have quite a bit of other campsites they have tent sites smaller rv sites but down here you can have a picnic overlooking the water there's fire pit you have a barbecue it's just really cool so this is just a um the problem i think with us for camping here as often as we do uh or why we don't all camp as often as we can is because it is way off the beaten path there is literally when you get here you're about you're driving a good 30 minutes off the main road to come down this long windy road to get down to this peninsula if you look at the map of maine for those of you that are interested i just hope it's not too windy if you look at the map of maine there's like fingers as i call them and each fingers like a little peninsula and you have to drive off the main road to go down that finger well this one is like a 30 minute ride and the closest big town that we come in off of is bath and we're actually in georgetown maine and we're in skagit hawk so it's kind of very interesting because it's um not too much to do down here you've got to drive like i said 30 minutes off the coast to uh to get up to the mainland so to speak even though you do go have to cross a couple of bridges because you are separated from the mainland here you have to cross over the bridges to get here so you have to go over i think two bridges and then you're in bath and then you're at the mainland and um this is kind of cool we actually yesterday did a a um a boat tour we went out on a boat tour and it was really really really fun i'm gonna superimpose a couple of uh clips here so that you can can actually see us getting ready for going out on the boat where we going honey up the river going up the river i don't think we have a battle all right i don't think we have a battle do we okay we're going on a four-hour river river ride i'd lighthouse ride right so we left out of bathmate and we're going all the way up to wood bay saltport now we're in a really rough area where the kenny vector meets [Music] the river it's like kind of really cold so we were out on the boat and we went from the we went from the bath iron works and the we went out there and we we took it was four hours in total we went down the kennebec river which was a slow menandering ride you can see some of the videos and clips that i'm i'm superimposing this beautiful beautiful ride going down the kennebec river then we went out to i think it took us a little over an hour maybe an hour and 20 minutes to get out to where the ocean is and then we we sort of it was a little wiggly out of the ocean and i think we might have been out in the ocean maybe another hour i'm not too sure but it was a little wiggly and we were out in the ocean and we we motored up it was a motorboat it wasn't a sailboat but we went up the coast to the southport island area and boothbay harbour region and we sailed all around south port island sailed moted all the way around south rhode island you can see some of the sailboats some of the pitches that i'm sharing with you just really pretty pretty pretty area and then into boothbay and then at one point we had sailed here i go sailing again you know i'm a closet sailor in case you haven't figured that out i've often said that um if i wasn't rving and i had the time i would i would follow the sun on a sailboat i would i would get myself a sailboat and i would sail around i love that lifestyle jay and i had our best trip of our life was 10 days on the high seas on our honeymoon it was just amazing we loved it so anyways at one point we went uh through boothbay and then we went up to the um deepscott river and we went through the bridge at boothbay and this is us motoring because the bridge now off season only opens up every half hour to let boat traffic in so you have to plan it just right otherwise you have to wait and this is us kind of motoring through the pass to go into up the sleep squat river and what what a beautiful view what a beautiful what it was actually a perfect trip i couldn't believe how perfect it was it was really nice we didn't encounter any rough weather at all nobody nobody uh was sunny but we had brought jackets just in case it got cold i'd put my jacket on the sail end of the trip we didn't get back to a little after six o'clock and we left at 2pm and right right on the dock because we boarded at 1 30. so it was really cool it was really cool it was an awesome trip and i saw things that we you know when you when you look at stuff from the water everything looks so completely different i wore a lot of sunblock i started the morning out making sure after i did my skin care and i guess i brought a lot of my skincare with me but i started out with a good heavy and i have the one from the dermatology i really like that one a lot i put that moisturizer on before i put any makeup on and then my foundation that i've worn every single day has been the boots number seven uh perfect and protect or protect and perfect or whatever it is this worked like a charm for me as far as making sure that i'm not burning and then i had my australian gold with me in my bag and at one point i did do a touch-up only because it was late in the day and i had put my makeup on early and i was feeling like maybe i needed to have a little more protection but what an amazing trip what an amazing trip i'm gonna take you out there film a little bit more and then i'll come back it's a little bit muggy here i've got my little so hard to imagine when this is full of water you know what it's like but i'm going to give it a try i'm going to give it a try and see if i can make it without sinking too far in these mud holes my city friends probably wouldn't like walking in this but it is not i'm not sinking in at all i mean a little bit of mookie but it's really cool and i don't know if you can hear it but there's actually somebody that was i thought it was a saxophone but they just stopped i'll try to put it back on so you can hear it as i make my way across here you hear it maybe it's a fiddle but you can see this is the other part of the campground you can see some tent campers up there and there's a house and i'll just turn around and show you from where i came yeah i haven't gone very far but this is so amazingly cool and because the tide's coming in i'm not going to be able to go to the edge but i'll be fine anyways this is pretty well we're the ocean and the river this is all salt water the tide is coming in so cool oh my gosh it's beautiful out here oh i love it i love it i love it [Applause] so the water is about to my ankles right now and it is cold cold water [Applause] but anyways it's so cool because as i mentioned earlier when we were on the boat we sailed right by that lighthouse out there or maybe i didn't mention it earlier but i mentioned the lighthouse we sailed right by it is really wicked cool i'm going to turn it's out there somewhere way way younger i'll tell you the campsite's up on the hill if you're into tent wow really pretty campsites on a bluff overlooking the bay and because we are facing due south we have to the sunrises is over on the you know the east and we sunrise sunset would be on the west so we just kind of get backsplashed we don't get direct sunrise or direct sun set because we have faith in yourself you get the background up to my cast yeah this day will fill up pretty quick i'm not too sure when the tide is but i know low tide was as eight it's now 1105. so 11 30 and now you can see those boats right there when they first came out they're already in water when i first walked out a little bit ago they were just resting sitting in the mud they made it all the way back without sinking into any mud my new shoes things look at they are where are they right here they held out pretty good i thought they did pretty good this will pick up but this whole bay is full of sparkles so beautiful so happy labor day monday it i just can't believe that the week is is um weekend is over it's been it's been kind of like a bittersweet weekend in many ways i had a message this morning on instagram that really made me deeply first of all touched me deeply and then made me really think deeply made me really think about a lot of things and one the message was loud and clear you need to make room for grief you need to accept it you need to expect it it's going to hit you at weird times but i didn't realize that i was putting it in a box grief in a box and stepping it under the bed and i read that message and i realized and then i listened to my girlfriend judy and i realized how true it was so i'm going to save that for a little bit of a video i'm going to do it a little bit and walk about sort of a chatty walk about and talk about that rather than add it to this vlog but it opened my eyes it opened my eyes so anyways happy labor day monday it's been a fantastic weekend we've done an awful lot today we're going to go explore pittsburgh one of the islands and we're just gonna just gonna go out and veg and and i hope we have a a fantastic day i'm sure we will it'll be super super fun you know super fun tonight we're having steamers and i don't think we're gonna do options just gamers and and um and i think just our last night fire and stuff like that should be cool i hope you all had a fantastic weekend oz was really really nice very relaxing and we had so much fun thank you for joining me and i'll see you in my next video much love hugs", "-JULXMlxmAM": "(guitar music) You got to, you gotta take it.

It stick to your bones.", "3e3CGHmARGY": "my dear brothers and sisters thank you for joining us today uh and uh we have a very fascinating topic to talk about today we're going to be understanding why one in ten of every uh american prisoners are becoming muslim it's an amazing phenomena so we're going to be learning today about why there's this mass con conversion to islam happening in u.s prisons and what it's like to be a muslim behind bars and when our incarcerated brothers and sisters are released what happens when a muslim who's never seen the inside of a masjid finally rejoins society and our muslim communities and um to help us understand this we have one of our very very many uh amazing american muslims who who was in prison and i'm going to ask him in a couple of minutes to share his story but before i do uh introduce our guest let me just say this virtual chat is one uh sponsored by mcc and the deva foundation now this is interesting uh the deva foundation is one of the few muslim organizations in the u.s serving incarcerated muslims and they provide muslim inmates male and female much needed islamic education along with essential life skills training and assistance um when they re-enter society shikhami who many of you are familiar with he's the co-founder and he's also served as our youth director at mcc um but and like a lot of amazing non-profits they were sort of incubated uh informally by what is now zaduna college uh notably uh for folks in the bay area in chicago the the the leaf collective was also uh incubated uh under the zeitung institute nauseating but the deba foundation began with sheikh rami uh he was teaching prisoners via collect calls uh to prison not a cheap way to talk to somebody uh and he would guide new muslims and inmates on the phone and answer questions about their faith and from these collect phone calls uh he saw this golf of understanding and need that was there for our muslim brothers and sisters that are locked up and he attempted to bridge that gap through distance learning and providing quality islamic education for tarbia which is the refinement of our thinking and behavior so deva is certainly to be commended for their work and their efforts and deserving of our support so with that let me introduce you to our guest uh so imam alhazadi said everyone needs one soul purifying transformative doba repentance once in their uh his or her life and abdul zahir he's with us today he was locked up for nine years in federal prison he actually was muslim before he went in and during that prison stretch he uh spent his time learning and then teaching akida uh teschia and arabic uh and then when he was released five years ago he received his degrees in behavior sciences and arabic and he's been working now on his masters in social work uh his thesis is on recidivism mental health and substance abuse which is a lot to unpack for a thesis um in addition to all that see the davidi is an author having wrote an introductory book specifically for newly um converted inmates and this was um about a year after his release that he wrote this book and he currently serves as re-entry department manager for david foundation so with that osa welcome thank you for having me uh and then one was at least five years definitely an honor mashallah so uh so there's much to unpack here but let's let's start off by getting to uh know you sod uh so tell us about your personal story where you were born uh where you were raised and uh wind us through your journey to finding islam and then becoming incarcerated right okay so alhamdulillah um i was actually you know both of my parents uh became muslim in um in the you know in the early 70s i think maybe my father in the late 60s um you know but you know at that at that time um you know there was no you know islam was not developed you know the islamic institutions were not developed as they are now um so i was born in columbus ohio and then um so i you know i lived there a few years in my youth and then we moved to los angeles where my father was originally from um and and you know stayed there for some time um but i can say like one of the defining moments in my life was you know my father was murdered when i was about i was about eight years old um and even though my mother remarried um you know the relationship between me and my stepfather was you know was tenuous it wasn't it wasn't like the relationship that i had with my father um and so you know i think that's like probably some that's something that's setting the stage for what's coming in the future um i had a muslim identity i knew that i was muslim i mean i remember memorizing ayato corsi by the time i was 10 years old and i learned how to read arabic at a very basic level when i was about 12. um you know i understood you know the oneness of allah you know the nebula of rasulullah the day of judgment you know i understood the basics of islam and then we moved again um to colorado and when we moved to colorado uh my you know my my mother and my stepfather they they put me into public school um alhamdulillah today you have you know a lot of organizations that um can kind of kind of counteract the effects of public school no doubt i'm sure parents have their problems um but you know public school was like introducing me to you know i had no idea what the non-muslim world was really like until i went to public school that's really where i got introduced to music brand names video games the relationships between the males and the females the negative aspects of those relationships um like gross selfishness like i i didn't really know that until i entered into public school so and this was at the fifth grade so from from the time i was born up into the fifth grade i either went to like small private muslim schools or i was homeschooled fifth grade i entered into a brand new world and then these different seeds of you know you know the different seeds of fitna are being planted in my heart um by the time i was in ninth grade you know my muslim identity was slipping you know i mean i can honestly say that i knew i was a muslim but you know it was it was it was not that important to me at the time so in ninth grade i i don't have any muslims to identify with i don't have any mentors i there's no youth groups in colorado at that time i think maybe some of the larger more developed islamic communities on the east coast maybe on the west coast they had those things but in colorado there was nothing like that and so um i remember maybe having one muslim friend all the way through um from from ninth grade to maybe 11th grade one muslim friend um and then he moved away and then all of my friends were non-muslims and everything that they were into the drinking the drugs the you know selling drugs to make money the partying you know everything that goes with that lifestyle and um i just i i jumped in i jumped in um you know with both feet you know i didn't touch the water i didn't tap the water i jumped all the way in and then i started learning these habits you know i started you know having other habits um and you know but it you know i made you know for two years i was in the dunya really really hard i was in a dunya really really hard selling drugs um girlfriends the clubs you know everything that goes with that and the analogy that i like to give is like you know when you plug in the iron right and the iron gets hot just because you pull the the plug out of the wall the iron is still hot and it takes time for it to cool down and that's what it's like like when a person makes tawba okay when a person makes tawba they realize they make some mistakes they pull they pull the plug out of the wall but the iron's still hot all right there's still fire damage there there's still damage now you have to purify i didn't know anything about purifying the soil i didn't know that that was necessary didn't know how to do it where to begin so those seeds that were planted were still there okay so you know they're not necessarily getting all the water that they need to be full-blown sins but the plant is very much there it's very much alive or you can say the iron is still hot okay um so i got married when i was young i was about 20 years old um i got married we i had my my son was born i was about 21. and then i kind of realized you know i need to um i need to you know i don't want my children to go through what i went through so i i moved to california um you know and uh you know got involved in different ways and this is right around the time when i moved zaytuna institute was just opening i think was like 97 1997. they were just getting going and um you know to make a long story short i ran into some opportunities to make some fast money with muslims and ended up you know you know it ended up being you know selling drugs um you know and i ended up catching a federal case federal drug charge for and i ended up serving 11 years for that charge um and and so sometimes people ask me well you know like how did that happen how were you like in the islamic environment and you know you started to study and you wanted to change your life and be a better muslim for your children and the only way that i can explain it is that the fire was still hot right like i had not began to remove you know those vices that i learned from fifth grade up until my early twenties i didn't know how to uproot that and so it was still there um even though i began to try to change so really in uh you know in prison um you know that's really really when i knew that you know this is not a game and you don't graduate in the the college of life you don't move from one level to another level you know with intestine trial except by sincere tawba sincere turning to allah and change um and so that's basically how i got to prison you know the the how the the the the vices were planted um you know and even though you know i made a sort of tawba it wasn't complete and it wasn't um you know it wasn't accompanied by purification of the heart which which which i i agree a hundred percent wholeheartedly you know imam ghazali he calls it like it's it's it's it's a it's mandatory that every muslim must learn enough about it so that they can purify and um so you know i can that's like the background that's what's leading to prison subhanallah quite the story uh it reminds me a lot of uh malcolm x's story of going in you know you we all have these gia days and uh it takes us a turning point in our life to to turn that so um let's talk a little bit about deva foundation of course david foundation did you learn about them and what resources did you find when you went into prison this is an excellent question um you know the the truth of the matter is um you know when i when i went into prison um you know i i i went to trial so you know from the time you get arrested to time you go to trial sometimes you know it takes years sometimes and in my case it took 16 months um so i went to trial um and that 16 months that i was incarcerated i was incarcerated in philadelphia there there's a huge muslim population in philadelphia and that's also reflected in the criminal justice system so i was on a unit there's 120 people on any given unit the unit that i was on i would say probably 60 or 70 of them in there they're muslim they're muslim you know you talk about half of the pod being muslim the adhan is called five times a day out loud you know there's uh you know all these muslim women in hijabs and nepal coming up to the visitation room you know some of the nurses are muslim some of the guards are muslim you know so it you know that was that was an experience but the truth of the matter munir is that what i found in the first week i was there the vast majority of muslims they did not know their deen they were muslim in name only and alhamdulillah had already been blessed to kind of get an introduction to the zatuna institute syllabus um you know what the teachers were uh you know she comes to yusuf imam zaid you know um uh shakespeare like what they were placing their emphasis on and so when i was looking at the situation in the prison i realized that you know we we have to focus on purification of the heart we have to do everything we have to learn fake we have to learn you know our theology correctly akita correctly we have to learn these things but i realized that what was mostly lacking what most people didn't know anything about was how to remove those vices how do you remove those dirt stains from the heart that comes from doing things year after year after year how do you how do you remove that um and so immediately that's what i started working on and like within the first two weeks you know you know a lot of the brothers kind of understood you know what we should probably make him the imam so that's what they did they made me the imam so now i'm automatically in search mode where are the materials where are the materials we need a syllabus we need some way of systemizing the delivery of islam to this population there's no there was no syllabus we had books we had catalogs in there um you know without getting into a lot of the polemics you know um you know there's there was a lot of extremists you know thought in there too you know um and it's not their fault that's what's being sold in the bookstores you know and you know they look beautiful the covers are very beautiful and it says that this is the authentic tradition and really it's not really that's that's the outlier right and so you know i wanted to tell brothers you no no don't don't read this read this don't read don't don't study that study this but there was nothing that was systemized there was no syllabus there was no curriculum so i just had to go through the catalog book by book buy this book don't buy this book buy this book buy this book and then you have to you have to explain it why why you have to buy this book why why not buy that book um you know so alhamdulillah at that time that i was there you know we gave a lot of shahadas i can remember just off the top of my head i can remember five names and i can there was probably double that though you know just people they're just watching you know they're watching and that's the thing about prison you're in an isola you're isolated you're you're in an environment you're like in a pressure cooker you see the same people every day and they're watching you and you're watching them and when they realize that you have something to share they're going to come to you eventually there was a puerto rican i'm sorry dominican that was in my cell he just watched me make wulu he just he watched me make wuvu and and he took his shahada based on that because he said that his grandmother who knew something about the black arts which you know that's very famous down in south america um you know that that's what she used to do she used to rub her face with water and rub her arms with water when she feared with witchcraft right so this is probably in her background there's some islam so when he saw me doing that he was like i want to know what you know i want to be what you are that's how he accepted islam um there was another brother he was cuban um you know he was having some uh some situations with his with his uh with his soon-to-be wife but he was looking at some serious time just i just gave him some advice one day we were in the sale he just started crying and he said i need you to teach me about god i know i want i need to know i need to understand like explain everything to me so i just started explaining to him and finally he just one time we were on a transit bus and the guard was asking everybody what their religion was because they have to make sure that everybody gets their religious services and whatnot so they get to us and he asked me i told him i was a muslim the guy next to me says i'm what he is i'm what he is and that's how he took his shahadah so i took him through the process um so that was that's what happened for the first 16 months when i got to the actual prison that i was going to this was maybe around 2006 the end of 2006 or the early 2007 i was talking to my brother-in-law who was living in the bay area at the time and he started he asked me he said do you remember remember romney romney was he was going over the seas and he was you know you know he used to come back to say tony's to teach sometimes i you know i vaguely remembered you know this tall guy you know coming back from mauritania you know i vaguely i said yeah i think i think so he said yeah he's starting a program where he's going to be teaching uh muslims who are incarcerated i was like really um but to be honest with you i didn't get i didn't get with him right away because i was ashamed of my situation i was ashamed so i didn't reach out because i knew a lot of the brothers at zatuna i knew a lot of the teachers you know and i you know i just was totally ashamed of my situation which i should have been um but finally finally i think maybe the middle of 2007 i reached out and sheikh rami masha'allah he was so gracious he took my phone call we talked about some some issues and then he started sending me material and this stuff was you know it was nothing it was no book form it was just it was just you know copied papers half arabic half english with some notes written on it and he sent it to me in the mail but to us who were in prison and now i'm i'm part of a bigger community there's there's there's maybe a 150 brothers at the prison um receiving that was like receiving light when you're in a cave that's the only way i can explain it to you you know that someone on the outside cares enough to you know go over fine details of some issue on the phone they accept your collect call and then when you ask them they take time to explain it to you and then they say i'm gonna send you some material give me your address and then you actually get the material this is very rare in prison this is very rare we live by the mail that we live by the phone and by the mail and the phone calls are only 15 minutes you only get so many minutes to call out so when you can call out if you might get 300 minutes a month okay 300 minutes a month and you know and and the mail that's that's how you keep your sanity so when you have a muslim who cares enough about you to send you books to send you literature to take your phone calls it means everything to somebody who was incarcerated and that was how i was introduced to the table foundation um and we just started studying and then you know every now and then i would get surprise books in the mail i would get surprise letters in the mail i would get you know like a newsletter or a calendar or a book and you literally just you fall in love with the sound of the person who's doing this for you um you know because really truly you don't know who your friends really are and how your family is going to stand by you until you are in prison then you're going to know you're going to find out and you know i can't there are thousands of brothers and sisters in all 50 states that love sheikh rami they make dua for the table foundation for the people who are helping in the table foundation because of what i just my my experience you can multiply that times hundreds of thousands of muslims that are in the prison system and you know anybody who reaches out to them you know um you know it's it's the difference between you know a hard year or an easy year uh you know a good day or a bad day you know i mean i mean it's it's it's pretty much everything so that's you know in a long-winded way of telling you you know that was my introduction to the table foundation and um um so okay so i'll go on just a few more minutes um eventually the books that started coming were much more polished so by the by like 2009 2010 we were getting the whole text half arabic half english and and i'm spreading the word you know there are there are brothers who were in you know prison i'm telling them sign up with the table foundation time you're going to get these books you're like this is this this is this and then we started a study circle and you know pretty much everywhere where i went i was either the imam or i was the assistant imam but my thing in prison was about education with particular emphasis on purification of the self and you know you're just introducing to brother you have to introduce to brothers because these brothers and sisters they love allah they love the messenger of allah but you know they grew up in broken homes or they grew up in the foster system their parents were drug addicts their parents were you know pimps and prostitutes and they didn't have a chance to learn eden they didn't have that chance the first time they see discipline is in prison you know in prison if you're not disciplined you have the threat of violence you bump into somebody and you don't say excuse me you could lose your life so your your circumstances force you to be disciplined but then the influence of islam in prison is greater than its numbers it's greater than its numbers you only have maybe 10 percent of the population that's muslim but the but the influence of islam in prison is much greater than that i mean you just imagine you know you you know munir when you when you walk into a parking lot just say you're just driving you're going to sam's club you walk into the parking lot and you see three brothers over in the corner and they're praying under a tree you know the effect that that has on you like oh wow masha'allah now just imagine somebody who knows nothing about islam he walks into the prison yard some people are out there lifting weight some people are running around the track getting their exercise some people doing push-ups some people are playing basketball but over there in the corner every couple of hours there's 25 brothers lined up and you see them all in unison moving together allahu akbar send me allah and these are some of the these these their reputations like these are some of the hardest dudes on the yard and they became muslim and now they have this discipline they fast during the month of ramadan they prayed five times a day they began to get rid of cursing in their language you always see them with a book in their hand they're studying a whole brand new language the arabic language and the people people that come they see that and they're like what's that i want that and this is this this is how islam spreads very very quickly very very quickly i've heard this over and over and over again by people that took shahada while i was in prison they might have seen the prayer they've seen the discipline they come maybe their homeboy got locked up a few years before them and when they come their homeboy is muslim and they're like this guy is totally different he's talking about god and you know he doesn't curse anymore and he reads now and i you know i don't you know okay i'm signed me up like you know that's kind of kind of how it goes so yeah on a lot thank you so much for sharing that it's not very beautiful and uh you know when i read the statistic of one in ten of every american prisoners becoming muslim it's just an amazing phenomenon it sounds like it's happening despite the efforts of the larger muslim community and and where but this and and the muslim communities we're moving from this ad hoc services to a little more structure i'm wondering from you thought what's the next iteration as we we have now mail service and phone calls to support our muslim incarcerated um and we have a little more polished distance learning what's the next evolution to support our incarcerated brothers and sisters um inside i would um two things come to mind the first thing is that we need many many more volunteers to go in and just be you know a support for muslims who are incarcerated muslims who are incarcerated i did 11 years in prison and i only saw three volunteers that were muslim to come into the system i only saw three in 11 years and um but i saw you know every every group the smallest group in prison is the jewish group but they get visitors every week and they're the smallest group the largest group are the protestant christians and then after that it's the muslims and then after that it's the catholics then after that is the jews the muslims we don't get any love from from from from the greater larger muslim community and i personally personally wrote letters to you know to the muslim community because i i did my time in jessup georgia i wrote to the imams in savannah i wrote to the imams in jacksonville florida i wrote to the imams in atlanta and out of probably 20 different places that i wrote to only one responded and they just sent us some they sent us some qurans and they sent them some literature and things like that but it was it's it was nowhere near what we actually need the morale of the muslims when they when they call you they tell all muslims you know report to the chapel you know that you know that you have a visitor your your morale it just it takes off it it goes into outer space because you just want to ask them how you guys dealing with such and so how does a muslim go about getting married in your community how you know if if i get released how where can i go buy a kufi from where can i get a test b right like these are simple questions to me and you right because we know islam be out out here but to someone who became muslim in prison they don't know what that's like can you bring us some miswak right what about prayer rugs i remember one brother he promised to send some prayer rugs and they never came that was heartbreaking for the whole population it was heartbreaking and the chaplain told him if you send the rugs i'll accept them the rugs never came you know it was a heart it was heartbreaking um and um so that's the first thing there we need more muslims to volunteer we're talking maybe two hours three hours a week it's nothing you know it's it's nothing you might have to pay for the gas up there you know the gas back and you know you spend an hour maybe two hours you know just talking to the brothers and sisters that's it that's the first thing the second thing is this munir 95 of the incarcerated population is returning back to society 95 i guarantee you every masjid every masjid in america is going to have brothers and sisters who were formally incarcerated i guarantee it whether you know it or not they will be there the question is how do we plug them into the greater community just i'll just give an example um there was there's a sister that just wrote us a letter she was in san diego and she um she she became muslim in prison she was at the halfway house she wanted something so simple i just want to buy a hijab that's it but because she's not connected there's no way there's nowhere for me to say okay go here talk to this brother this community talk to this sister in this community you know this brother is doing re-entry work these sisters are doing re-entry work you know if there's no structure where can i tell her to go buy a hijab from all she wants is a hijab she never bought a hijab on the street she just wants to go into a store and buy a hijab there's no one to guide her there's no one to help her this is something very simple what about complex matters get a job housing references for a job or to enter into college how about that that's more complex if we can't help them to get a hijab or to get a cool fee we we we have to step up our game there are hundreds of thousands of muslims in prison hundreds of thousands that's like a whole city of people you don't see but they're muslim and they're gonna come out they're gonna come out so we have to the second thing i would say is we have to we have to structure how we plug them into the community and how we deliver services to them because what you'll find like what we have here in southern california and it's all we're all table students we're all table students i can i can tell you there's four brothers in southern california right now that's that is giving more to the community than they are asking from the community okay so for example myself i teach in a couple of islamic uh um communities and they asked me to because they realized that you know i have a i have a connection to what is being packaged and given to them so in other words they're listening to music you know they're they're watching uh these programs on television dunya is being packaged in very beautifully and served to them via social media via the movies via the music and the imam doesn't can't always relate so what if you bring somebody in who can relate now you're a resource and you can talk to the children at the level that they are and believe me the kids are being exposed to everything they're being exposed to everything so someone who knows that and i know it not because it says so in the quran i know it because i lived it i experienced it and i'm telling you brother i'm telling you sister that you don't want to go down that route okay um we have another brother um he's the operations manager as one of the largest masjid most wealthy uh masjids here in southern california operations manager after 22 years in prison we have another brother um who you know he he just got a almost a million dollar contract with um the the city of los angeles or the county of los angeles to provide re-entry services you know to people who are entering into southern california he's muslim he's providing these services and he's able to hire other muslims because he has this huge contract right and each one of us received just a little support from the muslim community via taba but now look at the payback look at the payback just a little investment look at the payback that's what we have to do as a community that's what we have to do the responsibility is on all of our shoulders and uh you know we so often we hear from our incarcerated brothers and sisters uh that they're we sometimes they call themselves the forgotten ummah and for the viewer watching right now and he or she is listening to you and says oh i don't want to i don't want to be responsible i don't want i i want to do something about this but i don't know how do i reach out to deva do i call my local jail or prison do i what do i do i call the mosque and how do i how do i help my incarcerated brothers and sisters yeah that's a very very good question and the answer is going to be different in every location um because there are different levels of services that are needed you have some services that are needed at the jail level just people who are they're under the threat of being incarcerated or they're being held on some charge and they just need someone to come in this is local this is local work you don't have to drive far you have to drive downtown to your city and and ask you know the representatives or you know ask the administration how can we um you know just you know provide chaplain services to the muslim population how can we do that and they may say oh we just they need qurans you know they need um you know something for ramadan services for ramadan that's at the jail level then you have the prison level um you know in alhamdulillah in california it's it's it's more developed than in most other states where we have like chaplains that go into the prisons um you know you know are able to teach organizations like taba um you know to provide you know long-distance learning very very you know highly developed courses um you know for muslims who are incarcerated then you have the re-entry services so it really depends on where you are and what's happening for your particular community i would say um support the table foundation it's right there right there union city right in the bay area you know it's a staple in the bay area and but the reach is much further i mean we have students in 48 states male and female at the jail state prison and federal prison level so any support that you give it's going far and wide um we just started another program inshallah i'll be done with my masters uh next month inshaallah i submit my thesis next month and um i'll be able to provide mental health and substance abuse services you know not just to those who are re-entering society but muslims in general too muslims in general sometimes the imam calls me he says listen this student over here you know had a mental break and having problems with their parent come and talk to them um um you know you know but up there in the bay area i'm sure you still need somebody to go to the local jails it might be the san francisco county jail it might be the san mateo county jail the alameda county jail that's always needed that's always needed they just and and you don't need to know a lot you just have to have empathy that's it you don't have to know a lot of dean you don't have to you just have to have empathy sometimes people just need someone to talk to somebody to say we didn't forget about you so that's what i would say like kind of get in where you feel that you fit in you know um if you have a good listening ear maybe the county jails is your thing you know um if you you know have some you know counseling you know psychological skills something like that maybe the prisons might be you know going to the prisons um you know that they're a little bit further outside of the cities a little bit more effort but if you don't want to do that support the table foundation because we're starting all of these projects where we have the project fatima um where we just hired a life coach all women's life coach to deal with women and their issues in prison and when they get released because they have a totally different uh jihad when they come when they come out of out of prison they have their struggle is different it's actually harder everything i'm talking about when you deal with the women it's even harder and they need specialized care specialized care so that's that's just a few suggestions i know we're running out of time you spoke a little about the the onus on the masjids yeah and so i think that's two part one is to support the incarcerated brothers and sisters the other is when they are released making sure that they feel welcome and supporting them outside so with i'll just speak personally about mcc what we've been doing is you know sponsoring dates either we have a banquet at some of the prisons pelican bay state prison the chaplains reach out to us we do drives so we collect items from our congregation bhs tapes cassettes qurans books that they're not reading anymore that are in the house and we reach out to the prisons and ask them where what they need and then we just send it to them that's what we've been doing so those are some maybe some thoughts from other budgets that might be listening i think um how do we then make them feel welcome when they come to our masjid because when we're talking about supporting our uh incarcerated brothers and sisters we're waiting for them to reach out to us and ask for us a cat ask for helping them uh reach out uh you know find an apartment but beyond that we're not really we're really passive we're waiting for them to come to us how can we be more proactive right yeah this is a big one uh because munir the um you know there are i i can i just give you an example um i just i just you know brother just came home from prison he was in florida but he was a table student he came back to southern california and you know we always you know we have a we have re-entry services so i told him i'm going to meet you here at this time um i went there um there were some muslims there and uh you know he had some tattoos on his neck and on his hand and things like that you know and um but you know he was a table student a serious table student you know you know and studied the dean um for the short amount of time that he's muslim i was very very impressed at his level of knowledge i really was the brother you know i kind of know him a little bit so he was more warm with me salam alaikum how are you doing everything and shaking my hand when it when he came time to shake the other brother's hand and he was white he was very standoffish right and when he shook his hand it was almost like he really didn't want to shake his hand and it hurt me to watch it it hurt me to watch it and the reason why is because number i knew that the brother was hurt by it this he he has just come home after being in prison for six years this is his maybe second or third interaction with a muslim since he's been home because he took he took shahada in prison and there was no warmth in that interaction there was no warmth and that's the first thing i would say just be warm [Music] just be warm this is from the sunnah of the messenger of allah and some of his companions before they became muslim committed more heinous crimes than some of these brothers and sisters right there there they had there have most of most of the drug crimes most of the brothers and sisters you're going to find is related because it's connected to poverty right it's connected to poverty so they sell drugs to try to make money and the black and brown communities are heavily policed they're overcharged over sentenced and so then they go away for a decade a half a decade two decades they become muslim they've made their taubah but that spirit of tawba is not running through our communities we're not looking at them as they made tawba as if islam is not transformative right like there's no you know like we've all there are some muslims who are doing things it might not be illegal but it's still a sin it's still haram and maybe and even in a muslim country it may get you a jail sentence but just because you're in america you didn't get a jail sentence but because he did something that got him a jail sentence he's untouchable she's untouchable that's a bad representation on islam when for all everything that they've been studying is that islam is all about forgiveness but it's not reflected in the community this just happened this happened this the scenario i just told you about just happened maybe five weeks ago just maybe five weeks ago so it's fresh in my memory and that has been the story many many brothers and sisters they have that story i just i wasn't welcome i didn't feel welcome so even before the resources even before the resources just let them know that they are human being that they are accepted into the community what can i do for you what what do you need now every community might not have the resources to you know hire someone or appoint someone to just deal with brothers and sisters that come to the masjid or you know they might be converts somebody converts it and they need it and they need help um somebody came home from prison and they need help but every community should have someone that they can call to say hey this brother just showed up here today and or this sister just showed up here today just got out of prison or just took their shahada and they need to know how to plug in they need to know where to get these different resources from i think that's the least that every single community can do find someone who does this work and have his number on speed dial have her number on speed dial somebody shows up at the masjid somebody shows about ta leave somebody shows up you know somewhere oh i yeah i got this number i got to know somebody we can help you i think that's the least and the other things that you're talking about that's very advanced very very few communities have that like you said um you know the food drive you know the the the book drive and the videotape drive and things like that to me that's very very advanced masha allah may allah bless you all i just hope that that's accompanied by the understanding the empathy that's needed when people come home because it that's that's needed it's it's needed you know it's needed they already felt they they already feel like look i did my time i yeah i did what i did but i did my time and and and not only that but i became muslim but i'm being treated like an outcast all right i can get more love in the neighborhood i can go through the neighborhood i'm an og now i did 10 years in prison i can go in the neighborhood and everybody's going to say oh he's og now he's an original gangster now he comes to the masjid he gets no love that's bad that's very bad we're running out of time with uh we have some questions from our live viewers but before i get to that um i just really wanted to ask you you know covet has affected so much of our daily life um you know majits just living in a community there's so much loneliness and i think there's a parallel there for the loneliness that our brothers and sisters have in prison uh we've kind of become isolated in our own houses and we have this greater empathy hopefully for that but i really wanted to ask i uh what's how's coving affecting our incarcerated brothers and sisters are they able to congregate are are they able to meet each other and community covet was devastating for the muslim community the incarcerated muslim community was devastating no visits very few phone calls because you're locked down 22 23 hours a day because you know they're trying to stop the spread of covet we've had a couple of table students that were very very sick we had a table student who passed away it was devastating it was devastating so what we tried to do is you know just reach out to the brothers and sisters that were contacting us either through mail or through email or some of them actually call us on the phone and we just try to give them moral support um but yes it was it was devastating it was devastating it was worse and in there than out here because you have to be locked down in a cell when you're used to going out to sale you can go outside you can go to the yard and work out or whatever you can take shower whenever you want to take a shower things like that go to commissary get the food that you want um but after you know covet hit you're locked down 22 23 hours a day you can't use the phone because you're locked down um you know you can't order what you want from commissary you you're not getting any visits you're um you know it's hard it was it was it was devastating i can go on and on and on but it was devastating it was devastating for the muslim community there which is another reason why they need moral support and i'll bring these uh so i was gonna ask you last question we're less than a month away from ramadan ramadan is coming up tell us about what ramadan is liking prison tell us about the struggles and i imagine there's some opportunities because you're able to uh gather in community when at least before covet um so tell us about what it's like to be muslim during ramadan in prison uh so like i mentioned earlier you know you know islam has a greater influence in prison than the numbers reflect and ramadan is one of those times now what i'm going to say can can differ depending on the prison but i was in the federal system and that's one thing that i can say about the federal system is that they are sticklers for rules and regulations um if you have a gripe and you have a religion especially a religious gripe um they take it very very seriously and you can get recourse in the federal uh system in the federal you know before federal judge if you know you can prove that your rights have been violated so you know the chaplain is the one who has to arrange everything with the security so the chaplain will make sure that you wake up for support that you get the bags that you're supposed to get um um you know that you can that you can go to the kitchen in the morning for for uh for for sahor that you that you get a hot meal for iftar um in the federal system it was fairly easy we had a few run-ins i remember one time they tried to service pork that is always a challenge at the state level it's a little bit harder okay um you know you they want to give you um you know like a cold dinner you know you've been fasting all day and they just want to give you a sack lunch because they don't want you to have access to the kitchen that's always a hard time for ramadan for muslims nationwide um and then many times that because the chaplain doesn't know islam and he doesn't have anybody from the outside who is helping him to know islam um he doesn't know to go and tell prison staff on days that pork is served you don't serve the muslims pork or you don't serve them something else that may be forbidden and so it happens it happens you know when the guards come and they bring you you know you this sack lunch it's a ham sandwich what are you supposed to do with that you've been fasting all day many of the inmates are indigent they've got 56 cent on their account they can't go and buy tuna from commissary you know macro or anything like that they cherish what comes in those paper bags some days it's peanut butter and jelly some days it's it's you know um you know uh cheese and mayonnaise or you know something like that um it can be very very difficult for muslims uh during ramadan um which you know drives home the point that we just need more support because if you had someone to be able to call the chaplain's office and say ramadan is coming here's a guide for for ramadan in prison or here is um you know if you have any questions call us at this number you know the chaplain used to come to me the chaplain because we had the second largest community in prison the chaplain wanted to do his job but he could not find muslims in either savannah or jacksonville that were willing to come and provide services and each one of these communities was only one hour away from the prison one hour away and there was nothing i could tell him what could i what do i tell him right because he has to corroborate everything that i'm telling him with somebody on the outside he has to corroborate it and and but you know we couldn't get any support we couldn't get any support and that that shows up in ramadan and it hits it has a double effect has a double effect so it can be it can be very very difficult it can be it can be and i'll bring you i certainly understand what you're saying uh in my home state of missouri uh the masjid we would get uh calls in desperation from the local chaplain who's just trying to do his job uh and support the new muslims uh there and then here in california i see the same exasperated emails and messages coming from the local chaplains that we do need to do better we do better better because they're they're the chaplains are generally trying to serve their muslim inmates uh but they just cannot find the support from a large community so thank you for all that let's get to some questions that we're getting from um the uh our live viewers so we have one um that has come in uh this is from lukaman he took his jihad two weeks ago um and he says uh can i get any tips on myself i just converted islam i have two good friends which are who are muslim but they still go out and party and drink alcohol and go out with girls it's really difficult for me to change they are good friends of mine but it makes it hard for me can you help me out can you please uh help me out with my situation it's not necessarily specific to a prisons but it certainly is to the effect that um you know all of us face right you know like this is um you know i mean it's it's going to be specifically hard right now because of kovit but i you know if if if it was you know any other time i would tell him to up there if he's up there in the bay area i would tell him to get in contact with an organization called the ta'alief initiative that's one of the things that they specialize in you know just making a space for new muslims um that have you know a variety of backgrounds and just taking them step by step that's what i would tell him um you know um but as far as there is there is a test i don't want to make it like all this problems can be solved simply because you go and you find a different community there's going to be a test with changing you know your life becoming muslim and trying to do better you're going to be tested and it's going to make you a stronger muslim it's going to make you you know um you may find you know that you are even stronger than many muslims that you run into and then you know and be gracious be grateful to allah for that favor because you may find that you're the one who has to help 10 others later on down the line that are just like you that's what that's that's in in a nutshell that's what i would say about that you know try to find out you know what the brothers are doing at leaf initiative if he's in the bay area um and also have the understanding you know mean that we're all going to be tested we're all going to be tested it just so happens that your test is with other muslims who are not setting a good example don't condemn them you know don't think you know don't have the attitude of holier than thou you know you know perhaps perhaps they'll see you and change uh invisible asks us assalamu alaikum brother i have a whole bunch of stuff to offer but with my limited uh resources i would just like to send some hijab some miss walks some quran some does base to the prison how can i help please so this goes back to our earlier question there's well-meaning people out there they just don't know how to how to do this i mean can we just send the stuff to the prison and just get the address off google and just send it there or where else it's like that no no it doesn't work like that um you have to um you know there is an organization down here in southern california that's doing something like that it's called link outside and what that's one of the things that they do they send um korans into the prisons you know they they they have you know a brother that's going into the prisons that takes like liquor beads and things like that um and he visits different prisons around you know um around southern california um he would be the one that i would say get in contact with him um the or name of the organization is link outside and they you know they that's something that they do and we in table we actually work with them um you know to provide different services and things like that um so that's what i would say this is somebody who's in california i would tell them contact link outside the brother's name is amin ashakir and um he's he's kind of doing that work those are the questions from our live viewers uh we just have a few minutes before we'll be closing inshallah but i do want to just really quickly start i don't want to uh close out without asking this because when deva approached mcc about this they they gave us the title the sahaba behind bars and uh for those of us who don't have experience with the penal system and the title is just interesting when you think of the sahabah where these are tried true uh companions of our dear prophet saw some who struggled and suffered how does that become for the for the brothers and sisters in prison explain that title to us the sahaba behind bars right so alhamdulillah um you know alhamdulillah you know sheikh rami you know he he kind of coined this term uh based on the similarities between the tests and trials of the companions of the messenger of allah salah and the tests and trials of muslims who are incarcerated what are those parallels what are those what are those similarities um number one based upon everything that i just told you there's really not that much of an incentive for people who are incarcerated to become muslim not materially okay it's the same exact situation at the companions of the messenger of allah that they had they believed in allah they believed in the messenger of allah they believed in the day of judgment but to accept islam was sometimes to accept a death sentence it's like that it's like that when somebody becomes muslim in prison their parents sometimes shun them their wives husbands divorce them they get cut off from their money sources um you know they are they're isolated from their children i can tell you story after story after story that this has happened they're doing it because they actually believe in allah they believe in the messenger of allah and they find that islam is transformative but materially there's nothing in it for them just like there was nothing in it for the companions at the meccan stage there was nothing in it for them right they would lose their wealth they would lose their they would lose their lives some of them they were chased out of mecca you know and they had to seek refuge in east africa and abyssinia and these are some of the same experiences that that muslims have when they become muslim um and they're incarcerated like i said their families are non-muslim they're even if the families want to support them they don't know how to support them there's no resources you're joining a muslim community in prison is you're you're going to be cut off from the world pretty much your religious community you when you watch the news you're it's your community that's being castigated for a long time muhammad allah has changed because of you know everything that's happening now with white nationalism and stuff like that but for a long time every night on the news we had to bear that in prison this is what islam is this is what muslims do and we had to bear that and not you know and you know there was nothing materially in it for us and then you've got to go you accept islam you got to go tell your parents right who or your family members your wife whoever oh yeah i'm muslim now and they're watching the same stuff that you're watching there's nothing in it so there's these there's these connections there's these um you know there's these parallels that you can strike between what the sahaba experience in the meccan phase becoming muslim and what muslims who are incarcerated

motivation for training it when they face it everybody but me sucks yes yeah that's great analysis that you don't Jimmy hammock it sucks 32 Franklin is on top here I do believe this has happened down in the top here for anything else is there no inference potentially dangerous new stuff rather than riding high they're gonna stop that is potentially dangerous all right John and then once again on top Jeremy or tries to roll gets in cue points reversal and he doesn't it is for access all I can say is yeah I stepped up today very impressive please do not affiliated with just because they have high prices and they don't have this good food as whole foods market what I like little oh yes if you go to the fire right looks like rude man and I am in fact he is like Jeremy og content to write it

oyster beds are were when we took it over we're fringed by Neil deGrasse you know when we started 2009 there was lots of grass in those little tidal channels is surrounded the oyster beds and elsewhere also all throughout the day and it slowly disappeared and nobody really knows why yeah it's it's a mystery and I think that people at the yesterday program are working on it the oysters play a critical role in keeping the bay clean because they're filter feeders and so they're big pump a lot of water through their systems and they are feeding on phytoplankton which are the small single-celled plants cells in the water we don't feed or put anything in the water except the baby oysters and their protective touches yes I love working with yesterday program i'm a proud mutt myths

they would be after a bit choices are protected in these tops mesh pouches that protect them for predators things are getting better there's much more awareness of water quality issues in the bay people are doing more to protect the water quality we have a sewer treatment plan going in and Losos and we have people are picking up after this path now boat owners are being taught to make sure that they don't dumped into the bay and then keep it clean and so there's much more awareness of water quality keeping the beige weed and the national asteroid program has been huge in promoting that

southern coastline of Maine. Jutting out into the waters of Casco Bay, Portland is one of those special cities whose history and people have long been shaped by the sea. It\u2019s a city whose character has also been forged\nby fire. Native American raiders burnt the first English\nsettlement to the ground in 1676, and returned with the French fourteen years later\nto torch it once again. In 1775, British warships set the city ablaze, and in 1866, a Fourth of July firecracker\nset off an inferno, which left thousands homeless. But this is a city that refused to lie down, and today Portland is one of the most dynamic, and livable small metros in the USA. Part of the city\u2019s great charm is\nits working waterfront. Amble down Commercial Street and spend a few hours drifting around\nthe many wharves and piers. Relax with a craft beer and lobster roll\nas fishermen unload their daily catch, wooden ships set sail to nearby islands, and cargo ships glide out to far-off ports. Follow the salty breezes through the streets\nand lanes of the historic port district, where the currents of past and future eddy amid the old fish-packing plants and\nlocomotive factories of yesteryear. It was here that Portland\u2019s faithful raised\ntheir finest churches, and where the city\u2019s ship builders and merchants\nbuilt their stately homes. Spend an hour or two touring the ornate rooms\nof Victoria Mansion, the summer home of 19th century hotelier,\nRuggles Sylvester Morse. In 1940 this Italianate brownstone was almost demolished to make way for a gas station. Thankfully common sense prevailed and\nthe historic home and most of its original interiors were saved. Time also stands still at the historic home\nof Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of America\u2019s most beloved poets. See the hobbyhorse young Henry rode\ninto imaginary worlds, and the desk where the poet honed his lines, many inspired by the woodlands and wharves\nof Portland. Head west along Congress Street to the Arts District, an area teeming with creative enterprises. At the centre of it all is\nthe Portland Museum of Art. Starting life in 1908 at McLellan House, over the decades the collection swelled and\nnew buildings were added. Just like Longfellow, many of the artists whose works feature here\nwere inspired by the Portland\u2019s coastline, including one of the giants of American art, Winslow Homer. In Portland, the ever-present cry of gulls\nis a reminder that the sea is never far away. Head east along Congress Street \nto Eastern Promenade, visionary parklands that have provided Portlanders\nwith a place to stretch their legs and\ntake in the Atlantic breezes since 1836. Over the centuries, \nPortland has been of great strategic importance, and the coastline once bristled with cannon. Cross the mouth of the Fore River to South Portland and peer through the gun ports of\nHistoric Fort Preble, which saw service from the Civil War,\nright up until the 1950s. Just below the fort is the Spring Point Ledge Light, one of the smaller and more unusual of Maine\u2019s\n57 active lighthouses. While just a few miles south on Cape Elizabeth, stands one of New England\u2019s most beautiful,\nPortland Head Light. Commissioned by George Washington in 1791, the lighthouse has been home to many characters, including one lighthouse keeper\u2019s parrot\nwho would screech as bad weather approached, \u201cStart the horn, start the horn, fog rolling in\u201d. The lighthouse is part of Fort Williams Park, where you\u2019ll find even more historic defenses, as well as the eerie ruins\nof the old Goddard Mansion. Once you start exploring this coastline,\nit\u2019s very easy to just keep on going. Around every headland there\u2019s a new beach,\nbay, state park or town, places that beckon paddlers, anglers, seadogs\nand dreamers, and those happy to simply soak up the colours\nand scents of New England. Seven miles south of Portland is Scarborough, where families have been returning to sleepy\nhavens like Higgins Beach for generations. From here, let the bend of Saco Bay\nsweep you further south to the neat-as-a-pin-town of Saco. At the local museum, learn about the little mill town that became\na textile giant that helped dress the nation in style. Right at Saco\u2019s front door is\nFerry Beach State Park, 100 acres of trails, \ntupelo trees and time-stopping vistas. And if you\u2019re dreaming of a little salt-weathered, old-school, New England perfection, drop anchor at Cape Porpoise. Once you\u2019ve come this far, it\u2019s hard to resist the impossibly pretty docks and historic ship-builder\u2019s homes of Kennebunkport. A long-time favourite with US Presidents, this resort town serves up some of the best eating, classiest shopping, \nand most beautiful coastlines in Maine. On your way back to Portland, be sure to grab a ticket, and take a ride at the Seashore Trolley Museum, the largest collection of streetcars in the world. A visit here is more than just a ride, it\u2019s\na tribute to craftsmanship, engineering-know-how, and a time when\npeople stopped to talk to strangers. Portland, Maine, is very much a tribute\nto those ideals too, for this is a place where life is as it should be. It\u2019s a place where history, nature, creativity\nand community are in tune, creating more than just a city,\nbut a song by the sea.", "ZYEQi3_2pPA": "come to do here at the Norman Rockwell Museum

it's a nice campground I I kind of like our spot even though we're just off of a road it it's has a fair amount of traffic you see it pretty regular and there's some houses around us elegant site we don't like the beach as much as what they call p9c fact and seaside are homey beats this is take - I forgot seaside on the first day - cuz it's rocky any so you don't walk in this a misstep Long Beach and seaside was both pretty nice but we got to go up into Canada coming into Canada coming in too high okay you got your hands full Washington is not about them I'm saying very dry with you today yes are you filming me sir yeah can I not do that it's it pretty up here probably the best thing so far as Lisa brought up Josh and Jarrod last weekend for a couple days and that was a lot of fun they came up from Longview let me show you here on the map and I think it's a couple hundred bucks pretty long I'm surprised it is take that trip but it's pretty long a long view up to Seattle and in the birch Bay Blaine is the name of town and they came up we Lisa doing this exercise thing was she walking they walking off dinner we had our spaghetti and we're headed to the ocean with the lady because I like walking with the ladies and in her summer break and so she wanted to have a hundred miles in before they left to go home which would put her at the end of July and so both nicely she was here we went on a walk a three-mile walk with her it was pretty good walk she's got a pretty good faith so we enjoyed that I have to admit since she's been gone we haven't got three miles in we get maybe a half or three-quarters of a mile I think so we got to do something about that worked on the bicycles a little bit but we went up to Canada had a good time and barbecued some steaks have some spaghetti make some s'mores have campfire both nights and I had a small each night I think Perlmutter has two one that was pretty good Lisa puts Reese's Peanut Butter Cup came with a marshmallow and they're pretty good but one little one I didn't have one grandma Josh said no fire starter and then and then wood fire and that's all matches imagine a very good that's all you needed what we needed and it looks like it's gonna be a good fire so fire fire [Laughter] thanks guys when we went up to Canada we were going to go over to Vancouver Island but it looked like the schedule is going to be a little tough to get there and back in one day so we didn't do that we just went to Vancouver but an interesting thing that Lisa pointed out is there is once you go into Canada you go up to Vancouver then if you go towards the coast and come on down there's a place called Richard Richards point and it's just a tip of a little Peninsula off of Canada but the bottom like five miles of it is Washington State the only way to get there by Road or get out of there by Road is to go through Canada you can obviously can fly in or take a boat in but uh but it's kind of unique there's not much there there's a look like some golf courses and a couple of marinas and a lot of nice houses on the beach but if we didn't see much town too much stores and much tourist stuff so I'm not sure who live there or wine but that was pretty interesting we got to go there we didn't we got more questions than answers but uh here up in Canada and one a little taste of America you got a Richards point what rich [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so when you go to get your part 107 license take that test probably half of the test is over our space and reading sectional maps where there's a lot of it but the main thing they want to make sure is you we don't have to follow the Hobby rules we got our own set of rules and they're assuming we're smart enough to stay at we can figure out where restricted our space is and we're obstacles and stuff are an example right here's where we're at birch Bay we're camped right up here about where this 3 is and then here's some restricted airspace coming into some big Airport up in Canada and it's restrictive down to 2500 feet so we only fly 400 so I knew that wasn't it it was a non-event here's some more over here here's our having an airshow but that's 10 miles or so away got aerial demonstrations I'm not sure what it is but it's from the circus let's run up but it's too far away so I don't have to worry about that but you looked all clear this you know we're going to fly just a couple of miles within this circle here and we're okay so well josh is blind he flew around here he wanted to fly over so we're right up in here he wanted to cut across to this Bay right up above us probably three miles away and I said Josh go ahead and I watched him a little bit and then I was messing with Jerry talking about some stuff and all of a sudden he said grandpa what is that you can see in the video worried he kind of turned the drone away he said what is this I took it from our hand to me and I turned it back around and you can see antennas just all around it's a regular antenna field till we got turned around and got out of there we didn't do any damage but it was the closest that I've ever come to and I and I learned a good lesson to start I

sauntering from one Marsh to another and stunning on lookers nearby it was just our inspiring kristi Buckley was just wrapping up a morning hike with her husband Sean when the Gator started to move that's them right there lying on the ground capturing these still pictures from the other angle and yes he's just as big from that side too so my husband and I are calling him Godzilla because that's kind of what he looked like going across the path yeah crossing so slowly his feet flopping with every step and that tail dragging long behind he's so prehistoric looking he's he's amazing and before you start calling this a fake talk to the regulars at Circle B the estimated 13 to 15 foot Gator even has a name and it's been around here for decades the big hump back is what everybody's call him his back is a little bit higher up than normal so check this out normally Circle B is a pretty quiet park not today everyone's heard about that Gator and actually making up their own parking spot just to get a peek we live nearby and we come out here but we came out today because of that the trails on this protected sprawling piece of land is a hotspot for hikers and photographers because you never

of people's boats i break anything todd i'm gonna break it all break anything i'm gonna break it all okay so we're gonna go out we're just gonna fish for anything really i asked him he asked me what i wanted the fish for and i said triple tail what else did i say triple tail kobe permit cobia no no no i said triple tail kingfish and and goliath grouper yeah yeah there you go we put something together for you we'll catch a gag and you call it a guy that's a little guy good job i'm gonna be a northerner today oh man [Music] dad's dad's already yelling at the sun don't put the pockets on the bar we are out at the skyway getting ready to catch bait i heard bait is starting to kind of move into the bay uh at some of the deeper markers and stuff we just ran out here because we're gonna probably do a little bit of snapper fishing and stuff and and uh but so we ran out this way um so bait should be pretty easy from what they were telling me i haven't been out in a couple weeks god it's crazy you know what seasick dead are you no not yet but anyway let's see what we can do i don't have to throw the net today but caleb is getting ready to throw the talon cast net 10 foot 3 8 that's what they wanted so that's what i got him yeah you're good there's a lot of beat right there good [Music] oh yeah you know oh of course you got it oh we won uh we want some dead bait today yeah so no matter who throws the net the talon cast that is going to catch you bait that is the 3 8 inch net and it caught him bait first throw [Music] i'd i would have caught a lot more but what's that supposed to mean it don't get much more open than that no you opened it really well see we're fortunate enough now that the tide really isn't ripping that hard so we're able to set up outside i didn't really want to show them my trick of how i do things so um we're set up on the outside catching bait let's see if we can catch more the the talonnet is so good that the father and son are fighting over who's going to throw it next he won i want to throw it no i want to throw it okay go ahead and throw it old man old man gave it up quick yeah yeah i felt that in the shoulder it's not the net it's the shoulder trust me yeah i know why do you think i throw that 1.3 all the time all we've been doing is putting out a steady chum the tide is really starting to slow down trying to determine if we're going to go and snapper fish really quick with this tide slowing down like it is and then once it picks back up we'll go in shore and fish in shore [Music] look at that pretty much i think i got a couple he's like i think we're ready to go fishing i'm just now getting into catching bait so caleb what do you think of the talon castnet i love it good and you're not just saying that to be nice to me right oh man nobody cares about being nice i don't know maybe i love it because he loves it and that means i don't know how to throw the net right see now now caleb is using the the triple load method see how wet he is that's the smell that i'm smelling doesn't it seem like it throws bigger than a 10. yeah doesn't it but i think why is because you don't get that comb in the center like you get with a lot of them that spring open and spring back yeah you're actually getting the full 10. it just doesn't it yeah it lays out flat it just when i first started throwing it and i'm not saying this because that's my neck but when i started throwing it the first time i looked at chad and i said it just seems like it throws bigger than than a 10-footer i mean a lot of good have to go through a break-in period a lot of times this one's out of the package and that's right yeah they're stretching i gave it todd love oh wow i don't know how you're giving that toddler and folks just like that we are ready to fish get him up you gotta tighten that drag he's gonna get you you can hear him in you can hear it you can hear it oh oh dude you got a man now folks this is what happens when you don't tighten your drag down you get worked oh you got another one on i'm used to fishing for snook man little guy snap snapper okay so what what these guys don't um we were just discussing this we were talking about trolling motors and how it's up my game and everybody has seen my frustrations with with the trolling motor and and there's not a perfect motor out there there's just not it's just not going to happen so but what it did for us is it totally changed the game for us for chad and i to where we went from 25 waypoints to over 930 inside the skyway from the little manatee river to the skyway so it just it just don't do it it just goes to show you that um we are anchored we are on anchor we are on the edge of the ledge out here in the main shipping channel so you can find spots that you can anchor up on and we were just discussing this and they have a side imaging on their on their machine and and shannon was like man he says i just don't use my side imaging like i should and i just don't really take the time to to really learn it so what i did is i kind of gave him a little bit of a demonstration of what to look for and you could see the light bulb go off in his head and he was like oh my god finally yeah i mean it clicked immediately and what what i'll do is he's got a garmin so we're gonna go over his machine because it's different than the hummingbird but i was able to show him how i approach when i'm fish when i'm looking for my structure even though i knew where we were at and i knew what structure was down there i wanted him to see exactly what i was looking at and why i approach it the way i approach it so we'll definitely get into that because i get a lot of questions and a lot of people asking can i do more on electronics and now that we have a different machine on this boat that's exactly what we're going to do well i i actually started doubting my machine watching your videos and stuff like that because it's not it's not the highest quality machine it's a good machine i mean the side imaging is really good on it and um i just so it's it's a good machine you just got to um you've got to understand it know how to use it right and and you know when you're doing a lot of inshore fishing like you guys do yeah you don't really you don't depend on your electronics right in that aspect when you're fishing for snoke reds and trout but when i show you this and we go over it you'll have a different look even when you're going to look at docks in deeper deeper mangroves where you can see the fish laid up in those situations to where you won't even have to guess you just look into that dock and you'll see those fish laid up there it makes sense yeah i mean it makes a lot of sense now oh yeah it's a nicer grip nice on the half ounce stewie decent fish look at his nose all raked up scratched up that's nice right there i almost did he almost got you again i i almost i almost stuck my finger my finger in his mouth like i was grabbing a red look in there pull the rest of the stewies out of his mouth that you put in there probably up on that rock right now nice fish nice fish buddy light tackle straight back down good and that's what i caught right there look at that thing i'm the blowfish king yeah i think that's a good snapper he's fighting like one of me that's a good fish hurry there i'm getting old and weak old and weak oh is that a big snapper that's a red it's amazing how hard they fight dude i mean he slammed it pretty fish yeah man i mean those are okay what i want to show you guys is when we were coming to the spot i wanted to show shannon the difference of being in the channel and then being on on top of the ledge in shallow water looking down into the channel and what happens is you won't when you're in the channel itself trying to look up the ledge you're not going to see the ledge at all but when you're in shallow water looking down you're going to see the ledge and this is exactly what we're looking at right here this is the edge of the ledge you can see the fish start showing up right here that stupid dolphin's not going to leave us alone so you see the edge of the ledge right here and you see the fish down here we're catching fish but the problem is the dolphin showed up and he's already grabbed one of our good fish that shannon had on so we're gonna probably i don't have the dolphin pinger on the boat today uh so we're gonna run and go to a different spot the bite is really good here but it just it's that dolphin's messy yeah feed and flipper so let's go on to the new spot and we'll show you what we're talking about when we get to this new spot okay this is exactly what i was talking about now that we're down in the channel you don't see the ledge but as soon as we come up the channel i will show you that we're in 42 feet of water 43 so we're going out you see the side imaging kind of spreading out like this so when we go up the channel which you'll see here in a second it will start to get skinnier because the the water column is of course getting shallower and there it goes it's starting to get skinnier and you can see on the machine here that we're going up the ledge and there's the ledge right there and watch as we get up now you start seeing the ledge right there so it's very important that you get up on that skinny side now see that one's an okay ledge so we go along and we start looking for the shadow line so we're seeing very little shadow line there so that's telling me that it's not a very pronounced ledge in the sense of that i want to sit on that spot and fish it all right here's here's one of the the the difficult things when you're trying to anchor especially when you're fishing the main channel like this is what happens is that wind is going one direction and the tide has started to come in so when i got set up i thought we were going to set up perfect on the edge of the ledge well what happened was the boat actually swung out and was sitting perpendicular so we actually had to throw kind of up towards the front of the boat to get on the ledge and we caught some fish but um the boat's just not sitting where i want it so now that i know what our heading is we'll go and get set up on a different spot and get set up right on the heading and then we'll be able to fish the edge of the ledge correctly okay knowing that how the boat is setting up right now with that wind in the tide what i did is i i gotta set up and i think i did a pretty good job now i'm hoping that there's fish here but as you can see on the screen we're right on the edge of the ledge right here and here so there's a bunch of good markings down here so now i'm i'm leaving it up to these two to see if there's any fish here so hopefully there should be i'd be shocked if they don't get bit right away that's not a grunt what you got there shannon oh man probably it might be a speckled trout i don't know he's got a little bit to him i don't want to call it tempo i caught him probably a gag yeah not bread that's not a bad wreck yeah that's a bad one that's a family man yeah it is that's a nice one look at that look down his throat that giant hook hanging out of his throat oh god he does that's probably uh that probably wouldn't be a good one to try to help him out with wouldn't it now he's gonna have to it looks like it's almost in here yeah oh wow he's gonna have to die caleb give me those cars surgery let's see it looks like it's coming out this way look at that what a happy fish yep he's like thanks man good job dude captain shannon it's a fresh hook too yeah it is good deed for the day man good deed for the day got a hood fish nice job nice job well the old man on the boat has to show everybody how it's done i told him i said i'm gonna throw it up here i'm gonna let it drift back and i'm gonna catch one this is like what is it my fourth that's just pity for a senior citizen fourth fish yeah he's all giant but guess what he's better than what y'all are catching oh my god so what we're having to do is we've got the ledge just off to our right here and the tide is coming in pretty good now so we're having to pitch up and let the let the bait roll down but as soon as that bait gets to the bottom those fish are on it and right now we're in the mod or the major feeding time um i don't know what's wrong with them i mean every every bait that i throw out there i get i get a fish so i'm just gonna have to demonstrate it again i'm gonna figure out where i can uh put the camera to show what happened all right just i just i just popped it out there i'm trying to teach kayla how to do this because did you just call your shot it's it's different than what they're what caleb's used to doing yes i just called my shots the babe todd the babe fountain come on don't let me down now oh oh he hit it he's he's hooking his tooth from the nose down yeah i got it exactly not not through the nostrils what you get what you get dude let me get this tied up i still got hit like what didn't seem like what nevermind no you can say it no like it does it doesn't seem like you filmed a lot during the day but you do well i mean it's i i'm very selective of what i do and what i film because if i just film everything it would just get really boring because we because we have 45 minutes long some decent grouper man yes a lot of times if my if i have a if i have a five to ten minute clip that's really long really long um and it's mostly me but typically no if i don't leave it running yeah i just saw the snow oh my god but um oh lord i was just gonna say thanks for taking me out today i was gonna say thanks for showing us around well it was it was both uh it was awesome i'm glad you guys were able to learn something we caught some nice fish yeah yeah yeah yeah flats fish a lot yeah it was a different thing for you i had fun you know right yep look at the size of that one yeah but it was uh it was fun you know it was like yes it was something a little different something different i didn't have to cast right so that was a good problem anyway we had a we had a good time with captain caleb captain shannon over here and i'll put their contact information down below i've fished with them many times so they're really good guys good fisherman they know what they're doing and um you know it's it's that's what it's all about going out with friends having a good time teaching each other something new i hope i was able to do that you guys did something you taught me something new today what was that go ahead say it i got it was a good time it was a good time yeah it was man so anyway i want to appreciate i want to say everybody i want to say thanks to everybody that watch um we again we had a great time if anybody has any questions hopefully you learned something about what we talked about when it comes to side imaging and looking at the sonar that was you know that's something at least using a different machine compared to what i'm used to using um hopefully that kind of gives you guys a better outlook out there so fish more catch more and we'll see you on the flip side", "JIq5JWu4BaA":

parents I'm a former prosecutor having graduated from Hofstra law and gone right into the Nassau County District Attorney's Office I came to work for the office of the town attorney in Oyster Bay a couple of years ago and in February of 2010 I was very honored to be appointed to fill the vacancy left by Rose Walker when she moved to the legislature it has been a thrilling six months I was so humbled to be asked to join the board and serve with a colleague like Supervisor John Candido and the other members of the Town Council I'm so proud to be working hard to continue their legacy of land preservation and building innovative parks and recreation space I know that with your support we are going to enjoy a terrific win on election day and be able to continue the wonderful style of government that we have here in Oyster Bay representing the more than 300,000 residents of this town has been a joy and a pleasure it's terrific to be able to provide a constituent based government

your vote and your support on a beber second you", "Ih-e_0faKQY": "aurilla is tony from base state engines located in the North Shore of Massachusetts and today we're restoring this very beautiful Chrysler 250 horsepower inboard engine now this is actually a Chrysler 340 for those of you in the automotive field that goes by displacement the marine field goes by horsepower whatever it's all the same so today we're gonna be talking about a couple of things before we put the bottom end of this engine together when I'm talking about the orientation of the rod on the crankshaft the orientation of the piston on the rod how to install the piston with the wrist pin and these awesome little spiral locks that are frustrating at all and of course the piston and how it installs into the cylinder itself try not to fall so very first step before we install the Pistons on our connecting rod is to determine which way the connecting we're on faces being is this is a be oriented engine it has two banks of cylinders and two cylinder heads being the Pistons installed in opposite directions on the rod now the rods themselves are also directional they have this little chamfer here located on the inside of the rod we will work that a little closer to you so this chamfer actually faces the outside of the crank pin so if you come over here engine this being connecting-rod one and the very front cylinder being cylinder number one I want the chamfer to face towards the outside edge of the journal should it be flipped around the other way there won't be enough relief here and this will actually drag on the edge of the crankshaft journal and you won't even be able to turn the engine over another thing that was a great piece of information that they gave us and they show us the correct orientation of the Pistons in this engines as a Chrysler 340 so we're using this guy right here towards the front of the engine we see that all the valve reliefs face up we already know this but this is just something to help us not screw up in the future now that we've flipped the engine over you can see the cylinder side of the end shown you which way the rods face in relation to the crankshaft so all of the vod's side Bank rods will be facing the same direction and the Pistons will be facing the same direction and the same goes for the even side Bank Abroad's if you're confused in any way as to how they go might help to mark these or the paint marker that way you don't screw anything up it's completely obvious you can even write on the piston to determine how that goes and we're going to show you how that goes in the block right now so these pistons have valve reliefs this is so that when the valve opens and the piston approaches top dead center there's no contact between these two parts this is known as the quench area is the area behind the valves and this is the flat top of our piston these are going to install this way and on the other side of the block they're going to install exactly the opposite way so we're going to be installing these onto the rods in relation to the crankshaft now that we have the piston properly oriented on the rod and the risk pen installed we're gonna go ahead and install these quite frustrating spiral locks some larger pistons tend to use two spiral locks known as a dual spiral lock luckily this engine only uses one now the idea behind this is it's bigger than the bore that the risk pen sits in but this is going to provide tension towards the piston holding the wrist pin into place preventing it at any engine speed from coming out in theory personally I think the spiral locks are kind of overkill I've never seen a regular wrist pin lock fly out but life is long so we'll see if we can come across that in the future what I'm doing here I'm using my thumb nail to separate the lowest part of the spiral lock from the rest we will end up having to stretch the whole assembly out like this to get it into place but try not to go too crazy because if you do damage this you will have to find another so I'm gonna go ahead and just barely get the lowest edge of the spiral lock into the groove using my pocket pry bar make sure it's in place and once I've gotten it started I'm gonna start to work my way around and spin it in to where it goes this can take some time especially if you've never done it before but once you seem to get it going almost a full revolution from there on out it seems to get a little bit easier again here this you don't want to force anything you kind of want to just take your time and roll this into place I find that if you have to use more than your fingernail and this pry bar at the very end that you're over doing it just a little bit so I've got most of the spiral walk-in and all we have left is just this one little tabby here so we're gonna get the sand the rest of the way to the point where I can now get the edge of this underneath and pop that in you hear the click and you're done now the piston and rod assembly is almost ready to install we're gonna install the remaining parts of the piston known as the piston ring these are the parts that help the piston seal to the cylinder wall this is gonna be our top compression our middle compression and our oil control ring now only the bottom compression ring has a top side to it maybe with this little divot that divot or letter or whatever is on your piston ring will always face up I hope I'm getting that in focus for you we're gonna start with the lowest ring we're gonna start with our oil control ring the oil control ring is kind of a sandwich setup so that when it is installed on the piston it's gonna look kind of like that this helps to distribute oil on the cylinder wall as the piston travels up and down and lubricate the piston in the cylinder you don't want to overdo it obviously this is known as the oil control ring because it doesn't allow too much oil on the cylinder wall but it is allowing the correct amount of oil in theory so to put this on we're gonna take the wavy part now we're going to install that first luckily this is the most flexible of all the Rings so this should be the easiest one to do whenever you're installing piston rings especially on the end gap that is going in last and be very careful not to damage the side of the piston that will need to be removed if you do create a burr so I don't want these end gaps to line up so here we are there's our end gap put the bottom ring gap all the way over here hopefully get it started done this before I swear and I'm just gonna roll it into place these ones are relatively flexible we're going to snap that in there and then we're going to do the same with our top but again I don't want the end gaps to line up so I am gonna start this one all the way over here there we go there's our oil control ring gonna move on to our lower compression ring once again we're looking for this divot that designates the top of the Ring take this and using our fingernails we're just gonna separate it just enough there is a tool for this I don't typically use them but some people do prefer them they do make it a little bit easier but hopefully only have to do this once every once in a long while so you won't really have to fight with it too much now even though these end gaps are lined up right now I am going to orient them so that they're all obscuring one another as they're installed in the cylinder I'll get to that later right before we lubricate these rings and install the piston just like that we've got all three rings installed on our piston now the piston assembly is ready for installation I'm gonna take this opportunity and put some two cycle engine oil on these piston rings the reason I'm using two-stroke oil is because I want it to burn off right after the engine starts running this is really only there for the initial starting of the engine before I go ahead and the engine starts splashing all the pistons and cylinders with the lube that exists when the engines turning over I'm gonna make sure that that's on all the Rings and in where it needs to be another opportunity I've taken is to orient these Rings correctly hopefully you can see the end gap is one my other end gap is maybe about 180 degrees from the other and then the end gaps on the oil control ring are not lined up with the top two compression rings I'm gonna take a little bit of Lube put on the skirts of the piston help ease our installation a little bit put this most of the way into the cylinder it's gonna go a little further than I want well that's okay and then I have a piston ring compressor this is a Blue Point model I'm actually gonna push the piston up a little bit I'm gonna squeeze this down to grab it and compress all my rings about as far as I think it can go there's really no gap in here for you to fit anything some people use a special piston installation tool I don't necessarily find that to be the best thing I mean it's up to you really I'm gonna hold this rod journal down here to prevent it from hitting the crank and then I'm just gonna use the butt of this and push this in hopefully in one or two nice Bell swoops just like that the piston is located in the bore and we're ready to pick up the rod", "Q6bQbyRHhzA": "welcome back to ultimate Tahoe adventures so a lot of people always ask me where to the locals hang out well if you want to know you need to follow the show with us here today roundhill Pines right on the south shore is one of the most hidden hot spots where all the locals kind of go to

this is beautiful I didn't know I was gonna be ready to bike today yeah on the same bike yeah well this was actually I thought we're gonna write together that was gonna make it more second want me to jump on the back with the pattern you can jump on the handlebar yeah even better so tell me about the idea behind the bikes in the water Texas so on the fight row actually ends right hand our parking lot here Roundhill pines you guys can grab a drink if you want over here it's a beach bar and grill and then we have the water taxi melted you back over to camp richardson is we should grab my crotch like stars so we're gonna take a water taxi over hit the bike trail we're at our bikes back over we're get a little bit exercise we're get a little bit of alcohol and we're get a little bit of fun yep is there a veteran thing in life than that not at all the water taxi service is an ingenious idea you'll find the boat at the end of the long dock and unfortunately they don't allow you to ride the bikes on the dock because I was half tempted to do a buddy hop or something on that boat who attacks anything we want here right I bikes kids a couple caliber horse motorcycles no no not the horsemen motorcycle okay kids no kids around okay okay okay kids are okay he's got tied down right yep I agree we got our bike up very secure with a one bungee strap definitely go is it going not going anywhere probably here is the inside of the boats beautiful inside of the boat bring all your friends good for bachelor parties right you could like bachelor party your way over there taking this boat due west to camp richardson resort that's where we're going to dock up there let's light this baby up I can definitely see the benefit of people wanted to use this water taxi number one is a lot of fun number two you got amazing views and number three you're on the water the captain's and crew make sure that everybody on board is having a good time it is absolutely safe we got the bail though just to warn people is time for dinner the bell broke putting that away for later this water taxi is so convenient another friend of mine Vanessa that actually works for cat versus and resort actually takes it to work so why is it great taking the water taxi well you get to hop on a boat for one you get to be on the lake you get to bring your bike with you you can go and have a drink on either end of town this boat is fast it is taking less than 15 minutes and we have completely crossed the lake so Larry made it made it I love your Lake Tahoe blow out here when you're going that fast on the lake your harley worried about your hair but I do recommend a little extra product a little child in Brooklyn so this is camp richardson resort and we're pulling in so when you're bringing a boat this size into a dock like that you can just put her nose in everybody eventually gets out of your way right Chad's a good pilot though he'll bring us right in the next part of the adventure is we're gonna dock this boat the water taxi that brought us over from Round Hill crank we're gonna jump on another boat yeah why not what's better than one boat Kubo's thank you now we're gonna take the long jaunt to the rumrunner boat are you ready here we go and we're here what's up guys the rumrunner boat is right here that took meal you see that a whole two minutes it took me to get here you guys have room for my bike alright let's go come on lyric all right no it up the boat all the rumrunner you'll find the rubber boat all summer long docked right at campers in resort unless there's a ton of people out having a lot of fun the rumrunner cruise is one of Lake Tahoe's most popular tours everybody does it and it's going to take us around one of the most famous locations on Lake Tahoe Emerald Bay I got Sabrina and her boyfriend Chris we want to thank Chris for buying all the cocktails for this entire trip for everybody even in the captain who's already had about jumping joke in the cast welcome it's all right Chris it's all right Sabrina hustling what's the best part about the river but it we got kayakers cruising around today what a beautiful day we got stand-up paddlers got the beaches are covered and we're out here on the water there's no better place to be then like tom and on the water behind i came from game with you so we're about ten minutes away Avril bank which is honestly everybody goes their own way cuz it's that amazing so now where we're going we're going to go see Michael castle the island in the middle from and it's always better to see those two things with a rubber always well let's go what are we waiting for maybe a rum runner I'm gonna text ahead tell them I'm coming now I've seen too many people enjoying these orange drinks it's time to head downstairs and get one of these babies for myself we got the giant Tahoe Queen right behind us and we're just entering Emerald Bay and you can't go in Emerald Bay without one of these a rumrunner it's actually in the instruction book when you step on the rubber cruiser it's mandatory you have to have a rum runner before you go in Emerald Bay what do we been doing what's in this baby this has three kinds of rum and we add another floater of room to the top that's good that's good gotta try it later so what's look up what do we got in here we got rum rum and more rum exactly it's a secret recipe so I can't tell you exactly what's in it I love secrets so what's in it again alcohol yeah it's in it it's in my kind of cup do with a lid how many drinks are in that machine right there right now probably 10 I'm not leaving until I drink all 10 of them you'll be able to take the boat yeah you got me here for longer than that not until I get all 10 of those I'm gonna empty that machine actually this machine get one first though this is a it's got an empty the machine ready but mine on his down okay a great part about the rumrunner is that you actually get to meet some new and interesting friends like these guys from Texas what's up fellas ladies Texas no texas longhorns fan yeah we go Oh Aggies fan I'm say it up right I'll get to Texas very much where people don't will be here we gotta to stay here forever I'm from the UK from England and we're here on the rumrunner cruise in beautiful Lake Tahoe it's my first time here and and it's it's jaw-dropping it's stunning every time you turn the corner there's something beautiful a mountain the Blue Lake win emerald bay right now and the pretty special place you could come in in many different ways we've been in our boats before but coming in on the river cruise you're actually getting like you're able to experience it from so many different ways we come to the front of the bow then you can see it for 50 feet away its back is it a 50 feet I kind of Miss just so you remember how good our experience was with the hot in tahoe sports missing and they can actually catch fish anywhere they want actually catch up this right here at em obey oh got the net out don't horse it don't horse it but that's it don't let that guy get your fish oh that thing was a little guy there's only one person on the boat that I haven't met yet and that's the captain so I headed over the control deck or whatever they call it to meet captain scooter we got a cap scooter up here at the helm how you doing man good are you it's what amazing trip what a nice day huh beautiful now you get to do this all the time all day and are they ever done is scooter has to look at that all day long not bad on not a bad job what's your favorite part about reading the rubber recruits Oh probably just meeting all the different people you know you meet people from everywhere you know all over the place and you know we get some pretty interesting stories and in the course coming to Emerald Bay the beauty getting out on the water and yeah it's just a great place to be how long you been doing this I've been with the company 20 years we've been doing this boat for about five years now five seasons well we're gonna get screw a little break we're gonna bring in our backup captain here all right Zach come on come on Zach yeah take it up and bring it over a 50-foot bone in the hands of a ten-year-old let me hear a low level stand correctly all right Zach keep a straight narrow its girl get your cocktail all right thank you sir Zach how you doing pretty good you guys drive the boat paper straight now hey watch how to think in fact for ya what's a big goodbye a vegan buck is this right here good for three dollars at the begin rescue can use it on food or alcohol they have excellent calamari and more runners well since we are going to have lunch there this is gonna be perfect perfect i get to know just mine sorry there's a hard bargain take

Video that\nshows a murder that the guards apparently\ndid not notice. Tashauna Reid is here\nwith the story and the video that you will\nsee for the first time. What does it show\nus, Tashauna? Well, it's pretty\ndifficult to watch, Heather. This is the case of\n32-year-old Anthony George who is now serving\na life sentence for the death of his\ncellmate Adam Kargus. And this new video was\nordered released by a judge and shows Kargus\nbeing beaten and choked by his cellmate\nin his cell. The two of them\nare locked together in that particular cell that we just had\na circle around. And then you see a jail\nguard actually walking by at one point\nin this video and checking to see that\nall the doors are locked. But inside that\nparticular cell-- so, there's that moment\nwe're talking about-- but inside that cell as\nhe's walking by George can be seen through\nthe window punching and kicking and stomping\nand choking Kargus. So inmates at this time\nalso were bragging-- sorry, banging\nand yelling on their own cells, but then at this point\nthe next morning, George actually drags\nthe body from the cell. And as you can see, many\ninmates around without jail guards\ntaking notice and he leaves the body\nin the shower area which is a common area\nfor all of the inmates. So this video was taken\nfrom a security camera from one of\nthe common areas, but as you can see,\na lot happening here. And it shows that George\nover the days that they had obtained\nthe footage, it shows George\nphysically interacting with Kargus on six\ndifferent occasions and on four of\nthose occasions, he actually puts Kargus\ninto a chokehold. And I want to show you\na still image, as well. There's only one at one\npoint do we see guards actually intervening and as you can see,\nhe's holding him in a chokehold. So George was scheduled\nfor trial in particular for this-- this case, but pled guilty\njust three weeks before the trial\nwas set to begin and is now serving\nthis life sentence. So life sentence,\nwhat were the repercussions for the jail\nwhere this happened? Well, of course, I mean,\nthere were a lot of questions as to why\nthese two inmates who clearly had issues were even in the same\njail cell together. George is also a known\nviolent offender. Now, the court\nactually heard from a nurse who said that she\nsuspected that he might have been under the\ninfluence of alcohol that same night and that was\nactually fact because George\nadmitted in court that he was\nunder the influence, that he had\nbeen drinking what is called\njailhouse brew, or what is commonly\nknown as jailhouse brew, which is\nan alcoholic concoction that some of\nthe prisoners make. He also smoked\na cigarette that was laced\nwith drugs. So she had\nflagged that and reported it\nto guards, but instead\nthe guards decided to deal with the issue\nthe next day and then it\nwas too late. They said it was because\nof a staffing shortage. Now, another question\nis why guards did not respond\nto the beating. There were a number\nof different alter-- or interactions between\nthese two inmates that were caught on\na closed circuit camera and that beating also\nlasted for about an hour with the inmates\nmaking noise. So a lot of questions as\nto what the guards did and did not do during\nthis particular case. The judge ordering this\nvideo to be released so people can see \nthe fuller picture. Heather: All\nright Tashauna, thank you very much.", "d7YnMVgLAAY": "[Music] it's a crazy little world they're all living [Music] but you know we'll find a way [Music] watch your tv don't spread the infection around the pandemic has shut down our great nation some say we need to wear masks to the title infection others deny there's a virus at all and masks do not help which side are you on tonight anita man will delve into this topic and how it affects our community of dogtown bay live from docktown bay channel 2 this is kovd news you'll get it here first i'm anita mann with the nationwide shutdown due to the virus outbreak safety mandates have been introduced by health officials in order to slow the spread wearing masks in public spaces has been an idea that is rapidly catching up japan has been doing it for years with just the cold and flu will it work with a more aggressive virus with contradicting information out there members of our community have joined the debate with us today is edna crabtree a retired elementary school teacher [Music] hi anita thank you for having me on your lovely show and mo fishburn vietnam veteran and kitchen cook at the cluckin chuck um yeah hi we sell fried chicken and corn i don't have a lot of time for chit chat so hurry it up i've got a long shift ahead of me my break is only 15 minutes uh yes mo are you standing in an alley yeah you wouldn't see me doing this while i'm frying up some chicken would you you couldn't hear me over the grease popping you know what that's what makes it taste so good grease fat is flavor so edna with this current debate about masks and whether or not we should wear them what's your take on the situation well anita i think wearing masks is a good thing being in public is like swimming in a giant petri dish you wouldn't want to go into a bacterial cesspool without sun protection a giant petri dish why yes honey i taught elementary school for 35 years snot and boogers and dirty hands that's all there is can you imagine having to do that in the pandemic i can't imagine doing it outside of a pandemic i know right so imagine 30 kids who have never washed their hands blowing their runny noses everywhere passing around only a heavy nose what to each other if you don't wear a mask you will get something if not the virus it may be a virus we need to all wear masks i work in the clock and chuck i may work in the back but i can't tell you how many times i've sneezed or coughed into a chicken sandwich and i've heard no complaints obviously getting a little special sauce onto a sandwich ain't never hurt nobody even if i wore a mask i'm gonna take it off they're uncomfortable and i have my rights not to wear it you imagine working in nine to five near hot grease and wearing a darn mess the whole time i didn't think so actually in the constitution it states that the state government has the power to regulate safety procedures in a pandemic or state crisis and this has dated as far back as the 1800s well actually it's right next to the second amendment which is my favorite amendment the right to bear arms even if it ain't in the constitution i can't breathe in my mouth so if i choke and die i lose all my rights speak that news lady actually mo many others work nine-to-five jobs wearing masks the whole time and they breathe just fine take the workers in the medical field they wear masks for 12 plus hours a day do i look like i work in the medical field no i don't so you ain't making me wear a darn mask even if you don't work in the medical field you work a job where you can come in contact with large qualities of people you're in a similar situation as the medical fields actually maybe worse because i highly doubt that anything in that restaurant is sterile even if it ain't sterile i'm immune to everything in that restaurant for pete's sakes my favorite thing on the menu is the chicken sandwich and i can't remember the last time we changed that grease maybe it was when i was hired yeah when were you hired 45 years ago right after the vietnam war actually you want to know something the longer the grease sits combine it with my special sauce and that raw chicken juice the better it tastes alrighty moving on mo why do you choose not to wear a mask like i said i can't breathe in them but mainly i don't want to hide my face from all those gorgeous women that come by the cluck and shut oh what my phone's ringing one's one sec ladies i got a call from the old wife hello you're so loud stop shouting okay bye i'll talk to you later all right sorry my wife wasn't too happy to hear that there's other women in the world back on track mo edna why do you choose to wear a mask in public well i want to not keep not only myself safe but others safe i don't want to be the reason someone else gets sick i do wish others would wear a mask too edna it's just the flu i've had chickenpox wine flu and for food poisoning all at once sure i was spewing from both ends but i still went to work i heard the food tasted worse than ever it must have been because i wasn't working the fryer and my special sauce i was working the stove making that darn corn that is why we have food safety regulations i'm sure the cluck and shock chicken shack will be getting inspected very very soon with that we'll sign off i'm anita mann and this is kobd [Music] news [Music]

related to three chinatown assaults nbc's vicki nguyen now vicki it's so disturbing contessa today is the lunar new year it's the year of the ox normally this would be such a huge time of celebration in the asian american community it's obviously subdued this year because of the pandemic but also because of these heinous attacks against asian americans that video absolutely disturbing it's particularly bad in the bay area san francisco oakland san jose where police have stepped up patrols and citizens are now patrolling the streets as well the alameda county d.a where oakland is located said just in the past two weeks they've recorded 18 incidents like the ones you just showed contessa hate hate attacks against asian americans it's gotten so bad that the alameda county has formed a special forces a unit to try and respond to this here in new york some promising action the police here have been way ahead of this they started a task force last april after the terms kung flu and china virus started circulating and increasing hate incidents here in new york on average they see two to three hate crimes against asian americans per year after the pandemic that spiked to 27 last year from january to this year so you have 25 officers who speak 11 different languages now trying to address these crimes and protect the community what's encouraging this time around you're seeing so much more talk about it from hollywood actors to broadway stars to social media people are fed up they're sick and tired of it everyday citizens as well one man in the bay area actually formed a

gone out there to the bay area passing out pamphlets and whistles just encouraging people to report hate incidents when they see them let's take a listen to what he had to say what we want to do is to make our elderly feel safe you know they're a lot are out and about right now to be because of the chinese new year at lunar new year and contest it's such a difficult issue because traditionally this asian american community doesn't want to call attention doesn't want to talk about these things particularly the elderly but what i'm seeing what i'm hearing is a wave of younger voices a new generation saying this is infuriating enough is enough we're fed up and they're all hoping that with this new year comes new attention and new action to prevent these attacks contessa we can all hope

to the show our special guest tonight is Karin magno of Baystate consulting transduction pro in Porter and always with us each week is the incredible Bruce mcFarland thank you guys for joining with me tonight Karin nice to see you how are you very good thanks excellent so we're going to talk about Baystate consulting we're going to talk about transaction Pro reporter we're going to talk about how to import transactions into QuickBooks but before we get into the nitty-gritty why don't you give us a little bit of background on who you and your husband are and you know give us your story tell us how they state consulting came to be okay um John's had a couple businesses over the years and as you all know when you start a small business there's really no budget you know for software and someone who one of his um companies that he owned he wrote his own accounting system and scheduling system to work with his with his business and then you know what happened is he sold that business and started getting involved with QuickBooks back in 2002 at the first into its Developers Conference and started doing a lot of custom applications um you know for QuickBooks users so you know over the years and what happened is he kept finding that he kept getting the same request over and over again you know I want to import orders for my shopping cart I want to import orders you know from my invoicing system and there are a lot of common themes behind all the custom projects that he had you know built over the years and so he took all of his knowledge and built the transaction Pro importer over seven years ago now and and then you know he expanded it to adding an exporter he ended it to working with QuickBooks Online and what's happened is over time the business grew so rapidly that I left my job I I'm a CPA and I worked in commercial real estate in the finance area and I left my job to do come help him grow its business and it's it's just been a runaway hit we have over 17,000 customers we have over two million transactions imported on into its latest platform into an app center but quickbooks online and it just serves a real need for small businesses they can buy an importer for one ninety nine ninety five for the QuickBooks desktop editions and use it to import all their data as well as they can buy an app for $19.99 a month and import all their data into quickbooks online and it's it's been exciting to see the business grow and we've been very lucky that we've had a lot of great followers that have given us a lot of great feedback over the years which is why i personally think the product has has developed into what it is today right you guys have done a great job I mean I see you everywhere you guys have it looks like a close relationship with Intuit company that makes QuickBooks in fact I've seen your company featured right there when I'm looking at their App Center now that's correct were the first ones there we came out in the beta with the Intuit App Center and they've been great partners with us on the Intuit App Center and have done a lot of co marketing with us so it's been a great platform for us that's fantastic and so tell me a little bit about the sort of options what software does transaction Pro important work with I know it works with QuickBooks desktop and it works with QuickBooks Online does it work with any other programs just just with QuickBooks at this point oh okay any plans for other programs curious um not outside of QuickBooks at this point um the QuickBooks uses keep us very busy we have a big development queue people always want more and more we actually on the quickbooks online a platform we have a we have an importer application right now and what we're also going to roll out it's going to roll out an exporter and and delete or that's cloud-based so we're working on that right now so that's keep keeping us very busy excellent it's good to be busy right right yeah I finally had the opportunity to use it myself this week and I have to say I'm gonna give you my testimonial it was so easy it made it so easy to I had to go back and it clients QuickBooks file where we had started the year off kind of mid-year because his CPA was keeping back of the books up until that point and he has a fiscal year so when I started working with the guy I think he just didn't know any better than to tell me I would just start the books as of January 1st I want to start a new set of books so lo and behold came to find out fiscal year starts August 1st and he was going to try and consolidate financial statements between where he kept track and and the QuickBooks file just to cover that gap between August 1st and December 31st well it wasn't working because what he had done was just downloaded the bank data and he prepared a journal entry for all the activity during that time period so there's no way to really match things up so in the end they said go back to August 1st and download all the transactions so a transaction Pro importer helped me get that information into QuickBooks very nice and very quickly and I just had a undo all my bank recs and redo them but this specific aspect of it where it lets you import a bank statement as great just like I said it made it so easy to do and most users don't realize that a lot of times if you don't you if you just have to ask your bank a lot of times you can go back and get extra detail for previous periods all you have to do is just ask the bank where to find it and it could be Excel CSV text Microsoft money or a quicken file great so do you want to just kind of get right into it and share your screen and show us a little bit about it how it works ok so we're gonna start with our quickbooks online importer I really love the App Center um it makes it easier for users you log in to QuickBooks Online and you mouse over here and all of your apps will appear in the drop-down so you can see I've signed up for two apps I have transaction Pro a two-parter actually I'm looking at the Hangout screen right now I don't need a minimizer yeah can you see it now I know it may need a minute to update it's it's live on the air we go okay I just updated now and now I see QuickBooks Online okay so I'm logged into my quickbooks online test account i apologize it's a mess cuz thank you on my testing in here but what's really nice if you have a user or use quickbooks online it's all single point assign and so you log into quickbooks online account and you'll see the into an app center right up here in the right hand corner so you just select the drop down and i'm gonna select the transaction pro and quarter so it makes it real easy single point of sign-in and by the way for those of you watching feel free to post questions and comments either on google+ or on the youtube channel if you're watching on youtube click the title of the video right underneath the video player where it says interview with karen magnet cetera and when you click that link you'll see there's a section where you can actually post comments or leave a comment it's near the bottom right of the video so use that and bruce and i'll keep checking throughout the interview to see what questions we've got out there and have karen answer them okay so i'm logged into the transaction pro importer math we've actually provided you with a sample import file that has all the different import types that you can use as a template but you're not required to use this file you can use any import file we allow you to match the columns to the quickbooks fields but this is a good start you know for a lot of people that are new to importing it allows them to get familiar with you know with the way imports work you can see down here that we support you know excel csv files and currently we allow you to import up to a thousand rows at a time so once you log into the app the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to select your import file and I have a directory set up on your base date called IPP its call into a partner platform that's what the developers call it and this is the sample import file that I downloaded from our application and you select the upload file button and what this does it just uploads the data to our server temporarily so we can import it this worksheet has multiple tabs so you can select which tab that you want to import so in this case we're going to import invoices so this is the invoices tab then you can see all the different types of transactions that we support we support items vendors bills bill payments checks credit card charges estimates which we're never able to import with the prior developer API so it's the first time that users have ever been able to import estimates into QuickBooks Online invoices journal entries receive payment sales receipts and time activities and more will be coming as in - it adds more to the developer interface so we're going to select invoices and the next screen that comes up is a mapping screen on the left hand side or all the QuickBooks fields that are available on the invoice and I'll scroll down so you can see there's quite a few and then you have the ability to map an import file column so if you come over here into the middle in the drop down these were all the headers on your import file so I've already pre mapped this but you could come in and you could change you know you can either IMAP something maybe you didn't want to map the due date anymore you can on map that oops and you could also have the ability to type in a static value say for instance um I don't know you wanted all these invoices to be printed and your import file did not have a column to be printed what you could do is instead of mapping an import file column just type in a default value and so we're going to type in a default value here of Y and what you'll see is when we scroll down you'll see that the TV printed its are all now wise so you have the ability of the flexibility to map to any import file column or you can put a default value in here and you have the ability to save your map so the next time through you don't have to do the mapping it'll be there you know for the next time through we also have the ability to map in some ecommerce field such as you know shipping items typically um in e-commerce import file has the shipping fields in a different column you know and that's just quite a bit you can you can do taxes you can do discounts you know since it's pretty much there's a lot there right now and what's nice here is you there's a grid that shows how your date it's gonna be mapped into quickbooks online so you can see here in this blue title bar here are all your import fields or the quickbooks fields and right below it are all the transactions so it's a good check just to scroll over and look to see you know okay the cities here you know i have you know i have you know items i have you know prices etc we do do validation to make sure that you have the minimum required fields and also to make sure that the that the values are valid like if you're importing a date we make sure that their dates in the columns or if their amounts at their amounts so there is there is a fair amount of pre validation pre important so um what you can do is you can either select individual rows to import or you know if you're comfortable with your mapping and you're in your import files you can select this checkbox up here and what that does is that will select all the items to import but before i do that i want to click over the options section okay what happens is you can a lot you can let quickbooks auto assign your transaction numbers instead of using your invoice numbers in here you can also enable account numbers on transactions so it allows you to import account numbers or account names if you're using a transaction type that uses accounts this is a new feature down here that we just recently added which is which I'm very excited about a lot of times when you import from another application the names may not match exactly to those that you have in QuickBooks Online you know or some other database and so what happens is you have the ability to say I don't want to do a match based upon the customer name and QuickBooks Online instead I want to look at the resale number and then you can populate that resell number with a matching value say from your web store maybe they have an account number or maybe you have some other unique identifiers which most applications do and then the same thing with the vendors we have the same thing but you map it to the account number so that's a very powerful new feature that we just actually added at the end of last week and you can you know check off any options and you select save and they'll be saved for the next time through ok so I've selected all all this I think those three invoices here and so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select the import button are you sure don't want to import these records into quickbooks online we just warn people because with quickbooks online it's not like a desktop version of QuickBooks where you can do a back up before you do an import and while this is going I'm going to log in to QuickBooks Online so you can see the transactions coming in and you can see here are the three transactions that just came in so and over here you get a transaction log if for some reason the there was an issue with some of the data what would happen is the status you know you'd have an error message here as to why it's in an import so you can go right back over to QuickBooks Online and you can actually see the transaction here so you can see all you know we have the individual items filled out in this particular case there was a discount and then we actually also have a sales tax that's involved so it's you know it has a lot of you know functionality we put in a memo and we also have a client message and we also flagged this one to be printed or to be or to be emailed okay so should I move on to on the desktop importer or do people have questions about QuickBooks Online so far there's one question right Burstein is wanting to know if this can be set to automatically import from an online shopping cart not at this point okay no it's something we might consider down the road but you know this is a newer platform and you know we just you know down the road we might consider it but right now we have an offer that functionality but the reality is every shopping cart lets you download as CSV which could then be imported using transaction Pro right and that's correct well and then you could import it as sales receipts too right yep and has let's go back and whoops and we will um start over oops I shouldn't I'm swell just I'm not gonna do a sales we see an import but these are all the different transaction types that are supported currently and sales receipts are supported yeah what what we found which has been very surprising is Czech imports have been very popular I think a lot of people using it to import you know you know from their Commission software into quickbooks online and then producing the checks right out of QuickBooks Online nice any other questions before I move on I think that's it so far okay all right so what I'm gonna do next is I'm just gonna minimize this window and the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna do an import into QuickBooks 2013 using the desktop version of the importer and this is stuff this is what you had taken a look at so this this tool is a lot more you know powerful um you know because the developer API you know is has a lot more to it as well as this just a lot a lot more users on this platform what I wanted to start with first is I want to go over all the different options that we have this is what makes the tool so powerful we have three tabs of options and there's a lot of very advanced advanced features you can you know for instance you can a lot of times when you're importing from another application you know a lot of times you don't want that you know you don't want transaction Pro to create a new item or a new customer you might want to create it on the fly so you have the ability to say you know check off all these items and basically say okay I'm doing a you know um bill import and I don't want transaction Pro to create any new vendors or to create any new accounts that allows you to prevail date the data in your import file before you actually you know do the import we have a lot of very advanced features which allow you to skip transactions if there's a duplicate or you can actually replace transactions if you know if this if there's a um if there's a matching reference number we have the cross-reference feature we have more cross-reference features available in this product you can do a cross reference on the customer the vendor or the item you can also import your credit card information if you need to we have a gentleman in North Carolina that sells a product called snooze ease and he actually imports all of his data from his shopping cart you know into a sales order and actually imports all the credit card information into into QuickBooks and then actually goes into QuickBooks and does the you know does the import there so it's very powerful let's see what else you can use price levels which is you know very important for a lot of people on the you have the ability to import custom fields we have a cross reference on both the account name as well as the item name which is you know again if you're on the system doesn't match QuickBooks you can store matching value on the account or on a custom field on the item we if you have bills and checks where you have multiple items and columns instead of in rows you can you can import that way as well for journal entries if your journal entry is out of balance you can tell transaction Pro I want any out of balance not to be posted to you know whatever account excuse me and then the final tab here is our e-commerce tab and this is you know adds a lot of additional fields such as shipping handling discount and sales tax as well as and also gives you the ability to have multiple items you know on one row instead of in income and sorry on the same row instead of in multiple rows so and then we also have I won't get into it here but we also have a lot more advanced features that you can set via be a very easy shortcut that allow you to auto run this so if you did want to provide some automation for your clients or for yourself you could set it up so your client just clicks one button it goes out pull you know looks in a directory and pulls in the file into QuickBooks okay all right so um so the first thing that we do is we also allow you to import from this data source name or DSM it allows you to import from any ODBC database so you have the ability to connect to any you know sequel or file maker or any ODBC database directly or we also connect to Microsoft Access so what's you know it saves the saves your clients or yourself from exporting a file from QuickBooks to you know to your desktop so in this case I'm also gonna import invoices so I'm just gonna browse from my invoice file when you install transaction Pro importer we install a bunch of sample import files and maps just to help the user get familiar with how the product works and so in this case I'm going to select my invoice map or invoice import file we have the ability this is a text file so if you're importing a text file you have the ability to set a tab a comma or a pipe delimiter which is important because a lot of different applications export in different formats so it gives you that flexibility and then also at the end of the at the end of the line different you know applications we use different record returns until it gives you the flexibility here until actually I think I'm going to import a sales receipt to do something a little different so I'm going to hit the next button and what happens is you'll see this is what we call the file content screen and so this is so you can see exactly what's in your import file so you can eyeball this to make sure you know I pull the right data you know so you can just scroll across and you can see these are all the various um you know fields that are in this import file and then you select the next button okay and what I'm going to when I did the last import what happens is transaction Pro memorizes the map from the last time so I must have had a different import file the last time I did this I did this mapping so I'm going to lo um our sales receipt map okay well that didn't work I'm gonna do a field match because I know that the fields and the import file match exactly but just like with you know just like with the online importer you have the ability to you know to select fields so you can come in here you know and you can you can select additional fields so I don't know if I have a payment method in here but I don't so um I know what I did I'm just gonna go back here and I'm gonna select the sales receipt file I selected the invoice file okay okay so in this case it's already been pre mapped but what you can do is you can come in here and you can select a different a different import file these are the headers from your import file so you can either unmask or you can come over here and you can type in a static value you could say this is a sales we see it so you could say credit card say okay what if that what if credit card isn't a predefined payment method in my QuickBooks file will it create it will it give me an error or give me an opportunity to create it I believe it will create it so we can do a live test right online um and then um if you have any custom fields they are all down here at the bottom these are custody of see it's custom field customer and you have custom field item and then we also I'm importing into a into an enterprise file that has advanced inventory turned on you also the ability to import the site as well as well as a serial a lot number so it's but you know it's very powerful on tool and then the other thing I like about it is not only can you put a static value over here but what you could do is say for instance it's very common for an e-commerce store a lot of times what happens is the first names in one column and the last names in another column and so in QuickBooks we all know that the name is all in one field you know the customer name field you can actually come over here and you can put in a formula here that basically says I want the data in this column Plus this column to be mapped to this you know customer field just like the concatenate feature in Excel and you can also do simple formulas you could do addition subtraction multiplication and division so it's it's pretty you know it's pretty flexible um now what about the other name related fields because the customer name line it's just one name but then further down and the contact information it is broken up so you've got those two yeah we have we have um we have the contact name the first name the last name with enterprise with QuickBooks 2013 they have that an additional contact on fields but unfortunately in two it does not made those available to developers yet once you're made available to developers we will add them you know so you can see and the other thing that's nice is if you didn't want to map the price here you don't have to map the price um if you do not map a column to this QuickBooks field price and just leave it blank transaction pearl will use the price that is set up on your item and click books you know so this just gives you you know a lot of flexibility um you know you know all the custom fields is supported etc and then what happens is what I've worked with a lot of other import tools prior to start working with QuickBooks and what I used to hate is I used to hate having to do an import of a whole file and then wait for the thousand rows to import and then come back and find out it done the mapping wrong you don't have to worry about that here what you do is you hit the next button and what's happening right now is transaction Pro went through the whole import file check to make sure all the required fields are there it checked to check to make sure it had all the various due date let data types correctly you know just so before you even get to the import portion you can make sure that you know everything's going to be okay and then we give you this go ahead yeah we know I was just going to say when I was doing mine this week I had accidentally chosen the wrong field in one of the dropdowns and I was very impressed that actually flagged me and it just had a data validation error because I was trying to put taxed effectively in merit-based filled by because again I just kind of missed by one in the drop-down so I thought that was pretty example here like say for instance this is a required field item on a sales transaction and so if I unwrap this and I hit the next button some required fields are missing values and so what happens if you click the ok' button any any transaction that doesn't have a valid that doesn't that's something wrong it will be in bold and then you can just scroll around until you see you know where you'll see something highlighted in yellow and that's you can see here that the item field is not filled in so this just gives you a lot of additional protection that you know I don't know who if a lot of you important iif files but before you even start the import you know we go and do all this validation so you don't have to worry about you know creating bad data within your QuickBooks company file so I'm just gonna remap this okay okay and what happens is when you hit the next button the mapping is already saved if you happen to be supporting multiple clients or you happen to you know say for instance you have multiple ecommerce towards that you're supporting what you could do is you come you could have multiple Maps you know say for instance you did PayPal yesterday and today you're coming in and doing Amazon what would happen is you could select this load map button and you could go out to where you saved your Amazon map and then you know so you can have multiple Maps so it makes it pretty easy we're gonna hit the next button okay and then this is you know when you're using the tool this is the most important screen here it basically at the top of the screen just like with QuickBooks Online here are all the fields QuickBooks fields and then all your data is populated down below so it's always a good shock to just scroll around and just make sure you know that you know maybe your import file changed or maybe somehow you change the mapping so you can see everything looks like it's lining up okay I'm going to hit the next button and then on this last screen oh I forgot to mention um if you don't select any Asians transaction pro on the fly will create any new list items for you'll create customers will create vendors employees you know depending upon the type of the import type that you're selecting and so on this last screen if you want transaction pro to create and you say for instance you have an item in your import file that doesn't already exist in QuickBooks you can actually tell transaction pro if if you find an item that doesn't exist I always wanted to be created as a service item and then you can select the accounts that you want and whether you want it to be you know a non you know or taxable item what if I have a sales receipt where I have one item for labor and one item for material so once an inventory part one's a service item right now with on this last screen you only have the ability to select one item type you know but what you could do as um what you could what a lot of people will do is on this option screen here is they'll they'll check off this box do not add new items and then what happens is let me go in and and just edit okay I just want to show you and you can do this with any of the list type items okay so I'm just going to change this item you can edit in any of the grids which is what I like because sometimes you might see something that just looks wacky and you can change it right in here so I'm I'm just saying we have an item in our import file called xxx so I'm gonna hit the next button the mapping will come up and you'll see down the bottom we're querying all your items to see if we find a match and you're going to get this error message if it doesn't find a match and then what we're telling you here is the this xx xx item does not exist in QuickBooks so at this point you can either go in you know maybe it's mistaken your import file on or maybe you just want to have the ability to add it you know yourself in QuickBooks so you can set the actual values all right okay so I'm just gonna reload this okay and so you can see here's our grid again and unit of measure is supported which is very important for a lot of a lot of companies that use inventory maybe yeah and I can't tell you how many people do not know how to use unit of measure it's not a calculated field it's just a label right it's just a label yeah you know but they said they just still don't understand it okay and you select the finish button we're actually importing this file into QuickBooks yeah so going back to my previous question in theory what we might want to do if you know the items were an issue is just break it up into two imports one for service items one for inventory parts accepting that if I need both on one sales receipt around one invoice then I'm in trouble so I just have it not import and then I have to go in and how does that work do I just go in and edit it after the fact or well you can go into you you can either end it right within the grid or what you can do is you can um you can edit it you can add it in QuickBooks or you know you if you want to change the item settings on the last screen you can too so if I have existing items that are both inventory and service that it can do it just can't create new items of more than one type that's correct okay all right that makes notes so worse much worse you're going to quiz create the items you need if you have that issue before you do the import right then you're golden now we do have a few questions out there did you want to finish the import first and then we'll go to questions well it's actually it's else to show it some so Ann's bakery is one of them that's in here so um oops and you can see the sales receipt is right here and so you can see this one had multiple items we had sales tax on it and let's see what else um you know the payment method filled in for the credit card and I think I think that's about it so cool so alright one question we got and I think it's an excellent question of course they're all excellent questions Dennis is asking let's say I have a crafted QuickBooks file could I in theory in that corrupt QuickBooks file generate a complete general ledger detail report export that to excel and then use transaction reporter to import that data into a brand-new clean QuickBooks company file what most people will do is the the general ledger transaction detail report in a lot of instances if you using like sales receipts and checks and all the different import types it's not going to provide you all the detail that you need in your new QuickBooks company file and so what most people will do is we have a transaction Pro exporter product and you can actually export the products I'll start that real quick you can actually export the export all the transactions out by import type and list in action Pro to create I mean I have seen people do that but what the issue is is a lot of people don't want to lose that detail if you just import the general ledger you're gonna lose all the detail um you know behind those transactions and I'm just gonna start the exporter real quick okay so this is a separate product yep the both of them together um this act for some reason this isn't activated I have to have several virtual machines because of all the foreign versions of QuickBooks don't play well with the US version so um so basically what you do is you can see here it's all the different you know all the different you know transaction types and lists and what you could do is we have someone the other day that wanted that sold the business and they were smart enough that when they did the you know that one they did the um crated QuickBooks OU's classes so basically what they did is they exported all their invoices by you know they said okay I want all my invoices and I only want to export the East because that's a business that I'm selling and then what would happen is in this case you would just be retrieving the data for invoices for the East region and so what would happen is you would get an export file but in your case if you're creating a new QuickBooks company file you just put in the I'm in a sample QuickBooks company file so I don't know what I have for data but what you could do is you know just put in a date range here and then you just go through and you know all the different you know export types and a lot of consultants love this because of the fact it allows you to save the file out to an excel file and you can go in you can take that opportunity to clean up you know transactions you know maybe they haven't used items correctly maybe they've maybe they're cut maybe their accounts or amounts and you want to and you want to condense the amount of counts so it just allows you to save it out to excel and then you just start the transaction pro importer and you can import all those files into QuickBooks right and this is also great I know I've had my share of clients who have essentially what really is one company in two different company files where they're doing something that normally can be accomplished using classes so this would be perfect for taking a situation like that and consolidating them into one company file right which is excellent so transaction pro goes both ways export and import yep and hold the desktop on both of these products the desktop and the importer and the exporter you can automate these so with one click you can go out and you can tell you know you can set it up to go out and you know do the export you can you know set it up to just go and do the import with one click ok and a couple people have been saying they would like to see the source document it's just an Excel spreadsheet right I don't think I'm pulling one up just to show people what it looks like from the Excel side oops I'm just opening it up on my other monitor no problem take your time and then while we're waiting Dennis was asking he's got transaction Perot importer for and he wants to know what are the major enhancements for five obviously five goes one ladder yeah one of the steps you didn't take advantage of this cuz you're the acceptor the Excel guru but we added a lot any functionality but one of the big things that we added is the ability to import bank statements with payee aliases so here's the actual import file here so you can see it's just a standard flat file with you know that you don't have to have headers but it makes it easier to map if you have a header if you have a header row so you don't know if you have to and I'm assuming it doesn't matter if you happen to have it formatted at all that won't interfere with TPI's ability to import and a lot of people they have sent me their spreadsheets they do all kinds of macros and calculations and you know in their spreadsheets they do all their accounting and their spreadsheets and then they use they use transaction for to import them in so you know any macros or formatting will work fine but let me just show you the the transaction probably imported five we have what we call payee aliens matching okay and so what you can do I don't know if I have a bank statement of course I don't I'll just do a check import I'll do a deposit okay assume you know I'm going to assume that I'm importing a bank statement and so what happens is um you get to this mapping screen and let's see if I can and so I'm gonna actually do a mapping on the fly my import file doesn't have the bank account so I'm just gonna type it in as a static value I'm gonna map the transaction date the payee is the receive from the check number the account oops actually I'm not gonna map the account because we'll use transaction Pro to do that the amount okay I'm gonna hit the next button okay this is what we call our payee alias matching so what you can do is you can select this ill you know how typical a you know stuff I'm sure you saw this when you downloaded the transactions from the bank these names are a mess they probably they probably look something like Jeannie Smith you know with the phone number yeah yeah it's kind of like when you download from you know from your bank directly into QuickBooks in the QBO format it's the names are oh yeah so what you can do is you can select this alias map and a lot of people love this even though they have the QuickBooks Online import just because it gives a much more flexibility you can have as many maps as you want so if you had multiple bank accounts multiple credit card charges you can you know you can have as many maps as you need so what you would do is you would just type in here you would say up here okay if I ever find the word genie in this payee column I always want it to go and you can set up a new payee and we'll set up a customer and we'll set up Smith because I know know most people set up their QuickBooks that last name comma first okay yeah that's what I see anyway weird and then what happens is then you can select the account that you want it to go to and say we want this to go to automobile I don't know repairs and maintenance or something and then what happens is you you'll see down in the grid below it automatically updates it down here and so this makes it very handy when you're downloading bank statement information or credit card you have all these very powerful PE aliases and you save this map and so the next time you come through it has more and more aliases in it so get smarter and smarter so that's a big you know that's a big new feature that we added you know in for in version 5 another big feature that we added is we redid the whole activation system so it's all internet-based activation so I'm gonna cancel out of this um I'm gonna go back let's say you know you're you know everyone has a laptop and a on a computer in their office let's say you know you all sudden realize oops you know I want to be able to use it you know I'm at home I want to be able to use transaction from my laptop all you do is um we have a whole activation system here and what you do is you just put in your login and password whoops and hopefully I remember my password and then what you can do is you can see all your active computers so say for instance I wanted to deactivate this computer from home I can easily do that and then switch back to the activation tab and activate this machine so it just makes it you know very flexible you can use it from any of your machines so I think that address is one of Roxanne's questions actually cuz where is it in the past we gotta reload our computer or moved to a new and we had a contact based date to do that the program is tied to the specific computers that still the case so there's your answer right yep it's all internet-based it's um and so the other thing that we found a lot of QuickBooks users have a lot of personal stuff on their computers and we had people that their computers are crashing three and four times a year and so if your computer crashes just low transaction prone your new machine and you can just deactivate the crash machine and reactivate your new machine that's yeah and I don't really know Roxanne is asking how well does it work with the Amazon FBA there's CSV file has pretty limited info compared to regular Amazon is that the one that that it's kind of after the fact where they send the user on what the transaction fees are Roxana if you're out there do you want to comment on that and then she's know while we're waiting for her to come back on that she's asking how fast the queries let's say if 20 or 30 orders the day or a lot of items we would just be pretty slow and obviously it has to do with how many line items it doesn't matter how many transactions so I could have a sales receipt with 30 line items right it's actually pretty quick it's you know it's probably gonna be about a half a second per line where you get into processing time it's if you want us to check for new items new customers and that where that will take longer is if you have if you have a large item list reveals I have a large customer list limit as far as like a certain point at which it won't be able to import any more than a certain number like a thousand lines or 2,000 lines um typically um we have people that tell us that they're you know importing you know thousands and thousands of lines we say to start with ten thousand to start and then increase it there because it depends upon memory on your machine as well as you know as well as your QuickBooks setup Sam has a China back and clarifying about the Amazon FBA question yes the answer is yes yeah that file is its we don't I mean that it's just they don't provide a lot of information on that which is what makes it hard no they don't provide the you know the items and you know they just kind of have amounts with us yeah so it doesn't work with that Fowler is just limited with that file well we can import the actual amazon's orders itself but the you know the file that amazon sends to the sense to the vendor after the fact that has all the transaction fees we that's not a standard format so we have we have it doesn't work without at this point we've tried to make this tool simple so someone can go out and just buy one tool you can pay $200 and use it to import from virtually all web stores all web stores are typically in the sort a format where you know the customers repeated on each line and then you have the you know the item on each line we also do have some advanced e-commerce features that you can that you can enable for those shopping carts that have you know multiple items on the same row what we're trying to do is we you know trying to make it work with you know with you know with everything you know we don't want to constantly be behind the eight ball when Amazon updates their website and doesn't tell and tell people gotcha and how much is the exporter tool it's one forty nine ninety five but if you purchase both together from our website they are two ninety nine ninety five together and let me show you real quick we actually have loops just gonna drag this back over you have a tool that can import all of my wife's request sentence to my brain I'm built one gladly for my husband I'd pay a lot for that so here's our products page and you can see we have an importer exporter into leader and I know when the Sleater um I know in the a BPO hangout I know that Doug's leader is was talking and Nancy was talking about hosting we work with pretty much all virtually the major hosting companies that are out there so what you would do is um the import is one ninety nine ninety five but if you wanted to purchase the importer and exporter together it's two ninety nine ninety five which and then you save you know fifty dollars and then if you purchased the importer exporter into leader and they all have internet-based activation it's three forty nine ninety five and so you're saving a hundred and twenty-five dollars so and what is the deleted you it goes and actually deletes transactions oh yeah that scares me that seems like that would create a mess if I did that I mean like what if I'm trying to delete a deposit that's tied into a payment that's tied into an invoice how does that work well what you have to do is just like in QuickBooks you have to go in the reverse order the way the transactions work so you'd have to delete you'd have to delete your deposit you'd have to delete your deposits first then you delete you receive payments then you delete your invoices gotcha okay and I'm assuming this is used in cases where the transactions are just not right or completely bogus well we or a lot of times I wouldn't necessarily recommend this if you've got a lot of inventory in your QuickBooks company file but you know if your users are using Pro if you're using Pro or premier and your company file size has gotten too big and you're not using inventory extensively a lot of times people will just buy the deleter and I we have clients that use it every single year and they just delete a year's worth of transactions and then they run the the portable company file and re-import the portable company file back in and decrease this file size how do you I guess this is what I mornings because this was me how do I delete like historical inventory related transactions without ruining the integrity of my inventory balances say you would have to run a trial balance in an inventory less say for instance you wanted to delete transactions part of one one of 2011 what you would do is you've run an inventory report and your trial balance as of 12 31 2010 and then when you're all done doing the deleting you do an inventory adjustment and a journal entry to bring those beginning balances back on the books so more people you that are not in an inventory situation and a very common use that we see now is there are a lot of people that are trying to move from QuickBooks desktop to quickbooks online and they have file size limitations of the size of the file that they will upload to quickbooks online and so what happens is if their file size is too big what they'll do is they'll use the delete are to delete you know say year or two years worth of transactions so then they can actually use the file upload to quickbooks online gotcha all right hang on one second I'm gonna try something here because I think Roxanne has more questions so I'm gonna invite Roxanne to join us if she wants this she can just get on the air with us here well what's the biggest market market for your product the accountants and the QuickBooks Pro advisors or the individual business owners it's actually the individual business owners the accountants have helped us grow the product you know they they use it for one client and then they use it for all their clients but our you know our biggest you know user base is just someone believe it or not they they start a webstore and they go out and buy QuickBooks off the shelf and they're like oh my goodness how do I get these orders into QuickBooks and they go and buy the transaction Pro importer and they start importing the transactions into QuickBooks well you know it's funny I've had a number of clients recently who have asked you know come to me with situations where you know this tool was the obvious solution and it's funny what happens is I've referred them to Karen and so go buy transaction per hour importer but now they're coming back to me because they want me to help them use it so it kind of comes around but if you look if you are an accountant then this is a great tool to get your hands and head wrapped around because imagine you have these clients who come to you now and say hey we have this problem and we need to import transactions you can just do it for them right and and obviously charge them for the time to do it for them but get their file import the transaction send it back to them nice and clean and I think that would be a great service that you know consultants could add on to their sort of tool belts so with consultants have to buy a license for every company they did this for or would the one license service all of their it's license per computer so you can use it with an unlimited number of QuickBooks company files another way that consultants approach it is some consultants don't want to be doing data data entry or data you know any sort of data type transactions and so what some the consultants that we work with have you know they set up the importer or the export or whatever that they're using and they you know they set up with their client a schedule where ok we're going to come in once a quarter once a month we want to come in and run your sales tax reports and look at your reconciliations to make sure that you know something hasn't changed in your webstore something hasn't changed and your QuickBooks setup and then a lot of these users have gone out and built the relationship with the client just because a transaction Pro importer we had someone that just sold a 10 user license of QuickBooks Enterprise down in Florida because they called her because they saw that she knew transaction Pro importer cool so there you have it I guess Roxanne's not joining us maybe she bailed out you can okay so the official website is transaction Pro importer calm or based a consulting calm you can either use based a consulting calm or QuickBooks importer calm okay and for everybody's sake everything is summarized on the page where I have the interview posted so I'm going to post the link in the feeds so that if you would like to in on YouTube I can only put it in the description so I have to do that after the fact but if you're interested in the product then you know I'll post the links around so you can go in and and grab yourself a copy of the importer the exporter or the deleter I like to delete her that sounds like something from like terminator the leader you know if you've hesitated moving your clients to QuickBooks Online because they might have an application that in you know that integrates with QuickBooks desktop see if that application can export a file and maybe you can get them to convert it up to quickbooks online and use the transaction pro importer if they really you know if they really want to go to quickbooks online that's between the transaction pro importer as well as Intuit App Center there's a lot of applications that are out on to QuickBooks Online all right very good Karen thank you so much for being with us thank you for taking the time to show us this I think it's a really cool tool I think this time of year especially is probably why I've been getting so many inquiries because this is the time people are thinking about really kind of getting their books cleaned up so they're thinking about Bruce and wait here comes an update on Google Plus today and if you've missed anything we're actually doing um we're part of um Stacey kildall small business small business on comm on Wednesday and we're actually doing another live demonstration of the QuickBooks importer for QuickBooks Online and for the desktop fantastic and great and then what about training so somebody buys the product and they need to know how to use it does that cost extra how does that work well we actually have a very very detailed blog that you can go to if you it's blog based a consulting comm and we have a whole how-to section on every single import type as you know as well as lists and if you run into any difficulties all you do is just send us your import file we'll send you back a map that you can use with transaction pro importer and some instructions gotcha excellent and I'll be doing some videos on it now that I know how to use it once I know Seth was so busy that he's kept saying I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it once you do one and you get the one under your belt you're like why didn't I do this before because it's once you do one all you're doing is changing the import type and that's it yeah well and now of course I have all kinds of things I want I want to go play with it all day I you know the biggest thing I want to do is PayPal because I know I use PayPal and I know a lot of people use PayPal and I'm always telling people use PayPal for a lot of reasons so you know it's funny the challenging thing with PayPal I noticed as I started to try and play around with that this weekend at least some of the transactions that I get it doesn't have the challenge is getting the item as it's downloaded into PayPal and getting a column in there that references the item that it corresponds to in QuickBooks so cross-reference use our item cross reference well the thing is there is no there's no some of the transactions there's no description that tells me what item that is download so I have to go online still look at that transaction and look in the details to see which item of mine did they purchase it has to do with the way the products are set up inside because I use a junkie so with a junkie the way it downloads for the item or the product description it comes in as just shopping cart and I'm like great thanks can you do a vlookup between just eat junkie export a report that's a good point I probably could so yeah I mean because then then I'd have to go into e junkie export their CSV right to look up in PayPal to grab it from their CSV based on perhaps a combination of the transaction date and time because it's all timestamp I suppose I could do it that way so that way I know exactly which transactions which pulling the item that's a good idea that's a good point but you know so then as I write these things then we can sell them to the public or train them they're very good anything else no thank you for inviting me thanks for joining this is awesome and it's good to see you and we'll see you again around the web all right have a great night everyone all right good night I know", "7twSzQG2h2I": "okay hello everybody uh thank you for joining us it's just about 12 o'clock so i think we'll get started uh this is our march lunch and learn with anna louie and she's going to talk about nutrients in great bay and before we get started i'm just going to do a few housekeeping things in an introduction so um anna if you could advance the slide one great so for those of you who don't know who we are we're the great bay national estuarine research reserve and we're a federal and state partnership between noaa and new hampshire fish and game we're part of a national network of 29 reserves around the country there's another reserve very close to us in wells maine that you may be familiar with as well uh just so everybody knows this lecture will be recorded and we will post it on our youtube channel so if you'd like you can turn off your video uh if you don't want your video to be on there and for now we're gonna leave everybody on mute and if you have any questions you can type them in the chat box and i will help facilitate those questions with anna um throughout the talk or at the end of the talk and i don't think that i will need to use this but if necessary we can remove people um okay if you want to forward one slide anna so this is anna she is our margaret a davidson fellow at the great bay mir and each uh reserve right now has a margaret a davidson fellow doing a lot of important work around the country and um anna works at the unh water quality analysis lab and um to quote her she was bit by the near bug after working at the ketchumek bay national estuarine research reserve in alaska in the summer of 2018 and she was a noah hauling scholar at that time she received her bachelor's degree from the university of maryland in environmental science and policy concentrating in environmental geosciences and restoration and currently she is working towards her master's degree at unh so with that i will turn it over to anna hey uh thanks melissa and thanks everybody for coming today um uh today i'll be presenting on some of my preliminary findings and work for um the great bay national research reserve as it relates to my thesis and so i've aptly titled it nutrients in great bay because that's what we're going to talk about um and so without further ado here we go so estuaries um are very productive ecosystems they support a broad range of species and different types of habitats whether that's still grass beds oyster reefs juvenile fish horseshoe crabs etc and for the purposes of today we'll be talking about an estuary in new hampshire specifically great bay and so just in case anybody doesn't know where that is i've denoted it with that yellow star on the map in the left top left um and so because estuaries are productive ecosystems they need something to fuel all that productivity and growth and species living there and that fuel is nutrients and carbon and so i like to think about it as estuary soup because the nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus and the carbon fuel the plants the aquatic plants that grow in the estuary that then other organisms feed on and the carbon fuels a lot of microbial processes in the estuary as well um and so different there are a lot of different types of estuary fuel that goes into my estuary soup but for the purposes of today we'll focus on the nitrogen fuel as i like to think about it and so in a body of water there's a couple different types of nitrogen that you can find and measure and that entire pool is often referred to as the total dissolved nitrogen pools any form of nitrogen dissolved in the water and then within that total dissolved nitrogen pool you can have on the left dissolved organic nitrogen which consists of any kind of organic molecules um and then on the right of the circle diagram you could have dissolved inorganic nitrogen and so that's anything that's not derived from a living organism or living material and so some examples of estuary fuel that might enter our estuary in great bay include wastewater treatment effluent that can provide both inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen uh lawn fertilizer is another inorganic example and then on the dissolved organic side you can also have natural sources so wetlands or leaf litter can provide another type of nitrogen to the estuary and so because estuaries are productive and because they require all these different types of fuel to grow and provide for species they are really good natural filters of those nutrients and of that carbon and so this diagram if you move from the right side to the left you can see along the bottom we're looking first at a river followed by a tidal river then the estuary and then out to the coastal ocean and you can see that as you move from a river into the estuary our nutrient availability or that purple line decreases with that spatial gradient and that's because the estuary is using up those nutrients that are being delivered by the river and so in essence they start to aggregate in the estuary whether it's in the biomass of plants or in the sediments and as a result of that nutrient filtration we often see an increase in light avail a light availability which is that red line um or red dotted line and we see light availability go up as nutrient availability goes down because um you see less competition for light from species like phytoplankton and so the water becomes clearer with less nutrients available to fuel things like algal blooms um and so one of the key habitats that contributes to this estuarine filter that i'm particularly interested in is eelgrass and eelgrass can contribute to the filtration of nutrients and other materials in several different ways the first example being a reduction of turbidity and so as it as water moves through an eelgrass bed its velocity or its speed is slowed down and as it slows down anything suspended in that water will settle out into the eel grass bed and so any kind of sediment material that causes water to be cloudy will often settle out moving through that yellow grass bed thereby reducing turbidity and increasing water clarity another example of the estrogen filter as it relates to eel grass is nutrient uptake and so an eelgrass needs nitrogen to grow and so it will actually take nitrogen from the sediment bed surrounding it and remove it essentially from the ecosystem temporarily and as a byproduct as it grows through photosynthesis it also releases oxygen back into the water column and into the sediment and the combination of this ability to reduce turbidity take up nitrogen and release oxygen provides a lot of important ecosystem services to the estuary which results in sufficient or good quality habitat for juvenile fish and other species to thrive and so because eelgrass is really good at improving water quality conditions through that filtration capacity it also is sensitive to changes in water quality or changes in habitat conditions and thus we often use it as an indicator of estuary health um and i like to think of it as the canary in the coal mine in a sense and in great bay our canary is singing fairly loudly in the recent decades um as eelgrass field grass coverage in great bay is on the decline and so this is just a graph of acreage or you know amount of eelgrass in great bay estuary on the y-axis over time on the x-axis and we can see from this rate of decline we've lost about half or 50 percent of our eelgrass coverage since 1995. uh more visually that looked something like this with the left image showing eelgrass coverage or eelgrass extent in 1995 in that kind of light green color and if we compare that visually to the 2015 eelgrass map on the right with the purple you can see there is less basically you can see there's less eelgrass covering the estuary and we think that eelgrass decline is possibly due to nutrient loading and that's because in a low nutrient environment eelgrass does not have to compete with anything to get sufficient sunlight to grow but in a high nutrient environment uh other species like seaweed or phytoplankton start to grow above the eelgrass and essentially block or take some of that light that the eelgrass would need to grow and thus eelgrass is less successful in growing and surviving throughout a season and so this kind of context and background about the estuarine filter and as it relates to eelgrass really drives what i'm interested in which is how does a great bay process inputs of nutrients carbon and sediments and so i'm interested in understanding how the estuary can ecologically and biogeochemically handle inputs in the case of today's talk of nutrients um and is there a threshold for which grape a can't handle um any more nitrogen inputs and so before we can dive kind of into the results of this the methods and the results of this question uh we need to establish who the players are in terms of processing those nutrient inputs and what the potential delivery pathways of how those nutrients get to the bay are and so just to start i want to clarify that when i talk about great bay i don't necessarily mean great bay estuary great bay is a part of great bay estuary and so this is a map of the entire estuary and all seven freshwater rivers flow into it and i'm focused on this bottom portion um where it says great bay specifically for my research and so now we know what i mean by great bay we can start to look at the players and the processes that influence nutrient loading in grape a and so this is a conceptual figure of how i like to think about grape bay's as stream ecosystem and so we see again on the bottom of the figure moving from the right to the left we go from a river to a tidal river to the estuary and then out to little bay as we exit as we exit great bay and some of the key players in the estuary in that can process inputs of nutrients include eelgrass seaweed and phytoplankton and seaweed phytoplankton and suspended sediments can all influence the amount of light that the eelgrass at the bottom of great bay receives um and so how does do eelgrass seaweed and phytoplankton receive nutrients and how do the nutrients get into the estuary and that happens by way of the water cycle so a lot of times the things that we measure like dissolved organic or dissolved energy of nitrogen they have to be dissolved in something they're dissolved most of the time in water almost always um and so if we follow the water cycle in the great bay watershed and into great bay we can follow the path of nutrient delivery and so we might see nitrogen coming in through rainfall directly onto great bay or through coastal runoff from the surrounding land or through the rivers themselves in this case the lamprey the scot and the winiket or through groundwater flux directly into the basin and then lastly we can see nutrients coming in and out with the flow of the tides and so once we have our players that process our nutrients and our delivery method being the water cycle um we can talk about how the estuary itself might process those inputs and there are several different biogeochemical cycles that can be at work or at play in great bay um and those are denoted by the yellow arrows on this diagram that i've slowly been building over the last couple slides and so nitrogen or nutrients can be used by aquatic plants and taken up into their biomass uh nitrogen can be lost the atmosphere through a pathway known as denitrification where nitrate is converted to dinitrogen gas nitrogen can also end up being buried in the sediment bed and also flux back out of the sediment bed and it also can just kind of mosey on down to the coastal ocean and ignore everybody in between and so those are some of the potential cycles and fates of nitrogen and nutrients more broadly that once they enter the great bay estuary and so my research focuses on looking at these pathways and then the fate once the nutrients reach grape a and i'm able to do this due to long-term water quality monitoring and that helps all the monitoring sites and the long-term record helps me model those biogeochemical processes and so this is a map that's zoomed in onto great bay itself um and so you can see pink peel and blue kind of pin markers and so the pink pins um represent the monitoring stations for the three title tributaries the lamprey the squam scott and the winner kit at the head of tide which means they're located where the river changes from being a freshwater river to being a tidally influenced river the teal pins represent the great bay um nurse swamp stations which are also long-term water quality monitoring stations and those stations are located at the mouth of the tidal rivers and then the dark blue um symbols represent the three wastewater treatment plants um that discharge along our title tributaries into great bay and those wastewater facilities that may not be captured by our head of tide stations and so i take a lot of nutrient concentration data and discharge data from these stations and i combine that into a black box model to look at how great bay processes those inputs of nutrients and so a black box model is essentially a simplified version of what's happening in the estuary and it focuses on inputs and outputs and it ignores everything that's happening internally in the system and so we can look at how nitrogen is delivered via inputs and compare that to how nitrogen leaves as an output defined as in this model as being low tide flow out past adam's point and we can calculate a delta storage value which essentially is a retention storage loss term that allows us to infer how much nitrogen or how much of a certain nutrient stays in the estuary or leaves in the in the estuary and so um our black box model can have a couple of different outcomes that help us infer the fate of nutrients and so the first is that inputs could equal output and visually that might look something like this where we see the same amount coming into great bay as leaving great bay and what that means for the estuary is nitrogen is just passing through it's not stopping to hang out and get used up or being lost in the estuary through some biogeochemical process the second potential outcome is that inputs to the estuary could be greater than output from the estuary and that visually would look something like this with inputs being larger than output um and what that that result would tell us that nitrogen is getting used in great bay because more is coming into the estuary than we're seeing leaving which means something happened in the middle in that black box so we're not looking at and then the last potential outcome is that your inputs could be less than your output which visually might look something like this and if with that result we might say that great bay is producing more nitrogen because we're seeing more leaving the estuary than initially came in and so when i do when you do a black box model you often talk about the load of nutrients coming in or out and so um i thought i would step back for a minute and explain the difference between concentration and load because both are very important to my work and they're related and very similar but they provide different insights into what's going on in the estuary and so a concentration is primarily used in water quality regulation because it's useful when you're talking about toxic toxicity or like a drinking water standard and for instance so for example nitrate is regulated at 10 milligrams per liter for drinking water and we often report concentrations as a mass over volume so an example might be the amount of sugar that you put into a gallon of tea to make sweet tea whereas a load is more important for questions related to watershed management especially in terms of the delivery of something to a body of water or the accumulation of that something in this case for what i do it could be nitrogen but in the case of my conceptual example today it might be sugar and so we report load as mass over time because of the delivery rate and so an example could be grams of sugar per hour and so concentration and load are linked because we use one to calculate the other and so you would multiply essentially your concentration by your rate of water moving through a system to get your load but if we're talking about drinking sweet tea at a dinner party in post-covid times you might think of it as your concentration of sugar and your sweet tea multiplied by the amount or the volume of tea you drink over a certain number of hours and that gives you your load or your grams of sugar taken in per hour and we might care about this because if you're watching your sugar levels then you care about the rate of delivery of triggered to your system that you might not care as much about the concentration in your one glass of tea over a couple of hours um and so now that we now i've explained kind of where load comes from i get to look at some preliminary results of my black box analyses that are the theft in terms of the load and so the first uh interesting results thus far is that we see when we look at just one river between two monitoring stations we can see the influence of potentially through the influence of anthropogenic activities on dissolved inorganic nitrogen load and so just as a reminder dissolved inorganic nitrogen is the summation of nitrate and ammonium and if we look at the left on the at the map um we see kind of a zoomed in map of the earlier figure i showed and we see the pink pin representing the swampscott river and then the teal representing the swamp station at the mouth of the river and in between we see the exeter and the new fields wastewater treatment plants um and where their outflow points are located and so if you then look to the box plot on the right um the stars on the box plot would denote the mean dissolved inorganic nitrogen load in kilograms of nitrogen per year and we're comparing the pink station or the further upstream station to the teal station which is downstream of both wastewater treatment plants and we see there is an increase or there is a higher din load once you're downstream of those two wastewater treatment plants and i'm just showing this to show that for instance we don't necessarily know have the nitrate delivery rates from the wastewater treatment plants but we can infer them by looking at the furthest downstream station and assuming that that teal marker represents what we measure there represents any nitrogen upstream that has not been transformed or lost and so that in essence that teal station shows us the load of dissolved energetic nitrogen right before it goes into great bay from the swampscott river and so if we now zoom out from one river to the whole estuary we can conceptually look at what i mean by a black box model for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and so again we're ignoring everything that's happening inside the estuary and we only care about the load of nitrogen coming in from the three rivers the lamprey the swampscott and the winning kit the groundwater contribution the precipitation contribution and then the flux in through high tide and the flux out through low tide and when we compare those inputs and outputs we get our delta storage value which tells us something about what's happening within the estuary and so the results for the din black box show two interesting patterns the first being that great bay inputs often exceed output and so if we look at the graph i've plotted essentially our din load as input and output and so the input is the blue box and the output is the red box for red bar for each year and you can see from 2009 to 2014 inputs for that blue bar it's taller or bigger than the red bar indicating that of our three possible outcomes we have the one in which inputs are greater than output resulting in a positive delta storage value as we see as we move from 2014 to 2015 and 2016 we have a reversal where the din black box inputs are now less than the output which is our third possible outcome indicating that there is a negative change in storage within the estuary um and this me this could be due to several different reasons um and in case this wasn't clear i haven't shown in another form and so on the last slide we looked at inputs and outputs this is now just the magnitude of that delta storage term um and so when it's positive um or above zero on this graph that means more dissolved inorganic nitrogen is entering great bay than leaving which we can then infer means something's happening in between it's getting used in great bay it's getting temporarily removed or permanently removed because what we're measuring going in is not what we're seeing leaving and then in the more recent years when din is negative um we that means we're seeing less entering great bay than leaving and so once i'm done with all of my solute or nutrients black box analyses the next step is to start to see the part why we'd see these patterns in positive versus negative storage values and one of the ways we can look at that is by comparing the black box model to biotic response so do we see an increase in eelgrass coverage you know for example here i'm showing the 2019 eelgrass map from the arcgis eelgrass viewer or do we see changes in chlorophyll a concentrations or in seaweed presence within the estuary from year to year so that's one of the ways in which i'll start to determine which or why we're seeing the patterns we do in the black box but then the second half of my fellowship work focuses more specifically on what happens inside the black box or inside of great bag and so the question is in the years where inputs are greater than outputs where does all the excess nitrogen go and that requires us to open up the black box and start to look at some of those internal processes that we know are happening but maybe aren't quite quantified to the extent that we want them to be yet and so the way in which i'm going to be looking at that will start this summer and specifically i'm going to be investigating how eelgrass beds themselves can contribute to nitrogen removal in grapevine and so there's a couple different processes by which eelgrass filters out nitrogen and we'll be sampling within ill grass beds to determine some of those rates and so to start uh eelgrass can remove nitrogen in the short term along with its other biological friends seaweed and phytoplankton by just picking it up into its biomass and using it to grow and so we'll be looking at fuel grass nitrogen content this summer in eelgrass beds within great bay and measuring productivity in order to get a rate of nitrogen uptake um eelgrass beds can also contribute to what i call long-term removal mostly because it often is longer than just you know a season of growing um and that long-term removal is burial in the sediment bed and so that can happen if an eelgrass leaf like when eelgrass dies off and gets buried and then that organic material gets broken down that nitrogen can end up in the sediment bed in various forms and so we'll be looking at both pore water and sediment nitrogen start to get at some of those from that process and then lastly um well we'll also be looking at dissolved in gas forms of nitrogen in the water column and we'll use the combination of that and the pore water to look at permanent removal pathways um the most important one of the most important of those being denitrification where nitrate goes to dinitrogen gas and that nitrogen gas is inert our atmosphere is 78 di nitrogen gas and so not only does that remove a pathway take it completely out of the system it also doesn't affect the ecosystem in any other way like later on and so in summary uh great bay provides a really important ecosystem service of nutrient cycling and i'm trying to quantify that and understand it better by asking these two questions of how does great bay process inputs of nutrients carbon and vitamins and then specifically how does an eelgrass bed contribute to removal of nitrogen in great bag and thus far into my work as i'm starting to finish data analysis and starting to think about what it means we can take away a couple of things one the black box model helps us understand how an ecosystem handles nutrient inputs does it just export them out to the ocean or does it retain them and then secondly the results of the black box model can help us infer rates and direction of biogeochemical cycles meaning um is the nitrogen staying in grape a being taken up or is it leaving great bay or is great bay producing additional nitrogen that we're not accounting for as an input and then lastly um black box models are really great um but they often leave you with more questions at the end because you don't necessarily know what's going on inside the black box and so opening it allows us to investigate and quantify where nutrients go once they enter the ecosystem and with that i will be happy to take questions so we don't have any questions yet in the um in the chat box but definitely if you have any questions feel free to type them in or i think there's probably a few enough people that if you wanted to unmute yourself and ask a question that would be fine too so i have a question anna actually um it's pretty basic one and i think i know the answer but um it might help if anyone is confused if if inputs equal equal outputs that doesn't necessarily mean the nitrogen is not getting used correct it could be maybe getting used and then other nitrogen being produced inside the black box that is correct and so in the that's probably the most the least likely outcome but you are correct um if inputs equal outputs use of nitrogen might be masked by an additional input that we don't quantify because it's happening inside of that box that we're not looking at okay and so that could potentially come to light in this sort of the second half of your research yes it'll be we'll be able to kind of ground truth the black box results if we can figure out how much nitrogen is taken up by your grass fed or denitrified we can start to match up the inputs and the outputs and the delta storage to what we find inside the black box okay great uh looks like we have a couple other questions um kala wants to know if you can steal your graphics yes always um and then we have a question from um paul stacy um who actually used to be the research coordinator here before chris uh i don't think you ever met him but just so you have um some context um he is wondering if you think your sampling intensity is adequate to capture nitrogen movement in and out of various pools and to balance your budget another question all right um i'm gonna answer that for the black box because i think that's what you're asking about the question is if is sampling frequency enough to capture the variability essentially making sure we know what's coming in or not um that's a hard question to answer actually i think you have to work with what you have sometimes and so our sampling frequency is monthly um from spring to winter each year and i'm working part of my work to fill in that winter gap so that we can call it a true annual load in and out um and i think with any model you have to um take into account that there are some simplifications or assumptions you have to make and so part of my goal with this is this is the first round of a black box model for great bay um and so my goal is to do it as well as i can with the data frequency that we have but to build it in a way that you know if we move from a monthly monitoring time step to a weekly or even 15-minute record with sensors we can build that black box we can improve upon the black box model as monitoring gets better more frequent great and paul if i didn't ask that correctly feel free to unmute yourself because you're much more knowledgeable than me so just in case i missed something in that text um while he thinks about that i'll move on to the next question from steve if eelgrass beds are shrinking does the eelgrass detritus get buried and become a source of nitrogen sequestration yes that is definitely a possible outcome um and that leads to another interesting research question that is not fully in my scope right now but if it does get buried in the sediments how long until it comes back out of the sediments and into the water column great um and from richard have you considered the effect of native and aquacultured oysters in little bay on great bay water quality there were some oyster restoration efforts that is definitely something um i am thinking about and hope to look at um and was the focus of a sea grant proposal that just went in about two weeks three or four weeks ago so fingers crossed great um it looks like that's it for questions you definitely have a few compliments on here so you should definitely read those um but i think that's it for questions unless anybody else has a question they want to type in or unmute themselves and ask hi melissa it's paul stacy can you hear me yes we can hear you paul hi great well nice job anna and i put that in my comment that is a nice job but uh my point was that nitrogen i call it the great deceiver because it's really tricky in terms of monitoring it moves in and out of pools you know the vegetation and denitrification is as you pointed out and uh monthly samples it's really tough to capture it because it happens on very short time scales so if you go out sampling in the morning you may see a very different condition than if you went out in the afternoon or at night time so that that was the inspiration for my question and i think you answered it adequately it's a tough field it is tough no you summarized it very well thank you paul um any other questions and i mentioned that we have open water from the wastewater treatment plants and from river flow glowing into break great bay and they can contain the ammonia nitrates but it has has have you sampled any groundwater that's a very good question um our groundwater we are using a groundwater estimate from sampling done about 15 years ago so there was a big study done that looked at nitrogen and groundwater and also calculated essentially the loading or the flow rate of water groundwater directly into great bag and so um i think with you know it's always 50 time and money no so if final money permit in the future we'll go back and definitely like update those numbers but right now we're relying on published values for groundwater katie um katie and bob boucher um oh i'm not sure um not sure if that was someone else does carol i'm not sure if that was you um if you have any other questions for anna i had a question last night we saw a wonderful program uh put on by i think it was sue bickham bickford bickford i'm sorry uh from wells and i was interested to know if it was about the use of drones in uh the research programs and i was wondering if great bay had was doing anything with drones and if it would be helpful with um the top uh you know with about the using it in the research that we heard about today um the answer okay corey i was going to kick that to kala because i saw he was gonna maybe suggest the same thing or at least hint at it hi uh this is kala matso from piscatico region estuary's partnership can you hear me anna yes we can hear you uh so carol the answer to your question is that um we are about to this year for the very first time really ramp up our use of drones with regard to eelgrass we've been using them a lot not we but actually the great bay reserve in partnership with folks at unh have have been using them to look at salt marshes and dunes but this is the first year we're really going to start ramping up how we use drones to assess eelgrass distribution so great question thank you a great program today very interesting and very well done thank you great yeah lots of great questions uh any other questions well i i think that might be it um one last call for questions and then i think we'll probably end it unless um anna unless you have anything else you wanted to add no all good questions so great well thank you everybody for joining us and i hope everybody learned at least one new thing i know i did and we will put this up on our youtube channel so if you wanted to review it or pass it on to any of your friends or family i should get that up in the next few days thank you everybody bye everyone

it's separate which is really really nice so it's sort of a living area bed and then kitchen on the other side so you're not smelling onions when you're sleeping how's the water pressure water

visit the supreme court your mother your mother and you watch the murder trial this was to be formative and your mother in her wisdom had seen that your natural calm organized measured and diligent nature would be a natural fit for the law from this experience you started researching and mapping your path at the university of new south wales you undertook combined arts and law degrees you edited the unsw law journal you also took part in mooting winning competitions and traveling to new zealand while at university you also worked as a waitress at a german restaurant at campbell's cove called

enjoyed their lager and schnitzel one of the male staff behaved in an untoward manner with a female staff member your honor took the matter in hand and quickly devised a solution while the male staff member took a trip to the cool room you closed the door and locked him in he was allowed to come out on the condition that he'd never do such a thing again and by all accounts there was no further trouble after graduating you're an associate of justice kevin lindgren he recalls your honor in particular as being cool calm collected and organized from there you practiced in-house for an international transport company this was valuable experience but your honest sites were always set on the bar and you were called to the bar in 2001 you worked on a number of long and demanding cases with now justice andrew bell your honour didn't shy away from raising issues and your clear thinking advice was valued you're appointed senior council in 2016. i'm told you were encouraged to apply two or three years earlier and would have been a strong candidate while many others would have thrown their hat in the ring you held off in keeping with your careful considered approach for you it wasn't about the accolade or status as much as making sure the time was right to take the responsibility at 11 wentworth your honor worked on some high-profile and complex cases you built your reputation primarily in commercial law and equity as well as commissions of inquiry you are an experienced advocate before icac appearing at compulsory examinations and public inquiries on many occasions in 2016 you appeared for the commissioner of the australian federal police in proceedings in the supreme court in which the plaintiff was suing the commonwealth and the state of new south

ongoing investigations concerning the conduct of financial services licensees and company directors your honor represented the respondent in the federal court class action relating to alleged pfas contamination at the raf base at tyndall in many cases you defended clients facing considerable trouble or painted by the media as guilty this of course is the test of our legal system defending such clients shows just how fair a legal system really is it's also excellent training for the bench iran was a regular advisor to the bar council and appeared in professional disciplinary matters concerning barristers and solicitors all this experience earned you a reputation as a very well-prepared advocate with an impressive courtroom presence your reputation as a cross-examiner was one of a methodical careful analytical approach and always in control of your materials your honor is very much missed at 11 wentworth had you not been called to the bench you would have been chair of the floor this year the first female chair at 11 wentworth your honor was the go-to person for advice with a well-worn path to your chambers your honor was on a professional conduct committee since 2010 and was a diligent and conscientious member of that committee you gave your time generously to talks and seminars and more recently for the new south wales bar association's open day for female law students your honour started on the bench just as covert hit and no special dispensation was given you dealt with complex and sometimes very old cases from day one you're already a prodigious publisher of judgments you've already established a reputation both on the bench and in chambers as a consummate professional in the spirit of your early mentor justice kevin lindgren and others who mentored you your honor is always looking to mentor younger staff they've been touched by how much you value their input and advice your focus work ethic and natural ability mean you're able to do justice in a relatively quick fashion allowing time for your family and to travel and these days you're taking up the piano again to decompress often some of the greatest lessons we learn are those we learn in our youngest years now as you continue to embark on this new chapter in a glowing legal career i've searched for words to encourage you further on that journey conscious you've already started it i come full circle and return to charlotte's web as i urge you to never hurry and never worry as you continue to provide your service to the law in your honours life thus far you've taken a careful considered and confident approach in your decision making this will continue to serve you well on the bench your appointment is an acknowledgement of your skills expertise and specialised knowledge that you've acquired throughout your service to the law and of the hard work dedication and personal sacrifices you've made congratulations belatedly on your appointment and i offer you the very best wishes for your career on the bench mate please the court miss warner okay please the court i too acknowledge the gadigal people of the urination the traditional owners of the land on which

behalf of the solicitors of new south wales to offer congratulations and wish your honor well in your appointment to the supreme court of new south wales and mindful of the important role that your family has played in your honors life i would like to acknowledge your family members and friends who are joining us today and who are applauding your appointment and in particular i acknowledge your husband scott and children hamish and sophie and i must say i'm really pleased to see another north sydney girls high old girl at jerome's farewell from 11 wentworth chambers eurona was remembered as quote diplomatic diplomatic yet effective clever but humble and an enabler of the right kind today i'd like to reflect on how these three attributes made your honor the silk of choice for solicitors the mentor of choice for junior council and the candidate of choice for the highest bench in new south wales so diplomatic yet effective your honours many achievements within the law are well known as is your effectiveness in the courtroom your honours persuasive advocacy style was evident as a young law student competing in moots and has only developed over the following decades after being admitted to the role of solicitors in february 1998 on valentine's day no less your honor would be called to the bar and go on to appear in many high profile and high consequence cases in commercial law inequity as well as quite a few outings in front of icac your honor is known to be very calm and measured and you must have certainly needed that in your i-cap practice where one has to expect the unexpected one is never quite sure what's going to come out of the woodwork or the next phone tap however your colleagues believe that what truly distinguishes your honor are the cases that aren't listed on your cv a barrister at 11 wentworth remembers one such case your honor was unwilling to sign off on a pleading until a whole lot more work had been done and some more facts shaken out of the client your honor understood that this might jeopardise the brief hardly a desirable outcome for a barrister running their own successful commercial practice but according to your former colleague at no point was that even a factor in your decision making your honor did go on to lose the brief but not your commitment to doing things properly might i say that saying no to a client is one of the difficult things that we sometimes have to do your honest success over more than two decades has been built on strong that strong foundation of integrity and in addition diplomacy intact in particular in your dealings with junior council your honor is known as having mastered the art of the cone of silence your colleagues know they can confide in you or if need be vent and it will go no further your honor is also known for treating everyone frankly and fairly whether clients solicitors colleagues opponents or judges the second attribute mentioned was clever but humble your honor possesses a formidable intellect and your former colleagues are effusive in their praise for your deep understanding of legal matters however your honor has never been one to dispense with preparation or to wing it in the courtroom your honest humility is reflected in how diligently you prepare for each case and the amount of thought you put into each matter in the words of one barrister i have never met any silk that has approached the case with the same amount of rigor and diligence as kate does uranus case notes are apparently the stuff of legend at 11 wentworth for some lawyers case notes mean one or two pages of high-level thoughts a bit like a one-pager for a university student preparing for exams but for your honor it was more likely to be a novel sized documents 70 pages plus setting out a clear chronology and including extracts from and references to all of the material in the brief the reason that your honest case notes reached such a legend legendary status was that your honor would share them freely with fellow barristers who joined the brief she had this incredible capacity to generate work that was just so useful for everyone one said on countless occasions your honor would find yourself correcting an expert or challenging a witness and their error was clearly evident with a quick reference to your detailed case notes your honor was also remembered as the very best of mentors and as the most supportive of colleagues or in their own words the right kind of enabler someone who helps others to be successful from sharing insights into commercial litigation to giving tips on managing and commercial practice your honor has been for many barristers and their lawyers uh phone a friend over the years she was always able to offer wise and steady counsel and you always had great comfort in trusting her opinion said one your honor has been lauded for your consistency for doing the right thing and for doing it well day in and day out your honor help your colleagues to remain balanced and to take care of themselves as well as their clients and your honor was never afraid to encourage junior council to speak up for themselves and to back their own approach in reviewing your career i am reminded of an obsolete observation made by her excellency the honourable margaret beasley aoqc governor of new south wales her excellency said you can be very very good at this game without being aggressive you just have to know when and how to stand your ground since taking silk in 2016 your honor has helped many junior council to stand their ground modeling diplomacy tact and strength as one barrister put it she will be a wonderful judge she will listen she won't have the need to demonstrate that she is the smartest person in the room she will listen and she will also make it very clear when she's heard enough another colleague has said she will be a wonderful judge because in her daily life she is measured self-contained and judicial and i am sure you are honing those judicial skills on your teenagers before i conclude and possibly because of the fact that i watched a bit of brazen hussies on ivy last night which is a documentary about the women's movement in the 60s and 70s i would like to channel my inner second wave feminist for a moment can i say how terrific it is that women at the bar are being recognised for their talent and outstanding ability in much greater numbers than ever before may that recognition increase exponentially in fact it appears that many of those outstanding women are named kate for example i have heard solicitors say when considering who to brief why don't we brief one of the kates i have also heard one of the kate's laugh that she's been confused with one of the other kates so one cage has gone to the bench allowing the other kates to consolidate their kate power and the bench has also benefited from some kate power it is terrific to see talented women from the bay and also from the ranks of solicitors appointed to our courts and tribunals because you are role models for those who follow your honour will bring a wealth of knowledge personal integrity and diligence to the supreme court of new south wales the people of new south wales are privileged to be served by you in this role and the solicitors of this state have every confidence that you will make an exceptional judicial officer of the supreme court of new south wales so on behalf of the solicitors of this state congratulations your honor you will be a wonderful role model as the court pleases just sweet chief justice judges mr attorney ms warner distinguished guests family and friends i too begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we gather this morning the gadigal people of the eora nation and i pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging and what a wonderful gathering this is particularly after the events of the past year thank you so very much for taking the time and doing the honor that you do to the court and to me by being here this morning thank you mr attorney and miss warner for your very kind words i'm grateful to your informants for sharing with you all of my best qualities and keeping some of my other qualities to themselves they have most certainly understated their own role in the progress of my career no person comes to this point without an army of people having supported and encouraged them along the way my army is magnificent and it has far too many members for me to thank them all individually today but i do welcome the opportunity to publicly thank those who have been my key influencers and supporters both in my career and in my life i'm deeply honored by the presence here today of her excellency the honourable margaret beasley acqc governor of new south wales i believe that i'm a member of the first generation of women in the australian legal profession who have been able to look up to and draw inspiration from other women in very senior roles in the profession her excellency has always been a leading light amongst those senior women as has the honourable patricia bergen sc former chief judging equity of this court who also honors me by being here this morning there is great truth in the saying that it's difficult to be what you cannot see my peers and i were able to see what we wanted to be the honourable margaret stone ao is another extraordinary woman who had an enormous influence on me at the very start of my career working for margaret as a law student and then as a junior solicitor i began to learn the art of independent critical thinking starting from first principles and taking nothing as given i also learned that adrenaline and coffee can sustain that critical thinking for up to 48 hours non-stop when absolutely necessary i learned the value of speaking less but saying more and i saw how if you were at the top of your game and spoke your opinion plainly a room full of people jostling for dominance would quieten down to hear what you had to say because when margaret spoke they couldn't afford not to listen and they knew it perhaps most importantly i learned that maintaining a sense of humor is even more sustaining in any stressful situation than coffee and adrenaline i have fond memories of margaret moving my admission as a lawyer in this very courtroom just over 23 years ago on valentine's day as ms warner reminded me and of then attending her swearing-in ceremony on her appointment as a judge of the federal court just a few years later i'm delighted that margaret is able to be here today together with two of the friends i first met working with team margaret at free hills all those years ago daniel kelly and sinead eastman i'm also touched that margaret's daughter elizabeth stone who has always been at the centre of that small friendship circle is here this morning in these friendships as in my friendships with kate richardson and erin kennedy two wonderful women i first met at the bar the good times and bad are shared the long periods of radio silence due to work demands and other commitments are tolerated and all hands are on deck in times of crisis i treasure them most young lawyers would give anything to have someone like margaret stone take them under her wing but my lucky cards dealt me another wonderful mentor the honourable kevin lindgren amqc kevin is also a great one for speaking less and saying more his intellectual brilliance extraordinary work ethic and unfailing courtesy and fairness had already won him a reputation as an outstanding judge by the time i started work as his associate little more than a year after his appointment to the federal court outside the courtroom kevin went out of his way to create a happy environment in chambers he was generous enough to share his thinking with me in the process of writing judgments and kind and patient enough to allow me into aspects of that work thinking back to kevin's approach to the work of a judge has given me much to aspire to as i find my feet in this new role kevin was of course instrumental in my being offered a readership on the 11th floor wentworth chambers when i first came to the bar that opened opportunities to work with many leaders of the bar those opportunities of course being broken by the legendary paul daly oam my practice simply would not have taken off as it did without those opportunities and without the generous support and encouragement of the very busy and talented barristers on the 11th floor throughout the whole of my time at the bar the one constant thing was that i loved the place that i came to work and the people amongst whom i worked each day i shared many war stories and tales of my opponent's tactics with my neighbours and good friends peter bram ian pike and perry hertzfeld although their stories always seemed more colourful than mine the occasional bout of mother guilt was shared in halved with vanessa whittaker i would call on kelly reeves now justice reese or amy munro when i needed an island of calm in the midst of a storm and justice reese could always be relied on to put the fire back in my belly before i had to re-enter that storm many of life's dilemmas were solved over a cup of tea with phil greenwood and if i needed a quick chat with a friend to get me through a late night working marathon i would invariably find the light on in the room on the other side of the floor that was then occupied by justice bell i will always feel privileged to have been a member of the 11th floor and i thank all of the floor members for their friendship over the years and i thank the wonderful staff and dayton melinda morris mandy allen and zach reimer for keeping the wheels turning for all of us i was also very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with many wonderful leaders and in more recent years juniors at the new south wales bar and for on other floors and from the melbourne bar and i thank all of them for their outstanding work and their companionship through many interesting and challenging matters many who were my friends at the bar are amongst my new colleagues on the court i've been quite simply overwhelmed by the generous generosity with which all of the judges have welcomed me and offered advice drawn from their own experience of the transition to the bench i remain deeply grateful for their support and i look forward to serving on the court with them i'm honored to have been given the opportunity to do so and i'm conscious of the responsibilities that travel with that honour i'm touched that many judges who are unable to sit on the bench this morning due to social distancing requirements have taken seats in the public gallery of the courtroom for this ceremony i also wish to thank my staff jasmine geary lachlan mcintyre and isabella farmy and until recently harry simons it is genuinely a pleasure to spend each working day with these intelligent insightful and considerate young people it never ceases to amaze me how they calmly keep everything in order regardless of what might have unfolded in court or behind the scenes on any given day finally but most importantly i wish to thank my family i owe them everything my brother nathan is quite simply the best brother in the world and he and i agree that we have the best parents in the world our parents were raised surrounded by love joy integrity and resilience but they could only dream of the opportunities for the kind that they later provided for nathan and i in their early twenties they made what must have been a difficult and daunting decision to move to sydney leaving their established lives in northern new south wales and nathan and i are in awe of the life that they built for us here from scratch it's really quite difficult to capture the essence of our parents in words so the best i think i can do is to share with you that nathan and i by some source of authority that remains a mystery bestowed on mum the post nominals qfe on the occasion of her birthday a few years ago it stands for queen of everything and dad is undoubtedly the king of everything and i'm so very happy that the king and queen of everything are able to be here today together with nathan his lovely wife danielle and their two beautiful daughters as you've already heard from the attorney when i was not quite 16 years old mum and dad sent me to germany on a student exchange program only after becoming a parent myself did i truly appreciate what courage it must have taken for them to send me to an unknown family on the other side of the world for three months as you've also heard that courage changed the course of my life because that unknown family remain our very close friends today and i arrived back home not only with a greater appreciation of german language and history but with something else that i suspect mum and dad hadn't quite bargained on when they bid me farewell a boyfriend who had been one of my fellow exchange students and who began arriving at their home with what must have seemed like alarming frequency in a roaring bright red vw beetle that you could hear coming from several blocks away scott and i married almost 10 years to the day after we first met on our flight to germany and he has been my best friend and my partner for the whole of my adult life it was scott who encouraged me to go to the bar and supported me financially while i established my practice he continued to support me at every stage bearing with amazing good grace and good humor the vicissitudes of being married to a barrister even whilst rising to the demands and challenges of his own very busy and successful career and coping with the joyful but chaotic years in which we were raising two young children when it all seemed too much scott was the calm voice of reason encouraging me to carry on in raising our children we had the constant love and support of both of our parents and extended families for which we're both very thankful i'm delighted that scott's parents david and diane are able to be here to get today together with my own family we also had karen who came to work with us when we first started our family and has been with us ever since karen has played many roles over the years but most importantly she is a unique combination of best friend and extra parent to our children and a friend to us as well and we are very grateful to her our children are now emerging young adults they have brought us more joy than i can begin to describe and have challenged us in ways that have undoubtedly made us better people they've created many hilarious moments that form the fabric of our features in years to come we are immensely proud of both of them when my youngest niece was told about my appointment she wanted to know the name of the television show on which i would be appearing as a joke i know it isn't dancing with the stars darling but i've always thought these ceremonies were a pretty good show so i hope you've enjoyed it thank you all again each and every one of you for being here this morning i'll stand this honorable court is now

optimized for nutrition functionality and flavor it's the combination of brown rice millet sorghum buckwheat's and a little bit of quinoa in formulating it it had to work in applications such as bread tortillas muffins cakes bagels and so I've proven all of those applications out and pizza yes we actually have a great multigrain whole-grain gluten-free pizza that we've created and it has terrific texture and has some chew to it terrific flavor well with the pizza operator obviously the most important thing is you put your match your flour to the pizza that you're trying to produce so if you're making a thin crust that's going to require a different flower than if you're making a chicago deep dish for instance so always start with what you're trying to produce and then back into your flour from there we make the whole range of pizza flowers from your lower protein winter wheat flours that are traditionally used in either a cracker thin crust or your chicago deep dish style all the way up to your high gluten flowers which are typically used in your new york style thin pizzas where you're looking for a very chewy texture you need good strength and tolerance to fermentation well base state has got six flower has six flour mills throughout the country we have a national footprint Bay State has been in the milling industry for a hundred and fifteen years we know flour we know the baking industry we know the pizza industry extremely well what almost every pits operator wants is a consistent flower day-in day-out crop your to crop year the same flower and that is what bay States prides itself on and we achieve that a number of different ways from the type of wheat that we buy how we procure those weeds how we blend those weeds how we mill the weeds and then ultimately we can blend flowers to ultimately get to the finished product specification that the customer is looking for contadino is a pizza flower that was developed at baystate milling about a year ago it is the vet was developed for neapolitan-style pizza a lot of pizza operators right now are importing that flower from Europe from Italy at a very very high cost what we've done is we've re-engineered that flower we analyzed it did all the testing on it and then with the wheats that we have we developed a product that matches if not actually it's better than the competitors flower we put it into field tests and it's worked extremely well and contact your local distributor that carries bay state flower and they can put you in touch with a bay state sales representative or you can call bay state directly

big report that was due and the only other person around here who doesn't he works out on vacation for two weeks so yeah brutal but then you remember you've made it you've fought the good fight and arrived at the most glorious part of the day that's right it's happy hour time and today is thirsty thursday at the local bar down the street which means one dollar margaritas and all you can eat nachos and you're meeting your best friend there in 20 minutes a calm immediately washes over you the dreariness of the day subsides you break into a grin because if there's anything more awesome than a delicious libation after a long day at work it's a cheap delicious libation after a long day at work it may seem like the least controversial take of all time happy hour is awesome but as much as we consumers might view drink discounts as one of our god-given inalienable birthrights as americans not everyone's on the same page especially if you live in the wrong place if you're heading to a bar and say albuquerque new mexico for instance that one dollar margarita would be illegal same thing in raleigh north carolina or boston massachusetts in richmond virginia you might not even know the deal existed but how come well brace yourself because it's time to talk about the war on happy hour i'm jared dieterle author of give me liberty and give me a drink and this is the right to drink make me a negroni margarita old-fashioned let's pop the champagne we've got a right to drink hey everybody and welcome to the show where we talk about drinking and everything that gets in the way today we're taking a metaphorical road trip to virginia new mexico and massachusetts to talk about what happens when happy hour becomes well less than happy our trip starts in northern virginia in 2009 when a man named jeff tracy decided to open a restaurant in an area called tyson's corner chef jeff as he's known was already a very successful restaurant tour by this point owning several well-regarded establishments in nearby washington dc and maryland as experienced as he was crossing over the border into virginia for his newest restaurant proved trickier than he'd imagined that's because virginia had something that neither dc nor maryland had a government that effectively outlawed happy hour you see a long-standing state law prohibited restaurants from advertising drink specials this meant that chef jeff wasn't allowed to publicly promote happy hours at his new restaurant he couldn't even have any exterior signs at his restaurant with the words happy hour on them now to be clear the drink specials themselves weren't illegal chef jeff just couldn't tell his customers about them without running foul of the law chef jeff refused to back down however and started to push for change and five years later in 2014 virginia's lawmakers surprisingly decided to listen to him well sort of they let chef jeff and his fellow virginia restaurant owners use phrases like happy hour at 5 pm or drink specials in their advertising but they still couldn't actually tell their customers what the specific specials were this meant that they couldn't say something as simple as three dollar beers from five to seven or one dollar margaritas every thursday the government even said that using catchy phrases like wind down wednesday or sunday funday was off limits [Music] jeff wasn't exactly satisfied with this timid reform but the prospects for boulder change seemed pretty unlikely the legislators having decided they fixed the problem moved on they lost interest in the issue and started ignoring chef jeff but a few more years down the road in 2018 chef jeff got a call out of the blue from a woman named anastasia bowden she said she worked at a non-profit public interest law firm called the pacific legal foundation and in her opinion virginia's ban on happy hour advertising was blatantly unconstitutional after all any law that prohibited a business from speaking about or advertising a legal product or deal was a law that restricted that business's basic first amendment rights anastasia wanted to know if chef jeff would be interested in joining forces to challenge virginia's law in federal court he was and by march of that year the battle was on my involvement with this case started because i was a washingtonian at one point like you and i knew of the law and i thought it was silly i would walk down the streets of virginia and see the billboards that said happy hour 7 p.m and i thought that's uh that's boring and i always had an interest in challenging the law and so when i went into a little bit of a google rabbit hole about it i saw that chef jeff jeff tracy who owns several restaurants in the dc area he had been very outspoken about this law and in fact he had written some sort of tongue-in-cheek tweets about it saying you know i'm not allowed by virginia law to tell you this but uh we're having happy hour so i thought that was kind of funny and i have been to chef jeff's myself uh before georgetown basketball game so i just rang him up and i said would you be interested in being a client and he was very enthusiastic about it because he felt passionately that this silly law was wrong and was inhibiting his free speech anastasia and chef jeff were often running but they had no idea how rocky the road ahead would be while all lawsuits are contentious after all that's kind of the point the way the virginia government reacted in this case was the equivalent of throwing a legal temper tantrum when we filed this case we had no idea that it was going to become the war that it was with the attorney general's office um i mean i'm having a post-traumatic stress just talking about this because it was truly one of the hardest fought legal battles that i've had um and we filed in the eastern district of virginia we failed in federal court and the government immediately moved to dismiss the case so we thought okay they're not even going to answer the complaint they're not even going to let us go to discovery they already want to fight about it on some technical procedural ground they're really serious about this um and in fact you know we were able to overcome that motion dismiss and after that we found out that they wanted to hire an expert they wanted to hire an expert at 300 an hour to prove their claim that this law was so necessary for virginians um so we knew that it was going to be a battle they engaged in discovery requests they asked our client to provide documents about every item he had sold in the past several years by hour in each of his restaurants and he owns many restaurants many of which are not in virginia and had nothing to do with this case um we were just deluged with these document requests and it was extremely honorous [Music] but then anastasia got clever sensing that the happy hour advertising ban was already tremendously unpopular with virginians and as a virginian i can attest that yeah it was she took to the court of public opinion if the state was going to use taxpayer dollars to hire expensive experts at 300 an hour and pay state attorneys to spend hours playing document request games then why shouldn't the public know about it um and so we started publishing op-eds about it we just went to washington post and we wrote a little article and we said this is how they're handling this and uh that really upset the attorney general's office they didn't like it and i understand why it's i think they found it a little bit embarrassing but what's embarrassing was their behavior here's where it gets weird though while virginia government officials were making anastasia's and chef jeff's life hell they were also clandestinely preparing for an unconditional surrender to the judge in the lawsuit they were saying this law is extremely important and must stay but in private they are meeting with virginia lawmakers and begging them to pass a bill that would repeal the state's ban on happy hour advertising and it wasn't hard to convince those legislators who themselves were tired of having to defend this law to go along in early 2019 a repeal bill sailed through the state legislature it passed 40-0 in the state senate and 94 to two in the state house just like that happy hour was set free in virginia advertisements started popping up promising those one dollar margaritas and ten dollar game day beer bucket specials the people rejoiced but the victory still rang a little hollow for anastasia you know chef jeff's happy i'm happy i'm glad that virginia is a freer place and a better place to do business now because of our lawsuit but the unfortunate part about it is that by passing this repeal bill they mooted our case and now they're free to go do it again in the future and in any any other form too you know it doesn't have to be a happy hour law but the same issue now is out there can virginia do this and we don't have a court order saying they can't and we were deprived of that because behind our backs they were lobbying for this repeal bill and so it's a it's a bittersweet one so a bittersweet victory but a victory nonetheless which is more than can be said in some other states where the tradition of prohibiting happy hour shows no signs of going away anytime soon we'll crank it up a notch by heading to new mexico and massachusetts

which provides a rollicking recipe-packed tour of america's most insane and laughable foods laws give me liberty and give me a drink is available from all major and independent bookstores also be sure to check out a website and weekly newsletter from the r street institute which covers the intersection of alcohol and our legal system [Music] why did world war ii pave the way for the martini how did central park influence the manhattan and what can a creepy internet message board tell us about resurrecting in aviation well you see a lot when you look at history's favorite drinks and how what we drink shapes history i'm greg benson and coming soon from heritage radio network this is back bar it's one thing when a law restricts the ability to advertise and talk about an activity in those situations like in virginia the first amendment can ride to the rescue but it's tougher when a law forbids that activity in the first place that's what states like new mexico do when applebee's recently announced plans to roll out their one dollar dollar ritas as glorious an example of unabashed but also kind of gaudy american capitalism as there ever was they had a problem they couldn't serve their dollar ritas in new mexico which forbids restaurants from discounting drinks to less than half their normal cost so there may be many advantages to living in new mexico warm weather gorgeous landscapes but access to dollar rita's is not one of them for its part massachusetts skips the complicated calculations on what level of discount is too much and just bans happy hour discounts entirely while towns like boston are known as boisterous fun-loving and easy drinking cities it's the restaurants and bar owners who are hit hardest by the bay state's blanket ban on drink specials take sam treadway co-owner and bar manager of back bar sam was crowned the best bartender in boston by boston magazine and backbar is without a doubt one of the best craft cocktail joints in the city for sam like many massachusetts bartenders the happy hour band creates a lot of unintended consequences so i've worked in massachusetts on and off for 15 years i've also worked in minnesota seattle and hawaii and so i definitely recognize that happy hour is a super useful selling point you can discount alcohol just a tiny bit but people get that idea in their head they're like oh this is a little cheaper heck yeah let's go it's a big draw and especially when you're trying to do anything and everything to spread out business so that your friday night everyone wants to come at like 9 00 p.m well it'd be really nice if half of those people were there at 6 pm or earlier it is something that is incredibly useful and incredibly frustrating that we can't do in massachusetts sam's point that bars use happy hour to spread out and diversify when they're busy is a good one if you serve great food and drinks at your restaurant you can probably expect that you're going to get a nice crowd around 6 or 7 each night but without happy hour how many people can you reasonably expect to show up at say 4 pm on a tuesday and for some bars happy hour is one of their key money makers during a given week some bars or restaurants are using happy hour as just like a gimmick to drive a little bit of extra sales during their slow times and other bars like really thrive on it where that is like where they do the majority of their sales is during these discounted times i mean i worked at a bar where monday nights was half price bottle of wine night it was in a college town and it was just hysterical how busy we were on mondays but that like generated a huge amount of sales on a monday it was a staple that if we didn't have those sales that would would be a problem because of course you know people have to stick around for a while drinking a bottle of wine and then they inevitably are ordering food and it becomes like a big night of sales when those types of sales drivers get cut off from a restaurant which already is usually operating on a razor thin profit margin it can become hard to make the math work in massachusetts this has led some establishments to desperately seek creative ways to replace that happy hour-shaped hole in their business model there are a lot of workarounds that bars do we've done on and off doing food specials like from 4 pm to 6 p.m you can get blank food item that you can't get any other time and that you know is a draw we also did something called genius hour which was free wi-fi at four o'clock so trying to advertise like hey come in with your laptop finish your work day and start drinking so that's like a cutesy way of like trying to promote happy hour but honestly none of them they all pale in comparison to the drink specials that people really associate with happy hour other shall we say less scrupulous bar owners than sam push the boundaries even more the language of the massachusetts law says that you can't sell alcohol for different prices at different times but some places and we're not going to name names here since that's not our style get around this by for example permanently offering a certain beer for one dollar and then they just so happen to be out of it at all times except for four to six on weekdays so here we can see another problem with a law like the massachusetts happy hour ban when you have a hard to enforce rule that applies to thousands and thousands of businesses and people spread throughout a state you'll always have varying degrees of compliance and the honest bar owners like sam they'll try to play by the rules while the shadier operators will see what they can get away with which in the end creates an uneven and unfair playing field for everyone but if massachusetts law wreaks so much havoc for drinkers and restaurateurs alike why does it exist is it just some legal relic from long ago that never got taken off the books surprisingly unlike most silly alcohol laws in most of the ones we discussed on the show massachusetts happy hour ban is fairly recent the state officially implemented the rule in 1984 and the putative reason at the time was that it was a response to a tragic and high profile drunk driving accident that resulted in fatalities it goes without saying of course that trying to prevent drunk driving is a good thing and we should want the government to try to protect us from situations where alcohol can cause people to hurt themselves and others after all protecting public health and safety is why we form governments in the first place but while sensible people can agree that some version of an anti-drunk driving law is important and should exist massachusetts happy hour ban hasn't really had a discernible effect on drunk driving in the state while drunk driving rates have declined in massachusetts since the early 80s they've done the same across the entire nation most researchers attribute this nationwide decline to mothers against drunk driving and other similar interest groups raising more awareness about the prevalence of drunk driving starting in the 80s in conjunction with the federal government increasing incentives and pressure on states to adopt lower blood alcohol content levels for what constitutes a dui today massachusetts is still close to tops in the nation when it comes to drivers who self-report that they've driven after having too much to drink and while the state's rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities is lower than many other states it's not significantly different than that of its neighbors like connecticut and rhode island and they do allow happy hour so in the end massachusetts has seen a healthy decline in dui rates as a result of a nationwide campaign against drunk driving but it stubbornly maintains a pretty unrelated happy hour ban and every dollar that goes towards enforcing the happy hour law is a dollar that is not going toward enforcing the state's real dui laws it's a good reminder of a truism when it comes to our convoluted system of alcohol regulation we should spend more time enforcing the good laws and less time over enforcing the silly ones that would be a win-win and we make everyone as happy as happy hour itself i'm jaret dieterle and i wrote today's episode of the show our show is produced and edited by greg benson host of the speakeasy and back bar

can encourage one another we can listen to the things that you want to teach us to show us about your word and your kingdom father we just delight in this day and we delight in this fellowship and everyone online everyone that's a part of supporting you and your kingdom we believe we have faith in you we do not want to be credited amongst those who are faithless we thank you and praise you father for all that you teach us to show us in your son yahushua's name amen welcome everyone online that's joining us everyone that is here so um a few things that we uh talk about each week and we've got new people with us today so we want to be sure to mention this this uh opening adoration that we have or that will be up here in just a moment this opening adoration is 85 from the psalms of king david david being a man that knew how to pray had a heart like the father so we love to proclaim these words to the almighty because all david was doing was magnifying who he is proclaiming who he is and exalting him so we love to do that in this opening adoration and the songs that we sing you will notice that his name will be spelled out yode vave we want you to feel comfortable pronouncing that name however you feel convicted to say it and the same would go for his son's name so with that being said would you join with me as we begin this opening adoration together blessed be he who spoke and the world came into being blessed be he blessed is he who maintains creation blessed is he who speaks and does blessed is he who decrees and fulfills blessed is he who has mercy on the earth blessed is he who has mercy on creatures blessed is he who gives good reward to those who fear him blessed is he who lists forever and endures to eternity blessed is he redeems and rescues blessed is his name blessed are you yahuwah our god king in the universe the god the merciful father who is praised by the mouth of his people praised and glorified by the tongues of devout ones and his servants we shall laud you yahuwah god with praises and songs and now psalm 100 a psalm for thanksgiving shout joyfully to yahuwah all the earth serve yahuwah with gladness come before him with joyful singing know that yahuwah himself is god it is he who has made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pastor enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise give thanks to him bless his name but yahuwah is good his loving kindness is everlasting and his faithfulness is to all generations we say this in the name of our master and our king yahushua amen and amen well we're going to begin a time of praise and worship in a moment to magnify the king of kings but psalm 100 has taught us a wonderful lesson it says that uh we're going to enter his course with praise but we should before that we should enter his gates with thanksgiving and i call it setting the table right so i know we all have something to be thankful about over the last six days so would you join with me as i lead us in a prayer of thanksgiving to give him an offering i want to tell you this we're at this three o'clock hour which the new testament is very good at showing us and teaching us it was the hour of prayer even for uh those in the new testament but in the to knock the old testament it was the hour of prayer then too and so a lot of special things happen so in the bible it calls this hour a moab like the feasts so here we are at the moed of 3 p.m and the moed of shabbat we get an opportunity to give this thanksgiving offering to him as a community imagine the the aroma the the fragrance that goes up the sweet smell that goes up to abba at this moment we get to do that before we praise and worship so join with me everyone online as we come to him with a thanksgiving offering father we come to you we thank you for all that you've done for us the last six days since the last shabbat we thank you for providing for us watching over us protecting us from sickness disease bodily harm and injury we thank you for the provisions you've given us we thank you for opening our minds to understanding your word and giving us enlightenment and discernment but

place over the last six days because you know what you can do that when the sun sets tonight you can do it tomorrow you think about and dwell on those things anytime but right now the king is

home to return to you to do the things that you say is right oh father we hear it the world is hearing it there's a coming and a returning back to you that is so amazing at sweeping this world and father we are witnessing prophecy we're seeing things coming to a point in the head and it's so awesome to watch people coming back to you father returning to the way our patriarchs our forefathers lay the foundations through your word that you gave and they're coming back thank you father we glorify you and praise you mighty one of israel it is you and your spirit that is doing these things in the earth before our eyes and the nations are witnessing it a people coming back to him it cannot be stopped glory be to your name master of the universe praise into your name king of kings you are the beginner and the finisher of our faith we praise you magnify you and your son yahushua's name we ask amen what a song how would you like to see the three singers of all those songs we heard today do a concert here would that be something one of the riders already comes here we've had one of the singers here before the other one we met in israel whenever we were in israel on a couple of our trips so he does make tours through here so maybe abba will work out something that that can happen so may it be so this is a very uh weighty time of our service we're in the midst of this this this hour of prayer and so we would like to invite you to come and offer your petitions before the almighty we want to do what james chapter 5 says and james 5 tells us and teaches us that is anyone sick among you he must call for the elders of the assembly they are to pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of yahuwah the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and yahuwah will raise him up and if he has committed sins they will be forgiven him therefore confess your sins to one another pray for one another so that you may be healed the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much so james gives us a very good picture of how to walk this out ralphie is going around so you can some of you can come this way and back up against this bema here uh that way rafi can make his way out uh to all that's out there that are receiving so what's the big point about james 5. so the big point about james 5 is repentance so james 5 says that we need to repent of all of our sins iniquities and transgressions there are three things there the dimensions and all three need to be acknowledged if you don't believe me go to leviticus chapter 26 and he goes into very detail of a a formula if you will of how to approach abba and what we're to do very very explicit it's missed in in most communities but there's a way god asks us to approach him and so if we want him to hear these petitions which are very weighty we want we we you know we love one another so we want to lift up each other's petitions but we must clean this house every person in here and everyone online scripture is very clear no one is without sin and we cannot approach the father what did yeshua tell the man lay down your offering with the sign of the covenant the very sign and revolution as your people at this hour of prayer on this day of your shabbat a devil moed and we admit that we've sinned transgress committed iniquity before you we walked our way and not your way we turned our back on the commandments broke them we walk contrary to you and you walk contrary to us we have only opened shame but you have been righteous in everything you've done concerning us father we ask for your forgiveness we accept your offering of your son messiah you shall on our behalf and we acknowledge the sins iniquities and transgressions of our forefathers and we would ask that you would cleanse us of all of our uncleanness and all of our impurity by the blood of the lamb we ask these things in your son yahushua's name amen amen father yahweh great and mighty you are father you are unique there is none like you that was or ever will be father you are the author of life and you you're the one that directs him the footsteps of humanity you set the boundaries for for us father

yahuwah and let your enemies be scattered let those who hate you flee from you for from zion the torah will come forth and the word of yahuwah from yushlam blessed is he who gave the torah to his people israel in his holiness amen and amen it's kind [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] it is a tree of life to those who grasp it and those who support it are blessed its ways are pleasant ways and all its paths are peace cause us to return to you yahuwah and we shall return renew our days as of old we say this in the name of our master and king yahushua a man and a man you notice that that that same comes from proverbs 3 17 through 18 and lamentations 5 21 as you can tell we love scripture here you may be seated and now we have our torah our torah portion uh devarim deuteronomy 2 1 through 3 and mr alfonso is ready to rock and roll here there's one right here all right mr alfonso take her away shall we call him the voice part two deborah deuteronomy 2 1 2 3 22. then we turned and departed into the wilderness the way of the sea of wreaths as yahuwah spoke to me and we went round mount sierra many days and yahuwah spoke to me saying you have gone around this mountain long enough turn northward and commend the people saying you are about to pass over into the border of your brothers the descendants of esau who live in sierra and they are afraid of you so be on your guard do not strive with them for i do not give you any of their land no not so much as one footstep because i have given mount sierra to esau as a possession what food you buy from them with silver you shall eat and also what water you buy from them with silver you shall drink for yahuwah your elohim has barack you and all the work of your hand he has known your wandering through this great wilderness these 40 years yahuwah your elohim has been with you you have not lacked any matter and when we pass beyond our brothers the descendants of esau who dwell is here away from the way of the desert plain away from iliac and edson gibber return and pass over by the way of the wilderness of moab and yahuwah said to me do not distress moab nor stare yourself up against them in battle for i do not give you any of their land as a possession because i give an r to the descendants of lot as a possession the emits had dwelt there formerly a people as great and numerous and tall as the anakin they were also reckoned as raphael's like the anakin but the moabites called them eomites and the horites firmly dwelt in sierra but the descendants of esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their place as israel did to the land of their possession which yahuwah gave them now rise up and pass over the wide azir so we passed over the wadi's era and the time we took to come from qadesh barnia until we passed over the wadi's era was 38 years until all the generation of the men of battle was consumed from the midst of the camp as yahuwah had sworn to them and also the hand of yahuwah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed and it came to be when all the men of battle had finally perished from among the people yahuwah spoke to me saying this day you are to pass over at r the boundary of moab and when you come near the children of ammon do not distress them nor stare yourself up against them for i do not give you any of the land of the children of ammon as a possession because i have given it to the descendants of lot as a possession that was also reckoned as a land of raphaites raphaites firmly dwelt there but the ammonites called them zamund zimmerman a people as great and numerous and tall as the anakin but yahuwah destroyed them before them and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place as he had done for the descendants of esau who dwelt in sierra whom he destroyed the horites from before them they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place even to this day and the aoween who dwelt in villages as far as azah the catherine who came from cathedral destroyed them and dwelt in their place arise depart and pass over the wadi arnhem see i have given unto your hand sihon the amorite sovereign and hesman and his land begin to possess it and stir up yourselves against him in battle this day i began to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples under all the shamayim who when they hear the report of you shall tremble and shake because of you then i sent messengers from the wilderness of kedama to see han sovereign of heshman with words of peace saying let me pass over through your land on the highway i shall go on the highway and turn neither to the right nor to the left what food you sell me for silver i shall eat and what water you give me for silver i shall drink only let me pass over on foot as the descendants of esau who dwelt in sierra and the morbidites who dwelt and are did for me until i pass over the yardine to the land yahuwah our elohim is giving us but sihan sovereign of heshman will not let us pass over for yahuwah your elohim harden his spirit and strengthen his heart to give him into your hand as it is this day and yahuwah said to me see i have begun to give sehan and his land over to you begin to possess in order to possess his land and see hon and all his people came out against us to fight a yehats and yahuwah our elohim gave him over to us so we smote him and his sons and all his people and we took all his cities at that time and we put the men women and little ones of every city under the ban we left none remaining only the livestock we took as plunder for ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we captured from error which is on the edge of the wadi arnan and the city that is by the wadi as far as gilad there was not one city too high for us yahuwah our elohim gave all to us only you did not go near the land of the children of anan ammon anywhere along the wade yabak or to the cities of the mountains or wherever yahuwah or elohim had commanded us then we turned and went up to bashan and og sovereign of bastion came out against us he and all his people to battle at adria and yahuwah said to me do not fear him for i have given him and all his people and his land into your hand and you shall do to him as you did to see hon sovereign of the amorites who dwelt at heshman so yahuwah our elohim also gave into our hands og sovereign of bastion with all his people and we smote him until he had no survivors remaining and we captured all his cities at that time there was not a city which we did not take from them 60 cities all the district of arga the reign of ogg and bastion all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars besides a great many unwalled towns and we put them under the ban as we did to see han sovereign of heshman putting the men the women and the children of every city under the ban but all the livestock and the spoil of their cities we took as booty for ourselves and at that time we took the land from the hand of the two sovereigns of the amorites that was beyond the yardine from the wadi arnan to mount hermon sidonians called hermann shirion and the amorites call it senior all the cities of the plain all gilead and all bastion as far as salka and idri cities of the reign of ah in bastion for only og sovereign of bastion was left of the remnant of the raphaipes see his bedstead was an iron bedstead is it not in rabbah of the children of ammon nine emma is its length and for emma is with according to the emma of man and this land which we possessed at that time from error which is by the wadi arnan and half the mountains of gilead and its cities i gave to the reubenites and the gaydights and the rest of gilead all bastion the reign of og i gave to half the tribe of menasha all the district of arga with all bastion called the land of the raphaiites yahir son of menasha had taken all the district of arga as far as the border of the gesherites and the mayakai lights and called them after his own name in habashan how with ye air to this day and to make here i gave gilead and to the reubenites and the gaddites i gave the gilead as far as the wadi arnhem the middle of the wadi as the border as far as the wadi yabek the border of the children of ammon and the desert plane with the yardine as the border from kenarith as far as the sea of the arabah the salt scene below the slopes of pisgah on the east and i commanded you at that time saying yahweh your elohim has given you this land to possess all you sons of might pass over arm before your brothers the children of israel let your wives and your little ones and your livestock i know that you have much livestock stay in your cities which i have given you until yahuwah has given rest to your brothers as to you and they also possess the land which yahuwah your elohim is giving them beyond the yarding then you shall return each man to his possession which i have given you and i commanded yahushua at that time saying your eyes have seen all that yahuwah your elohim has done to these two sovereigns yahuwah does the same to all the reigns which you are passing over do not fear them for yahuwah your elohim himself fights for you and i pleaded with yahuwah at that time saying oh adonai yahuwah you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand for who is a mighty one in the shamayim or on earth who does according to your works and according to your might okay [Applause] 22 was the last one okay father we thank you for the reading of your word we give you praise and glory open our eyes and our ears help us to understand and uh help us to learn what you want to teach us today may it take root that we might be changed we might be different that we might come to love you and love our neighbor greater in a better capacity and to come to a greater uh relationship with you we give you praise and glory and your son yahushua's name amen okay so that's not the beginning slide but i wanted to um you might have to turn the other lights out for just a second ralphie so the equinox was just a few days ago uh many of you are getting the calendar and it was brought to my attention that i failed to explain how the month is called out so i'm going to explain that just real quick briefly and so since the equinox took place three days ago when the day and night was equal it's win the equinox and that's popped up and so the sun has given the light to the moon so now we have uninterrupted light for the the whole rest of the night so the sun sets the moon takes over and before the moon sets the next morning the sun pops up and now we still of uninterrupted light until the sun sets up next evening so this is what happens from that full moon part okay so from the full moon the sun will start moving and so at uh the moon is now moved uh when it sets the moon is now when it goes below the horizon the moon will be straight above halfway uh a quarter way or say halfway from the full moon to the new moon okay so the moon is up straight up here after the sun sets are you with me so far okay so the critical part is how do you determine the new moon well that's in this next slide okay so if you can see here like i use my tools when the sun sets in the east you see the big e here when the sun sets the moon is going to be in a sliver position just like it is when those of you that have looked to the west for the sliver it's going to be in the same spot in the west but it's going to be in the morning at say 5 5 30 whatever time uh just before the sun i i said sunsets before the sun rises i'm sorry so before the sun rises here uh in the east you're gonna see a sliver of the moon at the end of the month and then the next morning you won't see it it won't be there that's how you know it's a new moon so when you don't see the moon that following morning from this last liver that evening you declare rosh kodesh so we do watch the moon it's just when the moon becomes dark so let me share with you a couple of things that abba taught me when does you know because these people always say well it it the moon the the month begins when the light appears okay wait a minute did life appear on the seed when it was sprouted or when it was in the covering of darkness in the ground did life appear in the ground or once it sprouted when did the life appear in the in the covering right so when the moon is covered that's the beginning how about a baby does life begin when the baby comes out of the womb or when the baby is in the covering of darkness in the womb see god teaches us through nature when things begin all right so whenever you see that sliver the next morning you don't see it it's in a state of coveredness it's in a covering psalm 83 talks about blow the shofar at the new moon at the uh our feast day well this actual word in that verse is kise look it up this actually means covered so this new moon is a covered moon all right so that's how you determine the month so here in a uh shortly this the what is it on the calendar the 12th or the 14th i think it's the 12th isn't it so i want you guys to be looking out uh let me turn over here so you can see when it is okay month one begins on the 12th but you won't see the moon on the 11th that morning and on the 10th you will see the sliver that morning before the sun rises so on the 10th of april you'll see the sliver just before the sun rises the 11th of april you will not see it you declare the rosh kadesh that night which is evening the evening would would be pretty much all of the 12th so that's how the month is called out if i didn't explain it correctly if you have questions please go ahead we'll take one but the rest of you ask at the end of service and i'll answer your questions yes go ahead i just had something to add to that mark and i never understood it till right now i come from a town with 67 italian descent they planted at exactly the covering at the new moon so that shows you their tricks and it works a lot of them planted before that they planted weeks after and it works yeah abba is very uh explicit on his instructions so uh this is the way i see to call out the month and the year so observe it with me and see what you think okay all right so i'm going to switch gears up here to the beginning of our slideshow and so i've titled today's message this spiritual state of faithlessness i mean ralphie was doing a study on the in-depth and he was doing a lot of talking about uh truth and faith and belief and so here my message is titled uh the spiritual state of faithlessness which if we were to base it on the way ravi was teaching the way that would mean a state of lack of belief okay so let's see if that really works out that way how the scriptures teach us uh i also want to state um unless all word unless noted all word definitions are from the theological word book of the old testament theory for greek hebrew and greek strong numbers are highlighted beside the tdot and there in green so we're going to talk about in our prophet portion of habakkuk chapter 3 and in our new testament portion of romans chapter 9 both of these men are grieving over the spiritual state of the nation of their people they're both showing how saddened they are at the state of the family the state of the people so those two portions led me into what we're going to talk about today so we are going to have a few more pictures of the heavens here so bear with me let's read habakkuk 3 9. habit 3 9 says stretching your stretching you will stretch your bow seven scepters says yahuwah a land of rivers will be torn asunder in the greek septuagint so stretching your bow where do you think habakkuk got the idea that the almighty was stretching his bow because in the heavens there's a constellation called in biblical astronomy the conqueror going forth to conquer and it's pictured with a man a redeemer with a bow and arrows bow in his hand and arrows big quiver of arrows you think habakkuk had an idea of that you think the almighty was telling him hey i know you guys know the story and that guy you see that you know is a redeemer he's going to stretch his bow and this redeemer is facing an enemy and the enemy is um scorpio the scorpion and he's ready to shoot the enemy and do battle with the enemy ophicus is above the scorpion stepping on the scorpion with his foot and wrestling a snake and centaurus is on the other side with a spear we're going to see him in just a minute so there's a battle going on here three verses or these verses in habakkuk are a result of faithlessness in israel so habakkuk is seeing this abba is telling him and he's letting him know that there's destruction coming upon my people because they have been faithless that doesn't mean they were just they weren't thinking about anything in their mind like rafi said earlier they failed to do mental jam gymnastics about yeah i believe yeah i believe they were lacking something else that we're going to point out okay so he goes on to say in verse 10 of habakkuk 3 and rafi was he was reading the scriptures about the mountains the mountains saw you and quaked the downpour of water swept by and the deep uttered forth its voice it lifted high its hands so what is abba using for judgment the same things he used in the exodus he's using nature's using the elements that we see and so when we see that these things happen man will say oh that's just a freak of nature but those that know him and read his word they know no the one that wields those things he is the one that's behind it verse 11 sun and the moon stood in their place they went away at the light of your arrows there's the arrows from uh what you call sagittarius which is actually the conqueror going forth and at the radiance of your gleaming spear see centaurus here has got a spear in his hand and he's stabbing the enemy the the heavens declare the glory of god and they're telling of those same wonders that the prophets are revealing this this centaurus he is a two-natured redeemer now the greeks perverted it by having a horse and a man but this this one part of one thing one part another all you need to know is it means a dual natured part deity and part human dual natured redeemer that's what that whole dual thing is uh revealing he's piercing a victim and he is the the victim is the despised sin offering okay so habakkuk 3 12. in indignation you marched through the earth and in anger you trampled the nations what does it mean to trample the nations well this hebrew word for trampled is this uh hebrew word this and it's a verb indicating a threshing a treading out to trample it means to trample grain or other objects it is used figuratively of israel's threshing the mountains of the arameans devastated of israel's army and chariots under jehoiaz as if they were the dust left over after threshing grain of yahuwah's devastation and trampling of moab like straw in a manure pile you can find these examples in our habakkuk 3 12 and in amos and isaiah so if if the father doesn't change and this is the way he tramples the nations when he says i'm going to come back and i'm going to prove myself holy in the nation's eyes through you those of you that are coming back to the lord how do you think he's going to do that he's going to trample them the same way he always tramples them it's coming going on to verse 13 you came forth for the salvation of your people oh wait a minute i thought that was a new testament theme no he's coming forth for the salvation of his people to save in the in our greek and our new testament when you see saints it means holy or anointed ones to save your saints or to save your anointed ones you cast death to the heads of the who notice in your english it doesn't say lawless give me some words that it uses for lawless in your english huh wicked but what does wicked mean the greek nails it the greeks very clear no wicked is people who are without god's law lawless remember second thessalonians says that the hacitan the adversary is the lawless one we don't want to be like them folk don't want to be like that hand up here what you're saying reminds me of romans the first second chapter where god they knew god but he didn't recognize god that's right a lot of people know god in their mind but do they know him the way that god wants them to know him in an intimate relationship like a husband and wife so that's how the greek points it out going verse on further to verse 16 i heard and my inward parts trembled at the sound my lips quivered decay entered my bones and in my place i tremble because i must wait quietly for the day of distress the day of calamity that's coming for the people to arise who will invade us and though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines who and what do you think he's talking about he just said that there were people that were lawless meaning they weren't bearing fruit and then he says there's no fruit on the fig tree or on the vines that reminds me of what uh the whole thing about what the master said about the fig tree look at mark 11 13. seeing at a distance a fig tree and leaf he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for the figs something that should be bearing fruit but isn't wow luke 13 6 says and he began telling this parable a man had a fig tree which he had planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any and he said to the vineyard keeper behold for three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any cut it down why does it even use up the ground and he answered and he said to him let it alone sir for this year too until i dig around it and put in fertilizer and if it bears fruit next year fine but if not then cut it down in other words when the almighty takes the time to sow into you and still pour into you and still feed you with the word and yet you still turn your back on him and shake your hand and say i don't want any part of it now you know why the fig tree has to be cut down now you know why it's of no use anymore it's tough words but it's the word and it's truth going on to verse 18 it gives us some hope that we're going to close on this verse at the end of the message today he gives us hope in all of this the coming calamity he knows imagine he's just been told that a nation is going to invade them and going to bring calamity and what does he say i exalt in yahuwah and i rejoice in the elohim of my deliverance yahuwah the master is my strength and he makes my feet like those of deer and makes me walk on my high places you see in the face of calamity when we're walking right with god let us rejoice let us give thanks and let us lift his name up on high this isn't time to to waller in a pity and waller in sadness the the almighty has a reason for coming he's coming to bring calamity because he he cares about his people and he wants to correct them like a father wants to correct his disobedient child he loves them enough to come and bring correction he's not going to leave them just to keep messing up and and have death written all over them he brings judgment so that they'll pay attention and wake up i don't even know it's coming does your bible tell you it's coming yes it does so we can rejoice have you ever felt like this have you ever felt like you've gone around the mountain long enough have you ever felt like abba is telling you you've done this long enough it's time to move on every time i see this scripture i always like to point out because you know some of you may be in that season right now that this is for you that i was telling you you've been going around that mountain long enough you've been beating that horse it's time to move on i also like to point out what he's telling them here is you've been doing your own ways and desires long enough and now you need to heed the word of yahuwah and does i've asked you to do quit relying on your own strength quit relying on your own wisdom and your own counsel and come to me as that song says come to me return to me wholeheartedly give submit to me wholeheartedly give me your whole being let me have it and have faith that i will decide right for you we're going to talk about that deciding right for you here in a moment uh verse seven in our torah portion uh of deuteronomy which i'm meant to say we're in deuteronomy chapter two here now uh going on to verse seven he says for yahuwah your elohim has blessed you in all the work of your hand he has known you're wandering through this great wilderness these 40 years yahuwah your elohim has been with you and you have not lacked any matter but you know what even though they didn't lack anything they were still grumbling and complaining and bitterness wasn't there people still griped even though they had everything and lacked nothing got to get that griping and complaining out if you do then blessings come in an amazing way going on to verse 14 and that and the time we took to come to qadesh barnaya until we passed over the wadi zared was 38 years until all the generation of the men of battle was consumed from the midst of the camp as yahweh had sworn to them i read this and something new came to my mind that i have to share with you this week i realized that even though i knew it this new realization came to me i knew that they all died in the wilderness and they couldn't come in to the promised land because they had to perish in the wilderness all the ones that sinned at the spy incident right when he told them to go and spy they didn't come with a good report and they didn't have faith they were faithless in him so those faithless ones had to die they couldn't see the promised land even moses acted faithlessly could not go in and see the promise so i just realized oh my goodness it takes a 40-year portion a 40-year time span to get rid of the people that uh have done wickedly and can't be a part of it so and i should say not wickedly that people who have have had not trusted in abba and had not relied upon him so brings me to a reminder of the oslo accord what year was that done i had to look it up 1993. what's 40 years from that 20 33 exactly 2 000 years from the time of his death exactly two days see that it was a bad deal to do what they did with the oslo accord it wasn't good nobody knows it wasn't good and whether or not that is the same i just find it interesting that a 40-year period had to take place so that the people who were part of the bad deal could not come into the next thing a blessing that was going to happen my hand was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed then once they were gone i could bring them into the inheritance the ones that were not a part of that deal interesting going on to verse 25 on this day i want you to begin to put your trembling on this day to put your trembling and your fear upon the nations beneath the sky who when they hear your name will be troubled and i have and have pains because of you in other words when the righteous rise up it gets behind them then this comes a fear a trembling over you comes upon the nations because of what god almighty is doing god puts a fear in them just like he did when they were wandering through the desert every time they came to a nation they were the nations were trembling because they knew what happened in the exodus so whenever this great exodus happens a fear is going to happen across the earth because they know what has happened and who god is now representing and they're going to tremble and the army or the the number of you all is going to be enormous scripture says it can't be counted yes i was thinking about israel all these nations that are coming against israel will they be afraid of what has been spoken back in deuteronomy they're all going to said they will tremble the scripture says that egypt is going to come to know the almighty and build an altar at the border and make sacrifices to the almighty they're going to worship him it's hard to imagine but if you look at i believe it's psalm 84 it might give you a little idea of how that might happen yes a rabbi this might be an inappropriate subject at this time but after the high priest will they be given another shot i i'm not sure i always like to believe that the almighty is he doesn't wish that anyone would perish and i would like to think that there's going to be lots of chances for everybody i mean did everybody have a chance at the flood right until the door was shut they did when the raindrops were coming and the sprinkling started when let's let's let's go this way when the animals were passing a mall and heading towards the ark they had an opportunity to you know this got to be something let's go get on but they didn't so there's always the opportunity god is merciful he's gracious he's compassionate as i've said before david did not want to fall in man's hands he wanted to fall in god's hands because he knew god was merciful okay brought this up on tuesday so in this book review that we're doing on isaiah 53 what does it mean i thought i knew what the word chosen means but what does it mean to be chosen the elect the the saints the the chosen ones well i want you to notice that in the yellow to be chosen in hebrew bihar it means that someone's going to decide for you well mark what does that mean that someone's going to decide for me it means that when you become chosen you've relinquished your own wills and desires like what eve wanted i i can choose what tree i want and you're gonna say i'm going to trust him and he'll decide for me what's right and wrong and how i should live when you can do that then you're chosen when you can relinquish all of the flesh once and all that sin and the evil inclination wants and submit to god and say i want a relationship with you and whatever you decide for me i'm ready to do i'll give you an example my mom who now keeps shabbat and doesn't eat unclean but back when i first came into this there was a little between her and i there's a little bit of headbutting going on i say a little bit lightly but she uh she's 102 this year uh but she uh yeah she said but you know i had to use an example for her i said mom if the almighty tells me to go outside and grab a handful of grass throw it in the air and do three circles i'm not going to question it i'm going to submit to it and i'm going to do it why would i question it i don't want to be like the guy that says why does it have to be the jordan why can't i dip seven times over here that's because abba said not to he said over here people got to get it you've got to let him do the deciding when you do the blessing comes when he finally said okay i'll do it in the jordan the blessing came he got healed so this word bakar is here in deuteronomy 7 6 for you are our holy people to yahuwah your eloheim yahuwah your elohe has decided for you i will decide for you to be a people remember in the garden he's telling them he's deciding for them don't eat that that's off limits don't eat that you can eat over here but don't eat that he's deciding for them this hassetan says oh no no no you can make up your own rules you can decide for yourself what to do you don't need that just go ahead and eat it decide for yourself it's okay to eat it that's when you lose the opportunity of chosen and they got booted out yes it just reminds me of the concept of being a bond servant yes give yourself up that's right yeah lead me to the door post the mezuzah and let let pierce my ear uh because i'm staying with the master i don't want to go out and be in the world i'm i'm safe here it's abundant of food here this this master has uh 500 head of cattle and 300 head of goats and sheep and and uh there's there's all kinds of there's the fields are full of grain and why would i go anywhere else put me to the door post i'm staying how about you can go free don't want to i'm staying right here okay then i've got to pierce your ear but it says the torah take this bon if you want to stay you don't want to be set free pierce your ear with uh all and you're going to now be a bond servant great this is a great place i want anywhere else yes rabbi when when explicitly told what to do don't tap the rock that's right don't don't speak to it and tap it okay so we got this i want to give you a couple of analogies here imagine the game of basketball well let me go to this one you got a dad he's holding a baby i'm using this because i saw my son do this with his son uh yesterday you got this dad he's holding a baby picks the baby and he's holding the baby in one hand a little bit of a wobbling but that baby that's let's say he's under a year completely trusts the dad wholeheartedly there's no doubt in the baby's mind not even a not even fear there was no fear in that baby's mind complete trust he's got me this is fun i don't want to be in that spot of lacking trust in what he decides for me that is right wrong and what's good this is what gets everyone in trouble not trusting him to make the decisions for me that it's okay hey you can go and take those people remember the 10 with the report i don't know if we can do it i don't know if i can trust that that's not good okay deuteronomy 26 then i sent messages from the wilderness of kadamoth to sikhon sovereign of heshman with words of peace saying let me pass over through your land on the highway i shall go on the highway and turn neither to the right nor to the left that's a hebraic understanding of staying on the path god's word i don't want to go the right or the left i don't want to add to or take away what food you sell me for silver i will eat and what water you give me i for silver i will drink only let me pass over on foot as the descendants of esau who dwell in seer and the moabites who dwell in uh are did for me until i pass over the yard into the land of yahuwah our elohim is giving us so they present the same offering that they presented to the other two and something interesting about this but sihon sovereign of heshman would not let us pass over yahuwah elohim hardened his spirit like he did with pharaoh and strengthened his heart made in other words made him stubborn so that to give him into your hand as it is this day why did abba want this to happen why did abba want this hardening to take place so that this battle would ensue instead of passing through peacefully and buying stuff like the other two nations why did he want it to happen i'm going to give you two ideas one abba set this battle up with sihon so that one the nations would hear it and see it and be afraid and two by doing the battle themself it's now forcing them to take possession he's setting up the table so that they actually are physically taking possession of what he gave them as an inheritance oh but he's going to take me over and i'm just going to walk in i'm not going to have to do a thing oh read this one again because they're going they're going into the promised land and if you believe the accidents will repeat then you better believe this will repeat it may very well be that you're going to be set up to take possession meaning you're going to have to route somebody to take possession guess what that does for you can you imagine when nobody is slain of god's army and many are wiped out as a matter of fact it says the whole the whole people are wiped out what does that say is that a confidence builder does that let you know that only the hand of a god can make that happen where i know that my brother's fighting five guys over here and and he beats them all wanting to build confidence in his people he's wanting them to say i'm going to go in and take it god is doing it but i'm physically involved in the work i'm going on to verse 31 and yahuwah said to me see i have begun to give sihon and his land over to you now begin to possess it in order to possess this land take it i'm giving him to you take it confidence maybe to show the nations but guess what in the hebrew these verbs are what action he wants his people to be actively taking possession an action oh i i believe it's gonna happen i just have faith it's gonna happen call me when it's over i'm gonna sit here in my recliner and let me know when it's done no it's a matter of fact when reuben and gad said hey we'll take possession over here they said oh you're going to actually take arms and you're going over with us because you're not going to sit over here and enjoy things you're going to it took action their faith took action to back it up jeremiah 3 22. now the song we sang returned to me i didn't set this stuff up god does this you can see how god weaves everything in together return o faceless sons i will heal your faithlessness which is the hebrew word mashuva backsliding disloyalty i like this word disloyalty because disloyalty means lack of support what do you mean you mean faith is is actually showing support yeah we're going to get into that here in a minute behold we come to you for you are yahuwah this noun appears 12 times 9 of which are in jeremiah twice in hosea backsliding had a whole used to have a whole different view of what backsliding was has become a way of life to the people of the time which is why the judgment has to come this loyalty and which indicates that israel may still be cured from such a lamentable condition who's the cure yeshua only in proverbs 1 32 is mashuva applied to an individual the turning away or heir of the simple shall slay him another way to look at it is tropically calamity ruined destruction because guess what when i become disloyal what comes ruin calamity and destruction do you see how they're tied what's happening because of the backsliding he brings calamity ruin and destruction upon them the one brings inevitably the other they're tied together but if i obey and i am loyal and i'm faithful it brings blessing security isaiah 53 3 says this but his form was without honor failing beyond all men a man being in calamity and knowing how to bear sickness hmm you mean he bore our calamity which is here in in the number two and he took care of our sickness oh that was a result of our backsliding that was a result of our disloyalty that was a result of our faithlessness he came and took that so that we didn't have it oh yeah this one bears our sins and suffers pain for us because we were going to have to suffer that stuff and we accounted him to be in trouble and calamity and ill treatment yeah somebody had to do it either you or he had to step in and do it for you but he was wounded because of our acts of lawlessness the septuagint says different than what it says in the english he was wounded crushed because of our acts of lawlessness which is what we're talking about here faithlessness and he has been weakened because of our sins our iniquity our transgressions upon him was the discipline for our peace and by his bruises we have been healed do you see who took this punishment of the result of backsliding for you the lack of faith acts 26 18 says this i came to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of hasatan to elohim that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith the greek word is pestis in me this word you can see below it piste which is a form of the pestis is faith belief trust value and proof i need something more concrete than that show me what that means john 6 35 says yahushua said to them i am the bread of life and he who comes to me will not hunger and he who believes in me will never thirst again a form of pistus which is pristine it means to believe and to trust what's the common word between the two what is the common word trust trust appears in both of the greek definitions does it not it's the only one that appears in english this that's common but where do we get the word trust from believe is found 292 times in the bible but only 39 times in the whole old testament so this idea of belief in the greek really got promoted it's only 39 times in all of the tanakh but it's the word for amman we're going to look at here in a minute the greek word here is this pistol or form of it but trust is almost never appears in the new testament why is trust almost void in all of the new testament this word emmet truth is a root word of amman trust a word often translated as believe but really means support i'm going to say that again when you're looking at the word faith in in the new testament it is rooted in the idea of supporting something so let me read it this way that they may receive forgiveness of their sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by support in me how do i support him how do i support the savior so he's a general in the army not really but metaphorically he's a general in the army how do i support that general how do i what what was it how do i support him you know my wife is at the stove she's got three pans on cooking and trying to chop this and do this and she got her hands full i'm sitting on the couch having fun doing whatever feet up in the air you know just enjoying life and she say i could use some help in here honey i have faith that you're going to get that meal cooked out and cranked out i have faith that it's going to get done i believe i believe that it's going to get done are those words and that mental gymnastics of faith going to get us anywhere except me in trouble but how do i show my support and what she's doing in that kitchen and cranking out a meal for us do you see how this idea of support and how this idea of faith are connected and how we can get a better understanding of when a new testament tells us that we must have faith in him that i've got to this support means something revolving action if i'm going to support the messiah and all that he's come to do and his kingdom i'm not going to do it by just sitting in my couch going i believe i have faith it'll happen yeah yeah yeah get it it's going to happen no support in isaiah 22 23 where it says i will drive him like a peg in a place of support that's this word truth trust how does a tent peg support the tent it's firmly placed in the ground that tint peg is driven and i got to tell you the tent that living messiah has it's a thousand square foot military tent they're big pegs they go they go deep into the ground because the tent requires a lot of support the peg's not laying there on the ground going i believe that tent's gonna go up and it's gonna stand and it's gonna make it when the wind comes no the tent says drive me deep i want to be rooted because i support this tent that's faith a belief in elohim is not just thinking in our minds he's the creator but it's showing him our support with our deeds that's why yeshua says if you love me if you're going to support me keep my commandments it's real simple the word emmet has the similar meaning of firmness something that is firmly set in place like a tent peg your heart is firmly in place and it shows your firmness or lack thereof your heart shows your firmness or lack thereof if i'm stay if i still stay sitting on the couch i just showed my lack thereof of my firmness and my support just like israel is saying you have been faithless you have been faithless and i'm bringing the enemy to correct you because you have not supported me how did they not support him because they weren't keeping his commandments they were doing it their way oh they thought they were keeping commandments but it was the commandments they invented they invented their own things that he never told them to do or never asked of them this word emmet's firmly in place like the rock in rafi's message this morning he was re reading uh verse 29 i forgot to put the the book but he says yeshua said to him i guess it's john maybe james i don't know it must be no it must be john yeshua said and because you have seen me you have supported me blessed are they who did not see of course i'm using support in the word of believed blessed are they who did not see but yet believed but yet they support me they support me having not seen me so those that trusted and supported him are the people that had faith wow this is getting pretty heavy did you would you be surprised if i told you that the word faith which is from this word pistus in greek is only found four places in the whole tanakh right here deuteronomy 32 51 job 39 12 psalm 146 6 and habakkuk 2 4. why is the greek understanding of faith so separated from our tanakh understanding of faith maybe that's the whole problem how we all got messed up anyway but what's interesting is the first one in deuteronomy 32 51 is the word ma'al so i left it black with no support to it or no highlights in job 39 it's this uh blue word amman faith in psalm 146 it's the green word emmet and in habakkuk 2 4 it's the purple word imuna what do those three words the purple the blue and the green what three letters do they have in common hebrew letters i'm sorry what two letters do they have in common the aleph and the mem you see the aleph is the strong leader the bull the mem is the living waters what did yeshua tell the woman at the well i am the living waters i am the amuna i am the amman and i am the emmett i am the truth i'm the life and the way i'm the one that people trust in that are mine that are chosen that really exemplify their faith in me by supporting me are you liking this is this helping get clarity by the way the torah is a way to show our support of him as our leader think of the torah as a way a mechanism that we get to show our support of the creator of heaven and earth because only by knowing those things do i now have the ability to support it in other words if my wife never told me she needed help and i was too ignorant to see that she needed it then i'd still be on the couch but because she spoke it and said i need the help that's the tour of the word going forth i now am able to participate and support by doing it hopefully those are you husbands you you you don't have to have the words come hopefully it comes to you i will admit that a lot of times i have to hear the words because i don't often times see it but i'm faithful to when the words come out i'm faithful to get in there and help okay um so i broke down here in uh i better use my tools so i broke down here in this and it comes out a little bit funny but you can see that uh this word faith here appears uh and that didn't come out right on these 237 times but here's the four times it appears in the tanakh those four words faithful faithlessness though uh i'm sorry not faithfulness faith fullness uh are these uh hebrew words uh emmett and hesed and you can see here that the word believe we've only got amman 26 times uh and 11 over here but look how many times out of 150 is the greek understanding what i'm saying to you is the greek misses the concept of what it means to support it's missing it doesn't have the concrete okay all right now let's learn what causes the break in relationship and how the hebrew points this out so i the only reason i have this slide up is i blew up the previous slide so you can see a little bit bigger uh the 292 times here 250 faith and belief and then the 41 times faithfulness is in the greek and the hebrew why is look at this why is faithfulness which is the concrete word only three times is this greek word come up to to bring this out but look at how heavy it is in the hebrew but boy it's reversed over here in faith and belief should not be that way it should not be that way okay last week i put this slide up for trust iman and it was in uh deuteronomy 132 yet in this matter you are putting no support in yahuwah elohim notice that this verb is found approximately 100 times with only several minor exceptions the meaning of imam centers on the concepts of belief faith and trust but again it's rooted in a idea of support okay we're going to expound on this here in just a minute deuteronomy 32 51 because you broke faith ma'am greek means to disobey disbelieve why does breaking faith mean to disbelieve and disobey breaking how do i break faith what does that mean to break faith i've stopped thinking it that doesn't think in my mind anymore surely that's not it you're not doing the mental gymnastics anymore of faith and roving around in your head no you stopped supporting me by doing the deeds that i've asked you to do habit 2 4 behold as for one the proud one his soul is not right within him but the righteous will live by his faith this should be the same we shouldn't have any misunderstanding between the new testament and the tanakh what does this hebrew concept missing how is it missing in the new testament they should be the same okay so i'm going to bring this to your attention our new testament portion romans 9 30 says what shall we say then that the gentiles who did not pursue righteousness attained righteousness even the righteousness which is by faith but israel pursued a law of righteousness which did not arrive at that law why because they did not pursue it by faith oh we've got people that have taken this and dissected it and gone the wrong directions over and over and over again but as though it were by works they stumbled over the stumbling stone so knowing what you know about support how did they and remember there's more than one law that he's dealing with here he's dealing with the uh god's word law and he's dealing with the oral law that man had set up the pharisees had set up remember your your disciples don't wash their hands they were basing that on their law that they had codified it's not in the scriptures so our new testament portion says what is faith this hebrew word emunah is the greek word pistus as we've pointed out how should we define this could it be that they were trusting in the works of their own and not elohim remember what the spies do the spies wanted to trust in their own works and not what god said hmm what were they pursuing what law not god's but something else their own inventions a law but not god's law so this stuff gets twisted around uh this greek word here uh dioco is the in the present tense which indicates a pursuit of god's righteousness was continually not on the spiritual agenda of the gentiles or the people that he's speaking to on the romans it wasn't on their agenda it was something else so it can't be god's laws sure they pursued a form of righteousness at least some of them but it was human version of righteousness which is nothing but wrongness it was something in the eyes of our god that they should be pursuing and not something in their own eyes what god asks for is a perfect unblemished flawless righteousness not something that we create out of our own minds yeshua made it very clear that the pharisees who labored legalistically hypocrisy tithing the smallest of seeds in their attempts to meet god's standard still fell short of perfection why because they weren't doing it with the heart that god intended it and oftentimes they weren't doing it as god asked for it just like the woman that they bring out to stone it wasn't being done the way god asked for it to be done they thought they were doing it righteously they were they pursuing a righteousness when they brought the woman out a righteousness they were they brought her out ready to stone her we're pursuing a righteousness but he showed them it isn't my righteousness that you're pursuing because you're going to try to kill her without the other witnesses it's not right so see this whole idea of romans here we've got to really dissect that oh they were pursuing god's law seeing they no no don't give me that they were pursuing something else which has been going on for 2000 years man's pursuing something else in the garden she pursued something else here in habakkuk they were pursuing something else paul's upset he's grieving because he knows that the people are not pursuing the true righteousness they're presuming man's inventions of righteousness does that make sense okay just as it is written behold i lay in zion a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense and he who supports in him will not be disappointed isaiah 28 16 therefore thus says yahuwah see i will lay the foundations of zion a precious choice stone a highly valued cornerstone for its foundations and the one who supports in him will not be put to shame faith and belief is always associated with what elohim has spoken or done like promises or his commandments never in what man says it's in his miracles because it's rooted in trust there's only one who is trustworthy and will never change all that he has said all that he has promised all that he has done will not change it's trustworthy it's worthy of faith it's worthy of support it's worthy of belief just like that sun is going to rise tomorrow and it's going to set right now i can trust it because has it ever changed in your lifetime is it even does it even deviated no it comes right back to this spot on the equinox and will return again next fall doesn't deviate trustworthy i like those things this word truth is a translation of emmett emunah which has its root in the ideas of firmness and certainty we're almost done and includes such concepts of truth righteousness or rightness faith fullness it's also inherent in the word is the idea of faith which in biblical usage is an assurance of certainty i'm going to say that again in the hebrew concept of faith it's an assurance of certainty in contrast with modern concepts of faith as something possible hopeful but not certain the fundamental concept of truth is that it is absolute uncertain it's incontrovertible irrefutable unarguable unchanging if something is true it is always true and can never be untrue no matter what the circumstances so that means if the old testament was true it can't ever be untrue it's always true we have hands up a couple of hands who's got the mic okay uh when you talk about support my mind immediately goes to a marriage course you brought up an example of that and in deuteronomy 4 it it talks about those that fell in baal pior they did not continue in their faith or yah but then in verse 4 it says but you held fast to the lord your god are alive today every one of you that word held fast is the exact same word in genesis that says cleave so we are to have faith and to cleave and to stay right there joined and supported with with y'all and to obey because that's where his help to speak so it brings me to this question yeshua says those that believe in me those that have faith in me well if it means support what in the world are we you know i'm thinking from a person just coming in it's only reading the new testament in my mind i'd be thinking well how do i support him what is it i'm supporting what what support and salvation supporting what is that i'm doing and that's where we have to have the hebrew concept of what it means to support and what we're supporting perfectly a relationship a covenant union yes you kind of got away from me again but um my dad used to always say you can't make a wronger right that's right like you can't change it like you were saying that's right the truth is always going to be truth okay uh by the way let me i put this note abraham looked up and he saw something very trustworthy in the heavens that would not change it was what elohim had created and abraham believed in that that it was from him and it was trustworthy when he said look up and can you can you tell the story and he said yeah that that that's the redeemer the the one coming the the desire of the nations and abba says that's your seed it's going to come from your loins he believed it he supported it in fact he had men swear by it and then put their hand on his thigh swear by that seed that was going to come from his loins yes says god takes pleasure in the prosperity of his servants who favor his righteous cause a man and amen well said okay we're coming down to an end trusting faithfulness basically the term applies to god himself to express his total dependability his dependability if he's going to express his dependability how am i going to express my dependency he's keeping his promise he's keeping his word to do for me what he said he would do so i don't have to do that for him i don't have to be dependable i can just like ruffy said earlier i just play around with the word faith in my head and i'm all good to go this word mashuva is also used to refer to those who live whose lives god establishes he expects to see faithfulness in them and indeed such faithfulness or a life of faith is characteristic of those justified in god's sight god's word of truth establishes listen to this it establishes man's way of truth or faithfulness what is it that establishes my way of faithfulness his word his word you know yeshua says in john 17 17 thy word is truth no new testament written what word is he talking about what word did they have what did they know was the word before the new testament was written interesting stuff isn't it would you stand with me but you know what as habakkuk says that the calamity is coming there is a disaster relief there is a disaster relief plan skip moen writes as i said in that one scripture he says i exalt in the lord exalt the prophet habakkuk must have been a secret economist of course his prediction wasn't very favorable just look at the disaster no figs no olives crop failure loss of animals everything necessary for an agricultural society to survive fails that's like telling us that the banks collapsed the stock market dropped 6 000 points the oil supply dries up and the unemployment reaches 60 percent in true prophetic form habakkuk announces a celebration exactly the opposite of any rational man's response but habakkuk wasn't a rational man was he he was a prophet his reality was the character of god not the condition of the world and he tells us that it's time to party the hebrew verb allah describes rejoicing jubilation and celebration it is especially applied to celebrating god this isn't a party about the conditions of the economy they are dismal no doubt about it but habakkuk is not focused on the circumstances of present day life and neither is god he is celebrating the eternal power majesty and purposes of yahuwah in other words no matter what our conditions are being god's people is worth everything it doesn't matter what's happening in the economy what oil is doing doesn't matter how big the line is at the gas station allah's has an interesting pictograph it's an iron laminated design it is a picture to experience control cut off let's say that again it is the picture to experience control cut off oh i want to control everything god cuts that off you're not controlling anything he's the one that's going to control it till you give up the control and let him choose and decide for you you're not the chosen but he's going to keep working at you until you finally let him do the deciding for you amen wow it hardly seems like a picture of celebration this seems like a picture of catastroph but we have the picture upside down don't we it is only when we experience loss of control that god is able to demonstrate his care and compassion as long as the world works the way that we expect it to we are more than likely to put god behind the glass that says break in case of an emergency it's the truth the hebrew view is just the opposite we celebrate when things fall apart because we are known by the one who cares carl jung used to tell his patients that moment of loss in their lives where the perfect environment for real change when a patient reported losing his job jung was joyful since this crisis could precipitate serious personal introspection and development but when a patient reported being newly hired jung despaired commenting that this apparent apparently positive change could prevent real personal change he seemed to have a very hebraic view so often our focus is on all those things that we believe we must control in order to have life the way we want it fortunately god is good and he removes our seductive crutches in order for us to find him as he did in habakkuk as he did in the wilderness as he did so many times and as you've seen in your own life he alone is our rescue and deliverance perhaps your current current crisis is god's engineering attempt to remove the false foundation of your hope maybe when they were about to go in and he tells them look uh uh ceon is gonna rise up you're gonna have to fight him how many people fight him why do we have to fight him aren't you the one that does it all can we just let you go and whoop them and we go in and take possession god's gonna use this opportunity like we're experiencing here to show them something maybe what you need and i need is allah right now in the midst of all the collapse of our way of imagining the world hooray rejoice god's in charge father we thank you for the word today we thank you for showing us the things that we need to do and that we need to put our trust and our hope our support in you that faith in yeshua and faith in you and your kingdom and your word all that you've got planned to do is actually getting behind you and supporting you supporting all your words how do we support your words by carrying them out by walking in them by doing them thank you father for showing us that we need to be like that tent peg driven deep in the ground to show that we're supporting the whole structure not just falling out of the ground or letting the whole thing collapse oh i i believe thank you for giving us this example thank you for showing us concretely in your word what this all means that we can have now something rooted and established we could tell others what faith really means we glorify you and praise you for this word may it change us man strengthen us may it may it uh bind us together as a community even stronger each day give you praise and glory in your son yahushua's name amen if you're watching online you do not know this amazing amazing god that that does these things for you because he cares and loves you i'd like to pray with you father those that are watching a line that do not have a relationship with you but they want one they want to have this intimate marital relationship with you i would ask that they would repent of their sins iniquities and transgressions that they would uh ask for your forgiveness that they would acknowledge them and and uh realize that you you and they walked contrary to you and you walked contrary to them if they would accept your offering of your son messiah yeshua that they would acknowledge the sins and iniquities and transgressions of their forefathers and they would start reading your word and applying the words to their life and doing it and supporting it let it come to pass let it flow from their very being i ask this in your son yahushua's name amen would you play the avinu please [Music] can you pause that thank you ryan would you sing the avena please [Music] [Music] it [Applause] [Music] [Music] me our father in heaven may your name be sanctified our father in heaven may your kingdom be blessed your will shall be done in heaven and on earth give us our bread continually forgive us the

element nasa has ever built the core stage of nasa's space launch system fired its four rs-25 engines for eight minutes and 19 seconds thursday at nasa's stennis space center in mississippi the successful test known as a hot fire test is a critical milestone ahead of the agency's artemis one mission which will send an uncrewed orion spacecraft on a test flight around the moon and back to earth engineers designed the eight-part green run test campaign to gradually bring the sls core stage to life for the first time culminating with the hot fire nasa previously conducted a hot fire test of the sls core stage on january 16th the four rs 25 engines fired together for the first time for about one minute before the test ended earlier than planned following data analysis nasa determined a second and longer hot fire test would provide valuable data to help verify the core stage design for flight during the second hot fire test the stage fired the engines for a little more than eight minutes just like it will during every artemis launch to the moon the longer duration hot fire tested a variety of operational conditions including moving the four engines in specific patterns to direct thrust powering the engines up to 109 of rated power and throttling them down and back up during this test the team conducted new operations with the core stage for the first time repeated some critical operations and recorded test data that will help nasa verify the core stage is ready for sls flights since the green run test campaign is now over the core stage for sls will be refurbished then shipped to nasa's kennedy space center in florida there the core stage will be assembled with the solid rocket boosters and nasa's orion spacecraft in preparation for artemis one the falcon 9 launched another set of starlink satellites on march 14th with the rockets first stage setting a record with its ninth launch and landing the upper stage deployed its payload of 60 starlink satellites into orbit 65 minutes after liftoff bringing the size of the broadband internet constellation to 1260 satellites the rockets first stage landed on a drone ship in the atlantic ocean eight and a half minutes after liftoff the booster which powered this mission was used previously on a variety of missions including five prior starlink launches as well as the demo one mission for the company's crew dragon capsule the launch was the eighth for the falcon 9 this year and took place a little more than 72 hours after another falcon 9 launch of starlink satellites on march 11th a recent update from nasa reveals that nasa and spacex have signed a joint agreement to formalize both parties strong interest in the sharing of information to maintain and improve space safety the focus of the agreement is on conjunction avoidance and launch collision avoidance between nasa spacecraft and the large constellation of spacex starlink satellites as well as related share missions spacex has agreed its starlink satellites will autonomously or manually maneuver to ensure nasa science satellites and other assets can operate uninterrupted from a collision avoidance perspective unless otherwise informed by spacex nasa has agreed to not maneuver its assets in the event of a potential conjunction to ensure the parties do not inadvertently maneuver into one another according to acting nasa administrator steve jurczyk with commercial companies launching more and more satellites it's critical nasa increase communications exchange data and establish best practices to ensure we all maintain a safe space environment a new report suggests that the united states air force is considering starlink internet connectivity for its potential military applications one of the major contractors to the united states air force ball aerospace is working with spacex to investigate if starlink satellites might have military applications the fcc document said that the tests were designed to demonstrate the ability to transmit and receive information from two stationary ground sites and an airborne aircraft with limited testing from a moving vehicle on the ground spacex also disclosed that it was working with ball aerospace which will provide the antennas needed for connecting to starlink satellites on military aircraft the air force experiment will begin with ground testing near spacex's starlink manufacturing facilities in redmond washington then the test will move to edwards air force base in california for a ground to air scenario russian scientists launched one of the world's biggest underwater space telescopes to peer deep into the universe from the pristine waters of lake by cal the deep underwater telescope which has been under construction since 2015 is designed to observe neutrinos the smallest particles currently known neutrinos are the most abundant particles within the universe and could be the reason matter exists at all neutrinos are so plentiful that trillions of them pass through the human body every second the particles are incredibly hard to capture because they travel almost at the speed of light although abundant neutrinos are not absorbed by matter or deflected by magnetic fields and they only interact with gravity and weak force the russian telescope dubbed by cal gigatron volume detector is submerged to a depth of 750 to 1 300 meters into the water the telescope detects neutrinos through the cherenkov experiment jarenkov radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium here water acts as a detection medium and increases the chances that a neutrino will interact when a lightning fast neutrino hits the water it creates an electron or muon in the water which in turn emits gerenkov radiation the by cal telescope has a cluster of eight strings of light sensing equipment that consists of hundreds of spherical modules made of glass and stainless steel connected to the surface through a set of cables each one of those modules are vertically spread out 49 feet from the other and they currently occupy an area measuring 17657 cubic feet over time the plan is to add more sensors to make the telescope even bigger mars was once home to lakes and oceans and where all the water went to transform the planet into the desolate rock we know today has been something of a mystery most of it was thought to have been lost to space but a new study funded by nasa proposes that it didn't go anywhere but is trapped within minerals in the crust the new study published in the journal science shows that a significant portion of mars water between 30 and 99 percent is trapped within minerals in the planet's crust the study proposes that a combination of two mechanisms is responsible for the loss of water according to the research team the trapping of water and minerals in the planet's crust and the loss of water to the atmosphere can explain this mystery the researchers said that when water interacts with rock chemical weathering forms clays and other hydra's minerals that contain water as part of their mineral structure the researchers concluded that atmospheric escape had a role in water loss but findings from the last decade of mars missions have pointed to the fact that there was this huge reservoir of ancient hydrated minerals whose formation certainly decreased water availability over time now let's discuss some of the major starship updates from the past week on march 15th starship sn11 momentarily ignited one or two of its three raptor engines pre-burners that looked like a weak static fire and produced a small but visible amount of flame and thrust spacex aborted the static fire test on that day and wasn't able to conduct another static fire test last week spacex will now attempt a second static fire test on monday and if all goes according to the plan we could see the high altitude test flight of serial number 11 this week a recent public notice of cameron county ordered a temporary closure of state highway 4 in boca chica beach from march 22nd to 25th the next static fire attempt and the test flight of sn 11 could happen during these days a comparison of the starship launch operation timeline shows us that spacex has been gradually speeding up the test flight process over time starship sn10 the first prototype of its kind to land in one piece took just 33 days to go from pad arrival to liftoff and spend just eight days between its first static fire and launch attempts the same feats took starship sn8 77 and 50 days respectively with sn9 splitting the difference at 43 days from transport to liftoff and 28 days between its first static fire and launch attempts if starship sn11 does manage to launch within a few days of its static fire attempt on monday spacex would still crush sn 10's 33 day record meanwhile spacex recently rolled back the starship test tank serial number 7.2 from the test site to the build site this three millimeters test tank had undergone intentional pressurization to failure test on 4th of february developing a leak which was later repaired by spacex employees on march 18th the federal aviation administration released its findings from a public scoping report relating to spacex's starship and super heavy launch proposal at boca chica in the report the faa states it is conducting an environmental review of spacex's plans to launch its spacecraft from boca chica and will review whether or not it will approve the project a public scoping period was held between december 2020 and january 2021 to review comments and concerns on the spacex project the faa received 321 responses during the survey 122 of which came from agencies and non-governmental organizations some respondents raised concerns about the project's impact on local species in their habitat impact on the land negative impact on low income residents in the area and the overall degradation of the environment however others responded differently to the project and noted economic benefits regionally job creation and progress in commercial space transportation has positive impacts the faa will use these comments in a draft environmental assessment that will dictate how the agency responds to spacex's request to launch their spacecraft in boca chica as part of the license application process to launch starship spacex must complete a safety review and develop agreements in addition to the environmental review check out the link in the description to read the full report from the faa now let's discuss what's happening at the starship build site for the first time ever spacex has stacked a super heavy tank section to its full height effectively completing the assembly of the largest rocket booster ever built this was a first of its kind occurrence with a section of the high bay roof needing to be removed to allow the crane hook to descend through it although a considerable amount of work still remains to weld the two halves together and connect their pre-installed plumbing and avionics runs those activities are mostly marginal comprised of 36 stainless steel rings the booster bn1 stands roughly 70 meters tall with a starship installed on top of the booster the entire rocket will be 120 meters tall making it the tallest launch vehicle ever assembled according to spacex ceo elon musk super heavy bn1 will be a production pathfinder to figure out how to build and transport a 70 meter tall stage also serving as a test bed for inaugural pressure and proof tests as well as a possible raptor static fire according to him booster bn2 will be the first super heavy prototype to fly from boko chico launch site possibly with a mass simulator on top he added that spacex hopes to be ready to begin orbital starship launches as early as july 2021 the first launch attempt will nominally use super heavy booster bn3 with starship serial number 20 installed atop according to musk spacex is planning to use the launch tower to stack the starship atop the booster the launch tower should have a hook height of 140 meters to stack the 120 meters rocket it's unclear when super heavy will roll to the launch pad for testing but it's safe to say that spacex probably won't wait long after starship sn 11's test flight just like mr musk mentioned two weeks ago high bay got an elevator on its side last week recently someone shared a video on snapchat showing the inside of spacex's high bay top floor and the newly installed elevator when asked about the proposed 360 degree glass star bar atop the high bay musk replied that the floor is installed the elevator is operational and they are waiting for the installation of the glass base with this we have covered all the major updates from last week please share your thoughts on the latest science news and starship updates in the comments section also do

happening and are happening um at the county level and i'll just go ahead and i'm sure everybody's familiar with dave but uh commissioner eggers was elected to the pinellas county board of county commissions in november 2014 previously he served as the mayor of dunedin elected in march 2009 and then re-elected in 2012. prior to becoming the mayor he served as the city commissioner for dunedin elected in 2003 re-elected in 2006. during his tenure as county commission he continues to focus on fiscal accountability economic development transportation issues within the region in the county regional water management the consensus on enduring land availability for business expansion light industrial land use and zoning affordable housing residential zoning and stormwater environmental needs he is now the chairman of the board of county commissioners and i i have to say i i kind of sympathize with you i was on the oldsmar city council and when i was a mayor and i was uh one of two males with three females and you are you and charlie are one of two males with five females so you have trump me for sure so yeah i i was reading some of the comments uh you know that that went when you became the chairman of the county commission so they're not gonna let you forget that you are two of five so yeah oh no no they did that in the very beginning and uh they were they were gracious enough to let us be the chair and vice chair this year so so yeah it's a you know it's it's a it's a good group of folks that we're working with and you know um we just we just have um have a have a pretty good time we kind of get past the r d stuff as much as we can at least day to day because there's just so much that really is non-partisan about what we do it's just you know so we're trying we're trying hard to work together and um but um yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a uh it's definitely been an interesting year everybody that's on the on the on the uh program this morning that you can see on the screen here has been had their own challenges this year no there's no question about it we uh we're no different our staff has been unbelievable our economic development staff for instance has done continue to do the things that they do i just got to report in for their their kind of an annual update report the things that they kind of kept going on that front but also they were very involved in the in the cares program management's too so everybody was wearing like two and three hats and uh so i know our staff was no different than many of the city staffs uh i see felicia on here and uh dev and there's just everybody was involved in so many things just trying to make sure that we kind of kept everything going um while trying to be careful and trying to you know just just a lot going on so it just you know you you just can't imagine uh what our residents have been through i mean they they have their own struggle whether it's health or financial or um just it's just been quite a year so um i just uh i guess we're just blessed to be here it's a beautiful day outside and um you know just just lucky to be working and living in this area and and clearly i just really briefly wanted to touch on some uh just some covet stuff a little uh a couple things going on at tdc um and then just kind of jump in a little bit to kind of an annual update and then kind of this whole governance model of economic development in pinellas county and um and it's in kind of transition right now so for the most part just maybe 10 minutes on that kind of stuff and then maybe kind of open it up for conversation um i was at your meeting a couple couple months ago and had somebody in talking about all the different demographics and the generational demographics i found it fascinating interesting but what really good about the meeting is it was a lot of give and take and a lot of good discussions so just real quickly um doug is that all right with you i just want to touch everything in a couple of things yeah perfect yeah i think overall i would say on the covet front there's optimism in the air for sure uh we've got the numbers have dramatically come down in my opinion from january february and now into march um 70 averages continue to drop it's about four points i think the seven day rolling was about four point six percent it was it was over ten percent back in january the numbers continue to come down hospital bed icu bed capacities are good we have plenty of room there there are some covet case people but i think there was they said about 200 in the hospitals in our in our county but certainly that's down from where it was um vaccines oh i think that's probably the area that everybody remains optimistic about we're getting more now the supply issue has really been one of the one of the problems is that we haven't had that much vaccine over 65 65 and over and out over 50 percent have been vaccinated in pinellas county and that's a good thing so um you know that that that that kind of progress continues to be made um we um we've got two or three sites one primary site down on elmerton road or excuse me on east bay and then two or three other sites we're doing we're working with the state closely in the department of health but the states rolled out many other avenues too whether it's publix the hospitals even some drug stores and that kind of thing so there's many different avenues to get the vaccine out and i think that's that's that's been met with a lot of optimism as well and i and i would just say that at our last commission meeting there seemed to be more commissioners interested in having a conversation in april having the conversation in the first meeting or second meeting in april about some of the the can you know some of the restrictions that we have in the county and maybe starting to look at how do we start rolling some of those back and of course in the next 30 days we don't have another meeting in april the next 30 days we'll see how those numbers change how the number of vaccines are going up um and and that kind of thing but i think you know we want to see our businesses doing well we want to see them be safe we want to see them you know continue to make progress we've obviously never closed any businesses down after the governor closed them down in april opened them back up in may and june and everybody's been working uh that they've had this little cloud of restrictions out there that we're hoping that we're rolling hoping to roll back we'll see how it goes and you know again we're going to have the discussion in april we have to get official notification of a meeting to change the ordinance so nothing is going to change in that meeting in april but if things are looking really positive then we'll we'll move in a different direction we did get a group of folks in the area that are working closely with us from the hospitals from the universities to develop some numbers that we can use as as kind of metrics to to make those decisions they're very very very conservative i suspect that they're more conservative than need be but um but anyway i i feel like that we're moving in that right direction and clearly all of us want to get out from under this as quickly as we can but we want to we want to be safe um just real quickly the tdc has developed a rise to shine campaign which i i thought was it was pretty pretty cool it's really about our visitors coming down february march april spring breakers coming down and how to try to behave here we were marketing heavily at families not so much the college university kids but you know they're they're going to come anyway whether it's from other areas or from you know people in the in the tampa bay area they're going to come to our beaches so but we've tried to provide some tools for our businesses to use to encourage people to participate in a kind of how to be safe while you're here um the masking the distancing and and washing hands and stuff like that but really when you get out to the bars and stuff it's just sit down try not to you know to overload the bar areas and try to behave ourselves and you know we're learning more and more about this thing so we're feeling better about at least the treatments and and where we're heading so overall i think those are positive things that that are that are going on and and so i just if any questions about that before we move on i think i didn't want to i didn't want to dwell too much on that but i did want to at least talk briefly about you know about that that area any anybody have any questions on that i think it's great that the the numbers continue to go down and i continue to hear and you kind of alluded to it you know i i think we have realized that we lost our ability to have common sense there for a while so i think that's something that we really just need to get back to with just using plain old common sense so give people their state you know quit getting in people's space and you know things like that well it's it's just you know we want everybody to kind of respect everybody else and we get we get that people want to get rid of the mask we understand that uh but at the same time they they they make it they disavow the the positive aspects of a mask and there are a lot of people who say they're positive there are some studies that come out and say they don't do much but the negative approach to them really makes you question about how they're going to behave if we get rid of the mass so we're trying to make sure that everybody at least is on that same page of accepting everybody and how they how they feel if you want to wear a mask that's fine and right now we're keeping the mandates in place and that discussion will be coming up but just real quick we have just a couple numbers our our group our pinellas our ed group really was talking did 5 389 business applications were approved in this past year this is a pinellas cares program 55 million dollars awarded to local businesses um and and then another 1.7 million in state bridge loan so just they were very busy and active trying to and it started a certain way and they got and it expanded and got a little better um there were still some things that i wish we could have done more for the new businesses that were just opening up um but at the end of the day i guess they felt that we needed to um at least be able to survive an audit if we get through it so everything seems to be it seems to have been really really positive in that regard you guys of course are are much more in touch with that from an economic development standpoint the area really is recovering faster than we thought it's recovering faster than the pinellas is actually recovering faster than the other fastest in the region for the most part and higher numbers in the state and higher numbers than around the country so the area is doing well i think it's probably a lot of the diversified economy that we have here and you all are right in the hub of it they're in oldsmar the manufacturing industry clearly supplementing and far outpacing the tourism and what they do for the county not not to downplay the tourism and the importance of that but i'm just saying we are so diverse here and i think that's helped us recover a little better i you know it actually i think they said that we ranked fourth the tampa bay area ranked fourth as nationally in terms of new folks coming into the area so they're the influence over close to 50 000 people this past year in flowing into the area for one reason or another but there was a i guess i just read that in that study that our economic development people put out the 2021 milliken institute of best performing cities named this region as the top region in the country in terms of job and wage growth and some technology factors etc but so really this area continues to be a a good area i remember going to a commercial real estate for women group and they said that the economic professor that kept coming back every year would say this area if we ever get our our government groups together on the same page with our universities and our businesses and but the governments themselves talking to each other better that this area would probably be one of the probably one of the top regions in the country as far as job opportunities and economic growth and i'm not saying we're there by any stretch you i can tell you stories of regional cooperation and areas still to be still to improve on but um in any event i i feel i feel that that's going well too i think our unemployment numbers are down to about five percent um in the area um the um just the number i'm just looking at the job loss this year was more than ninety thousand we've created about we've added back about 70 since then and it took about four years after the great depression that we had about 10 years ago to add back that number of jobs so really we we we lost a lot of jobs quickly and we've we've started to bring them back so i think from a tourism standpoint the numbers are starting to look better from a from a job growth standpoint the numbers are starting to look better and overall i think all of our government forecasts for this coming year are changing a little bit as we speak are you know so i'm at least at least optimistic that we're heading in and heading in the right direction and i would just say that um some of the things again that i was reading through our annual update here was that you know companies like jabil they continue to grow our employment sites program is continuing to be developed and communicated better our innovation center our 45 000 square foot innovation center down in st petersburg is is under design uh there's still some work to be done to see if that's going to actually get off the ground this year it's targeted to get off the ground this year and that's going to be a 45 000 square foot uh building targeting you know going after our target industries and helping new businesses get started in an incubator setting down there so um you know anyway just just to really there's some really good things that are going on and i think one of the areas that we've been working on is our small business enterprise which is which helps a lot of the smaller businesses in our area that might they're women-owned businesses or um you know african-american hispanic businesses whatever but we have a program there that's really doing well and it's very closely and tightly scrutinized so we give contracts out peop these contractors are getting bonus points for adding these subcontractors to their to their best so what it's doing is our you know our millions and millions and millions of dollars of capital that we're putting out into the community is starting to spread a little bit more and um and frankly frankly we're really really happy about that continues to be looked at though because i still think we have work a ways to go but uh doing much better and then i would just say real quickly that we are in the final stages of a total review of our development review services and our building department the pieces are in place but we really haven't been ranking very well in our business community um and barry came in and he brought an outside group an outside guy that he's used before and he's just kind of pulling it apart and putting it back together and really starting to at least understand the culture changes that have to occur to be more entrepreneurial even in those departments we've got all the rules and regulations that we could ever possibly need but just a change in attitude about how do we make something happen versus how do we not make something happen we got that mastered so i think things are starting to change and i'm really happy and excited about that and that to me is part of that grassroots economic development if you can't get that right then a lot of the things you say are just talk you know and so we have to be able to help our businesses with their that are doing that so i really feel good about that as well but uh one of the things that we've kind of started around i'll finish up with this last comment and then we can kind of open it up for conversation i didn't want to talk too long but um is that you know regionally we've been talking about economic development and what that means and all i know is that i want economic development to be locked step with our businesses and for the most part our businesses they don't know county lines i mean they don't really care about county lines you know and our universities they don't really care about county lines i mean they're just trying to get people trained up they're trying to get people you know in jobs they're trying to help get folks it doesn't really matter where they're coming from they're just trying to get them so the better we do to act as one in a region is really important so there's there's some efforts going on and i gotta tell you it's easier said than done to have this region again getting back to that that commercial real estate for women conference that i keep going to if we start working together it's going to be amazing so our tampa bay partnership has worked with our universities and and trying to come up with an approach and i really think it's a healthy approach and and then when you start thinking in that global sense as far as the region goes what can we do in pinellas county to govern our processes better and and frankly i think that's kind of what and i think barry and i had a lot of these conversations we've got a lot of tools um in our economic development we've got some great professionals that are very entrepreneurial in their thinking and their approach again how do we work better with our business community how do we work better with our government partners to make sure that we're doing what we can do to help our businesses grow have more jobs help our residents get higher paying jobs and more jobs and and so there's a governance process to that and i know that our our folks have reached out to city of oldsmar felicia i know you're going to be very involved in that um interview process and the next 60 days we're trying to get a lot of information together i think there'll be a presentation of the county commission in may or june about what kind of what we're hearing what we find but we're going to involve the your chamber of commerce as well we're going to involve some of our target industries um that that are out there that are part of our system uh we're going to talk to a couple of chambers we're going to talk to a couple of those types of businesses to figure out make sure that we have a governance model for economic development that is fluid that is responsive that works with our education system because if it doesn't we're not training our people right for our businesses and that's critical so and and there's just a whole lot of those pieces that are going to be paid and it's a it's a complicated thing it's not going to be solved in the next two or three months but what we're trying to do is get those partners to the table to help us formulate a different of maybe a an improved approach to the governance of economic development in pinellas county because if we're going to be strong and at the table regionally we better make sure that we have that together and it's not that we're that far off but i think we can do a better job of working with our partners i know we can i've talked to a lot of different cities that have reached out for some help and it gets a little awkward at times but i think we could be better so i'm really looking forward to those next two months and felicia thank you for for agreeing to step in maybe you could even speak to your early perspective about what you what you see happening on that front yeah i um i i did have a conversation with kevin and i am speaking with the consultant next week but um you know i'm excited about the movement to a governance model for economic development county-wide because i think that will will um you know through collaboration from a new structure i think that um we'll it'll the process will be more effective ultimately if we're not if we're not talking to each other and we it should just be as easy as picking up a phone and making a couple of calls and getting and getting folks mobilized to help a small business with an issue um help you know you hear about a business that you know is having trouble and maybe not even financial trouble they're growing but they can't find land or they can't find the temp and they need help but we need to keep them here not that if they go to pasco or or to hillsboro that our folks that are working there aren't still going to be able to work there but when they relocate that's that's not a good thing because sometimes it's relocating out of the area so we got to make sure that they know like like every once in a while city like goldsmire will steal a business from dunedin i know that oh oh big one yeah but but they could have gone to atlanta yeah you're right so that wasn't and dave i think it's really helpful too and oldsmar just our our relationship with the chamber i think is extremely helpful to to increase our capacity you know um so i think that that model um works and that right the regional trying to to keep people in pinellas county so maybe you know we're seeing businesses now that are that are growing out of their footprint and so if they if we can't accommodate them in oldsmar we want to we we don't want them to move to pasco or somewhere else atlanta yeah it's it's really tough and we had a case yesterday and again it's still in the process and it's going to still come before the county commission but that's it's a county-wide plan change that somebody wanted to do and um and it's again still in the process but an example of holding on to our industrial lands or employment land employment designation plan because we start we lose those to other things um then we can't respond to those businesses and um and when you look at dollars per square foot there may be a realtor online here but i am as well in the commercial area but if you look at that dollar per square foot number on industrial land it's always about at least half or a third of you know say multi-family land pricing or even much lower than that in in what some of our downtowns that have gotten very expensive so if you if you change the zoning you get more entitlement more value to the owner perhaps but we lose that that property for manufacturing expansion or or the like so this one this one case is being looked at they want to put affordable housing which we need they want to put other things on the property but it's zone industrial right now that hasn't been used for some time but times are different today environmental cleanup you have some extra tools to help with the expansion of that so you know there's a there's a real push there's a real um tug of war going on i mean it was a it was kind of a split vote but we voted not to do it now they'll go to the county commission and see how the county commission thinks about it but holding on to that is really important and you guys the reason i think olsmar was kind of chosen is because you know 70 percent of res of your community is residential where like in dunedin it's 95 residential and 5 commercial you guys have a huge investment in infrastructure and land in the commercial sector manufacturing etc as you said felicia i think your relationship with your chamber is very unique also um and i think and i think that kind of i think that's that input's going to be invaluable i think because others can learn from it um throughout the county we've got some other industrial areas we've got a lot of other chambers so there's a lot of ways to i think to to improve that that that model i didn't know if there was i thought i heard somebody say that this is jerry i love this conversation i know felicia knows why i love it but the uh you know like you said it's very complex economic development but you've talked about all the thing i looked at is four things it's proper use of land labor capital and technology and that's the things that you drilled down on in every area that's what economic development is the proper blend of all those four those four characteristics and you really drilled down into it so i think it sounds to me like you got a great great start for your governance model yeah yeah i think that i mean the pieces are there we have like i said our economic development department is just really have consummate professionals there that um and again you know i i i've been trying to the idea of in our building department or development review services is to bring a more entrepreneurial spirit of can do kind of thing even though we know that there are restrictions in what can happen we don't have to worry about that our economic development those folks are definitely entrepreneurial and they are energetic folks and i'm really excited about that and um clearly we have some good great chambers in the area um and and uh businesses that are so i don't we're not we're not reinventing anything i think it's just making sure that we have um the ability to mobilize quickly to help with problems that lead to better jobs better opportunities making sure that you know somebody says i got five acres of land but i i need about seven and a half to really accommodate my 10 20 year plan well we we get beyond that tomorrow i mean they can hire a broker you know commercial brokers and and help them out with that but in some of these larger companies they have their own real estate department but a lot of the small businesses that i think we need to target our thought process a lot on need our assistance and um and we can work you know hand you know hand to glove with them and whether it's training or education or you know whatever but also on the uh on the on the front of making sure they have enough space to do what they need to do so um anyway looking forward to that um alicia thank you again for for being a part of that part of that group but i really don't i don't really have anything else i just really wanted to touch on the i i feel pretty optimistic about where we are right now going into this year if you'd gone a year ago clear clearly all the indicators were down and we were running into the stuff that was this cove and stuff and the governor basically shut us down in april um and um you know you can always say in hindsight was that the right move i don't know but at the time i think it was absolutely had we didn't know what we didn't know and um but i think today things are in a much better place and um we certainly are cautiously optimistic you know you hear about all the variants out there and all those and it keeps you on our keeps us on our toes but i do think you know things are heading in the right direction not only on the on the health front but also on the business front we're recovering much faster our tourism is much better than we ever would have imagined a year ago so yeah anyway i'll open it up we can have discussion however you want to do it doug sure and you know i'm excited and dave you and i have talked and felicia and i have talked i'm really excited about you and i had a conversation the other day about kind of the uh the reshaping of the economic development component with the county and you know because truth be told whenever you say government one of the first things you think of and try and get things done is red tape and i think that kind of this new look at the economic development the relationship between you know the county government and businesses um and to be more efficient i think is huge and to be able to actually get things done i kind of equate it to uh there's so many rules and regulations it's kind of like an old house and when you start to peel back the paint you don't realize how many layers of paint that are on that wall until you start to peel it back and i think that's kind of the you know the rules and regulations and you know you often hear people want to try and apply for grants or funding and it's like it's just not worth the effort to try and get 10 you know why should i spend twenty thousand dollars to get ten thousand dollars and and i don't think it needs to be that way and hopefully this new uh kind of direction will like you said it's not going to happen overnight but uh well i think it's a breath of fresh air uh-oh i see chef waving over there i i don't know if chuck's waving at us or is waving at his employees in his office there but uh he's got a train maybe he has a crimp my lights go my lights go off for lack of activity yours are the rooms i never know what's chuck exactly what's going on maybe he's doing aerobics i'm not exactly sure uh and david one of your points you talked about uh you know the rate that people are moving into the state of florida i just pulled off the february residential numbers and it still continues to be incredible um the the the values of homes in the in the area are up 21 year-to-date the the inventory is down 58 so um you know it continues to grow i don't know you know how long it will grow obviously you're in the commercial i'm in the residential and and so i mean trying to find places for these people is which i think it's back to your point about people wanting to maximize vacant land and and get the most they can because they see you know this opportunity you see all the the apartment complexes that are popping up all over the place up and down us 19 because that's the you know the highest and best and biggest financial return for these businesses don't know that it's necessarily the best for the community long term but it is what it is people are trying to make a buck but to that point doug it's like those apartments that are being built and it and it is a question because you have infrastructure issues traffic and all of that but um but it's just amazing um when you see all of those being built and they're being filled they're being filled pretty quickly at market rates um and it gets back to the issues the challenges that we have in this county why all of us talking together and working together really makes a difference it's a redevelopment county so we are taking lands that have already been built on and doing something different with them and we're trying to balance you know if if i'm talking to the folks at the sierra club they want us to take the land and make it you know environmental lands and if i talk to people from fast which is an organization that is all focused on affordable housing and they want everything to be affordable housing and then of course the business side you know we've got to have those industrial lands protected so you have a real tug of war that goes on and every single part they're all critical otherwise we're going to have folks continuing to move to pasco and living and then commuting and eventually you know they get a business there and they stay there and then we have to recruit more to get people here so we got to have people living here getting these businesses to focus on affordable housing peace to their overall development is not easy to do but at least we now have these developers that are actually looking at affordable housing development that is co-mingled with regular housing development whether it's fee simple or rental housing so that's continuing to work we just did our first um i guess we had four four um four uh deals that we did back in january um of course we got criticized that not enough of its 80 ami and under it's probably more in the 80 to 100 percent i argue that well those are our police they're our teachers there are nurses um and those folks can be at 60 percent ami or 110 they still need a place to live and so we've got to do but i don't want to give up our light industrial because for me that's where the jobs and the number of jobs gets protected or goes up and the and the salary levels go up that's what we want so that we shift all of our people further on that that scale from eighty percent their eighty percent ami now they're at 95 or 110 percent so um it is a it is a tough challenge no question about it um but i do think that we've got some good pieces in place to try to try to maximize that but those apartment that apartment growth it tells you that there's a real need but it also all of the yellow lights go off too because you gotta we gotta make sure that we can handle the people moving around and there's other there's other demands on land uh back to your your guy a couple months ago that spoke about the millennials and post-millennials uh and that whole discussion about wanting to live at home uh or work at home excuse me not live at home work at home um instead of traveling so what does that mean to our roads and the you know congestion in the morning and i know that it's lighter than it has been although with all the tourism here now you wonder the roads are still pretty crowded if you're trying to get around on 19 at work going home at night or up east lake road or any of these roads but um you'll wonder what that impact is going to be as well so we'll see it's interesting you say that and you kind of bring up a question but to the point of the the gentleman that we had to talk about the post-millennials and we also recently had um what black white blanket on from forward pinellas and we talked about that very thing and referenced the previous speaker about you know the transportation and the people working at home he says you're still seeing the amount of traffic but it's not concentrated necessarily at you know 7 30 in the morning it's kind of spread a little bit a little bit more out so uh same amount of cars but over maybe a two hour window instead of a one hour window which leads to my question dave and you had talked about this so of course pinellas county has 24 cities you know you got hillsboro um pinellas pasco county and you said people don't really uh care about the borders and to your point about regionalization what are you seeing this has always been our achilles heel when it comes to attracting other businesses from outside the areas what are you seeing about regional transportation are we making any progress on that i know we continue to slowly slowly slowly i think we just got passed by a snail but moving forward and doug i assume when you say regional transportation being in the transport you know being at ford pinellas it's transportation really has to do with roadways as well so the roadway piece i really feel that we have made huge strides in that we have a mpos and people are aware of that they're the ones that kind of prioritize the state and federal money for these projects around the around the tampa bay area but we have one in pinellas there's one in hillsborough there's one in pasco and we've we've created a regional group called the tma that meets every every three months that works at prioritizing projects for the region and i remember that day about three years ago two years ago we were working and i was on the in the mpo and i made the motion that our number one project would be the state road 60 i-275 interchange over in tampa and that was uh that was a our in our board here uh our mpo and pinellas voted unanimously to support that pasco hillsboro they all got on board with that same project and it got awarded it's about a 1.4 billion dollar project that's going to be on the heels of the new the new span the howard franklin being built uh i know it got pushed back a little because of revenues it didn't get pushed out it just got pushed back a couple of years it may come back again but uh but it's it was a big thing and it was because the challenge here was you all don't speak with one voice and so we decided there's some people that would like to have a mega mpo for the area and we we kind of like the separate mpos because it involves people that represent oldsmar safety harbor and tarpon springs on that board cliff mers from safety harbors your representative right now if you go to that mega board you're going to lose that so we the other way of doing is we created that tma so from a from a transportation roadway standpoint that was a huge victory and i think that's the that's the direction that we're going we're still fighting some of that regional stuff i mean we think that's the way to have the conversation we get a little bit of we get pushed back a little bit from some folks over in hillsborough but i think we're all moving in that same direction um and we're doing really well on the tampa bay waterfront we even though we have challenges there we work as a region so i think from those perspectives it's a good thing the transit issue is a different animal um and uh there's some real challenges going on right now to tibarda which was supposed to be or is so one of the regional focuses for transit uh with that one voice it kind of was it has the ability to attract federal dollars better um but that the existence and the success is being challenged by some folks at the state as to whether it's really needed or not and um and i think that they're taking a good hard look at themselves to make sure that they're indeed providing value-added to the two transit groups so you know the two transit groups have services that cross boundaries but they really can't plan uh as a region they only plan within hillsborough they play when the pinellas t-barna was supposed to be the unifying piece you know we're looking at that wesley chapel to almost saint pete beach uh transit system uh it's kind of a transportation transit combination i'm i'm you know i'm i'm a little bit uncomfortable with it we're moving it forward in that direction it's a way to utilize the way to connect those areas not that you're ever going to travel the whole distance but the pieces will be in place that you can use the the the the shoulder to travel past uh traffic and but you can only go 15 miles an hour faster than the the existing traffic anyway it's just i'm i have a little difficulty with that i i get the uh hov the dedicated lanes that makes sense to me um i'd love to be in a car flying by at 60 70 miles an hour while everybody's stuck in traffic that that that would make me feel good about doing that right about using the hov paying a toll or something but i think that that little piece is still being worked through but you're talking about different legs you're in wesley chapel to the university area university to downtown downtown to the airport airport to gateway gateway to saint pete st pete to um to saint pete beach that whole area has a different legs and different but you want to have that spine that connects all of it so i understand that thought process and it's it is a it is a it is a slow slow work in progress but i think you know at the county we're we're planning our the office building for for the new the new office building for that'll be probably built way after i'm out of office maybe five years down six seven eight years down the road but um but that whole that whole planning about the dynamics that we spoke about how much do we need and where is it gonna be and you know that kind of conversation is still in play also with transit and um but those elements there's little pieces that we're working on access to beaches and ideas are coming up for on that we're talking about a a modal intermodal system in downtown clearwater to connect uh the rest of the transit to you know beach access transit and there's different pieces that are being worked on but it does it does seem to take forever doug back to your original question yeah and and i you probably and i think we are obviously slowly starting to see sing from the same sheet music but i remember having a conversation uh probably six eight years ago you probably had the same one one with the then senator latvala about funding for the area his passion was the airport to the beaches and when you would talk to him about funding in general for the area he would say the consensus in tallahassee is we don't know what the hell we want down there and so because we we were all singing from different sheet music and singing in different keys and you know i to your point i think we're slowly starting to to realize that because we're getting beat out on funding by miami-dade county continuously the money was going down there yeah you would think that there would be you could you could think in two ways one within your county and two in the region and you wouldn't just be you know so myopic that you could only think of things going on within your county you could do both and um and just even on the tma we have the we have rep we have two uh we have three representatives from pasco three from hillsboro three from pinellas and there's a difference i mean there's there's little tensions in that edges and the hillsborough folks seem to be in you know looking internally to their county more than externally uh except long-term projects like you know utilizing the rail the rail line at some point and and that kind of thing but yeah it's it's a it's a it's it's a it's a real challenge and the funding piece that hillsborough county went through you know they got shot down by the supreme court now what to do with it they're probably going to bring a referendum back again and i know i know pinellas county was having that discussion about having a referendum last november of course cove had changed all that you know there's no you're not gonna you're not gonna talk about increasing those kinds of fees and taxes on people that are either out of work or struggling or worried about things and so you kind of got away from that i'm not sure that we're gonna be healthy enough in that sense to have that discussion for 2022 but i certainly would think in 2024 that that i could see a place for that kind of conversation but again you're talking three four three years away so three and a half years away to talk about getting a local funding source and that would be you know adding another penny for transit mobility and that could be all kinds of stuff not just buses it could be could be some type of some type of rail could be some type of um gondola system across you know beach access it could be hov lanes could be there could be a lot of things involved in that um and um but i think that conversation and the importance of it is definitely on everybody's plate today versus say 10 years ago but you know you know things just move slowly and in some ways you know being methodical and being a little bit more deliberate uh saves you i don't have to be the first on the block to do something i can see others do it and learn from it and it can be better on the other hand we don't want to be doing the same conversation 20 years from now probably so the young people i'm told the young people like transit they like to be independent of their cars so again if we're if we're our our average age group and pinellas county government is 52 years old so there's opportunities for young people to come into government work and to exp you know to to to move up the ladder quickly quick more quickly than normal uh but you guess what they want to work from home they want to move around on in buses and you're trying to attract that talent to your county for companies that kind of talent to this county for our government so and you those are the pieces that they want to see happening if they if not in place they want to see happening so again i think those are all elements that we have to keep an eye on yeah absolutely dave we started the conversation we started to start a conversation talking about a really innovative model governance model for economic development as you go into transportation my observation on tibarda and correct me if i'm wrong was was always this but tibor was informed was given a lot of responsibility but has given no authority and they really can't do anything except talk yeah i i it's a jerry i mean i can tell you i looked right over it commissioner long in a meeting yesterday i said i'm going to get a scowl when i asked him this question so i asked her the question i said can you give me an elevator speech about the mission and value value added that tibarda brings to the area i have too many people asking me what the hell do they do and um and and i i'm serious the show she said instead of a scowl she said thank you for that question as only commissioner long can do she pivot and uh but then she went on to explain what she felt the real value was to it some of which is getting federal funding to the area with what you have one voice for the region you know that's one value to it uh but also having the conversations and bridging gaps between heart and and the psta is another one there there are elements there and she was talking through it i said well i wanted an elevator speech um so uh but i mean the senators that in our our state senators are challenging the existence of it and so i i do think and and there was some comments made by the chair of tea bar that wondered about the real value so i think there's some real like we got to be doing things to your point jerry talking is just you know i people we just we do a lot of talking in government and i think when we start implementing things people start believing but it's also where we really help and augment the efforts that are going on by our business community implementation talk talk talk talk it just drives me nuts but yeah i think the responsibilities of debarter were pretty clear you know pretty clearly but they just never had the authority to make people work together no authority felicia's got a question but i remember mentioning the commissioner seal probably five or six years ago as well to jerry's point that that uh you know tibarda is is a mouth with no teeth and that's a very sensitive subject to commissioner seal i know and and i think that's kind of jerry's point i know they have some funding and things like that but still again as you say uh commissioner it's you know a lot of talk talk felicia you have a question yeah i i did i actually um i i wanted to talk a little bit about that employment sites program so i see that like today is the official deadline to take applications but i think that we've been very successful at um getting businesses here to put in those first steps so so do you um do you have any idea of where it's going now you talk you're talking about the um the economic development piece of the penny yes yes i'll be i'll just be totally candid i i'm um i'm i'm still trying to wrap my arms around it um not not not how you calculate what we have not how you um can you know envision what it could be used for but you know again i think to your points like how do we how do we get companies to understand where that piece what it plays in the role of their own development or their own construction and um and again the the idea of those funds being available to help make things happen as opposed to no it doesn't meet a standard um and and i i'll be you know that's one of the areas that we are you know barry burton our county administrator i have talked about uh that that's an area that we have to i think i don't mean step up as in we we don't have it but just better better communicate the opportunity to our businesses and i know you all are trans trying to be a translator for it um but it becomes so sometimes more difficult it's like you know but it can really it can really make a difference to our small businesses um and um and i think we need to see specific examples pulled together as to how it can help a business expand we have a hundred we have fifty thousand foot space i need seventy five thousand i need a twenty five thousand foot expansion my but it's based on future you know future and so they have relationship with banks and banks can come to the table and then there's a you have equity requirements and there's a gap there's a gap and we can help make it happen but again it's it needs to be a little more fluid i think at least i need to understand it better myself so i can explain it better now like yeah yeah and for and for that you know we would um we would offer our assistance with that we we've had conversations with several local businesses so if that's helpful in any way as the county is going down the line i think we may have a um you know a unique perspective for trying to shepherd people through the process thank you thank you and felicia i think that might there might be a place in that then that conversation the next month or so the one that you're going to have to interject any of any of those types of thoughts in there too because i think it just adds to the many dimensions that we need to to simultaneously address you know i don't want to be addressing this one and then in three or four months to address the next one we can try to address many at the same time and get to us get getting to a place quicker and sooner and more effective uh effectively i think would so yeah please you know i know you will but just we would definitely offer to help i i definitely from our perspective we i can see the challenges so anything that we can do to provide some kind of technical assistance from our experience you know we we want to help and then the other thing i wanted to share with the group was that commissioner eggers was talking about you know the population and the jobs ratio so so um doug had recently reached out to pinellas county economic development to help update our statistics so i have a couple of powerpoint slides that i just i just felt like i should share so i'm gonna i'm gonna share those real fast hey felicia that'll that'll upgrade the class of this whole presentation by bringing it so thank you so again this came from pinellas county so hang on because i i thought it was um you know it made me happy to see it so can you guys see my screen uh yeah there it is that's our buddy ben friedman huh yeah yep so ben friedman helped us he's a genius um i think he's a genius but absolutely one of the best researchers so um you can see we this is our 2020 demographics but you know oldsmar we're still the we're the youngest median age in pinellas county um so you know saint pete were right below st p but i thought that was interesting you know from commissioner egger's remark about our demographics and the age so um you know you can see safety harbor and clearwater and and tarpon and dunedin and then the the other side i think that is um helpful is is this one and so that's our our population and our you know um the population ben can only pull by zip code he can't pull by our municipal boundary so everybody's population is askewed and so but you know in in oldsmar we have the very high jobs to population ratio which is which is what communities dream of yeah um and then we also have the the highest average earnings um in all of north pinellas and that average earning number being a more more universal to pinellas county is definitely a target we got a ways to go to get there but yeah that's that's pretty that's pretty amazing that's pretty graphic is that household is that household income no no that's average earnings for per job ratio so that's per job in pinellas county but that's because we have a high number of professional technical jobs because of our manufacturing sector right it all comes down to when um commissioner edgars was saying you know the the 70 the 70 residential to a 30 business but it's our it's our um it's our high concentration of technical professional manufacturing in particular so i just thought doug just got that information he hadn't seen that i had updated the powerpoint yet but doug i updated the powerpoint yeah and it continues to grow we have the 2018 numbers and then the 2020 numbers and things continue to to inch up throughout the county but we're leading the way and the other really interesting thing is we're still i think and you know this again maybe could help um uh could help is that i still think we're we're one of the few export economies in pinellas so we actually export here more than we consume which makes us unique awesome now doug i can't figure out how to unshare my screen now i don't know how to do that either so we'll just leave it sit there because it's you guys it's showcasing all it's showcasing oldsmar so we'll just leave it like that [Laughter] yeah yeah so anything else dave that you want to finish i i did have a quick question i don't know if there's a quick answer to it uh you you were talking about industrial areas um and what's the status of airco is there any any plans for that the olympic golf course because that's one of the biggest industrial pieces in the county yeah you know obviously it has its challenges uh from a uh elevation standpoint there's going to be a lot of a lot of land you know a lot of land uh elevation to be done um because just of where it's located uh the there's a piece that's gonna be associated with with the airport uh i know there'll be a piece that is more associated with businesses and um the last thing i heard on i haven't heard anything on it recently was that there's there is interest from businesses in that area and there are discussions going on but i i couldn't tell you from the you know i'm not sitting at the table so i don't really have a feel for you know how real it is there's a lot of infrastructure work that needs to be done to make it real to make it business receptive because if i'm a business looking for something right now you know you're talking probably five years away before i can you know have a shop there you go you got to get water sewer elevation planned and so there's a lot of uh and i and i i do know that that kind of conversation of what we need to be doing is going on but it's not it's not ready yet that's right i didn't mean to pop that on you but yeah people are looking for people are looking for more like we have somebody that's looking for you know 40 000 square feet in oldsmar and we have a building that hopefully would be done you know at least frame wise in december so those are the kind of time frames that i think people are are looking for to explain to your point earlier i have fifty thousand i need seventy thousand but i need it within a year not five years from now well hey doug when you get when you when we have one of those businesses that needs to grow don't forget there's a there's the coca-cola plant over in dunedin maybe we can steal a business back to dunedin yeah let me google it let me let me google done and see if i can remember any other questions chuck you got how are your lights doing over there chuck you doing okay thank you thank you for the invite i'd like to check i like to be a part of your meeting anyway so it's great to to be a part of it today and um i just would say overall i'm really you know very optimistic and positive about where things are heading right now and just you know just keep working together i think i'm really excited about this this next two or three month effort that's going on on this front and um just i think there's some real good opportunities and the area is recovering pretty much faster than we thought so that's that's a positive optimism well just know that we're here to work with the county on whatever we can so felicia got any closing comments i see how you got out of your screenshare and you just got off this you just if all else fails control alt delete look at it just left the meeting and came back so yeah hey doug look at deb's map there putting oldsmar right front and center yeah yeah yeah yep dunedin's way over here yeah somewhere so well thank you so much dave i appreciate it i i recorded this and i'm gonna edit it and and i know you've got a full day ahead of you so we really appreciate it and maybe felicia and i can work on updating the rest of that slideshow and make a presentation down the road to share some of that because it really is interesting uh how the numbers worked out so yeah thank you everybody i appreciate it have a terrific day bye thank you thank you you",

beautiful ready to get into the public and um live like a human being for once have a bit of fun hey you and the first lady just kicking back yeah just kicking back um yeah it's been a hard three days trying to convince her that um i was a good boy but um yeah it is what it is uh let's get into a few of the questions then we've got a few questions from the d gens um i want to talk about one thing that we forgot to mention when we spoke last time after game one uh what were the details behind the now infamous phone call to wayne bennett about extending and getting the extra day run us through how that combo went and how how wayne what how wayne the goat was with you in camp following that conversation yeah scoby um it's pretty much of a blur very vague memory to be honest but um i do have moments of it where i was sitting there signing jerseys for the premiership and um i had cooper on my left and brent on the right and um he wouldn't like he would know ben and brian byron doesn't take too much to convince me to have a beer yeah so yeah brandon just goes mate let's just let's just make a meal of it and we'll go to barn for an or two and um let's just celebrate a bit more i was like oh [ __ ] and then i cooper cooper john's in my hand and yeah he's the best of getting up a motivational speech and getting you up so you got me up and yeah i just remember ringing and um yeah the cool didn't take too long um it was too much just it was pretty much made just get your [ __ ] ass here um so yeah it didn't really um go down too well but when i got back in the camp um yeah it was um it was all knuckled down and um yeah it was a great time yeah how good um so then you eventually got into camp and then you've now had again what what's become one of the great meme photos it could be go down it's people will comparing it to the joey the joey photo on the skateboard you leaving the grand final bender going straight into camp and look like you're doing it really tough in that uh that team photo um what's your thoughts on that is do you think you're going to get into joey territory with that photo with that meme or um how are you feeling how are you feeling when you're in camp for the first couple days well that was that was literally the first day photos and that was the night i was a day i decided to do so there was a person waiting at the front for about an hour and a half to two hours me trying to convince myself that i was going in the camp so then we got to the gold coast and i was still off no sleep and i was in and out of like half asleep going to gold coast i was in and out maybe an hour and a half sleep yeah put into got in the camp and i got told we had to do team photos and i just looked them and said you got to be kidding me they're like surely give you another day yeah give me one more day like look at me um and then we got like literally got to the spot that we were doing our team photos and i said oh this is this won't take long we had to do singles we had to do team photos and we had to do the spine as well and do like the lights and everything so i wouldn't couldn't imagine what it was looking like in those other photos but mate i was i was pretty much falling asleep in the team photo yeah yeah it did look like that and because of that it's become legendary you've obviously gone on to now win the series after winning the grand final i think a lot of a lot of the punters respect you even more for that it's one of those things where you look like you're doing a dusty but i think i spoke about it on his little show yesterday it's probably going to go down in folklore now so very proud that you were able to do that mate step up to the plate after doing it so tough for four or five days and getting the job done no there's only one joey boyz and dusty so i'm very grateful to be in that category but got a long way to go yeah we'll maybe get on the podium little third place you get a bronze medal sit behind sit behind the fourth place who's the third then participation participation leading on to the origin let's talk a little bit about the origin um i want to ask you where this one compares because back at the start of your career you come on the back end of that run with with probably the greatest ever origin team assembled playing with the great where does it compare winning winning the origin with those boys compared to winning it with what some say uh poor gallon the worst origin team of all time oh it's a hard one scope i guess making your debut with the big three and you play all your footy with them for the last six or seven years and to guest debut in the [ __ ] as a young fellow watching on wednesday nights with having pizza with your family um is up there um but like you said my art to play series by yourself where no one really gave you any chance um with all the young debutants and with mel um and wayne they're the reason why we probably won it they just gave us some so much confidence in those young blokes and um and you can you've seen some of the young blokes step up to the big stage and harry grant xavier co played a pretty good two games um obviously you couldn't play for the third one but some of them young bugs that you wouldn't even heard of and names and you're thinking you're scratching your head going mate why are they in the team um yeah just it's such a great feeling um and you obviously would have seen after the game everyone was rubbing shoulders and hugging and pretty much kissing each other because it meant so much to queensland and and to us um we knew we weren't the greatest side but you know it's like when you're playing in big games all you need is the right attitude and work hard for each other and it gets the job done yeah well a couple of things you mentioned there i know you're normally a pretty humble guy you like having a laugh but whenever you talk about accolades and whatnot even just chatting to you while we're up there you not only you but a lot of the other boys kept on mentioning the influence that wayne and mel had in the camp in particular um and then i'll touch on another thing but yeah do you want to talk on that a little bit more as well like what what is it bro because um i know there's experience and like you know mel's done it before but what was there one thing that you can identify that sort of they instilled in the group that made you feel like you were confident enough to get the job done especially considering you said you had so many deputies yeah it was just standards um chess you've played with him you know what he's like all the older blokes have been there and done it and um and a lot of young blokes were coming into the camp like looking up to us um had been idols of us and we'll we'll be in chasing all that looked at each other going we haven't done anything like like it's just crazy like well for example we were drinking that night and he's having a coach stood up and like said cam you need to have two shots with me because i looked up to you as a young and i'm listening you've got to be kidding me mate like he's the best kid ever too by the way yeah and he was piping up and he never usually pops up and i was just shows where like everyone was no no one was beneath anyone and everyone was on the same page and we all respected each other in the group and regardless if you played or you didn't um we all have respect and mutual respect for each other being in the camp and if you're in the camp we know you're there to do a job and i guess wayne has put all that confidence in us and the biggest thing that hit me on the head was that that day we were supposed to play we're just about to get on the bus and he showed the team of 2017 with a big photo of celebrating with a shield and said boys do you want to be partying like that tonight or do you want to be partying with your head down in your heads and you're just wishing right so yeah it obviously gave us a lot of boost and confidence when we went into the game and um yeah i'll never forget it that's unreal bro um you mentioned harry just before uh i've got written down here as i was calling him baby goat which he he was reluctant he was reluctant to answer back to while we're up there um is he got next is he how impressed were you where were you from his debut um being you know a storm teammate obviously played at the tigers this year but you spent a bit of time with him at the storm and were there any other origin debutants that that impressed you i think you mentioned xavier um any other guys that sort of stood up you know what's your thoughts on harry and the other deputy times yeah funny not really that people know scope but i actually played with his older brother george back back in rocky oh yeah so you've known him for a minute i've known him for ages um played all my school footy against his brother and uh funny enough his old man was the one that put me on to the recruitment manager at the storm oh yeah he's that had a bit of a bit of time at the brennans i was obviously at a different high school but um yeah he just said mate give this kid look and um yeah it went from there so i've always been forever in his debt for passing me on so i've obviously got to look after the young fella now but nah the baby goat um just the way he trains um he's he plays like he trains and as you can see he creates um things that are nothing and he's just a footballer and he just runs a ball and tends to things thing tend to happen for him when he runs a ball and yeah that's why he's a baby goat first game in origin decider worst team of origin and he puts a bit performance on like that and unfortunately um the tigers lose him we're obviously trying to keep him and it's a great it's a great news for the next decade for queensland i'm sure he'll be captain of this team soon and um and that's how much that's how much respect he got from him as a player and um yeah people just tend to play with him and that's a massive rap and down here deserves it yeah um i think the one thing that always stands out with you guys and knowing these boys a little bit now because i think i've said this before to you like i've i always used to hate melbourne back in the day we had a bit of a rivalry during my days at manly in melbourne but whenever i've met any of the man the melbourne boys no matter what they've achieved throughout the time they're always really humble and and harry seems like he's you know he's the same sort of guy he's level-headed he didn't want to be called the baby goat because it felt like it embarrassed him so just another just another reason to love the kid um what about any other guys that stood up like like like you mentioned xavier coates was was really good in game one and game two game two was a bit harder because results didn't go your way and you probably wouldn't have seen much of the game but um i thought i thought kp was unreal mate uh considering this yeah yeah yeah like you said capes um corey allen was really good at training as well he's got real good silky hands um he's not one of them full backs that runs the ball back hard and gonna dint the line like a vel holmes or or anything like that but just him at the back of shaping his presence around the ball um really showed um he's like you said that first try was off him he caught yeah very silky very silky hands um and that's what you want from your full back obviously you need him to run the ball back as hard as he can at times as well but um he comes to his own especially around that that try line to that 20 middle line and really execute his passes and scores try so that's what you want in a full back but um yeah he's going to be something special as well i don't know what's going on with sauce but i'm sure some club will pick him up um xavier um he's it's hard mate he's got a bit of drow yay and a bit of gi in him he's still raw and he's still big and athletic and just the way he jumps for that ball and he's just got that presence about him and um yeah it's just so so much special to see him play yeah that's unreal yeah he always seems like he's he's probably even just like in the celebrations too was sitting on the hill i was talking about that interview that he had he still got like this massive big cheesy grin on his on his diet he was proper enjoying every moment of it and those are the times when you're looking and you understand that's that's the reason you you love footy and speaking about our time in byron up on the hill um the fish the fish was supposed to turn up mate what happened what happened to the fish let us down don't get me started i mean i was calling him all hours in the morning all hours of the night trying to get him there because i got some of the boys to stay an extra night because we i was that confident he was coming and he ended up texting me on sunday morning going oh sorry mate i had a big weekend and i was like no he ended up hanging out with uh dusty and kevin that so i couldn't imagine why he didn't turn up but yeah um yeah i was pretty pretty filthy but other than saying that i think they needed three two or three days of a pass because he lives in gold coast and he gone in this out of the border i'm not fairly sure he didn't have one so oh that's all right he said he owes me one so um it's not a bad person to owe to so i'll make sure i take it up soon yeah make sure you get me the invite for that too because i'll be coming back up you always invited escape um what about we got a little spray in the uh me and me and sandal got a little spray in the daily mail too yesterday hanging out with the prez few few washed up retired nrl players hanging out with the president just living off his coattails wearing his wearing his medal around geez they got us there oh mate i honestly didn't even see the paparazzi there to be honest with you scope i was looking around everywhere i was thinking someone's surely going to take something but they got us a beauty um but yeah a bit disrespectful to be honest talking about being washed up i think you and chandler can still play the game and at a high level um there's no doubt about that at all but yeah obviously media trying to hype it up and do a bit of click bait so people can watch it and get a bit amongst it so it's pretty chill on their end um but i guess that's the world we live in at the moment people are just going to try and do whatever it takes to get a bit of click bait but nothing but respect for you two boys and i really enjoyed my time with his and byron well look i wouldn't i wouldn't take it back i wouldn't to save me life that was a good weekend like you said probably just a slow news day and not much doing and you know what i'm just happy to get a mention these days anyway so it's good for the scope podcast if i get it even if i get caught washed up it's a it's a good little spray to get all right it's annoying when they when they say that because they haven't played the game don't know what it's like so oh wait a minute and by the way we've got one one more person that wants to weigh in on the uh he wants to jump in on the zoom caller so we'll see if we can get him in and he can have his two cents oh here we go who is it this will be good have we got him hey he's got the passengers in melbourne can we get a yktr face mask something oh man what's he doing it's funny it's funny you called in sandor because we me and me and money were just going in we're just talking about sitting here we go boys have we have we all got the face mask on give me a second i'm filthy that i have to wear it can you still hear me through this any chance i can get a face mask something yeah yeah we'll see we'll send you one mate now now that we're we're washed up um we're gonna we're gonna live off the freebies mate was this i was just talking to pres geez me and you got a hammock for hanging out with him oh jeez didn't we what geez the proper sidekicks oh my i got a question from one of the degenerates and i want to know if you can answer this for us and all the question was how many cheeks did you pull with the wally lewis medal [Laughter] well here we go here's the the debate is how much credit are we going to give to the wally lewis medal there's been a couple of there's been a couple of um different posts thrown around um you know some support from a couple of different uh nrl banter um accounts on instagram which i'm very grateful for which is you could have snapped me wearing the premiership ring and the uh wally lewis medal then there really would have been a [ __ ] uproar yeah i think uh oh i i think we all had to go at some point wearing it and i pretty much wore it for the whole time at the house party so i'm glad there were no photos taken back there oh mate hello but uh yeah thanks uh thanks for coming in and clarifying that brother how are you traveling you're back down you're back down to melbourne now yeah back into it got the uh f45 keen on back in the grind you know the us washed up lads we're random podcasts we're uh we're back in the gym so we're just we're just doing our best you know just a couple of battlers yeah my demons couple of demons out there hey well you know what i said i said to prez just before i said now that we're retired and washed up any publicity is good publicity for us at the moment so if they get if it gets people talking about the scope podcast we'll take it hey correct i'll be throwing on a party show this weekend send down the wally lewis medal and i'll uh see how successful it goes in melbourne boys you know you know we need to do we need to make a little metal and have candles based on it yes yes let's send it to wally lewis [Laughter] hey if wally gets a start off the back of it well then [ __ ] yeah as it is mate the proof is in the pudding i think your lemon spreads looking a bit better than his at the moment but long live the king all right oh that's outstanding thanks for coming in and clarifying that door um it's a pleasure doing a podcast with the goat today as well oh yeah loki bloke in the bar now well we we'd uh we'd already done it okay but it's dropping today i hope that's not a i hope that's not a trade secret that it's pre-recorded but uh yeah that drops today so that'll be pretty cool always good to chat to our chat to denim and bloke in a bar so check it out live story you know how good we'll be tuning in to that a little bit later on then thanks for stopping in brother see you bro there we go clarified all done let's get on to a few questions from the degenerates i've got about five or sixty for you to finish off fresh um no dramas at all still lucky left i couldn't get a word in yeah speaking of that was it leading on from the from the trip was a little misdemeanor between you and sandor on the balcony so one of the one of the degenerates asked about that yeah funny enough you know obviously we're having a bit of a giggle about me and being shana in the ring and i was telling him i knock his head off and obviously can't find myself out of a wet paper bag but i'm just cheating him up a bit more and obviously the beers got to both of us and um i'm one more comment for myself and he started seeing red and come over and push me over and i guess it got a little heated from there and then but we sorted it out like men and i had a bit of a chat and i'm still good mates and um yeah i guess when you're not if you don't have a bit of an argument with one of your mates on the pierce then it's not a good time yeah i feel like i'm half the blame for that i got it stirred up on by putting up a story and then all of a sudden sandal launches across the table and grabs grabs present a little chokehold and i go this is legit what's going on i had to get in there and get the boys apart we went downstairs they had a good chat in the alleyway for about half an hour no no fist against the throttle it was just a bit of batter between mates and uh and we moved on and i think that's where we went to the hill and got on the pitch together again i think that was the reason why we did so we couldn't happen again yeah um um one of the other questions is uh remus smith signing for he's that uh pretty a little low-key good signing for you got a bit of talent what's your thoughts on him um he's probably gonna slide over to the right right side now that sully's gone do you think that's where we'll probably end up yeah look um great talent um you're obviously seeing what he does at the bulldogs and he's really good in the air just ask him he's uh he pretty much posterizing my back up one stay at one stage there in the sunny coast um so um i remind him of that my back's still sore from that actually so um yeah great talent good in the air um good carries out of the back so he'd be really good signing for us um i'm sure away i saw wayne i'm sure craig i've got in my head sure craig will do um good things with him um he's all about work ethic and hard work and um if he can do that he'll pretty much have any support in the side and and um yeah all he has to just worry about is running the ball hard and getting the ball back and scoring tries and if he does that for us to be a very successful year for us again you'll be on the back back end of a fuel your kicks rather than jumping on your back this time uh hopefully um they'll be nice usual use boys always seem to get the best out of those players they've got a bit of talent probably haven't been at the best team and then they come to you guys and they kick on uh another one of the questions was if the borders were still open would mean you still be on a larry together i'd love to hope so scope um i think a couple hours sleep would be do us justice but um i think we'd love to go again um there's no doubt about it um first of december the board is open so um i hope the kennel is ready from a little even if it's a little dog bed i'll be there ready to go yeah we got a spot for you when you come down there's uh i hear there might be a little yktr party happening um halfway doesn't look mad or noisy so maybe maybe that might be a good time to come pop down and have a have another little larry have another little beer with us um yeah lovely nothing better than having a larry scope in in such a small amount of time um what's more rewarding for you from the winning the origin or winning the premiership in the last month considering the situations with covert obviously because spending a lot of time in the bubble and then obviously not not getting to see your family going straight into camp again and spending a lot of time in the bubble with the with the origin i it's a hard question it's like answering who your favorite kid is yeah um jesus um i would have to say like i know how proud queensland is of the origin and wanted us to win it and i'm glad we won it for him and they deserved it um so many queensland fans come out to us but i'd have to say um the premiership scope um working that hard during the pre-season two or three months with your teammates as much as i love my teammates for queensland um you only see them probably three weeks of the year um but you come together like you've seen them all year um it's got that bond but um yeah i'd have to say the storm premiership mate just because of what happened in melbourne and all the coronavirus that happened um there's so many people doing it tough down there with the businesses and people pretty much not be able to do anything for six months yeah going for a 5k walk if that for an hour so um an hour exercise was the only thing they got for probably four to six months and they were doing a lot tougher hospital or living up on the sunshine coast even though we were still in a bubble and we couldn't do much we were still able to go for a swim have a coffee at the resort even though we were blocked off from civilization and the public we still got to see people and and families and kids and um yeah i guess that was something that i really took for granted um obviously with you guys in byron i haven't obviously been out and had a drink with other people and at pubs and had a feed and stuff and you can't even dance you can't even get up and do whatever you want you got to just sit at the table and you're pretty much bar service so yeah i really took it for granted and um yeah hopefully fingers crossed it happens soon and we can all go out and have boogie 100 get back to normalities as quickly as possible um do you have a do you have any pregame rituals yeah i do actually um funny enough um i always get strapped maybe 15 minutes before we go out always always run out last and um i always put my left sock on and my left boot on before i do my right sock and my right boot and that's always my formality and routine um if i screw that up i pretty much gotta go and do it all over again so um it's pretty funny i know i come around as a laid-back guy but that's just three things that i really focus on that i need to get right yeah i thought ever ever all i think a lot of boys got those quirky little yeah whether it be massage or having a little stretch at certain times and i know i used to have a game day ritual and like a game day feed and whatnot um what about what's yours um i still host eat sushi every game day hey really yeah yeah and i used to i used to be the same thing i used to be an hour before we ran out i'd go get a massage and like you know sometimes it would throw me off if i wasn't because you know how you can do as soon as you get in there because you get in there an hour before hour and a half before the game yeah all the boys come put their names on the list and i used to always go to like leave a bit of a gap and put myself like fourth or fifth because that was always about an hour before it but sometimes the boys would come and put like six names above you hold on ah oh i think we're about to lose 10 minutes left remaining oh yeah we got 10 minutes left that's right um yeah some of the boys would come and squeeze him and above you and if just say if i was rushed because you know how you feel just before you about to go warm up if you if you rush gonna get a massage quick gotta get strapped quick he used to proper rattle me so those are some things a few things that i used to try to get get going before um a little two questions they're two punting questions because people love us on on the svc what's your favorite punting story and what's your thoughts on the prez today winning i mean uh the monster monster winning today in morpheville yeah i've got two punting stories um i'll be real quick um the first one is the old man tipped me uh 101 tip at toowoomba um and i obviously through the field in the the group chat with us and said boys um i've got a tip here 101 do what you like with it um i don't know if a win but i've got a massive uh tip on it obviously one um and one the boys a couple of thousand but some of the boys didn't get on and they'll be filthy about it um but the other one is um obviously deanna i can't even say the word that's how good i am yeah proper degenerate yeah proper one um i actually like pretended to put money into my account and i always do this and i put eight like just pretend to put eight thousand dollars on this horse and it ends up winning and i didn't even back it it got to eighty thousand and i wasn't i thought on it threw it on a ten dollar thing and it won so i would have won eight hundred thousand um and i've never told anyone this but um it still hurts to this day um and i watched the race and i said you gotta be [ __ ] kidding me what do you mean so you pretend to put money on it and then take it out and then like just don't follow through for a giggle yeah just don't follow through for a gig i don't know i just did it to myself and i looked at myself going holy hecka i'd be probably be able to give up footy but um yeah obviously it wasn't meant to be and i'm still kicking myself better but that's life harmful monster oh jesus it's a top weight obviously you got a got an apprentice on it with a one and a half kilo claim um i've actually funny enough i've actually had the owner ring me and asked me if i wanted to have a share in it um talk to a manager about it um he wasn't too keen on it but um yeah if it's anything like it's anything like his person at the moment it's a bit erratic um it might come out of the gates looking a bit scabby but at the end of the day i'll run down and do his best like work like scope does so fingers crossed he gets up to the boys it's like you mentioned before mate like it's got a bit of weight on it but i mentioned it in my little ride up in the sbc you've got the white yeah the way to queensland on you still got the job done brother so let's uh let's check our fingers let's keep our fingers crossed we're back in the uh sbc today i appreciate you coming on brothers uh that one went a little bit longer than last time but thanks for coming on brother skipper and prez episode two [ __ ] baby thanks kobe boys [ __ ] baby thanks boys see you soon", "guGffGw3uDg": "couple weeks ago brooke and i crammed our lives into a rented van and launched into a two thousand mile journey from new york city to colorado bridge duck as we hurtled into the setting sun i could feel that big city smog giving way to blue skies crisp mountain air and a fresh new outlook on life but i was wrong we now live you see in the suburbs to beat back this desolate cyberpunk wasteland and pry its consumerist fingers off my soul i've developed a weapon of pure creativity a cyber attack ladies gentlemen cyborgs say hello to the void star data blaster and welcome to voidstar lab west from the future i am zach friedman high altitude cybernetics suburbanite and this is the void star data blaster i've taken this raspberry pi 400 and souped it up with a detachable wearable display battery handles an sdr receiver and a goddamn antenna in fiction the cyberdeck is the trademark battle station of console cowboy anti-heroes running nets through cyberspace but what makes a real-life cyber deck depends on who you ask the cyber deck subreddit says it's basically a laptop computer but using an hmd or neural interface cyberdeck cafe says they're artisan crafted computers made in the cyberpunk aesthetic the cyberdeck discord says i don't actually know what they say because every time i log in i get distracted for hours you should totally join the cyberdeck discord also join the voidstar lab discord even us cyborgs crave human interaction i decided this cyber deck needed four things one it needs handles so i can lug the deck where the action is and jack in without sitting down it's always easier to jack in one-handed number two it needs full-size physical keyboard but it can't fold up if it's got a touch keyboard it's a tablet if it's got a hinge it's a laptop number three it needs cyberpunk features brain computer interfaces are bogus fight me so that means it needs a head mounted display and some cyber snooping ready sdr why is it called the data blaster well it ended up looking kind of like an old school ghetto blaster except data some of you may ask what i'm going to do with the cyber deck and that is an excellent question this is the first project i built at my new workshop which totally rules void star lab west is almost as big as my entire old apartment and has tons of tools and toys that just couldn't fit into the fab lab i also added a 3d print farm humidor room i'm giving my patrons an exclusive tour so if you want to see the new and improved void star lab and support future projects like this one head to patreon.com zac friedman the heart of this project is the raspberry pi 400 which is basically a raspberry pi 4 in a keyboard the pi 400 is perfect for cyber dacking because it's a slim computer and a slim keyboard and all the ports are on the same side so there are fewer cables to run the pi 400 uses the same chip as the four gigabyte pi 4 but it actually runs both faster and cooler it's science look it up i ordered this 1280 by 480 touchscreen from aliexpress 1280x480 sounds like i'm saying something wrong but think of it like two 640 by 480 displays in one the display is sensibly short but still comfortably holds two terminal windows side by side or one lead hacksaw split terminal i have no idea what the script is doing but it looks sick but no cyber deck is complete without a way to wire your head into the matrix so allow me to introduce the viewfinder unlike my octagon wearable teleprompter the viewfinder is just a display no computer which is perfect because it's attached to a computer this is literally a second monitor i can drag anything from the main display to the viewfinder and even use both at once the viewfinder doesn't permanently attach to glasses it's held on my magnetic mount so i can detach it from my face and stash it on a dock on the deck on on the deck dock the pi 400 sucks 500 milliamps doing literally nothing and i can draw over one and a half amps when it's feeling frisky i bought a chunky 20 amp hour usb bank to give it plenty of juice it's fancy more like a solar panel for off the grid fun don't get too attached to it though this story does not have a happy ending you see i was supposed to design a circuit board for the data blaster but dragging 200 boxes of crap through two time zones turns out to be kind of distracting this week's episode is sponsored by next pcb the quick turn circuit board prototype manufacturer even with next pcb's 4 day turnaround and 24 hour shipping i just could not finish this project before we left new york with prices this low and service this fast prototyping straight to a pcb is a no-brainer says the guy who just proved he had he has no brain had i made boards i would also be able to refine my design with nextdfm their free gerber analysis tool not only does this visualize the gerbers that you're about to fab it also scans them for hidden dangers and risky elements that can trash your budget and smash your schedule next dfm also lets you panelize your boards which is a super useful feature that's missing from eagle popular board editors kick ad no matter what you're building no matter what software you're using and no matter where you're having them made next dfm can boost your odds of crushing your design on the first try links are in the description and every board you order supports voidstar lab i started by modeling the raspberry pi 400 and then i designed a home for each part i constantly printed these little test slices to make sure all my dimensions were right you can see that some of these took a few tries so thank satan that we have micro center in denver so i could buy more filament i have got to stop name dropping micro center the trickiest part was getting the wearable display dock its sexy curves made it basically impossible to measure and i had to design the dock mostly by trial and error you can see that i originally intended to make the data blaster white to match the pie but this was a big mistake everyone knows that everything cyberpunk has to be black which is why the most cyberpunk of all the cookware is the cast iron skillet next task is the battery handles before we build we must destroy its equivalent exchange baby i'm gonna pull the lithium ion cells out of this power bank and then rearrange them into the handles except wait this usb battery pack doesn't have cells it's got lipo packs well if only i had made my own power board all i have is my daily driver usb power bank and i need that for my portable soldering iron at least i needed it for my portable soldering iron hey kids soldering to batteries is extremely dangerous these things can start a house fire so make sure you do this project before you get too attached to your house so i bought this extra flexible 18 gauge wire from amazon and i added a slot in these segments to route it but when i started soldering this weird black crud started boiling up and ruining my joints this was odd because this usually happens when there's padding or enamel or some other additive in the wire but but this is all copper wait a second why is the cut in silver instead of you know copper colored well this isn't copper wire at all each strand is aluminum wire painted to look like copper wire so this wire is worthless i'm gonna find out who did this i'm gonna go to their house i'm gonna wait till they're showering i'm gonna sprinkle legos all over their floor here's how this thing comes together uh in front we have a face plate which has the heads-up display dock and has a frame to stick the display to it has like some double-sided adhesive on it everything is covered in ads nowadays i mean in our cyberpunk future so i printed some fake logo badges the pcb from the power bank is mounted in the middle layer the back has some fancy flair for which i forgot to focus the camera and some integrated pegs to wind up the wearable displays cable you have to do a little loop the loop at the end next step figure out the wiring these ribbon cables are the thinnest available but i'm limited on how aggressively i can bend them because if they crease they break figuring out a combination of ports and parts that minimize the wiring was by far the hardest part of the project and i really should have just integrated all these into one board this is a double pane in the ass that's right a pain in two asses because the zip sockets are super duper fragile and even a tiny bit too much force will snap this tab off wait i need this one for the project pistols the power banks charging port and power button are now buried inside the deck so i added an extension cable and a fancy light up button the battery handles mount to the back plate and over here is the charging indicator from the powerbank pcb i added some light pipes made of 3d printer filament and the blue leds make the filament fluoresce for the finishing touch i added a new elec nester nano 3 a super small software to find radio an sdr is sort of like an am fm cb tv basically super high bandwidth receiver with tuning electronics to let you use software to define what radio signals you pick up i can still use this to sweep for bugs debug wireless gizmos and make cool-looking waterfall plots nothing says cyberpunk like sniffing and demodulating every radio signal in the immediate vicinity with a collapsible aerial finally let's get ahead of the meme lords not only does the data blaster play doom it plays doom on a wearable display i'll be honest i built this thing for the cool factor but it turned out to actually be really useful it's easy to carry and it's you know fully loaded desktop computer with like linux the battery life is bananas this thing draws like 600 milliamps from the batteries so with over 20 amp hours in the tank this thing could run for like 30 straight hours i left the gpio usb ports and ethernet open so i can hook anything up the data blaster has immediately become my dedicated go anywhere do anything field computer and now that i'm in colorado where we actually have fields you're going to see a lot more of it if you want to build your own i did not have the time to take pictures for the how-to guide and now it's fused together with epoxy so you're screwed i did put the printable stl files in the bill of materials in the description it's not terribly difficult to figure out how to make it but uh sorry in the future i do plan to revisit this project and make a version that's better documented you know not permanently glued together and of course loaded with custom circuit boards from our sponsor next pcb assuming they don't fire me for not actually using their product in their video subscribe if you want to see that not me getting fired the cyber deck this project was made possible by my hyper generous patrons filling up the parts fund if you've got the means and you want to see more spicy projects hit the thing right up over there your support makes a colossal difference our super cyberpunk collaborators are cmd and i'm not bettacore i've implanted their names somewhere in this episode so go trace their uplinks our augmentedly awesome lab assistants are tech daddy taranak sea harris robert breeze salty roger pink oh the antifa azundo

patton but by far the biggest thank you to our overlord and savior the one person who i really wouldn't be here without oh i'm sorry it looks like it got cut off i'm just kidding william overton and daniel cadwell i'm glad the guy from the last episode who was calling for help via patreon username got rescued although maybe he died anyways thanks to brooke the greatest road tripper in the west into our discord mods my fair julie billy rubin and tekniak who held down the fort during our voyage billy has been streaming regularly on her own channel and it is delightful so go check that out but wait one final thanks to boot disk the hack maniac who basically made the entire cyberdeck community happen he invited me to the cyber deck virtucon a few weeks ago and we chatted about diy wearables we got do maternal running on a heads up display and i spilled prosecco in my lap about three minutes after the camera started rolling and i had to keep a poker face link is in the description like

cities um where i was strongly influenced by my mother's devotion to artwork and creative outlets and um and some very fine teachers through the school system there when i was a kid my mom used to sit with a drawing board right in her lap so no one could see what she was doing um i i wasn't real out with what i liked doing um i started going to the university of iowa in in the 70s and one of the small projects that i worked on was um the hawks are clicking badge homecoming badge for 1976. that one particularly it you can see it featured here in this picture um i'm very proud that one of the things that i did way back then as small as it was is part of a collection for the university of iowa i started off pursuing artwork at the university but so many teachers in the art department said i needed to loosen up so i loosened up by going into another field actually just to be able to i needed to have a job a career when i finished doing that when um we moved to des moines from the university of iowa area here um we moved to des moines um i had a realtor friend who contacted me and said hey you'd like to draw would you like to sketch a house that i just sold and he would give the drawing to the people there that's what kind of got me started um and that was almost 40 years ago what you're seeing right here and the very first slide was four doors um this is my largest piece ever this is in colored pencil and ink four different separate drawings with one stream of water going through them each drawing representing a different season of the year um this is for a true value store in southern iowa that wanted to be known as the store for all seasons so they asked me if i would do this particular almost mural um these pieces started off actually as um oh they were about 11 by 14 drawings uh and i laid them side by side and then once they had them in their hands they went to a sign printer and they went to these garage doors um pretty amazing to me this is one of the ones that i i loved working on um this particular fraternity is was celebrating their 100th anniversary they were uh this was in it is in ames iowa right now uh really enjoyed doing that and doing lots of detail to it the state capital of iowa yes in des moines there a lot of my drawings were in des moines that's where i resided for uh 25 almost 30 years and this particular drawing was the cover of a calendar um during the 90s i swore off doing calendars after that particular venture that was really a toughy but um this one is one of the few gold domed capitals in our whole country very happy with that one this one touched me so tremendously the staff of senator tom harkin asked me apparently they are asked frequently to give to donate something to different organizations for fundraising um tom harkin wanted an iowa artist to represent the united states capital and he wanted to be able to give a a drawing to visitors or to people who worked on different ideas for him and so these prints were available only through him and um i was very very honored to be a part of that project for sure um this one was one of my early i um capital drawings of the capital in des moines of the state of iowa and uh i guess i should have started off by this whole conversation saying how very touched i am to be asked to be doing this videotaping for you right now because it's just it's an exciting idea what's happening in iowa city with with artists and and recognizing the people that we have in our own neighborhood anyway this particular drawing was one that um as i look at it now i think i mean i had the perspective right but i worked directly with what i saw rather than what is if i could do that all over again i would straighten that building out but it's kind of got a neat perspective as it looks up the hill at it like that um court avenue in des moines at one end of it is the capital the other end is the courthouse and i had the opportunity to draw that in a couple of different angles and versions along with this is one of the other angles and versions of it um i kind of challenged myself on this one to draw this old part of des moines it had spaghetti works and it had this uh building that was slowly being converted into something else right now well i did this and and i actually did like i think i did 120 prints of this i i thought i don't even know 120 people let alone 120 who would like to be able to have my artwork showing anyway the week after i completed this the building in the foreground on the one side there burned down to the ground um the newspaper contacted me and asked if we if they could use my drawing as a before and they would show that after with the fire uh taking the the whole building away the photographer for the regis des moines register stood where he thought i was standing and he said i can't get the capital in there and i said that's because it's the power of the pen you can move things around and place them for for the perspective for what you want to be conveyed and and that's what i ended up doing so i was very it was kind of you know you can do a lot of pen is not forgiving but you can move things to make them be the way you want them to be um court avenue brew pub this particular building used to be a hat factory uh back at the turn of the century in somewhere this particular place turned into a brewing place a brewery and they used my drawing as coasters as bottles as drinking mugs um as far as my teenage kids at the time decided that that was the first thing that i did that was really cool was to be on a beer stein um along with polk county uh courthouse which is at the end of court avenue that drawing was used for several different things along with um christmas cards note cards um event programs and exciting the university of iowa president's home asked president's office asked me to draw this just a couple of years ago when the house was celebrating its um its 100th anniversary um i was thrilled to be doing that one that that just um i think that's over on church street and something that maybe many of you can get over and compare and see they used that particular drawing to celebrate their anniversary at the time um the the original of it is in the entryway as you come into the the place itself this one is by far my most personally that i feel personally attached to an achieved great detail with um the emirates company was in um des moines they represented about five different companies including iowa realty they asked me to portray somehow all of the places that they worked during the floods of 1993 in which they wanted to show every community coming together to be stronger so i selected photos i i went around the state drove around to these different locations and um went to cedar rapids rock island des moines grinnell valley junction in west des moines and east village in davenport all the locations that they asked me to somehow portray and that's what i did i came up with this particular uh view of the whole thing and people swear that they actually walk down that street when what it was was me putting the buildings together side by side so it did look like all the communities were coming together what was particularly challenging with this was i had to imagine the same size person going into each door and size those photos yes i do work from photos or sitting there or standing there um they didn't send me to washington dc for senator harkins one though they sent me photos darn it anyway there's um the representation of the communities that were affected by the flood and helped out two of my favorite drawings the one i just was describing which was called recovering heartland and the bettendorf bridge that goes from bettendorf into rock island moline area in the quad cities uh that's now considered the old bridge that is where i grew up and literally used to escape from anything i needed to escape from as a young girl to go underneath those bridges and scream my head off if i wanted to um the bettendorf bridge is now it's older than me so they're putting up a new one i guess i don't have that option this particular drawing was really fun to do this represents four different women's organizations that came together at the turn of nineteen hundreds uh four different organizations actually in iowa that formed planned parenthood their names are buried in the trees of this drawing this drawing was the original this house was the original house in which planned parenthood officed and provided services for the vast community planned parenthood has a large book sale every year as their fundraiser in this drawing i put a person up in the window reading a book there's a stack of books in the front of the doorway and the names of those strong women who put together that who brought together their desire to have good health care for all their names are in each of those trees this one is my kentucky home my part of my family lived in this home and a way to celebrate that family i put the family names in this giant tree that was in the front yard um i was and then i gave prince of it to each one of the family members made note cards for the family um what an honor to be in that family as well as have our names in the in the branches to the tree this one had hidden things in it as well this is a church in des moines um this one also a church in des moines prince of each one of those church drawings have gone out to their members in however they designated to be able to give them whether it was a fundraising effort uh an expansion to a building or their programs whichever they chose to do this one has a nice little feature to it because that front door is over to the one side of the church but you just can't see it as much so we did it almost as a little window down in the lower part of it this one was exciting too i found out that i could actually draw on a brick um this stone was out in front of this house the family sold the house many years ago and i was asked to draw that house on the rock that was in front of it um you know you can do a lot of things that you never thought you could do um i got into doing a lot of different kind i'd like to have little pieces of buildings um and use them in different sorts of ways it it um it just was kind of fun so uh that that's that um hoyt sherman place is a beautiful uh old building um within des moines um used for a lot of theater productions and such now that they have um it's this is a window from that place that window along with several other drawings were part of the polk county sesquicentennial celebration i was asked to draw something from each one of the 18 communities that made up polk county and it was put into an 18 month long calendar that was the one that led me to i swear i'll never do another calendar again um a fraternity fireplace the iowa state bar association used their drawing for stationary and note cards that were sent out um if you are in the arts you know that a lot of people tend to come to you and ask for donations um i had this happen a number of times so i decided i wanted to give to the organizations that i wanted to be a part of and support um the aids project of central iowa in that was housed in des moines i was a volunteer there for several years but one of the ways i could uniquely give was through my art and volunteering with that um they whenever someone um uh passed away a single rose was sent um to the the funeral to the family and so we represented that uh and then individually colored the rose whichever color you wish to have it be um this one obviously a a red one but this was from a note card prints were made as well i have long since admired and loved the beauty of trees as someone significant my life said uh bear trees speak to me this one uh leaves from my kentucky home yard but it was used as a folder that these note cards were put into that was part of a gift that went out to a corporation in which note cards were given as a seasonal gift and along with that so those different ones were used the one down here on the um on the one side of the house i would like to let you know that particular one the the original homeowners said they really weren't sure that they wanted to have their house used in this way so i took parts of buildings and put it together in a house that i only imagined i'd like to live in and that um maybe the door belonged to one person down the street and that bay window belonged to another but together it made a beautiful house i think i should have majored in architecture um note cards were made from several drawings this one was the beginning of the of the heartaches the headaches and the beauty that comes when you just give yourself a little peace and time to give back to the thing organizations that you cared about um i was asked to help celebrate and raise some money towards this organization up with people they wanted to portray uh the people who had founded the group so we came up with this idea i needed to prove that i could do it and i did it um i'm not sure where your picture's showing up but i wanted to show you all of that this started off on the lower side here as just bare trees going from start um i usually start with a sketch in pencil where i know where i want to go i refer to photos as i work with this i had photos of trees that i needed to know were real so i was portraying a real tree not just something in my head anyway the photos started off as i got the limb i also got the names put in and then worked the leaves around the names so step one and then two and three you can see it building till it got up to the the one still on the one side here the finished product was called the legacy tree and um i was honored to meet the founder of that organization as i presented him with his copy of this family and friends you don't turn away and those that are your god children you do a lot for if you were asked and i was welcome to be asked to um portray the place where this couple got married uh in the park outside on a beautiful day so this particular drawing was then used in the center of a very broad matted uh picture um that the matting guests were asked to sign in and they uh this couple has this framed and hanging over their fireplace um showing that all these people were there at the start of their wedding day um and then sometimes you do for your own children what you do for your best friends too but this one um peacock feathers for my daughter's wedding and leaves for myself these are hanging in my home this is uh pen and ink and water color uh while in des moines i worked with adult community education um loved working with classes for them and portraying some of the old schools that they had um we dug up old buildings that's really one of the things i love to do is to find a very very old picture of a home and show all that it's it's going with and and some of its beauty uh so these were used as the cover and advertisement for their um their classes one of the other things i've come to do with pen and ink this one was done for the wells financial build wells fargo financial building in des moines if you look into the reflection of those windows you could kind of see maybe if you use your imagination um the skyline of des moines which i've also drawn before um there's the capitol up there there's the bridges that kind of go across some of the areas and some of the buildings although that really doesn't exist because there's other buildings across the street from this so there's no way it reflects um some people have collected some of my artwork uh this is um something in a friend's house um the one on the lower left was from a vacation or the the lowest part of this um we went on a vacation and all of us got to do what we wanted to do and i got in a a little inner tube with my pen and my um and drew uh plan air and plein air in in the water that particular time and uh then presented our friends with a drawing at the end of that vacation this one is a very special place to these special people um in colored pencil one of the boardwalk bridges that will go across some of the areas there in sandwich massachusetts i want to show you now the stages of probably the one of the most important ones that i feel i've ever done um this again is a tree but this particular tree um it actually exists over on the oakdale campus um of oakdale camp excuse me um a friend of mine found it and said you got to draw this this particular tree is strong and growing and vital um this tree was used as example to put 305 names on this drawing of people who had been supporting this particular church in this drawing the base of the tree the roots of the tree uh are names of people who um money was given in memory of them and then um funds were developed in order to build a new building for this church and all of those 350 names were in the in the drawing this particular drawing was um 30 by 40. it was the largest thing i ever did um starting off again with you can see just the sketch work there and then little by little you keep adding and you keep adding and growing you have to kind of keep using a lot of ink work to get the depth in the drawing whether it's cross hatch or um scribble type or dotting along with it and go getting it to grow i would add the names along the way and then connect them all with every every stage of this my tools have always been technical pens a fine point pencil that can easily be erased yes i do use straight angles when needed um t-squares i turn the picture upside down around as i need to i walk away from it as i need to your eyes your shoulders get too intense at the whole thing um and the finished product i i was sincerely deeply honored to have that be hanging at um the unitarian universal society here in our church in um coralville now that is one of the framed that is the framed piece that is hanging in the hallway there and folks who are wanting to find their name they can locate that name i kept a i kind of used the names in a grid fashion so that i could keep track of of them it was not in alphabetical order but um i was able to kind of scramble the alphabet but yet you would know where you were so there was a guide to go along with this that uh has all of that this is terrace hill in des moines pieces of artwork pieces of doors there um these were some of my early ones where i chose to just take the drawing and do with it what i could do i was challenging myself to do each and every little brick to do each shadow um even to put a bird on the wire that was uh outside of this window at terrace hill terrace hill is the home of the governors of iowa this is a rose window oh so much of a challenge to do that is in grinnell iowa and an old bridge this one was really fun to do as well it was used in a calendar many years ago but a friend of mine just recently looked at this and said how do you put breath in there and i had to reflect on the fact that my my younger my son when he was quite young looked at my drawings and he said mom you put breath in there what a compliment um this one bear trees speak to me this is um this was a gift that was given to someone who had given us a lot um and it is in pencil this is a fraternity here in iowa city this particular food and the front door to it this fraternity was one that i i took apart their um their logo their legend whatever you call it and actually put parts of it in the leaves to this um if you were to look at this a little bit closer you'd see or if you could get up close to it anyway you'd eventually find um two swords battle axe and scimitar that are crossed within the leaves up there you can find the names of some of the significant people who started this fraternity as well as the house mothers outside the house mother's window where she lived so that one was kind of that was fun and interesting to do this is a window in ethica new york um for that fraternity there are their symbols which is delta chi all buried within the leaf work there that was an interesting fun one to do and that was given as gifts to uh some of their board members the drawing of the capital in dc that i mentioned earlier for senator tom harkin they asked me to draw his hometown this is the home that he actually grew up in uh inside this brochure is the his home um his first school that he went to and the church that he went to as a child we packaged the drawing of the capital inside this folder that was um ready then for framing for individuals so it was protected as it became a gift and that again is that magnificent building i was really trying to be able to put senator sanders in there with his mittens on and his crossed legs but i couldn't quite manage that i'd like to almost end this great little time with you today by letting you know that shorts on the east side shorts burgers has nine of my drawings up they have tremendous reflection in this picture um but if you want to stop in there any time in the near future tell them you're there to see the artwork they will also give you um a 20 off discount for coming in so i think that's pretty cool um i like the way they're supporting local artists as well i'd kind of like to end this with letting you know one of the things that have just inspired me through the years as i grew up somehow when i started um i i i didn't quite grasp the whole idea of school was hard for me reading was extremely hard for me by the time i got to college i figured out i had dyslexia oh that's why i didn't get half the stuff i always kept my grades up because of my art i could balance out that grade point average as i went through school um i think it was until afterwards that i realized the power was within me always and i want to keep that i enjoy teaching i enjoy working with young people which i've done many times through the years um and sharing some of that that skill that you learn um by looking by seeing by feeling um by being engaged in the world i hope you've enjoyed this presentation i really want to stick around and answer any questions you might have if you want to contact me my gmail address is right there thank you so much for listening you", "AEjSfuv9xvc": "what's going on everybody welcome back to the channel thank you so much for watching and subscribing we got a great video for you guys today from our favorite lynn wood at this point you guys know i'm a big linwood fan like huge uh anyways he had some uh awesome stuff to uh share recently and i just love doing videos and updates on him linwood always gives me the impression that he's working on way bigger things than he actually like lets out uh yeah he's a mysterious guy in a really awesome way but his telegram channel's awesome he's really vulnerable there just like about his life talks about his animals a lot his dogs his puppies uh horses the other night he was talking about some owls he has like a wilderness cam because it looks like he owns a lot of land it's just always interesting stuff but yeah so he had some good stuff to share he's been in quite a little battle as of late with the state bar of georgia i'm sure you guys have seen there's a lot of people that are trying to get his law licenses revoked under this you know bs that he's mentally unstable when the reality is that dude would shred anybody in a court of law anybody no no one will go head-to-head with him that's why all they do is blast lies about him and they never actually go forward with anything because he will tear you up uh but linwood's awesome obviously you guys probably know by now he's teamed up with sydney powell helping her fight her case against well you know who and uh just just an incredible guy big fan so let's uh he had some stuff to say about the stock market so let's dive into that he said i got out of the stock market early last year candidly i was tired of watching my life savings fluctuate wildly based on national and international events over which i had no control i reached my own personal conclusions that the stock market is manipulated by the powers who own and manage it and who profit when it goes up and when it goes down plus in the final analysis all i had was paper and someone else had my money i have a curious mind so i've watched the stock market since last march and wow nothing seems to impact it in terms of national and world events it just keeps going up and up and up to new records despite events which would normally shake it and create significant fluctuations the market did not even suffer its cyclical 20 correction amazing historically the market like certainty and dislikes uncertainty do you think we are living in times of certainty or uncertainty i am not a financial advisor i have no training or experience in that arena i am just a person who tries to stay informed and think for myself the stock market records and consistently uh upward trend in the past year makes no sense to me i'm so sorry guys the stock market records i was like why does that sentence not make sense the stock market records and consistently upward trend in the past year makes it okay never mind that sentence doesn't make sense at all to me now that i think about stock market records and he must have just had a typo there does it make sense to you just saying he said sorry about the guys it was confusing so i want to say this i've done some investing and we've promoted it on the channel a little bit not too crazy um we did for like you know like a week of videos i think um i i see what he's saying and i don't know if he's saying this from a sense of like he knows something that's gonna happen i just wanted to share this to say i might be pulling all my money out soon like i don't know i just i always feel like he knows something ahead of time you know and you know look arguably everybody says he's crazy if you think he's crazy doozy please i would say it wouldn't be unwise to maybe proceed with caution because he does bring up some really good points in there you know we are living in uncertain times there is nothing certain about right now at all there's nothing guaranteed i mean i don't know about you guys but life right now to me i feel like i'm living in like the twilight zone like i just feel like i feel like reality isn't even real everything seems kind of fake i feel like i'm very much just living day by day just kind of waiting to see what happens um and i find it really difficult personally to make long-term plans right now with anything with my business with my life with traveling commitments to friends or family it's like i i just feel like everything's always on the verge of collapse or change and so i've been very cautious with how i've lived my life and i kind of feel like he's hinting at that that listen this could all change really quick this is just my take so curious stuff there let me know what you guys think about that though because uh yeah and like you said he is not a financial advisor he said he has no training and no experience in the area so take it with a grain of salt you know i mean we should do this with all people that we listen to eat the chicken spit out the bones like if you don't like one thing doesn't mean you have to discredit him as a whole all right so moving on to the uh state bar of georgia he said i think most of you are at least generally aware of the false attack against me by the state bar of georgia uh does anyone feel that the seminar below chaired by don jones so he shared a picture and it was it i didn't bother in getting it to share because there's nothing special about it it's just like they're promoting this seminar through this like digital poster and it shows the speakers for this law seminar in georgia i guess uh chaired by don jones president of the state bar of jojo's georgia strike from hypocrisy in it it said the neces the necessity of unparalleled unity the necessity of unparalleled unity it's again unity a message the left cries with every beckoning call yet never shows an ounce of unity uh he said why do these activist lawyers or who do these activist lawyers think they are kidding the state bar of georgia plans to achieve unparalleled unity by falsely attacking and eventually revoking law licenses of all not just him of all lawyers who litigated to show yeah i can't say that uh november stuff i think i said that in a few videos but we're gonna call it november stuff um some things that were funky that happened in november who litigated to show that some things that happened november were funky we'll say that and the lawyers who supported president trump and liberty how is that unparalleled unity you're gonna revoke law licenses because of who we voted for that is insane that is absolutely insane uh then he said after their brand of unparalleled unity is accomplished the state bar will change its name to the communist bar of georgia how do you spell corrupt someone needs to speak truth to the lawyers in georgia it is time for the lawyers to take back control of their profession and focus on the practice of law which must be nonpartisan he said noah george a lawyer email him or her and speak the truth he said by the way if i am suffering mental illness because i love america and support trump uh liberty and the bill of rights and truth i need to wait i need to find a way to bottle up and sell it i think i could make a lot of money which could benefit a worthwhile and legitimate charity he said maybe maybe president trump would allow me to sell it under the brand name kofifi or however i always mispronounced that you guys probably remember that kofi i always forget anyways so you know this state bar of georgia just adds just to the overwhelming list of hypocrisy we're witnessing right now you can't have your own profession if you supported trump because you're an insurrectionist you're violent meanwhile like we're starting to teach kids in school how to be less white i don't see equality there i see you're demeaning one race at the sake of another that doesn't preach equality that raises a generation of kids that have hatred towards their own skin color or white people listen i think you can talk to just about anyone in america and they will disagree with slavery disagree with racism disown it at any cost necessary but when i hear this stuff i think of one thing and i think i've mentioned this in videos before i had a old mentor that used to tell me this that whatever you hate the most you'll end up manifesting in your own life so if you have this blistering hate in your heart and you don't deal with it you end up creating that very same thing now in fairness i don't think that's actually the case here i think there's a radical agenda i think global elitists run the world and i think they run mainstream media and i think they plant these messages through popular celebrities through teachers unions through film and television and the list goes on and on and on and if you trust everything you hear and you don't look at your own sources and you don't research it all you will believe that stuff and before on our side we go pointing fingers and calling everyone morons you have to think how could you actually expect them to believe differently they don't see anything wrong with that narrative that's being spun because they've been conditioned to think that way it's just what it is so on the opposite spectrum let's all be better let's not have so much hate brewing in our hearts that we end up manifesting the very same thing we hate because then we start creating these really intense echo chambers and we cut we start secluding other people got to give people a chance to learn got to give people a chance to grow some of us were lucky to be born into families where we were taught to question and to research things a lot of people weren't don't get mad at someone just because you were dealt a better hand of cards when you were born it's it's so psychological all of this stuff and we have to be patient and understanding with people there that's just my personal opinion i just think with i've talked to so many friends and i've had the most breakthrough when i was patient and i fed them little seeds little breadcrumbs over and over again i didn't come in here you libtard you should research more and you'd see trump is the second coming of jesus that stuff is never going to work that approach will never work you will tick people off okay be the example thank you guys for watching this please like share comment subscribe uh if you wouldn't mind uh go ahead and subscribe to uh we have some good stuff in the description link links in the description uh

incredibly gorgeous this downright best drone shot on a mountain since we got the job and I think I think founders hey guys welcome to all sorts of adventure I'm Sarah I'm Nate and we are adventures with the budget these are our newest friends Caitlin and Gary we've known them for a whole 48 hours because we met them on the Russian and Kaitlin kind of asked told us that she was going where are we Alaska so she told us she was going there and we were like hey can we tag along Sarah said this because Sarah is the social butterfly the two of us and she said yeah so and they caught all 12 of their fish that day which was pretty awesome anyways okay so we are kind of stranded on an island we're stranded on the beach with them what's trying it on a beach with them for the next three days so hope nothing goes wrong we all have to eat make them because we would obviously eat him further than you in this whole video is basically just a testament of the phone we have a new mixer [Music] rookie mistake thank you you are the man thank you this is my buddy chewy Thank You weeks and right now we're offloading - where are we going because we hope that Gary and Caitlin know where they're going because we're just following them yeah but we dropped all their stuff off and put all the food in the bathroom it's locked up and now we have a 9-mile hike back to camp at the South Chris Ridge Trail and catch Back Bay State Park or hike over grace Ridge about eight and a half nine miles to kayak beach where all our stuff is already kept better tonight super steep right now making our way up it's about 130 degrees think Oh [Music] the most notable thing about this trail beyond the beauty are this stupid now I use that word very often mosquitoes they are like super resilient and insistent huh pretty yeah like you don't think sometimes if you stop moving they'll get you but like here like they're just trying to bite you while you walk like trying to get it a nibble so my whole back arm is like massacred this can't stand still can't even really slow down we're coming up to this really big part who is gonna be a doozy I've been waiting for the the first like incredibly gorgeous it's downright best drone shot on a mountain since we got the job and I think I think found it [Music] well we made it to the top absolutely beautiful oh my gosh but I am getting eaten alive you will see a reveal of my legs at the end there's probably 20 bites on each leg not why I wanted to under a state maybe like a whoa there's actually 50 bikes um so making our weight down right now again SuperDuper beautiful still in good spirits food is good water is a little low um we have a filter at camp so maybe we'll get to use a filter for the first time he's used it before I haven't and then we'll eat and just give you an idea it's about three o'clock in the afternoon right now it sends up pretty high all right you probably can't see it but the mountains are just Wow the mountains are gorgeous today okay so Nathan and I are gonna go get some water and we're gonna filter it which I'm a little bit nervous about a little bit skeptic and I know anyone that's used a water filtration product is probably like it's no problem I've just never used one so I'm gonna go to a lake and put a straw in it I'm gonna drink it she just seems a little odd to me okay so we've got two methods of water filtration here okay so we've got the first which is the Sawyer Oh micro I saw your mini water filter and this is simply it's great water filtration system for one two people but it's going to we got four people here and so we've got a second system that they actually brought that we're gonna use to fill their everybody's bottles which is a pump so both of them same concept for dirty water goes in one end in this case it's the end your left my right my left your right and then comes out at the straw or you can be drinking or into a bottle I just want to show you a little bit of what we were walking through there's these giant leaves and if you've ever seen Land Before Time you're like ooh star relief yes totally except for on the bottom and these suckers are these gnarly little thorns all the way through I can see this and then these are all covered in thorns so like these little soft cute cuddly leaves that Littlefoot would eat or just mean ouch yeah so put it in so like this deeper right there right here yeah just don't push it against the dirt that's actually pretty good it's nice and cool it's nice and cool no you don't open it so then so because we've got four peoples with the water bottles we're going to fill up we're going to use there Gary and Caitlin's katadyn filter basically you've got a dirty hose I've got a clean hos clean hose goes in the filtered water there's only four filtered water dirty hose is only for the contaminated water I don't know I've ever since I put these new ASO a stickers on this water ball why don't you taste better okay as we went hiking I think I mentioned that the mosquitos just were just awful so take a look at my legs see weakens I don't even know if we can capture on camera like Sarah is you know put her legs because she's sporting her a little skirt active skirt thing but and then oh there it is right there there it is look at all those freaking me out because I can't see him Ethan and I are getting ready for bed we're in our tent because we could only take what fit in our backpack yeah it really did not fit but our sleeping bags did cuz I get real little and we both have our neckerchiefs or bucks to put over our eyes as we sleep because if you can see like there's no extra lighting here this is just Alaska at 10:30 10:30 p.m. it's just so great we are loving this season soaking up every minute yeah Nate looks ridiculous and I've told him so just in case you're like Sarah why don't you tell your husband he looks like a goof nugget I have told him the odds are stacked against me okay good morning we had a very slow wake up which is my favorite kind had some breakfast we shipped Gary and Caitlyn off on their kayak cuz they're gonna go kayak for a little bit now we are collecting firewood for tonight I love collecting firewood it's like a treasure hunt for me you could probably see it's a little bit cloudy or today and the wind was uh it was pretty windy this morning so I just made a little bit chillier so on the hunt for some firewood that was the third option well our new friends Tom and Jean both agreed that while they're out hiking we could use their CC kayak so we're gonna go out on the water for a little bit yeah this has just been a whole adventure of strangers and kindness and good time deliveries an adventure adventure with colleges also Jean and Tom have been married for 32 years yeah so they made the awesomest [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is not a drill but there are sea otters being cute together there's so many and they're looking at it oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh they're so cute there's one two three four five six oh seven eight nine and eleven eleven sea otters oh my god she's sticking his head so far up [Music] [Music] okay we are headed to bed we've had a really really nice fire and awesome friend Denver hopefully we'll get to introduce you to him tomorrow he's actually gonna do the same hike we did all nine miles there and back tomorrow good luck Denver um Amy and I are gonna actually sleep in the hammock I've never done that um it is a two-person but we've never slept in it like for the full night just for naps and stuff so we'll see you in the morning and we will see if we made it through the whole night good night hey guys good morning on day three today is the day that the boat taxi will come and get us um and we met another fabulous stranger this is Denver Denver Halldor you 19:19 and he might look like your average ultra marathon runner because he is can you just tell us what you did this morning um so 6 a.m. and then I ran to the other end of grace rage which is about 8 miles it's about 3,000 feet of vertical elevation and then just came right back and how long did that take you four and a half hours give or take okay so just for perspective it took us five hours yeah to go there and it took him the same amount of time to go there and back and it was raining yes is this something you do all the time um this is the first time I've done this but I do this trail pretty regularly okay so just a humble reminder this weekend to me tonight is that you will always find people more adventurous than you who will challenge you to push your boundaries yeah so Denver doing the down in back Tom and gene who are 60 plus years old going kayaking for fun seven kilometers yeah and then Gary and Caitlin who are just kayaking right now for funsies before the boat comes and gets us so really humble reminder any last words do fun things yeah okay we're heading out our boat is coming up right now Denver's way over there he's turning back on his boat and we will be leaving [Music] [Music] anyway and that is the end of our little excursion we spent the rest of the day looking at little shops Tom and Jean actually invited us into that we ran into them again back at the parking lot and they invited us in for tea and to prune yogurt which is really nice gave us some extra food because they're heading back to Wisconsin and then we're driving back to Anchorage tonight and then Gary and Caitlin's told us that we had to come two seconds which was right over there they claimed the best barbecue in Alaska and it was pretty dang very good that's really somebody yeah I've never like you wouldn't even know just by sorry you wouldn't even know just by looking at it that it's so good but I got their chicken pesto Caesar salad I've never not been able to finish a salad and it was just so big and so full he was very delicious it was that quick it was an amazing excursion we met amazing people met amazing strangers and I think some friendships or at least we'll grew from them and I wouldn't be surprised to run into them again in the future yeah if you guys enjoyed this video go ahead and give it a like comment and subscribe Oh Cheers until next time Adventure within the budget bye guys [Music]", "EQYerewClag": "how is it going guys drew peacock here back with another video and instead of sitting in my room or in the garage talking to you guys for a video i thought i would take out the mclaren and just chat with you guys you know have a little honest heart to heart if that's what we want to call it anyways today we're going to be talking about things that can make or break a build and i'm talking about more of the show car aspect i go to a lot of car meets here in socal i've been going really recently to a lot of them and i see a lot of dope ass builds but there are some things and of course this is all opinion based there are some things that i see on builds and i'm like oh the car would look so much better without it all that car would be complete without that one little thing that that guy did again like i just said it's all opinion based and you know anyone can do whatever they want to their car it is their car after all it's not my car but still i thought i would make this video just in case you're not really uh too aware of what looks good or not on cars or at least i don't know i don't know how to word it without sounding like a dick i already know there's gonna be people in the comments like drew that's their car they love how it looks how it is that's fine that's fine that's 100 fine but if you're looking for advice then this video is for you anyways i have a list here i actually asked a few people so i have like an actual list i don't want to spoil anything but let's just start with number one which is bad slash ugly wheels maybe even stock ones and this is the one this one that you see a lot sometimes you'll see a nice looking car it could be an off-road vehicle it can be a tuner car can be a muscle car and for some god-awful reason they have the worst pair of wheels ever existing on that car it could be fake te37s te-37s look great by throwing fake ones on a car that's that's not going to cut it picture wheels like your shoes of your fit imagine you're wearing some nice pants you got a nice shirt on and then you're going out in some beat ass like vans or something if that's what you're going for then sure but your car is a little bit different you shouldn't have beat ass vans or reps or anything like that on your car unless i get i get that everyone's not born with the silver spoon in their mouth not everyone can afford realty e37s and some cars don't deserve real te37s if you're in a honda civic maybe don't put t-37s on your honda civic your wheels will be worth more than your car i get that but if you're going for the ho the whole show car look it kind of makes sense then to go with the real wheels in my own opinion there are companies out there that make great looking wheels for discount esr used to make a lot of reps now they've branched out and make great three-piece wheels they make some really clean monoblock wheels this isn't an ad for them i just like what they do and their wheels are structurally sound unlike some of this other china garbage that's a nice looking lexus right there anyways bad wheels can really make or break a build that's a pretty good obvious one don't pull up air out on stock wheels people do it i see all the time i don't know why but you know anyways next one on the list is poorly placed stickers or stickers that just don't go along with the build this is actually the single reason why i'm making this video i saw a very clean amg on the freeway the other day super clean it looked great it had white and it had like rose gold wheels or i i was hard to explain it was super cool it stood out and it was sexy and for some all reason he had this ugly decal right above his rear right on the rear quarter like above the tail light it looks so ugly like the car was so sleek and clean without that and then he put this just god-awful sticker right there and i was just like oh man if i just went there and peeled off that sticker oh that car would be so perfect yeah stuff like that again i saw a wide body air suspension evo 10 out of meat the other day it was purple super clean looks dope man he aired out it was it was badass but for some reason on the side of his car he had the stupid sponsor stickers but it was a grocery list it said like eggs and like milk and all that dumb i was like oh man it just it just killed the build in my opinion and again it's all opinionated but uh just one of those things where if you misplace a sticker it's not that stickers are bad but they just have to go along with your build and for those two cars that i saw i just uh they would have looked so much better in my own opinion without it i already know i'm gonna get a bunch of people in the comments drill it's it's their build they can do whatever they want i know they could uh this video is for people that maybe are looking out and want to hear other people's opinions this is my opinion so i'm just stating that if you want to state your opinion go make a youtube channel that's fine you can do that anyways here we go this one will literally make or break your car and that is cheap china parts you see it all the time cheap china parts it's okay like china parts you know for some things that they'll work but uh this one super came into the shop the other day at sideways and it was claiming a thousand horsepower now we popped the hood and it's just china fuel rail china cooling system china china china the whole car was like built in china it was a japanese supra built in china apparently and the car obviously blew up for some reason who would have guessed it you know you throw china parts out of corn it's not going to run right yeah that will literally make or break your build not only does it show that you didn't like necessarily go with the top dollar stuff to like set your car apart but your car's also not gonna run at its top dollar sorry i gotta adjust my balls right here they're getting a little moist anyways it'll also just it's not going to make your car run at it's at its top when you go with china parts china parts are good for some things but if it's a vital component you probably don't want to do the china fuel rail i don't think i'd get a china fuel rail would you order a fuel rail off of wish.com if you say no to that then you should probably stay away from china parts all right moving on sorry i didn't pick the best time to make this video it is russia right here in socal here we go exhaust loud does not always equal good i don't know who told you that your v6 mustang needed the open header or open mid pipe i don't know who told you that but you don't know how many times that car meets like people just just destroy their exhaust systems and they're like exhaust sound that's part of your car's appearance if your car sounds good pulling up like if it sounds sick and then you pull up and you park you shut it off that's part of it but if your car sounds like ass and it's already deterring people and making them spread out because it just sounds like someone's wet farting on in a pool or something like that no one wants to go and look at the car because it's already just making people not care loud like i said does not always equal good i don't know why in the modern day car scene people go for the loudest exhaust you should go for like the best sounding exhaust loud is cool but it doesn't always equal good that one's pretty obvious all right let's move on to cringy decorations oh this is something straight up for show car people i don't get this i see this again all the time i meet you pull up and then for some reason some of these these car enthusiasts they open their hood and they start placing toys in the engine bay i've seen a deadpool themed mustang with about a hundred deadpool figurines placed all meticulously throughout the engine bay why why are you gonna decorate your car like it's a goddamn christmas tree it's not even with lights you're doing it with like ornaments and like i do not get that i think it is the cringiest and the dumbest thing ever especially thinking about an adult dude going to a karmy or car show and decorating his car with toys or toy cars or stuffed animals whatever it is like maybe it goes with your build but having a hundred deadpool figurines i don't see the point in that that does not make any sense to me and i think it is the cringiest thing just imagine honey honey did you did you pack the deadpool figurines you forgot them my built my build's gonna be ruined i'm never gonna win a trophy imagine that it just sounds cringy i just it's i just uh just think about it i don't know really bad would not do that would not anyways moving on from the cringe that really hurt my hand shitty neon lights neon lights are coming back i've said it before i said it in my you know mod trends or whatever that are gonna come back for 2021. neon lights are coming back whether you like them or hate it they are and you just gotta accept it i'm on the fence some cars i think can have them some cars can't what i am 100 off the fence about and think that it is the dumbest  ever is when you install your neon lights very poorly while you're not supposed to see the light strip i'm i don't know why these  morons are putting the light strip on the outside of the bumper so you can see it i can literally see the diodes on the light so it makes no  sense you're not supposed to see it it's supposed to be tucked underneath your bumper it's supposed to be giving off this like glowing effect or like a hovering effect and it could be cool i've seen it i've seen some light kits too that like really complement a car none of these mods on this list by the way are necessarily rice so i don't want you to think that but lights that are poorly installed or they're dangling or that you get to see it that is just 100 something that can just destroy your build and it just uh just looks so cheap so tacky don't do that if you're installing a light kit which you can just do it correctly make sure that you're mounting them correctly make sure that they're in a decent spot and they're not gonna like uh you know be visible to every who is walking in the vicinity because it'll look horrible disgusting all right i think we have one more save the best for last this one is pretty obvious i i'm sure a lot of you are expecting camber camber can really upset a bill nah show cars you know usually have camber so i'm not going to say camber but one thing that no show car can go without is having some good fitment so if you have bad fitment that right there oh that can totally make or break your build like if you're dialing if you're dialing in everything else and you cheap out on some wheels and get some ass poor fitment what is this monkey doing this is one like what are you doing it's one lane we're in one lane you it's one lane it's one lane um come here i'm gonna talk to you it's one lane what are you doing look at you  oh my god i cannot understand people wow it was one lane all right anyways that guy obviously can't build a car or drive a car to save his life so we're just gonna exclude him from the conversation anyways wow oh god i just don't understand how people think these days you see one clear lane and you're gonna go next to a car just because there's room that's not how it works bucko i'm sorry oh anyways yeah uh completely lost my train of thought anyways bad fitment bad fitment is going to 100 destroy a car's appearance if you have bad fitment on a car it just it's a total show if i can fit my whole fist inside your wheel well no one is going to come and look at your car and think it is clean i'm sorry you got to have that nice fitment or pretty nice fit i know not everyone wants to destroy their fenders i'm one of those people i think the super has decent fitment but i'm also not going for a show car i think the supra is more of obviously a street race car so it is what it is but if you're going for that hardcore show car aesthetic then i think 100 of the time you need to go ahead and get that fitment dialed in and make sure that you know maybe not a business card but i'd say one finger that way you can safely drive it if you're on bags no excuses you should have the bombest fitment out there because you can adjust that on the go pretty much but if you're static and you want to be able to still drive your car i understand i'm not saying to go ahead and just slam your box but bad fitment can really set apart a build anyways guys hopefully this video was informative and you guys enjoyed it uh it was fun i don't know why that guy really got me mad right there i just i hate how when people are stupid i just can't stand it anyways let me know if you agree with me down in the comments and comment some more things that might make or break a build

52 wall street new york locked up the vault and went home when he returned on monday according to the nashville whig of nashville tennessee at the normal hour and opened up the vault in order to take out the necessary money for the business of the day he was shocked to find that between when he locked the vaults on saturday night and when he opened the bank on monday morning someone had entered the vault and taken the astounding sum of 242 000 newspapers at the time claimed that it was the first bank robbery in the united states and all that that was certainly not the case it was perhaps the first large bank robbery in the city of new york the 1831 city bank of new york robbery is history that deserves to be remembered the first petition to create the city bank of new york was filed in 1811 in the midst of a national debate over the renewal of the charter for the bank of the united states the purpose of the request was to make banking in new york easier so as bettors compete in foreign trade with philadelphia boston and baltimore requests have been made by new york merchants aligned with president james madison and face some difficulty as a rival faction in the new york legislature supported by then u.s vice president george clinton also wanted to charter a bank eventually a compromise was reached in which the original charter was approved and the board was split between madison and clinton supporters the charter was approved by the state assembly and on june 16 1812 the city bank of new york was founded and that bank of course still exists today with more than 2 600 branches in 19 countries citibank is the fourth largest bank in the united states by asset size the city bank would quickly earn a place in american history helping to finance war bonds for the war of 1812 and in exchange being named a government depository while it had to be restructured in 1824 by 1831 the citibank was prospering with the burgeoning trade of the industrial revolution according to the new york evening post when mr burling opened the vault on monday march 21 everything was found in confusion and the robbery discovered the thieves had taken two trunks that had been left by depositors and locked in the vault s name allen had a trunk stolen that contained 18 thousand dollars in bank notes a type of currency that is a negotiable promissory note made by a bank according to the buffalo bulletin of buffalo new york it appears that the robbers selected bills of the city and other banks curiously the paper noted that they seem to avoid taking specie money in the form of coins or gold bullion with a single exception the robbers took 200 gold doubloons spanish gold coins uses the dominant currency in nova scotia and of course a common form of pirate treasure because don't all good stories involve pirates they've been kept as safe deposit by a mercantile house the reports from the time give conflicting numbers but the sum was certainly very large the total sum of the banknotes and doubloons together was in excess of 240 000 around 7 million in today's dollars surprisingly the buffalo bull noted when mr burling arrived in the morning the doors of the bank were found closed and locked as usual entering the vault would have required two keys one to enter the bank and one to enter the outer vault the door to the inner vault didn't have a lock the evening post reported there were no marks of violence perceptible on any of the doors leading into the bank or on those leading to the vaults the national banner and natural wig reported that the police magistrates had been all through the building and examined the premises and we believe all are satisfied that the bank and vault were entered with false keys false keys are a method of lock picking that use a wax bold of a lock to create a key the evening post reported that we have also heard that a few days hence it was discovered by derangement of the books papers and furniture that another banking house on wall street had been entered by false keys but the villains were not able to penetrate the vault which contained the money and we understand that two or three unsuccessful attempts were made on saturday night to enter stores in maiden lane with false keys in during which the wards of the locks were twisted and bent and the locks spoiled of the robbery the post concluded so ingenious have these become of late it would really seem that locks are no security against their depredations as to the police investigating the crime the new york city police department was not established until 14 years later in 1845 what there was in place was a night watch while there had originally been a night watch formed in new york when it was still called new amsterdam in 1658 the watch that was in place in 1831 had been created in 1801 by mayor edward livingston the website of the new york city police department explains that in the imaginations of those inclined to imagine it new york of the knickerbocker era was as quaintly picturesque as a sepia toned etching there were no elevators and hence no apartment buildings no railroads and so obviously no mass transit on the cobblestone streets prior to its phenomenal growth through industrialization and immigration the city was more intimate and orderly more homogenous safer and fairer at least in comparison to the immense and messy behemoth it would later become policing at the time was sporadic as the detective in charge of analytics for the nypd detective bureau notes presumably few crimes were solved clearance rates certainly weren't formally recorded there were essentially two systems a set of constables who kept order by day which the nypd describes as more akin to jury duty than it was to modern civil service citizens were expected to take their turns at it and their annual salaries were the roundest of numbers zero but the night watch was somewhat more professional with an actual salary though the pay was described as meager still the nypd contends the difference in compensation and stark difference in staffing between constables and watchmen is probably indicative of the temporal distribution of crime city government was clearly invested in maintaining order at night but clearly the relatively more professional night watch had failed to catch the men who had committed the robbery at citibank as the post lamented as to the city watch whose duty it is to guard our property at night the numerous recent robberies show that there is little dependence to be placed on them this would not have been a surprise to new yorkers at the time as the nypd page explains though the responsibilities of the night watch were serious the institution as a whole was not it mostly comprised moonlighting tradesmen many of whom were dismissed for drinking or sleeping on duty the bank immediately offered a reward of the substantial sum of five thousand dollars for the recovery of the property in a proportionate sum for any part the reward was quickly increased to ten thousand with an additional thousand offered by the morris canal bank company who had issued twenty thousand dollars worth of the stolen banknotes and while policing at the time might have been somewhat spotty the people of new york did have one significant police asset jacob hayes high constable of new york city born in bedford new york in 1772 hayes had been a city marshal from 1798 to 1802 and high constable in charge of both the night watch and the city's constables since 1802 according to wilbur r miller of the state university of new york in his book the social history of crime and punishment in america by the time of his death in 1850 hayes crime-fighting ex-boys were known throughout the english-speaking world upon his death in 1850 the brooklyn evening star described him as the terror to evildoers the nypd page explains hayes was half legendary himself his name evoked by parents who warned misbehaving children old hayes will get you contemporary accounts are almost unfailingly laudatory describing him as a sleuth of unusual sagacity of the strictest integrity of a generous and frank nature warm-hearted kind and true hayes was said to have an uncanny memory for names and faces and in the case of this robbery which a letter in the post described as the all-absorbing topic of the day hayes already had a suspect in mind james honeyman a 2013 retrospective in the saturday evening post notes that honeyman had recently been charged with robbing a store in brooklyn but had escaped conviction due to lack of evidence he'd also been caught trying to steal money from a steamboat and there were rumors that he was still the chief suspect in an english male coach robbery the paper notes that hayes went to honeymoon's home but found neither his suspect nor any money with honeymoon nowhere to be found there were no apparent leads on march 22nd the evening post reported we do not learn that anything has yet transpired whereby the least suspicion can attach to any of the perpetrators of the robbery of the city bank all is enveloped in utter darkness at present but that darkness would soon lift according to the evening post the monday that the robbery was discovered a person calling himself jones applied for board at a respectable private boarding house in elm street corner of broome kept by mr henry banks jones requested a private room and paid cash in advance but the paper writes he had been at his house but two or three days when the suspicions of his landlord were excited the papers had reported on the theft of trunks full of money from the bank and mr bangs had apparently become suspicious of mr jones evident anxiety regarding the smallest of three trunks which he had brought with him when jones left with one of the three trunks bangs contacted police and hayes accompanied by his son benjamin who was a constable and another constable named homans opened the trunks that had been left behind finding that the smaller one had been packed with bank notes which are at once known to be the very ones stolen from citibank the three then waited for jones to return and apprehended him the man who had been calling himself edward jones was in fact james honeyman the very near dwell that hayes had suspected from the very start the arrest laid to rest an initial assumption that the robbery might have been an inside job a march 28 edition of the post explains had the robber escaped detection a certain degree of vague suspicion would inevitably have been harbored in the minds of many that the villainy was perpetrated by someone connected with the bank this timely discovery frees all connected with the institution from every shade of doubt when brought before justice hobson the evening post said he was apparently perfectly composed and expressed with great coolness his determination to decline all questioning an article in the post in may described him as short in stature with sandy hare what may be turned a long head the moral cast of his countenance is decidedly bad the general expression of his face is intellectual and marked by features of a strong character shrewdness firmness of purpose and self-possession are written upon his brow in lines not to be mistaken honeymoon who at times went by the aliases both edward smith and edward jones had a wife and two daughters ages six and eight in the city he insisted that his wife knew nothing but the magistrate didn't trust her and so had her jailed along with the two girls who suffered to remain with her at her request mrs honeyman was released but the evidence against her husband was overwhelming the trunk at the boarding house contained bank notes that burling could identify a hack driver named henry allen testified that he had been hailed the monday following the robbery by two men who had carried trunks allen was able to identify honeymoon and positively identified the two trunks that had been found in the room rented by honeymoon in which the stolen banknotes were found a cart man named jedibaya corey testified that he had been engaged by two men to carry two trunks to the bang's boarding house and he positively identified honeymoon as one of the men hayes also testified at the trial and in the end the evidence was so overwhelming that the post reports that the jury found the prisoner guilty without leaving their seats but there was a problem honeymoon's accomplice in around 63 thousand dollars was still missing the accomplice james murray was identified because one of the trunks that had been left at the boarding house contained the wearing apparel of murray's wife hayes also recognized the description of a man who bangs had visited honeymoon as murray as the two were commonly seen together murray was apprehended in philadelphia on another charge and brought back to new york at the request of hayes bangs positively identified him as having visited honeymoon at the boarding house tried in july the post reported that the jury were absent for a total of about three minutes before returning a verdict of guilty the two were englishmen who in addition to being suspected in multiple crimes in new york were reported been convicted of a robbery in england before coming to the united states the vermont mercury of woodstock vermont reported that in 1826 honeymoon was apprehended on a charge of a felony and being found guilty was sentenced to be transported to botany bay the british penal colony in australia for the term of his natural life the paper reported that honeymoon and murray had become acquainted at botany bay and had eventually made their escape back to england honeymoon and murray were both sentenced to five years hard labor at new york's sing-sing prison but around 63 thousand dollars was still missing a break then came in september when a man named parkinson tried to cash a banknote that a teller recognized as being similar to those stolen from citibank it turns out that parkinson was honeymoon's brother-in-law honeyman had left a chest of money with parkinson but parkinson claimed said nothing about the manner with which it had been obtained after being caught parkinson negotiated a deal where the prosecution against him was dropped in exchange for returning the money honeymoon had given him he returned another 37 thousand dollars but the remainder somewhere around twenty six thousand dollars was never recovered henry banks had to sue in court to get the ten thousand dollar reward that the banks had promised he did eventually prevail was awarded the money in 1833 the robbery was indicative of the growing complexity of crime in new york city as the new york police department page concludes by the 1830s it was becoming obvious that crime fighting in new york city was more than a one-man job especially since that one man despite being a legend was nearly 60 years old it's hard to say how much this one high-profile crime contributed to decision-making but it was growing crime that eventually compelled the city to create a professional police force in 1845 although jacob old man hayes was allowed to retain what had become the largely ceremonial title of high constable until his death in 1850 some newspapers at the time tried to claim that this was the first bank robbery in the united states and that was certainly not the case other newspapers at the time noted a 1798 bank robbery in philadelphia that was surprisingly similar it wasn't even the first bank robbery in new york city there was evidence that jacob hayes had returned smaller sums that had been stolen from banks before that robbery in 1831 but it was the first bank robbery in the nation large enough to really gain national attention the lake county news of clear lake california noted in 2017 that the story behind the march 19 1831 bank robbery while it really wasn't the first bank robbery in the nation certainly sounds like it ought to have been the vast sums of money stolen the audacity of the robbers and the open-ended conclusion is just the sort of story that reporters

general flynn is gonna be here for the the town hall tonight and all the major media is covering it and uh so i'm on the phone with you we got general flynn there's so many great patriots out there uh sir there is this thing called a retraction being done by the washington post tell us about the great retraction i'd like to refer to it as the admission of uh wrongdoing to the listeners that aren't familiar with it just generally the background is that there was a funeral raised when president trump did an interview with brad ratkensberger's office and an investigator yeah where there were claims that president trump had made statements that were reported by the washington post from an anonymous source in the secretary of state's office and they claimed that he had said he wanted the investigator to quote unquote find the fraud and that if she did so she would be a quote unquote national hero those quotes were lies they told the washington post or the story to the public was that there was no tape of them of the conversation with the investigator and the president well they found the tape they found the tape and the tape revealed that the president did not say that at all the president said that he wanted it reviewed because they might find some dishonesty and that her job would be important so they grossly misrepresented what the president said in a way to try to suggest that he was obstructing justice now the frozen county district attorney's office has got an investigation going to empower a grand jury based primarily on the false statements that were published in the washington post one lie begets another lie all designed to advance an agenda against the president of the united states they got caught so it's a big deal and it's a bigger deal than the washington post because untold numbers of members of the mainstream media reported the same lie right you see the media doesn't check anymore to find out if the stories are true yep the media doesn't follow basic journalistic standards on confidential or anonymous sources they get somebody that says what they want them to say they call them a confidential source so the person's not outed where they could be tested in the in their their statements verified right and they want they run to the press boy that's not the way they used to do it and that's not the way journalists are supposed to operate under their own canons of ethics and standards lynn i've never been an attorney uh for multiple reasons one i i know i could not pass the exams needed to become an attorney but you you have unbelievable memory and you've actually uh gone after cnn uh three times i believe and you you've won um you're one of the most legendary attorneys well-known attorneys in america why can't you in a court of law cite un uh what can't you say unknown or i guess unspecified sources why can't you in the court of law get up there and present evidence and say that you have a source that you're not going to name and then use that as evidence why can why can you not do that in a court of law and then why can they do it in the the court of public opinion why can why can the media do that but you can't do that in the court of law well the media has legal accountability for false statements okay so here i am joe citizen and they publish a false statement about me yeah and they attribute it to an anonymous source how am i going to go find out who that anonymous source is to test the credibility to test the accuracy to see whether that's not somebody just out there with an agenda a bias right against me well if they claim confidentiality they say well they only agreed to speak on condition of anonymity they give themselves complete immunity from wrongdoing and that is not the law i can remind the listeners and maybe i'm dating myself but there was a a minor incident that said facetiously called watergate yeah watergate was busted open historically by two reporters at the washington post woodward and bernstein they also had an editor there that knew journalism standards named ben bradley bradley drove old woodward and bernstein half crazy because they had a source they called deep throat and they wanted to publish what  said and bradley said i'm not going to allow you to do it under the standards unless you can come up with two independent corroborating sources it tells me that deep st deep throat the anonymous source has a measure of credibility before we'll publish it and they were able to meet those standards but when you turn somebody loose in the media in today's environment on television or in print or online and you're simply going with one source who is anonymous everybody's at risk they're at risk that one source is anonymous because they're biased and they're advancing a false agenda there's no accountability for that person and then no accountability for the publisher that publishes their statements that's a lack of rule of law that's the violation of fundamental fairness it violates decades of journalistic standards so you can run with your anonymous source you don't the fact is the anonymous source is supposed to be the exception right not the rule it's become the rule in recent years in the media the reason that it's the exception is that the duty of the journalists is to undertake every effort to get the source to go on the record and it's only an absolute last ditch where you'll give them an agreement of anonymity but even then you've got to look around and find other corroborating evidence that supports the believability of the anonymous source otherwise it's just defamation by accusation from an unknown source and that's a slippery slope that we've gone down in this country in recent years in our journalists and media world because they turned into propagandist and that's that's their classic working tool now we'll say whatever we want to we'll say well it's an anonymous source anonymous someone close to the president right someone knowledgeable about the investigation who are these people call them out put their names out there so we can check out to see what's really going on and whether we're getting the truth or a lie so this is a big deal and it highlights a lot of problems in our media our propaganda media right now and the political agendas of people trying to overthrow our government now one of many problems but it's a major problem that's highlighted by what happened to president trump in this washington post story and guess what clay yesterday i gave what i'll call an educated guess based on information that i've developed over the last several months i said i bet you that we got to go find out who the anonymous source was that lied right and then she he or she in all caps needs to be fired there's got to be accountability i suspected then that it was jordan fuchs the deputy director the deputy secretary of state the washington post came out today and outed the source it was jordan fuchs jordan's executive secretary of state who has a job that didn't exist under georgia law until brad i call him brad jordy rathensburger created the position of deputy secretary of state and gave it to jordy fuchs who's involved with dominion voting machines who calls the shots at the secretary of state's office even though she's not qualified experienced or competent to do so because brad rathensburgers doesn't do his job he's got a lot of family money he does not actually perform his job as the secretary of state lynn i went upstairs huge and a guy named gabe sterling he's got ties to dominion too i want to bring i want to bring this up here linda uh you mentioned dominion voting machines now dominion shares shared office space with george soros up there in toronto dominion the election machines shared office space with george soros that that that's a fact we know that the software used the smartmatic sequoia election software that was created by communists in venezuela these are all these are all facts but yet somehow lynn you're being silenced because you're sharing the truth meanwhile the mainstream media can quote unsighted sources and i think what's happening is a lot of patriots feel like they can no longer sit on the sidelines people feel like they need to get involved they want us they want to stand up they want to fight they want to get involved and if it's okay sir what i wanted to do is i wanted to bring in some people who are here for the uh general uh flynn uh town hall tonight and i'm sure many of which are going to come see you in tulsa oklahoma on april 16th and 17th and they had a few questions for you so is that okay if we begin to begin our linwood interrogation it's absolutely fine i love to be asked questions even if it's in the form of interrogation let me make one point though yes yes sir look at look at look at what's happening my free speech is being censored and suppressed right with a national campaign to smear me and a campaign with mercy university the state bar of georgia the lawyers club of atlanta to punish me for exercising my first amendment right of speech and for exercising my rights petition for grievances to file lawsuits lawsuits by the way that were validated by clarence thomas's dissenting opinion so they're trying to keep me from speaking truth and they're letting people under the guise of anonymity go out and speak lies correct that's just that's just plain and simple propaganda 101 is part of a color revolution where people are trying to overthrow our government and to do away with our rule of law so when you say people are upset they are they should be i believe in the rule of law so to draw an analogy not to get someone to claim i'm trying to stir up violence because that's not what i am and that's not what i do i'm a lawyer and i have to go in and fire my bullets in a court of law so i'm going to be suing the state bar i'm going to litigate these people uh through the rule of law until we learn once again that perhaps sadly it doesn't exist but i'm going to fire my legal bullets because if we don't try to fire those bullets legally god forbid somebody's going to start firing him in the streets we can't let that happen in our country so i'm going to fight in a court of law and i'm going to fire my bullets there and i've got some pretty good bullets to fire just like now we've got bullets in the court of public opinion to fire once we have learned that there was a campaign to lie about the president to ultimately get him criminally prosecuted and it's all a fall this one masterminded by jordy fuchs and i think a few other people in the state of georgia point a a treatment that's been safely available available to treat malaria uh for over three decades now but now we're gonna we're gonna shift directions we're gonna kind of go into the town hall mode and these are great people and lin many of these people are going to come meet you here at the event on april 16th and 17th uh this young lady used to work in a prison uh lynn so watch out watch man will you introduce yourself to lynnwood hey lynn this is chrissy uh yeah i used to work at a prison um in cushing oklahoma you know small town small town girl um i just want to say thank you for being a patriot to us and sticking up for the american people i'm honored to be able to ask you this question and i just want to know are you excited to come to tulsa and speak to the american people here christy the answer to that is unequivocally yes i am excited listen don't demean the small town small town america is what makes america great it's the big cities in america that's creating the the problems in this country right now but america the heartbeat of america the heart and soul of america is rural america it's the small cities it's the small businesses it's the family units it's our communities so i'm thrilled to come to tulsa well we're very thrilled now do you uh uh have when you when you now work in the office up here how is it different working up here than working in prison i mean is there less fights is there more fights do you feel more dangerous less dangerous it's actually a thrive actually changed my whole life you know i love it here the the vibe here is amazing um it gave me a lot of opportunities to make my life better and do better for myself and get to meet amazing people like you lynn and a bunch of other people that are going to be at the conference so i'm actually thrilled to be here and it is a lot different than a prison so lynn it's a lot different than a prison up here that's the best endorsement i've received all year on the show all right now we have another listen she worked in prison i was born in north carolina my grandfather called me a north carolina tar heel and then i moved with my family at age three to georgia he called me a georgia cracker now i'm in south carolina i'm not sure what i am i'm just a southerner but you could call me a redneck you can call me a deplorable i'm just an average citizen i've had some success financially in my life thanks to my hard work and the opportunities america gave me yep but i identify with the rednecks i'm not part of the global elite i don't want to be i'm i'm luckily i've taken opportunities in america to advance myself that's what's great about america it allows you to upwardly advance yourself based on your hard work and the exercise of the freedoms that this country recognizes the freedoms that were given to us by god almighty so i'm looking forward to meeting my fellow american citizens in tulsa knowing that we are all with the heart and soul of this nation and the heart and soul of this nation is not going to allow it to be taken over by the communists the global elitist or the cia and the deep deep state that exist in this country we're going to get rid of them oh absolutely and i stand with you lynn all the way so amen well then we have our next guest here this guy he looks like he's not part of antifa i know it's an audio only broadcast today he appears not to be part of antifa i'm going to get him on this mic right here uh uh parker i'm going to put him on that mic right here so sir come on down to this mike here's he's got a he's got a red tie on what appears to be a blue sport coat he's got some great khakis on lynn i don't know he's not a member of antifa we're not prepared for the question he's going to ask but uh sir why don't you introduce yourself uh to lynn wood and then what question do you have hey lynn this is mike paul i do not i am not and never was a part of antifa i'm just a roofer which often times i get a bad rap but not that bad of a rap i guess my question for you lynn is you know the big picture that i keep hearing clay talk about is this fight for truth that is it seems like sometimes we're losing but i don't want to be discouraging or negative how are we continuing to fight so that the truth can be revealed so that we don't have to continue worrying about some of these issues that you've been talking about so far well let me say this our time on earth is limited by faith our time is unlimited we have eternal life through the grace of god almighty and the sacrifice of jesus christ but i'll tell you when when your time on earth is over and you were part of living in the history that we're living in right now do you want to be remembered as someone who fought to the end for truth or somebody who gave up and surrendered to the lie i think we all who are patriots want to be able to put on our tombstone that we fought for the death to the death for truth we never surrendered to the lie so what can we do i've said this and i think general flynn is probably the best spokesperson to describe it the way i see it is we've got to rebuild our country from the ground up right now to get back to what we were when we were founded a nation under god a nation of communities that combined together through states to be the united states of america so you've got to go out and you've got to start being active at the local level your boards of education your city councilman your mayors then you got to expand that into your communities where you're talking about your state officials your state board members your state legislators and yes your governors your lieutenant governors you gotta find people who love america that are willing to go and serve their fellow citizens citizens statesmen that's what we need we i think our founding fathers did not ever envision that we would be governed by officials who were there to be career politicians to fatten their pocketbooks and build their own personal power they envisioned that people would go and serve their country for a limited uh finite period of time try to do good work good laws for the fellow citizens and then return and live under those laws that they enacted so we've got to go back and that's what our goal and our model has to be we got to rebuild it from the from the ground up and it can be done i know already in south carolina i'm talking to people that want to do and are doing just that got to do it in your political party too i don't know if i disagree or agree with george washington i think i agree with him that political parties two political parties were going to be the death knell of of the country because you end up got one side getting what they want one side fighting for what they want and they forget the people in the middle i'd like to see president trump's model followed we don't need necessarily now to form a third party we need to rebuild from the ground up the republican party to make it the party of patriots the people who believe in what donald trump believes in freedom and patriotism and what i think will eventually happen is you're going to find they were almost a one-party country a party made up under the name of the republican party a party of patriots a party who loves freedom a party who loves the fundamental principles this country was founded on i've always said bring in the immigrants if they want to come here and they want to be part of an american experience love our constitution work hard play by the rules we were made up as a country of immigrants what we have now is a country where they're flooding us with people that don't care about our constitution they want to change it they don't want to play by the rules they want to come in illegally we've got to get back to the fundamentals isn't that true in life fundamentally in life we've got to get back to the fundamental rule of life and that is that we're created by god almighty and he gave us a set of rules to live by our constitution is supposed to have been based according to the people that wrote it on god's law we got to simplify our lives we got to simplify laws and we got to pursue simple truths simple truths are simple truth we got to start being good to each other we got to be civil to each other we got to recognize that we're all different but we're all alike and we've got to focus on the similarities because right now they're trying to get us to focus on the differences and that will divide us so we need to focus on the basic things that we all share in common we ought to be good to each other and be civil to each other and respect the right to disagree so we've got to get back to fundamentals in politics and government and in our own personal lives lynn uh we have another person here who's here for the town hall event this person i don't know if she is a member of antifa or not i i there's no real proof we don't have lin we don't have proof that she's a member of antifa but i'm trying to practice to be on be a member of the washington post here be careful now some anonymous source will come out and say that she is yes i'm saying i have an anonymous source very close to the source it could be in this room it could not be we don't know uh but i'm trying to get a job lend at the washington post so i'm trying to practice so here we go uh folks we're here here on the thrive time show we have an anonymous source close to the source near the source on we can't name them right now to keep them safe who thinks that our next guest might be a member of antifa don't research it don't look it up just assume it's true uh and then we'll print it okay that okay then i'll i'll keep practicing okay ma'am what is your name and uh uh what question do you have for lynnwood yeah so my name is parker and my question would be um i know you've had lots of years of experience and a lot of followers of people what's one piece of information you would want them to walk away knowing after talking to you one piece of information based on my life's experience that's a good question let me take two seconds or three seconds and think about it because i don't want to get this one wrong i want to be honest with you if i had to give someone starting with my children my friends and my neighbors one piece of advice i would tell them to start at the fundamentals figure out what is the purpose of life why are we here ask yourself the question is god real because once you ask yourself the question you're going to learn that there's only one answer that god is real and then i would say follow god's laws the most fundamental law that we were taught by jesus who was both man and god is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you if we lived our lives like that if we conducted our business like that if we conducted our government like that think about what a wonderful world this would be so that would be my fundamental piece of advice to people on how to deal with their lives incredible ma'am can you prove that you're you're not a member of antifa i am not a member of antivirus lynch sounds like a team let me tell you i know your identity i know her identity if i want to investigate whether she's a member of antifa i can do that see if they both were anonymous i wouldn't know what to investigate to find out the truth woulda there i don't think we're talking to anybody that's a number of antiques okay that's fair that's fair with you i know she's not okay i'm just practicing lynn if this whole uh podcast thing doesn't work out i want to get a job at cnn or washington post and i've got to learn to say the things you say a shocking headline you don't verify the sources and you just print that thing you just just print it we don't have time to be accurate hey thank you parker for being here and lynn we have another guest who has a question for you but before he asks you the question i want to bring up we're approaching uh essentially your one year anniversary lin it was five days ago so one year ago in five days so five days and one year ago you were meeting with the president of the united states and you so i met with i met with him on march the 11th march the anniversary has passed okay yeah i met with him at his request i met with him in the oval office and it was march 11th the day that the worldwide pandemic was declared so i i had the uh let's just say i had the i'll call it like it is i had the misfortune of having to look across the room outside of the situation room where i was waiting to go see the president and i saw old foucy i call him faustian fraud voucher and i want to tell you god gave you instincts he gave you common sense boy i tell you i took one look at that guy and i didn't like what i saw my instinct said this is not a good person instincts turned out to be right hey just because fauci told us that we shouldn't shut down the borders and then we should shut down the borders and we shouldn't wear a mask then we should wear a mask and just because he is the one who used us dollars to fund the controversial wuhan lab where the covet 19 virus came from folks if you don't believe me type it into google right now type in type in fouchy funded controversial wuhan lab and you can find it right now on newsweek so just because lin just because he's the one who funded the actual laboratory where the covet 19 virus came from just because he flip-flops and just because uh he he without being elected has ruined the lives of so many um melinda is there any other reasons why we shouldn't trust dr fauci i mean because you you picked up on it i mean you have a great sense of uh well you know well let me let me try it back to where i started yeah what if fouchy was going around espousing fouchy's agenda under the condition of anonymity and everything fauci was saying person close to the investigation a close person close to the vaccination development a person close to the national world health organization what if we didn't know who he was you wouldn't know whether to believe what you were reading or not but the good news is we know about old fountain and we can investigate pouches and we can find out whether we want to believe old fouchy and you don't have to do a whole lot of investigation on uh the internet not in google don't do that do duck duck go you can go in and you can invest you have duck duck said i'm sorry i can't i'm not that skilled in the names but you can go in and you can investigate it find out his ties to bill gates find out his ties to the national world health organization or who find out that he said one thing on one day and another thing on another day find out whether he's really got any medical training and experience as a medical doctor i believe if anybody takes a 30 minute or less search about fouchy in a legitimate search engine you wouldn't trust spouchy any further than he can throw a baseball and he can't throw one very far and he can't even pull it in the right direction you are correct do your homework think think for yourself do your research find out who you really want to believe and trust and who you do not want to believe and trust i wouldn't trust fouchy i wouldn't believe him he's inconsistent he's contradictory he's biased he's got financial agendas at work and he's calling the shots now under the so-called biden administration you better wake up america vouchers not your friend you know lynn i will point this out if all the listeners will go to time to free america time to free america and you click on the truth about dr fauci you can see that he's the one who funded the controversial wuhan lab with millions of us dollars you can see uh dr david martin created this this document called the fouchy dossier which is incredible you can see his years of conflict of interest you can see where he has served on the bill and melinda gates foundation for years you can see that this guy is not on our team now then we have another great uh guest here for the town hall tonight this guy i can tell you he's definitely not a member of antifa he seems to be a great american uh sir what's your name and what question would you have for lynnwood my name is ken juan fulso that's kind of hard keen one folsom kin one yes okay what question do you have hello hello gen one ken one getting one what the ghost i got yes thank you lynn um i got one question who is running the country is it president trump is it president biden or is it the military boy abcd i guess we could say none of the above but i don't want to do that one uh i don't know okay i don't think that i think that's i think that's the issue that's burning in americans minds right now we're not sure now i can give you what i believe looking at the situation as i perceive it and learn it through trying to research i can look at the laws i can look at some of the executive orders that have been passed and i can give you what i would say is at least my own educated analysis i guess that's my opinion i do not believe that the biden quote unquote administration is real i think it's fake i believe that president trump did not walk away from his commitment to america freedom and patriotism and the people that supported him tens of millions maybe 89 focus on the people that share your values work with them and build relationships that'll build a strong bond fundamentally in our country that will it ultimately be a strong bond of the united states that's what we got to go back and get i love that ma'am any follow-up question that you want to ask lynn again linda he's a crazy man he actually cites his sources he he refuses to just spout generalities sources and you could never be a reporter for cnn you could never be on the washington post with that level of detail they don't want that stuff any question you have for lynnwood man i guess actually yes i love that idea of local i grew up um in a very small town in kentucky you know farmers we ate food from our own dirt which i think has been a big problem um recently we're eating too many things from too many other places and i agree um so but what i guess then my follow-up would be what should we do once we've established kind of that local and taking care of um what can we do perhaps i guess on a state level to truly affect with elections or that kind of stuff or to be more involved so that we actually know what's happening where would be a first step exercise your right free speech free speech now social media has kind of become a plague on our society a place where people profane they insult you they demean you they lie about you but you know actually social media could be a very positive beneficial tool for our society to use to communicate to people outside of our locality outside of our cities outside of our states outside of our country so i would say get get on social media and stand up for yourself and express your free speech get let people know what you stand for do it in terms of when you see something wrong you got a politician or an official that's taking actions that clearly do not support the values of your community speak out inundate that person with emails even go out and exercise your right of peaceful assembly take to the streets in a peaceful way let people know that your voice is not going to be drowned out in america so if you get enough people vocal enough writing enough peacefully assembling enough you'll start changing this world i i lived at a time when i started practicing law cnn didn't exist right i guess it was a gleam in ted turner's eye the internet didn't exist i guess as i jokingly say it was a gleam in al gore's eye he takes credit for it but he didn't invent it the world changed and i've seen over the course of my 68 years uh i've seen it change and change is is a good thing if it's changed in the right direction true you got to have you got to be fundamentally centered you got to have fundamental principles you got to have common goals and so can we advance and and to do better in how we actually live with each other and communicate with with each other sure so the technological advances don't have to be bad they can be an instrument for good but it's at the end of the day life is about a lot of things but in terms of the real world it's about communication yep how you communicate with your spouse your boyfriend girlfriend your children your neighbors your officials you gotta communicate freedom of speech is the fundamental first amendment right if you lose your freedom of speech you're going to lose your freedom of assembly you're going to lose your freedom of religion you're going to ultimately lose your right to bear arms you're going to lose your due process rights you've got to exercise your right of free speech don't be intimidated don't let them suppress you if they sense you in one place find another find a forum so that would be my advice in terms of trying to tell you what to do outside of organization of things speak up let your voice be heard thank you so much hey thank you i appreciate you being here now then we have two final guests here who are here today to attend the the in person uh uh town hall meeting by hosted by general flynn here at the riverwalk my office is here and then on april 16th and 17th those of you who want to see a sydney powell general flynn linwood and a host of great speakers you guys can go to thrivetimeshow.com and click on the conferences button and lynn i've seen you i've watched you uh deliver some speeches do you i feel like you kind of feed off the energy of the audience there did you do you like speaking in large audiences i mean i feel like i get myself all fired up just watching you lynn well i mean the answer is yes uh as a trial lawyer i love a captive audience i got to listen to it but but i do feed off of of of the people that i speak to i like to communicate with them i like to have a conversation with them sometimes i'm hot blooded on things i really care about i'm okay with that i hope you all are too but but i believe that it's the fundamental of having a conversation sit down with i get in front of a judge he or she's done a black robe and they look important i try to have a conversation with him yep i get a jury i try to have a conversation with him with a witness i'll try to have a conversation sometimes on cross-examination it's a little bit harder on the witness than they'd like but that's the way it goes thorough insisting examination to elicit the truth but but i believe that in the people i i think donald trump i'm not i'll say i'm a little bit like donald trump i think trump feeds off of the people because he loves the people i love talking to your guests even though i don't know i like to talk to people so yes i love to speak i don't do a lot of it but when i do i relish the opportunity i'm looking forward to doing so in tulsa amen maybe maybe with time goes i'll speak to more people but i know this the reason i love to talk to people is because god created us to be with each other and have fellowship with each other to talk with each other to enjoy each other that's why he created us another major reason lynn we have a a young lady here to my right again i have no proof lynn i have no reason to believe that she is a member of antifa also no reason to believe she's not a member of antifa you see that lynn i can't it's it's you know even though we have irrefutable evidence that uh ballots have been shredded that is just is a conspiracy theory and that when you see the evidence of shredded ballots that's a conspiracy theory um and anybody who is not a part of antifa out th anybody who's not outwardly sp speaking in favor of antifa is a crazy conservative conspiracy theorist so i guess our guest here might be a crazy conservative conspiracy theorist uh ma'am what what is your name and what question would you have for lynn woods hi my name is kristen schumann and my i have two questions the first question is what are your thoughts on term limits how can we get to a point where we could begin term limits so you got first you got to get honest officials in government and right now if you put that vote to the people up in washington dc even in your state uh legislators they'd probably vote it down quickly because they're looking after themselves and not you so i think you've got to re-establish honesty and government with honest officials who are looking after your interests and not theirs and if you stop and think about it what i said earlier about citizen statesmen send people men and women send them to government to serve the people let them serve for a limited period of time and then return back to being part of the people who have to be governed by the rules they enact so i'm a proponent of term limitations in our legislators and our state officials i'm a little bit torn on the question of term limits on the presidency if i haven't studied that i know why they did it back with uh fdr and i can see where it may be that you just can't we we don't want to have a king right we broke away from the king back when we had the first the revolutionary war i said first because i feel like we're in the middle of one now but we broke away from having this type of tyranny where one person could run us and tell us what to do for too long a period of time we've absolutely gotten back into that same mindset where the king george today is the people in the senate the people in the house and the people in our state governments the bureaucracy that is unknown and yet exist no matter who's the president the same bureaucratic people are there they're like miniature king george's you got to seize back control of our government i think term limits helps us get that done lynn our guest has a follow-up question i believe for you this is coming from my son he wants to know what is your favorite client or who was your favorite client and what was the strangest case you've ever been a part of oh my favorite client i've had so many wonderful people that i've represented i hate to to single one out but i but i've done it repeatedly because it's simply it's the truth and i speak truth my favorite client was richard jewell the man falsely accused of bombing centennial olympic park in 1996. at the olympic games of atlanta i love richard jewell he taught me a lot about life he changed my legal profession he changed me as a person he died way too young he was a victim of the deep state the fbi and he was a victim of the media and he was used he was a scapegoat they threw him out there so they could finish the games of atlanta and make all the money they wanted to make on it and the fbi wanted the world to know oh we we're the fbi we got our man oh man it's richard jewel they wanted people to think the park was safe and so they scapegoated richard jewell and ruined his life without one shred pick my words carefully not one shred not one iota of evidence that that man did anything wrong wow they they told you they told you in the newspaper the atlanta general constitution he fixed the fbi profile of the lone bomber they wanted you to think it was one person so they think that he was captured and you would be safe but we know that richard jewell was in the park at the precise time that the real bomber placed a 9-1-1 warning call saying there's a bomb in centennial olympic park you've got 30 minutes they knew where that call was placed from they knew the time it was placed they knew that richard jewell was in that park that night so even if you were to hypothetically say richard was somehow involved which he was not he could not have been a lone bomber the richard jewell story was the story of lies by the media and the fbi and i'm proud to say when somebody went back and wrote a book on in search of eric rudolph the man that was the bomber they had a chapter in that book and it was about richard jewell and one of the quotes in that book written by henry schuster who was part of the reason i sued cnn back in 96. he said that lynnwood was loathed by the fbi the fbi loathed you know why they loathed me then and they loathed me now because i went out every night and i told the truth about what they were doing to this innocent man and they don't like the truth lynn richards stands out in my mind richard there's a lot of other people i'd love one day to tell you about some of the other great clients i've had both in the past and in recent times i've been blessed with some wonderful people but richard jewell stands out in my mind i still have not given up i hope that one day richard will receive posthumously the presidential medal of freedom because richard jewell stands for what america stands for hardworking man trying to follow the law in fact enforce the law to help other people and he was falsely accused and they destroyed his reputation i think he contributed to his early death at age 44 wow i never forget richard i'll never forget him lynn lynn uh we have time for one more guest i believe and uh before we have our our next guest on here uh i know a lot of our listeners want to support you because you are fighting to defend this republic uh you and sydney powell and general flynn you guys are really putting in the fight here um is there a website where people can go to support you sir or to learn more about the efforts that you're making right now to defend the republic well i want to put in my disclaimer i'm not antifa and i'm not a grifter not been i'm not somebody out trying to make money on what i'm doing right now i'm doing what i'm doing because i love this country okay but i have sought donations in recent weeks because of my efforts both to defend myself against the actions of the state bar and others and obviously the fight for integrity in our election you can go to the website www dot fight back one word fight back dot law i formed hashtag fight back foundation the texas 501 c 4 foundation in the middle of the summer because i felt like we were in the middle of a revolution where we were going to come close to losing our constitution and our constitutional rights and our formed fight back so that in the future people would have a group they could go through to advocate to prevent us from ever losing our rights again so i've used that foundation uh to try to promote things consistent with the mission to protect our constitutional rights and so i i i love the accepted donations and i appreciate it i need it listen i did i've done well i'm not gonna sit here and tell you i'm i'm out looking for my next meal god has blessed me but the fight that i'm trying to wage right now i need everybody that's willing to have a dog in the fight to put the dog in the fight and it will be spent on the efforts to defend our constitution i don't take one dime other than cost for security and other related costs administrative there's nobody taking a salary there's nobody flying around on private jets yep we're putting that money to good to good use so i i'm confident that your money will be well spent because i'm in control of it and i'm not here to take advantage of anybody financially but i want people to feel that they've got something to do whether it's to send five dollars or even better yet just pray for us play for me we need everybody to pull together and everybody needs to be involved in some form or fashion lin what's that website five bucks you're involved you got a dog in the fight lin what's your website where people can donate if they want to www.fightback.law fightback.law folks that's fightback.law one

CANAL SPEECHES.", "E1hTWofZGSY": "[Music] okay so this is the bass champs uh as i teased you guys on tuesday so uh this is the saturday tournament uh norris and blakelock won the tournament with over 30 pounds it took almost 19 pounds to get paid and and moonpie and i had 19 and a quarter pounds so um we uh we started as you're going to see you guys who know rayburn are going to be able to tell we started on the south end of the lake actually there's no footage from the first place we started the first place we started um i knew there was some really good grass in there we made a pass through it and we might have caught a keeper as i recall i don't think we did and that was right there within three or four miles of the off and then we just started working our way north and on our second spot uh i think we caught our limit on our second spot uh including uh a really nice fish you'll see here so here's our here's our second stop here's the second spot we stopped them [Applause] keepers i don't want these six cents one with them big ass hooks they don't pop grip out of that grass every morning i walked outside to go to work his mouth i didn't feel you got clipper in there he is red i do not like the way he bit that's not good that's how you lose a big [Music] [Music] compared to this one i well got kicker what you got i know give me some rattle here fish uh right there feet out i think that's five i think that's a number uh look out okay so uh we had four or five fish there i believe we had five when we left there i'm sure it's in the footage jared's uh eddie editing this so i won't see the actual raw footage but we either left there with four or five fish and we just kept working our way further north we fished basically starting at about five fingers we fished into caney we fished up into the mouth of harvey and then we continued further north to some of the most north grass on the lake and we kind of went into an area hoping we could fish it and it was extremely crowded and we just sort of worked our way through and and you know i gotta say this this a couple of areas on the lake were as crowded as i've ever seen these two particular areas and it was remarkable to me i never heard crosswords from anybody everybody knew there were fish in these areas everybody knew there was going to be a crowd in there and on multiple occasions we were throwing at each other matter of fact sunday we watched three boats sitting i'm going to say way less than 50 yards apart throwing at the same spot all three of them caught over 20 pounds saturday and all three of them caught over 20 pounds sunday and they just got along and that's just remarkable in a time where everybody seems to be fighting about stuff uh the fishing community or rayburn really came together the only crosswords i heard were deserved i heard a guy idle over a point where a guy was fishing real early saturday morning and that guy told him he should idle around him and he should have so um it you know it it was crowded and we all understood it was going to be crowded and we all just kind of stuck it out and uh here's kind of how we finished our day uh i don't remember what all exact footage we got but i do know that we turned the camera off and uh we we literally had 10 minutes left and i turned the camera off and we caught one more fish a little bit over three pounds that was about a pound call and that got us to the 19 and a quarter we felt like we were going to get paid with that but we also knew that there's been a number of tournaments there this time of year where 20 plus doesn't get paid so we were a little bit nervous about it but we made the run in and fortunately we got paid so i hope you enjoy this last little bit of footage right here all right [Music] [Music] [Music] what was the one he caught earlier um [Music] one [Music] nice oh spotlight oh my god [Music] [Music] 11. oh andy down right so there you go so that's the bass champs saturday uh i'll get sunday posted up next week between now and then i'm going to get the ballistic grading done and then we'll get that big string of the 27 pound stringer posted up for you guys to watch as well and again i'll talk a little bit about the difference as you saw saturday and by the way the things you didn't see so we threw uh a rattle bait mostly a trap and a quake seemed to be the baits that they wanted uh the big fish pie caught was on a quake um i believe that's right i threw an a-rig a bunch but they didn't really seem to want to bite the a-rig although one of our fish we waged saturday was on an a-rig i threw a jerk bait a ton never had a bite on a jerkbait i threw a chatter bait a ton um never had a bite on a chatter bait now i know somebody else who caught a bunch of fish around wood on a chatter bait but i never had a bite on it and i did jump one really good fish off i was throwing that little fritz five flat sided it's the five it runs five feet deep it's got little tiny hooks on it and i jumped one about three and a half four pounds off that probably cost us a pound saturday and it was just a good solid bite with those little hooks i pulled a little bit too hard trying to make sure i had him stuck and trying to keep him from burying in the grass and right out of the water he came and off with that little crankbait so that happens on occasion um but uh we we had a good day it was the only quality fish we lost that we saw now there's with a trap down there right now you're getting a ton of crappie slapping that bait we caught several crappie we saw a guy snag a giant buffalo sunday moon pie snagged several fish that they pull off and you get a big giant buffalo scale back so there's just a lot of animals up shallow right now uh and matter of fact moonpie did call for the net saturday or sunday one for a blue channel i think that was sunday i don't i don't think i have footage of that i think i recorded over it but he did think he had a big one on until he saw his line spinning so anyway that was our saturday we got more footage coming up for you guys that i think you enjoy so please stick around and thanks for tuning in thanks for subscribing and we'll get footage up for you soon on the big stringer well on the bigger stringer about that thanks guys [Music] you", "DKmxuBALP3Q": "family and friends are mourning the loss of a loved one tonight who drowned on the Oregon coast Friday night during a church trip the Tillamook County Sheriff's Office says he got caught in a rip current near in a hail Ambe State Park Fox Tolls Audrey Weil spoke with those who were with him that night in interviews you'll see only on 12 it is an emotional and difficult night for many of the congregants here for service at the first Slovak Immanuel Baptist Church several of them were actually with Vladimir Kravchenko in the final moments of his life this is Vladimir Kravchenko in the ocean near Nehalem Bay State Park friends say he spent a lot of time in the water that week on a church camping trip and Friday night was no different we just decided to go for a swim mark kazakian says he Kravchenko and kravchenko's brother-in-law all went for a sunset dip but that when they tried to get back to shore they got caught in a rip current a strong fast wave moving away from the beach I started swimming harder and gained a little bit of distance turned around and saw him still in the same spot and very tired look on his face and he was barely swimming and then he started saying you know help me help me and that's when I knew you know he was in trouble two of them were able to get back to shore where David medvetz Key was waiting to help they're like where's Vlad where's Vladimir and they say minutes later the tide brought kravchenko in unconscious they tried CPR and first responders arrived but the Tillamook County Sheriff's Office says kravchenko was pronounced dead at the hospital it's been really hard he was an amazing person an amazing husband and father he now leaves behind a wife four kids and a grieving church turning toward their faith and each other like the Bible says if one body part is hurting the whole body is hurting that's kind of what I would describe our church right now this family's in a lot of pain and that makes the whole church in pain D I believe was ready we don't know why this all happened how it happened but like I said we do believe he's in a better place now and hopefully we have hope that one day we'll be reunited with them the church will have funeral and memorial services here for Kravchenko this weekend there is also a GoFundMe set up to help his family we have the details on all of that on our website kpbs.org Weil Fox 12 Oregon and drownings are certainly difficult for loved ones but it's also hard for the emergency responders who aim to save lives each day with that the Tillamook County emergency manager wants you to remember these tips in hopes of preventing more drownings if you are ever caught in a rip current don't swim against it instead swim parallel to the coastline until you get out of that current and can swim to shore if you can't escape the current tried to float or try to tread water also don't swim alone have a designated person watch you from the beach if you have to go in alone and consider getting a lifejacket that you can always wear whenever you're in the water", "hJrBttbaD8U": "Wow sitting there with well Jenny bug nice you know we're talking like Oh iris guys do we tell the same stories over and over Isaiah to get better

celebrates this day every year and being in the business of weather and climate research this day is very important for us and we organize a special lecture that is very much based on the theme of the day and this year the world metallurgical day theme is the ocean our climate and weather with his expertise in ocean sciences and its transformation into societal benefits today we have the honor and privilege that uh dr this invasion kumar director in choice hyderabad is with us to deliver the iatm world metrological day special lecture 2021 before he proceeds to enlighten us on societal benefits of ocean information services uh i would uh invite iotm director professor ravi shankar nanchandra yeti to please give his uh welcome remarks and briefly introduce dr kumar to our audience over to professor first of all i would like to welcome dr shinovas kumar and all the others who are virtually with us on this day that is the world meteorological day you would have liked to have a physical talk by dr shinwas but situations are such that will not be at least this year we can't have it uh so it's a welcome again dr shinwas and to those who are not familiar i mean i'm sure most of you are familiar with dr shinwas but just a brief bio which is more like a formality i'm sure all of you are very much aware of shinwas and his good work but just a brief bio of him before we start the talk dr kumar is presently the director of the indian national center for ocean information services hyderabad it is an autonomous body under the ministry of earth sciences government of india he has more than 22 years of experience he has worked at various techno managerial positions and has managed large scientific projects in different capacities and roles at various prestigious organizations before joining incoice as director in august 2020 dr kumar was heading ioc unesco intergovernmental coordination group for indian ocean tsunami warning and mitigation systems icg slash iot wms quite a bit of a mouthful i'm sure his work was equally demanding as the name itself suggests this was in australia prior to that he was the head of advisory services and satellite oceanography group at incoice he has immensely contributed in advancing the science of tsunami warning and the successful implementation of various important projects related to tsunami early warning fishing zones multi hazard vulnerability mapping coral reef bleaching and many other areas of work earlier he will also serve in isro dr kumar is the recipient of several national and international awards including the prestigious national geosciences award in 2010 and the indian national geospatial award in 2008. with a phd in marine science he has more than 70 peer-reviewed publications to his credit i now request dr shinwas to give his talk dr shinwas thank you very much uh professor ravi uh for the generous introduction and it's a real privilege uh to be here today and then a very good morning to you and all the colleagues tuned in to this wmo day talk so let me share my presentation okay uh is my presentation visible above yeah yeah very much so please go ahead all right all right so thank you very much and good morning once again um so i'll be talking today uh briefly about uh societal benefits of ocean information services uh as professor ravi uh introduced of course uh several colleagues in iitm uh i'm i'm aware of the work that inquires does so i represent indian national center for ocean information services uh which is under the ministry of earth sciences right as the iatm we are sister institutions uh and then so we work on ocean observations information advisory services so i'll actually try to take you through some of the activities that we do at empires uh and then i'm very happy that this year's world mythological organization day there's a wmd of 2021 the theme is the oceans of climate and weather uh so this is uh very uh timely in the sense that the the u.n decade of ocean science for sustainable development uh started uh uh was launched in january this year and it will run from 2021 to 2030 where there are going to be a lot of activities that are going to focus on oceans our understanding of the oceans uh the the the benefits that we can derive from the oceans of course how do we uh you know do that in a sustainable way uh so all this is actually going to be the uh the the focus of the u.n ocean decade of ocean science for sustainable development and then it's very timely and apt that uh this year's theme of the wmo days are you know the oceans are climate and weather um so uh just you know for completeness we let us actually uh see why oceans are important um most of us know this but then the air that we breathe you know every second uh you know breath that we take the oxygen comes from the oceans actually um and then of course the ocean stores 50 times more co2 than our atmosphere uh so it's a sink to the carbon dioxide that is actually produced by the by human anthropogenic activities and then it regulates the climate uh 70 covering 70 of the ocean surface the oceans we know transport heat from the equator to the poles and then they regulate our climate and weather patterns and of course they are important for recreation they're important for transportation and economy uh i mean we talk so much about blue economy these days uh so most of the ocean economy uh it is actually the oceans producing goods and services uh and they employ many people food of course the oceans give us about about 90 percent of the global fisheries they come from the oceans and then the 25 percent of global biological productivity comes from the oceans so not only fish actually there are several products that are you know that comes from the oceans that actually uh get into our food chain and then of course medicines a lot of medicinal products they come from the oceans and then uh of course 50 of the human population and 70 percent of omega cities they are near the coast 100 kilometers from the shoreline and a lot of energy supplies about 25 to 30 percent of the global energy supplies are estimated to come from the oceans they could be from tidal energy thermal energy gas hydrates and so on and so forth and very importantly the oceans as all of us appreciate that you know they are the driving force for monsoons and then they are the source of oceanogenic disasters such as cyclones tsunamis sea level rise that is actually due to the impact of climate change etc and in spite of being so important the oceans are the earth's least expo explode frontier as you would have all heard we know more than this about the surface of the mars then we know about the bottom of the oceans so so this is a this is something which the u.n decade of ocean science you know intends to change and then of course all our institutions in quiz and iot nccr cmlre iatm imd all the institutes that under our ministry of earth sciences they are actually trying to you know change this uh you know and bring a step change in our understanding of the oceans and then how it impacts our climate and weather so some phenomena of interest in the oceans uh we actually there are molecular processes that are sub meter level to actually processes like enso which are which actually span thousands of kilometers on the spatial scales then you talk about time scales you use you actually start from you know time scales ranging from a few seconds to years to decades to centuries so these processes like in the range from surface waves to phytoplankton blooms to internal tides france eddies coastly trapped waves and so on and so forth so what all we are trying to study about the oceans they fall within these different spatial and temporal scales now coming to the indian ocean uh indian ocean is again very important like there are more than 50 nations around the indian ocean most of which are developing ones there is about 1.5 billion population and then with heterogeneous cultural heritage in all these countries i quote here from the indus 2 report which is actually something which is a publication by uh io goose cliver goose cyber uh indian ocean panel and all these scientific bodies our own colleagues like matthew roxy and gavichandra and of this report which was published last year uh this report talks about the societal needs of a sustained observing system in the indian ocean what is the what are the societal needs in the indian ocean so there is rapid growth in blue economies and opportunities to exploit ocean resources and services but again this has to be done very sustainably and then indian ocean is on all the countries around the indian ocean are agriculture farming depend uh there is this is the uh there are a grainy agrarian economies where a lot is dependent on the monsoons uh and then of course the marine fisheries uh which is dependent on ocean conditions the productivity primary productivity secondary productivity etc and then the extreme weather and climate change so the coastal populations are vulnerable to the extreme weather and climate change so these are the societal needs of the of the indian ocean region of all our countries around the indian ocean region but then what are the operational drivers uh agencies like uh inquiries which is an operational agency like what imd is to the atmosphere in coil seats to the oceans so there are several operational drivers for uh for the indian ocean which is actually we need to be able to do operational sub seasonal to seasonal forecasting and in our attempt to do forecasting we need to actually be able to understand processes and then model them and then drive ocean models and atmospheric models so we need we need surface accurate surface fluxes and of course we also need the ocean data assimilation systems to actually get a lot of observational data into the models and then to be able to do forecasting so what i'm trying to make a point here is we need to better observe the oceans we need to understand the processes and model the indian ocean not only indian ocean of course all the global oceans but then we are talking about the indian ocean now what are the scientific drivers again i quote from this report there are several scientific drivers like i've showed in my previous slide the the the the phenomena processes the different temporal and uh you know spatial scales now these are some things that are very important all of us as meteorologists and ocean oceanographers would like to understand i mean they range from uh you know augs and minimum zones the omz in the indian ocean the up filling in subduction zones major heat flux components and then of course the tropical modes of mjo and monsoon intraseasonal oscillations the indian ocean dipole and then other subtropical modes of ningaloo nino and subtropical iod climate change of course uh how the you know rising temperatures atmospheric temperatures and the ocean temperatures are you know impacting the oceans the sea level rise etc and of course cyclogenesis and and and tsunamis etc so these are some of the science drivers uh for which we need to observe and understand our uh ocean now where do we come into picture uh inquiries uh i mean actually so encourage these uh these specialized agencies which deal with ocean observation information advisory services so we occupy the niche space where there is science being done in in several institutes in the country and internationally and then there is this user community the coastal community which actually needs information uh on how the oceans would behave and then how it would impact their lives and livelihoods so we actually come in between uh where we bring in translate that science into services that are useful to the communities and the the our user communities are listed there on the right panel those are not exclusive there are several others starting right from fishing communities to coastal states the met community could be imd it could be iatm and cmrwf etc the navy nhos the strategic users like coast guards the ports and harbours offshore shipping industry the fishing industry research institutions and academia who actually do pursue research in oceanography so and what are the services that we provide currently to these users so we our services are categorized into ecosystem related services like fisheries the coral reefs the harmful algal blooms and then we have ocean state forecasting services which actually enhance the safety at sea and then we also have disaster related services such as the tsunami and storm surge early warning systems the high wave alerts marine search and rescue etc and then we also have coastal geospatial services how are our course going to be impacted by uh by sea level rise say for example or by by a tsunami or by a storm surge or by a high wave so those kind of services related to vulnerability assessments and the gis 3dgs mapping of the coastal areas that could enable us to develop impact-based focus from from our models so that's something which includes is also involved in and then very importantly we also provide data related services uh people need data from the oceans uh to be able to do their research so that's something we should provide and we contribute to weather and climate like for example on the analysis of ocean conditions from using our ocean models etc and then capacity building now to be able to deliver these services all of us appreciate that we need huge observing systems and these observed observing systems could be remote sensing satellite based systems or the in-situ systems so those are the bottom two boxes that you're seeing there once you have these observations you need to be able to if there is satellite observations then you need to be able to uh to to to to develop algorithms to be able to derive geophysical parameters from satellite data and then if you're talking about in-situ observations then you need to be able to really uh get this data into your ocean models for forcing your ocean models or for assimilating these data into ocean models do that modeling and then deliver a service actually so this is the end-to-end thing so ocean observations ocean modeling satellite oceanography develop a service and then disseminate it to the community so this is what we do and what i'm going to talk about today in this talk is basically focus a bit more on the observations because i'm sure a lot of you must be interested in what are the kinds of observations that india does among our various institutions the ocean observations especially and then how they could help you in the kind of the work that we that you do actually so i will talk about uh those a bit and then i will also talk finally about the services that you are seeing on the top and then what are the economic benefits of those services uh coming to the the the the services the the observations like for example there is a global ocean observing system which is actually run by the intergovernmental ocean of the commission of the unesco uh together with the wmo and unapp this global ocean observing system is based on a global design uh now how what do you want to do with these observations so you want to address climate ocean open ocean and climate you want to also address the coastal oceans uh so so so there is a global design and there is regional implementation like for example in the indian ocean there is a indian ocean global ocean observing system the io goose it's a it's a it's a regional alliance and then where do the contributions to uh to these uh observing global ocean observing systems come from they come from national contributions like countries such as india with our ministry under our ministry we do a lot of observations which are broadly contributing to a regional implementation plan and then also contribute to the global design because ocean observation is not something that a single country can do and then the design cannot be based on just you know just you know considerations of our own requirements it has to fit into your overall global design so so the themes it could be climate theme it could be operational ocean services theme or it could be ocean health and then there are under goose essential ocean variables that have been defined covering the physics the biogeochemistry the biology and ecosystems and then what you see down below around this globe all are all those essential ocean variables that need to be measured by systems that contribute to the goose so that there is a standard uh on what you observe how you observe and then how this information can get into they can contribute to understanding the overall you know oceans weather or climate so this is the broad uh the global uh ocean observing system and coming into the indian ocean again um like i mentioned before there is an induced indian ocean observing system uh what you're seeing here on the left panel is actually designed for hindus now induce 1 started in 2006 and then the induce 2 now is actually something which is an aspiration from 2020 to 2030. in fact when indus started and even to now even now to certain extent indian ocean has been the least observed of all the other oceans and then induce really helped uh set up a lot of observing systems starting from mood buoys a lot of our our indian observing systems also contribute to the indus like the argo floats the our mood buoys of the national institute of ocean technology xbts tide gauges so all the dots that you see here either they are already existing there the rama buoys etc a lot of countries uh come together to put these observing networks and then and then actually this data is available to drive our ocean models or atmospheric models etc so all those are defined so there is a design for induce in the indian ocean region i'll not get into the details there but then now i'll quickly get into now where does india fit in where do we contribute to ocean observing systems for our own region as well as for the entire uh you know the indian ocean region so the indian institute observing network we have ocean observing uh platforms which are uh which which actually are set up to deliver our services now these services could be like tsunami buoys they are actually there to deliver to be to enable us deliver tsunami early warnings similarly tight gauges you have gnss and strong motion accelerometer networks we have wave rider buoys ship days ship-based automatic weather stations etc etc and then you also have other platforms which are there for r d for example uh like uctds estimate sensors led cps dcfs the optic profilers which can measure optical properties etc which are actually there for measuring certain um processes and then we also have process specific observations where we try to have observing campaigns for uh for learning about the ocean physical process marine boundary layer process and bio geochemical processes so in a nutshell in a snapshot if you see if you want to see what are our observing networks of india and then where they are currently the the bottom map that you see on the right side panel with all those dots they are the observing networks that are actually ocean observing networks of india it could be by and iot mostly by encouraging niot now of course also there is a remote sensing satellite constellation i'll not get into the details isro launches these uh you know our ocean remote sensing satellite starting right from moss earlier and then to oceanside one to oceans at two and then now there are plans for very quickly launching motions at three and we have at inquires capability for for for receiving data from ocean satellites not only indian but also international satellites and then analyze that data and then use that data for our operational applications as well as for disseminating to several users now i'll actually uh talk a bit about the argo about each of these observing networks now argo floats uh it's it's a global uh array of 3000 floats in the global oceans and in the indian ocean region there are supposed to be about 450 floats at every three by three degree grid and then right now india encoys contributes about 50 floats a year for this indian ocean argo in the indian ocean region and now we are actually getting into deployment of most of the argo floats of course so far they have been measuring temperature and salinity profiles from up to 2000 meter depth in the oceans and now we are actually getting into measurement of bio biological uh parameters using these argo floats through floats called bioargo and then they can actually measure like chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen backscatter nitrate etc and the application of these argo floats is to improve ocean and climate forecasting of course understand ocean atmosphere interactions because they actually give all these parameters in the upper 2000 meter ocean depth uh and then we also use this for you know predicting the seasonal to decay the climate variability argo is basically for climate applications uh and then you do you can actually use them for global ocean analysis and then of course they are operationally going into you know being assimilated into ogcm's globally um so so the data is available over gts and then organizations like encoys ncmwfi iitm they actually assimilate this information into their uh ogcm's actually and of course they're used for atmospheric modeling uh finally and future plan of course we will continue to deploy 50 floats a year and coming to new kind of observing systems that we are we that we that india is currently very new he recently got into is the gliders uh which can actually make uh vertical profiles uh of temperatures led chlorophyll whatever argo flutes does they can be also measured by gliders the only difference being that the gliders can actually have a mission you can send these gliders or long transects and then have them do the profiles the way that you design them and then retrieve them back so we have we have now increases deployed very recently two gliders along in the bay of bengal transect we will in future also be doing the arabian sea transits under the deportion mission so two of these gliders are currently uh have been deployed a couple of weeks back uh in the bay of bengal now coming to waverider boys we have a large network of wave rider buoys about 16 wave writer boys all along the indian coastline encourage maintains these waverider buoys and then they help us provide our ocean wave forecasting service so they help us in understanding wave conditions over different time scales starting from diurnal to intra seasonal to inter-annual uh and then the data is of course used by us to validate our ocean model wave models and then be able to provide services like for example what is what you're seeing in the top bottom right corner is actually a real time um the comparison of our wave forecast with the wave writer we observed wave rider waves from the wave writer boys so this information is available on the encourage website so they are used for operational forecasting now encourage also has a large network of about 34 automatic weather systems on research not only research vessels but ships of the shipping corporation of india these measure relative humidity swr lw or sst air temperature wind vectors etcetera and then all these data is available through the gts available for for modeling uh uh applications and of course for validation of uh the um the model outputs so 34 of such systems are available always these are on ships and then transmitting data in real time these ships are mostly operating in the indian ocean tsunami tsunami buoy network of course tsunami boost measure the pressure uh i mean water level that is derived from the pressure bottom pressure because the bottom sensor sits at the ocean bottom these we have seven uh network of seven buoys maintained by encoys and imd sorry uh the niot they measure uh the water level and then help us uh provide operational tsunami early warning but in addition to that these uh sea level information is also used for scientific studies recently our colleagues in encourage published an article a a publication in nature communications which talked about the basin wide sea level currency in the tropical indian ocean driven by the mjo so so these data sets are very useful for in addition to tsunami warning for for research applications tight gauges increase maintains a network of 36 tight gauges again primarily for tsunami warning because survey of india also maintains a tiger's network for long-term sea level monitoring but then nevertheless this network is also used for other research applications like the bottom corner panel that you're seeing here is actually a tiger being used for tsunami warning so this is uh for the event in 2012 a campbell bit tight gauge how it has monitored the tsunami wave but then we also use this data for long term sea level rise kind of applications the top panel that you're seeing here is in different colors on the coast is actually how the sea level has varied at different parts of the indian coastline as derived from tight gauge data of the last 100 years from the survey of india type gauges so these are the kind of applications that are possible using tide gauges we also have a very dense network of gnss that is gps sensors and strong motion accelerometers again which can be which are primarily for measuring the peak ground acceleration and vertical displacement for tsunami warning but then as you would as you appreciate the gnss information can be used for ipwv for you know integrated preceptable water vapor and tec kind of applications for uh weather uh so 35 stations are currently operational in the andaman nikoba islands uh transmitting data to encourage in real time and of course mood buoys many of you are aware of this these are run by the national institute of ocean technology and then these the data from these buoys again is used in a simulation into operational modeling systems and of course we use this information enquiries extensively for monitoring and validating our model uh focus that we make so this is by niot and again hf radars there is a there are five pairs of radars again run by niot which monitor the ocean surface currents 200 kilometers from the coast and this data is again extensively used for validation of the coastal forecasts that are being put out by encoys and then of course the data is also used extensively for for for research there was a recent publication from inquiries and encouraged colleagues which actually tried to look at the variability of coastal currents along the shelf and then tried to see and and they identified that actually the annual variability that is uh seen in the slope of the slope is not actually seen in the shelf region so these are some of the research kind of applications of this hf radar networks drifting buoys again this is a global network uh what you're seeing on the map there is all the drifting buoys that are currently in the in in the global oceans yeah there are several different buoys in the indian ocean and then encourage uh manages uh uh puts about about 50 drifting buoys in the in the indian ocean um so uh every year so that's the uh that's the network of drifting buoys and then of course they measure the water temperature and atmospheric pressure and this information again is available or the gts available for a simulation into uh models um so so drifting buoys is again a very and of course also used for several scientific applications like for example studying the annual harmonics of zonal currents etc xpt and xctd transects again this data is not available in real time they actually are run along the shipping routes we measure the temperature and salinity profiles up to 760 meter depth and then these are used for long-term monitoring of operation thermal fields and this is very important in regions these profiles in regions where we can't put argo floats because argo floats are primarily put in the deep oceans but then within our ez's or coastal regions where you really can't cargo floats are not an option for measuring the profiles so these are the systems that can actually provide these uh temperature and salinity profiles in the coast lotions and now we are working on making these systems real time so that again this data can be useful for you know our modeling and forecasting purposes and we also through national history of oceanography manage several coastal adcps acoustic doppler current profilers in the coastal regions and then also equatorial current meter networks these are again not real time but they actually help us in assessing the long-term variability of ocean currents in the coastal shelf slope and equatorial indian ocean uh and of course seasonal intra-seasonal intra-annual variability of ocean currents along the out along the indian coastal region and of course we also use this data extensively for validation of our ocean currents that we actually forecast try to model using our ocean general circulation models so there is a future plan to expand this again through nao for the gulf of mana and the lux deep sea flux mooring again colleagues in iitm would be very interested in this this is actually a mooring that we deployed and then ran for more than a year from 23rd may 2019 to 7th october 2020 uh to understand the mixed layer dynamics fine tune the bulk flux algorithms and you know understand the uh you know oceanography upper uh ocean processes um in the in the bay of bengal uh and then the data is currently being processed and this is actually uh where we had dcfs measurements on the on the buoy and estimate measurements of course and several oceanographic sensors under the under the sea so this is we are we are having plans to move this to the arabian sea uh in the future we are also working on biogeochemical sensors uh because a lot of observations so far has been on observing the physical oceanographic parameters mostly but then there is a lot of focus now on getting into biology chemistry we talk about ocean acidification etcetera so this is something we are getting into the the monitoring of the by geochemical sensors now this is a biochemical sensor that we actually mounted on the niot mood buoy so more such observations will be made for observations of pco2 and ph etc into the future then we are also working on coastal water quality buoy network along with the national center for coastal research in chennai where we would like to make observations of the coastal water quality so there will be several coastal water quality parameters both physics chemistry and biogeochemistry that would be monitored on these buoys so initially we are actually deploying about two buoys and then we would we intend to expand this to six buoys in the future so the first phase of deployment would be in kochie and vishakapatnam and this is in addition to several buoys that are being deployed in the near coast by the nccr to monitor the coastal water quality and we also are working on of course process specific observations several of them this is one example of which i picked where iitm colleagues are very closely involved where we would like to make intense observations like similar to what was done in the omm uh in the bay of bengal we would like to kind of replicate it into the arabian sea trying to observe the processes uh the the boundary layer processes in the ocean and atmosphere in the airbnc because that's a big gap area now and then we would like to use that information for uh you know improving the parameterization schemes in our ocean models understand the mixed layer process boundary layer processes etc and of course eventually uh you know with the with the view that we'll be able to improve our you know predictions uh of course iatm enable iatm and imd to enhance the predictions of monsoon and where does all these data go now ocean data services is one primary area that encourages works on so from the observations now i'm trying to get into the services in the next 10 minutes or so i'll try to try to show you some of the services that go out from incois so the data gets seen to increases the national oceanic data center so if you see on the top left panel the argo floats drifters hf radars whatever data whatever observational platforms that i spoke about before they are they are synthesized and then made available in the national specific data center at in coils and then they are quality controlled if they are if the data is real-time data that is to be used in the simulated into the ocean models that is available through the gts and then data is available there is a national oceanographic data policy that we use to provide this data to the users to the research institutions to academic users to to any user that needs this data and that is actually provided through web through live access servers through adapt offline means such as cds because we generate atlases in some cases like for example there are argo data used to generate atlas of the salinity or the temperature and then those atlases are available to different users so this is how the data is available both from the institute data as well as the remote sensing data the bottom panel that you see here is the remote sensing data products that encourage generates on a day-to-day basis and then used for our applications such as pfz etc and on the right panel is actually it's not very clear but what you see on the x-axis is the data sets like i said in 2006 indian ocean was so data sparse and then you see over the years it's not that we have everything now we need to put in a lot of efforts in data in observations still we are still under observing the indian ocean but still the you know what you're seeing in this plot is how the observation the return of data sets from different observing systems grew over the years so the last you know bar that you see would be for the year 2020 perhaps so that is actually the data returned from various observing systems now this is a this is a new application which actually was launched uh very recently by incois which is called the digital ocean which enables the user to request for data and then do their own analysis they can they can create workspaces like for example you can if you're interested in cyclone you can create a workspace for cyclones and then all the data that is relevant to that particular cyclone be it from in-situ observations or model data sets would be can be made available in that work particular workspace and then anybody who is interested in looking at that cyclone data from different observing platforms related to that particular event can go to that workspace and then extract the data in you know very easily so like for example you want to look at tropical cyclone heat potential or you want to look at argo data sets that are actually there along the track of that cyclone so all that can be done using this digital ocean this is a very new application so all that observing systems and then data services so they get into at inquiries we have ocean modeling and forecasting system uh i'll not get into too much of details but encourage runs a suite of ocean models uh starting right from mom to roms to hi com etc for different applications wave watch swan ad circ toonami etc and then all these actually get into our forecasting services and then these could be a very very immediate forecast like for example forecast for the next day to next three days two regional analysis for example what we do for the uh what we provide to you know to iatm etc for the regional analysis and forecast they could be very coastal forecast and there could be of the time scales of uh several minutes like for example tsunami warning we give out a warning from our model modeling and forecasting system in few minutes so these are the time spatial and temporal scales of which the products are available different products from our modeling systems and then of course we are moving towards a unified ocean modeling and forecasting framework uh we also had several discussions with all iitn and imd and several other institutions which do ocean modeling within the country iisc etc to come up with this kind of a framework uh into the next going into the next five years where we'll be using mom 6 as a primary application for global to regional to local kind of modeling and this is also something which i thought you might find interesting where we are working on ocean climate change advisory services again we'll be working very closely with iatm here and of course the nccr and other agencies where we try to come up with advisories like projections of sea level change and how that change might impact our coastal regions so and of course what would be the impact of climate change on the cyclone intensity and frequency this is something iatm a lot of iot colleagues are working on and then we would like to we'd be working closely with iitm on these aspects and projection of storm surges and wind waves and then biogeochemistry of the ecosystems so this is something which we intend to do as part of the deep ocean mission and coming to a couple of other applications uh i will try to close in the next five minutes so that we have some time for questions uh the potential fishing zone advisory service is one of the uh prime surveys of inquiries we have lots of users the information goes to about 700 000 fishermen on a daily basis on where they could go and do conduct they can conduct fishing operations so that their catches will be better so this is done based on satellite data sets isro has been heavily involved in the initial development of this technology and then we use sea surface temperature chlorophyll etc to develop to provide these information on a daily basis to fishermen and of course there is a user demand for species specific forecast for tuna and this is something also which we give on a daily basis we have parameters such as k490 which is the water water clarity we actually include information on the currents uh the the the mld etc which is very important for tuna fishing so this this is also another service that goes out from encores incas also puts out coral bleaching alerts this is again based on the sea surface temperature data sets from satellite where we actually provide information on the probability of bleaching occurring based on the enhanced sea surface temperatures if there is any enhanced surface temperature or the uh or the nominal average and then to how long is that particular enhanced temperature sustaining how many weeks so based on this we actually developed a developed method and then now this is an operational service where we can actually provide bleach coral bleaching alerts so we put it under no stress watch and warning if there is a warning that means that the probability of corals bleaching during that particular year is very high so this has been uh this we have been doing for several years now and it's a it's a it's been proven very effective and we also have algal bloom information service these are all the ecosystem services i i'm talking about and this actually is operational now we do algal bloom monitoring based on satellite data sets and institute data sets we put out an index based on normal that means there is no harmful algal bloom or watch or warning again so and this is based on several products that we generate from satellite data and then we generate an index to be able to provide this based on all those parameters that could be chlorophyll a like microplankton nanoplankton so bloom index phytoplankton species sst so these are all the parameters that we actually analyze to give that service now coming to safety uh ocean state forecast we have this is one of again a prime service that we tell fishermen for example say where to go but then whether it is safe to go now this information we give from ocean state forecast this is again based on several models that we run it in coils wave currents so on so forth and there are specialized products for different industries for fishermen then for small vessel advisory services which is an impact-based services which tells the the the safety margin at which different sizes of vessels can operate so and then we can provide forecast along ship routes etcetera etcetera and the swell forecasts for example with the swells originating from the southern ocean um this is something which used to create a lot of flooding even now creates a lot of flooding in the uh southwest coast of the country so now these are some things which we are able to monitor now we also have buoys installed in seychelles maldives etc to be able to track these swell uh waves uh while they're traveling towards our coastline so several products on ocean state forecasting we provide we also provide information to the work with coast guards on marine search and rescue based on the current information that we that we developed from our ogcms we also provide oil spill trajectory information work closely with coast guards and navies to provide this information on so that they can actually take up mitigation measures if there is a spill they would know where this pill would go tsunami warning most of you know about it i'll not get into the details it is actually one of the very good tsunami warning centers that we have providing information not only for india but for the entire indian ocean region similarly we also our tsunami warning system is a multihazard system we can also provide information on storm surge early warnings this is something which we help imdb with so we get information on the cyclone track from the imd and then we run a storm surge model at inquiries in real time and provide information to imd so that they'll be able to provide information on storm search so this has been validated with several models so we can provide coastal inundation due to a particular cyclone what would be the surge so this information is provided operationally and 3d gis and multi-hazard assessments we have done mapping of the entire coastline of the country at a very high resolution using altm data from nrc and this data is used in conjunction with several other oceanographic data like for example the tide gauge data to come up with an atlas called the coastal vulnerability index atlas and then we've also done 3d mapping of the entire coastline of about 3600 uh square kilometer of area has been mapped in 3d uh the panel bottom right panel that you see there uh to be able to uh you know if you know that okay from a tsunami this would be the inundation now you could actually get to the level of okay how many how much of this community could be impacted or how many of these buildings could be impacted now that kind of impact based services can be provided using this database so we have done this multi-hazard vulnerability mapping at one is to 25 000 scale encores also does a lot of work in uh capacity building we have a training center called it's a category 2 center under the unesco that provides training to researchers students scientists users not only from india but from the entire indian ocean region and we use a variety of uh tools to reach the en end users like we have satellite based broadcasting system like gagan and navic because fishermen once they go out of the mobile phone coverage they'll not be able to have connectivity unless they're on satellite communication which is very expensive so for the traditional fishermen we actually came up with a device along with the isro and the airports authority of india called gagan through which we can broadcast information to them even when they are outside the nominal mobile phone coverage now coming to the last couple of slides economic benefits now so coming to the uh what are the benefits now i think the benefits of ocean observing systems or services is something which we cannot estimate with any reasonable accuracy because some of those things like how they impact the weather the climate and what the climate will do to the sea level and then how the sea level would impact the coastal areas the understanding of that we cannot put a value to it but then there are some tangible uh you know benefits that that can that we can actually put out like for example by giving pfz service uh this is a survey from ncaer which says that okay there is a certain amount of reduction in search time about 30 to 70 percent reduction in search time which means that there's a savings on fuel so they spend less time at the sea and then so their safety is enhanced because of osf or if we give up rough weather and then if they don't go to the sea and there is a life saving and then if we see that there is a there is a rough seas and then the navy could not go ahead should not go ahead with the mission that could actually result in savings like tsunami for example if we given no evacuation warning that would save several hundreds of crores of rupees which you would which we would have to otherwise spend if actually people had to evacuate duty from spawning like for example taking a small number here if for the coastal evacuation expenditure from pylon for one state it was about 3500 crores for for the odisha government and if you're able to avoid such an evacuation now doing that evacuation when there is when there is an event it saves all those lives so it doesn't really matter how much you spend but then if there is no warning and then if you give if people have evacuate unnecessarily if you're able to stop that then you save that money so these are the kind of benefits and of course there is also huge environmental benefit to these surveys like you put less diesel into the you spend less diesel you're putting in less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so these are there are several estimates that are done by several independent agencies like naip cmfri etc it says that how much less greenhouse gases you're emitting by just one pfz service like fishermen going to these locations doing fishing and then putting less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so in conclusion uh let me say that i you all would certainly agree with me that oceans are key to understanding our climate and weather they play a huge ocean observations information and advisory services they play a huge role in securing the lives and livelihoods of our communities and then we can contribute hugely to the blue economy of india which india is coming up with to meet our targets towards the sustainable development goal 14 which is a life under water and then of course the new uh initiative the ocean decade of the decade of ocean science for sustainable development which is called the ocean decade there are several challenges that we want to address as a oceanographic community as part of the ocean decade that could be pollutants ecosystems etc which are listed there as ocean decay challenges which you would like to address and then what we would like our oceans to be in the future which is actually the outcomes we should we need to have a clean ocean healthy and resilient ocean productive ocean predicted ocean safe ocean accessible ocean inspiring and engaging ocean so with that i conclude uh with the acknowledgement acknowledging my colleagues here who have actually whom i work with and who've helped me put together this brief presentation if you have any questions i'm ready to take if you don't have time there is my email address on that slide please feel free to contact us thank you very much thank you dr kumar for such a wonderful lecture uh from youtube channel i see there are no question as yet because uh you made this information very simple to understand and maybe even those who have a little understanding of science could understand this uh i would like uh professor davi sir if he has any queries uh thank you bye thank you dr shainmask for an excellent presentation it was a pleasure listening to you about all the work that's being done on oceans especially by inquires it was a fantastic presentation i have a couple of questions more out of curiosity one of them is about the deep ocean mission which you mentioned can you briefly tell us about what is the aim of it and how encouraged and other organizations are going to be kind of involved and what are the kind of results we could expect from this deep ocean mission yeah thank you professor ravi uh thanks for that question see uh under the deep ocean mission there are several components of course which actually talk about technology which is done by an iot and then there is uh you know ocean biology uh there are there are several components the biodiversity etc which are dealt with by several agencies not only within under moes but also different other ministries and departments now what i would actually uh like to uh talk a bit more about is uh what in choice is uh uh where inquiries is involved in uh and so this is basically uh how uh we we could make observations uh to to to to provide climate change advisories um for the indian ocean region mostly for the indian region uh so so we we should be able to do observations that can be that can help us you know observe the changes in the oceans over a long period of time and then also use these observations and all the other observations that we have to be able to provide these uh you know climate change advisories now as part of this what we are planning to do is actually to deploy uh the gliders which i said before the deep ocean gliders and then of course to be able to make transects and then make observations which which were not possible before uh in into the deep portions and then measure measure these all these parameters that can help us understand the oceans and the processes much better and then also deploy deep argo floats now the argo floats that we deploy currently go and go up to two kilometer depth but then the new kind of argo floats that we plan to deploy as part of this mission can go until 5000 meter water depth which is very important to actually make measurements in those deep oceans when you talk about you know variability uh you know climate variability and then how it has been impacting the deep oceans so this is something which we intend to do as an observational part and then as far as the modeling is concerned uh the we should be able to develop a suitable suitable modeling framework uh to make a projection of sea level changes uh like for example what is the overall sea level change that is that is like we have semi kind of scenarios we have iatm working on climate change whether we will be able to take this information at the regional level and then downscale it both statistically as well as dynamically uh can will be can we be able to do that modeling and then come up with the impact of this uh you know climate change uh on sea level rise and then how that sea level rise might impact the coastal areas now we have all this database that i've talked about before on the coastal regions now how can some of these this information be used to really come up with that kind of advisories so this is basically what we intend to do some of some part of it of course another thing also uh deals with you know what is the obvious the cyclone intensity going to or the frequency uh going to change in a climate change scenario or the next 50 years or 100 years now this is something which we would like to all these things we would like to work closely with you know colleagues in iitm and then you know at the end of five years hopefully we should be able to have some uh answers to these questions thank you dr shinwas i have just one more question yeah meanwhile meanwhile uh sorry for interruption dr kumarji can we have your video on please okay yeah sorry i didn't is that on now you can switch off the screen sharing and then i think yeah okay yeah or maybe that's the reason okay just one second yeah no no okay okay please uh yeah you mentioned about blue economy can you tell us what would be increases role in blue economy and studying the blue economy i mean and also what are the potential areas where they would be working on yeah so again in the blue economy there are several aspects like for example there are the priority areas in our blue economy framework it's it's a draft policy document there are seven uh priority uh areas like for example there is a national accounting framework for blue economy and ocean governance how do we really account it account for it when we mean blue economy what are the parameters in which we account for it and then there is coastal marine spatial planning and tourism that's one important activity priority area and there is marine fisheries aquaculture and fish processing and then there is a manufacturing emerging industries trade technology services and skill development that's an emerging priority area and then there is another priority area on logistics infrastructure and shipping for example and then there is also a priority area on coastal and deep sea mining and offshore energy and there is another priority area the private area seven is security strategic dimension and international engagement in fact not only encourage all our institutes under the ministry and then several other ministries they they actually can play a huge role here and like you talk about any of these sectors the priority areas i think you know being able to observe the oceans you you need to quantify or understand and then quantify the benefit or be able to you know monitor the entire thing we need to actually be able to observe the ocean and then most of these operations that we talk under blue economy they will need uh you know information about the oceans so you need to model the oceans you need to forecast the oceans so i would say you know ocean observations modeling and advisory services they'll play a key role in each of these priority areas that are being addressed as part of the deeper as part of the blue economy so most of the sectors which we are talking about in blue economy can benefit from uh will certainly benefit from ocean observations information and advisory services from inquiries and of course other institutes of the ministry that are dealing with all the other activities they they can contribute in a big way to the blue economy of the ministry i mean of the government thank you dr shimas any other questions i know i don't have any more questions okay many but i think yeah thank you so uh dr kumar you really made it very simple for us to understand uh what are the advances in ocean sciences and how ocean information services offered by inquiries are being used for societal benefits and you also helped us understand in a very simple way how important the oceans are for us they are not only important for weather and climate they are also important for sustainable development as we are also observing the united nations decade for uh of ocean sciences for sustainable development so uh we must commend dr kumar and the entire encourage team for remarkable contributions and constant striving for further advancing our understanding of the oceans and translating that knowledge into services for societal benefits we wish dr kumar and employees would contribute significantly to achieve the decadal goals of the safe ocean predicted ocean and transparent ocean making the live coastal people safer better and sustainable on behalf of the entire iatm family i thank dr kumar for sparing his valuable time and enlightening us on this very important topic thank you very much dr kumar for such a wonderful lecture and thank you professor ravi for being with us and i thought everyone who joined us on on this online session and uh but makarji and computer team for facilitating this session in a very smooth way thank you very much everyone and uh wish you all a very happy world metrological day thank you thank you very much thank

evening everyone my name is micah jarrett and i'm a transfer admissions coordinator at the university of north carolina wilmington and i'm excited to be a part of this virtual transfer college fair this evening i'm going to briefly share some information about the city of wilmington and uncw go over the application process for transfer students and highlight some exciting student opportunities after the presentation i do encourage you to take one of our virtual campus tours available on our uncw website wilmington is a town of approximately 120 000 residents situated on the un's uh southern north carolina shore and the uncw campus essentially located just a few miles from the historic downtown riverwalk and only five miles from wrestle beach as one of the 17 public institutions within the unc system in north carolina uncw is north carolina's only coastal university we are home to nearly eighteen thousand students comprising of almost fifteen thousand undergraduate students and over three thousand graduate students uncw offers 56 bachelor degrees 35 master's degrees and four doctoral programs our campus is situated on 660 acres and houses 55 different academic and student service buildings ready to serve our students some of our most popular majors for transfer students include business psychology communication studies nursing biology or marine biology education film studies and exercise science however as i mentioned before uncw offers nearly 60 bachelor degree options so there are many more to choose from if you do not see your major listed here though uncw is large enough to offer incomparable student experiences that include research and discovery opportunities we still maintain the advantages of small class sizes and low student-to-faculty ratios at uncw the average class size is 27 students and our student-to-faculty ratio of 18-1 promises students the opportunity for a personal educational experience and the ability to build valuable relationships with their professors during their undergraduate careers uncw prides itself on offering students a challenging environment to explore their passions and enhance their opportunities through applied learning the applied learning opportunities which we implement equip our students with real-world experiences and push them in extraordinary ways ensuring that our students graduate with the edge to be competitive to enter the workforce students are able to take advantage of a wide variety of experiences and we have seen that students who enhance their education by utilizing these options of applied learning are more likely to engage in their communities build their capacities to lead and increase their aspirations to serve just one example of our research and discovery opportunities i'm going to highlight our marine biology program uncw houses a center for marine science that is located just a few miles from main campus and is situated on the intercoastal waterway just steps from the ocean where students have the opportunity to engage in research in an active laboratory specifically for study abroad students can choose from over a thousand programs in over 50 different countries to ensure the broadening of their horizons challenging of stereotypes and development of higher levels of critical thinking each year uncw offers students options of thousands of various internship opportunities as an example our film studies program offers 100 local internships and students are involved in over 500 motion picture projects each year providing plenty of first-hand experience to break into a competitive field to sum it up our smaller class sizes personalized educational experiences coupled with applied learning strategies equip our students with the skills to leave our campus and pursue the next set of goals in the workforce some data to support that approximately 75 percent of our graduates advance to full-time employment while around 14 of students elect to attend graduate school full-time each year incoming class is comprised of about 49 transfer students a diverse and robust student population joining us from in-state out-of-state military and workforce backgrounds in order to be competitive for admission applicants are recommended to have at least 24 hours of college-level coursework and those of those 24 hours we recommend that six via college

hey there my name is hilda carros i'm an admissions counselor from mississippi state university mississippi state university is located in starkville mississippi so that's about two hours south of memphis and two hours west of birmingham so we are near major airports we also do have a regional airport about 30 minutes from campus so while we may be a little bit far off it's really easy to come visit mississippi state university was founded in 1878 as mississippi a m so agriculture and mechanic and we've grown tremendously since we have 22 000 bulldogs on our campus but we have a 20 to one faculty to student ratio so you really get the best of both worlds so in the classroom you're going to get that small school feel but when you step into say davis swing stadium for an sec football game you are really going to get that big school feel it is the best of both worlds like i said we are um we our foundation is an agricultural and mechanical school but we have about 200 programs for you to choose from spread across these eight academic colleges we are known for the stem specifically our engineering program it's one of the best engineering programs in the country you're going to have incredible hands-on experience and we have everything from petroleum engineering to aerospace engineering and literally everything in between and while we are known for the stem as you can see we have way more than just the stems to offer for example our college of business is home to the entrepreneur center that's ranked number six in the world for their entrepreneurial research they're helping students get businesses off the ground they're graduating students ceos who are turning a profit our college of art architecture and design is one of very few in the country that graduates licensed architects it's a five-year program college of arts and sciences is home to meteorology program where one of three meteorologists that you see on tv either train at mississippi state or got their degree from mississippi state college of education has an elementary school or a middle school excuse me on our campus so you can get experience as soon as you get there hit the ground running the day in the life of the college of forest resources looks like that they're working outdoors they're getting that experience because we have a ton of land and the president of our university dr mark keenum is a three-time graduate of the college of agriculture and life sciences he went on to work for the department of agriculture for the united states so this is a college that's going to set you up to really be successful and do a lot of different things at mississippi state what really stands out to us is the hands-on learning opportunities we are top 100 in the country for research and what research means for you is hands-on opportunities that means that you're going to learn by doing and you're going to do the thing that you came to mississippi state to do and you're gonna do it a lot what you see over here is the fourth largest supercomputer in academia this is the kind of resource that our students have um available to them we also are home to one of the nation's best cyber security program working directly with the nsa and getting that certification so that really makes our students stand out we're also a national center of excellence for the faa so our students are working with drones and unmanned aircrafts to really write the playbook for what that's going to look like in the future so really innovative research and experience and we also have the center for advanced vehicular studies that's working to produce the first all-electric autonomous suv that can even drive off-road so it's there's some really cool research happening and this is just to name a few because there are a bunch of really cool opportunities for you to come and make your mark and really build your resume and um hit the ground running it's really tough to talk about my from mississippi state without talking a little bit about the student experience we are the most diverse school in the sec representing all 50 states and 80 countries so you're going to see a little bit of everything we are in sec school so you are looking at like a big feel for athletics we love our dogs we support our dogs anywhere we're gonna pack the stadium for whatever it is that our dogs are playing we have a really awesome study abroad program they'll work with you to even create a study abroad program for you if there's not one that fits with your schedule or your budget or whatever it is transfer students also have their own transfer student association on campus as well so you can start right away and get tapped into your community and other transfer students um there's a lot of opportunities here and if you choose to live on campus there are some living and learning communities as well for transfer students so we're gonna make sure that if you transfer to mississippi state you are going to have a ton of resources to feel at home right away to become a bulldog it's super simple we are on common app coalition and we have our direct application we're going to need a 40 application fee your high school transcript your transcript from your community college and your act sat scores we have rolling admissions so no hard deadlines you can apply um and hear from us within

and virtual visits so i hope you'll check us out hill state thank you very much mississippi state um up next will be bridgewater college right hi everyone my name is emily helms and i'm the assistant director of admissions here at bridgewater and the sole transfer counselor who reviews all the applications that come in um i'll go ahead and switch slides here yeah so bridgewater is a four-year private liberal arts college here in the state of virginia we were founded in 1880 and we were the first co-educational private institution in the state of virginia so we take a lot of pride in that you can see there that we have a nice diverse class pretty evenly split between men and women we currently have about 1600 students on campus both bachelor and master degree seeking we have students that participate in over 80 different clubs and organizations those are academics social service cultural religious you name it we probably have it on campus um 30 of our students actually compete intercollegiately with our ncaa d3 sports and most of our students are from virginia but we do have students from 28 different states and 34 different countries we have four divisions on campus and

have a hundred and four hundred and forty full-time faculty members there are no grad assistants or teachers assistants in the classroom so you really get that one-on-one relationship with your professors on campus we're a very hands-on school so you're going to gain that practical application and that real world experience by taking field trips and doing practicums and a lot of travel opportunities your academic advisor that you are given is within your department and they're there to help you make sure that you're going to stay on track to graduate within the time that you're here on campus um you can see there that we have four master's programs on campus the masters of athletic training is a 3-2 program and the other three are one-year 30 credit master programs we in 2018 broke ground on a 13.2 million dollar renovation and that is the john kenny four-year learning commons this was the first project in bridgewater history to be fully funded through philanthropy and it is a academic hub on campus so you can see there we have our career services tech support tutoring and peer coaching writing center media production and research services readily available available for students right within that same building there are also two instructional rooms for class time that students can use the great room that's pictured there is used as a multifunctional space for club meetings for studying whatever students need that for we have smitty's cafe that is our panera esque food on campus and our starbucks and then we have an art gallery for local artists and for our art students to display their work on campus we like i mentioned have 23 ncaa d3 sports on campus that compete in the old dominion athletic conference and that is comprised of mostly schools in virginia we also have a highly competitive equestrian program our barn is about four miles away from campus we have 16 different school horses we have an indoor ring a heated tack room just a really great program for students of all levels that are interested in equestrian we have cheerleading we've had 11 national championships in the past two years all sporting events on campus are completely free for students to attend and you can see here are the end of our soccer field our softball baseball in our football field the students that are not interested in participating intercollegiately are more than welcome to participate in our intramurals we have over 55 of our student body participate in those over the course of the year and they're all competing for that highly coveted intramural championship t-shirt and for a chance to have their picture on our championship board as for financial aid at bridgewater we do offer merit scholarships for our students they're based on that cumulative weighted gpa from your post-secondary institutions so you can see there they range from 17 750 to 25 750 and we have one highly competitive president merits award for transfer students and that is a full tuition scholarship we also offer the out of state scholarship of about 3 500 church of the brethren members also receive a scholarship based on if they're residential or commuter students and then for students that are involved and members of phi theta kappa we also give you a three thousand dollar scholarship for that the v tag is a um state grant for virginia residents attending a virginia private college and that's roughly thirty five hundred dollars as well and then the fafsa just like every other school helps with additional aid and you can see there that 75 of our students received more than 30 thousand dollars in scholarships last year for bridgewater our application is super simple it takes about 15 minutes on our website to complete we are rolling

leo unfortunately our sixth presenter this evening was not able to join us winter university but that does leave us with a little bit of extra time so for our attendees please feel free to send through any questions you may have utilizing the q a button while we're waiting to see what questions come in from our attendees perhaps we could do a couple rounds of questions here ourselves so if i could ask all of our panelists to turn their videos back on and i would pose the following first question to you all what's one thing that you did not have time to present on that you'd like to quickly discuss now whether that's your favorite event or tradition on campus a fun fact about your school or just anything else you'd like to share so we'll go in that same order starting with randolph college thanks um hey everybody did a great job by the way i do want to say that randolph has rolling admissions and for spring semester i did have a late applicant and i uh we enrolled her the day before classes started so it's never too late at randolph thank you uh unc wilmington hey how's it going again uh so one thing uh that i didn't have time to present on or would like to share with with everyone uh that's joining us today is um some of the involvement opportunities that you uc so we are a big time transfer destination school about 49 of our incoming class every fall semester consists of transfer students so you can imagine that there's a lot of uh all walks of life there and one thing that we do to try and get everyone acclimated is a beach blast and an involvement carnival so those are two separate events that happen pretty early on in the fall semester um we take all our new students to the beach and we have a lot of fun events and things like that obviously pogba has interrupted that but we're getting back to safer times hopefully and we'll get back to the beach class and then the involvement carnival is where you get to learn about all the resources student organizations things like that on campus so lots of fun hey thank you mississippi state so we are in the sec the sec loves their tradition most southern schools do um what my favorite addition that we have is the cowbell so we are the only school that's legally allowed by the ncaa to bring in artificial noise makers to our football games so what that means is that no matter how many people you bring to a game you are never going to be louder than 80 000 cowbells ringing out once it's a lot of fun it sounds obnoxious but i promise it's not it's a little obnoxious but like it's a lot of fun um and your first cowbell has to be a gift so that's one of our favorite traditions and i wanted to share that with you guys great thank you bridgewater so one of our favorite events that we have on campus is we have live action battleship so we actually borrow canoes from another local school and we have teams of four that get in those canoes in our pool and try and sink the other team it is the most highly attended event on campus we had over 35 teams participate last year um and we had over 300 spectators of our 1600 on campus so pretty awesome event all right thank you san leo um i guess one thing i could have elaborated more on with our size it's really unique because like i mentioned um even though we have that small classroom size only about 14 to one faculty student ratio being having over 20 000 students worldwide it really opens up more opportunities to give you students more amenities and resources as well so you have a small school atmosphere on campus in class but also the resources for a larger institution so it's kind of cool all right thank you so the other question i would pose is answer one of the following two questions what's one piece of advice you have for transfer students going through the college search process or what's a frequently asked question that you receive from students that you'd like to quickly address now so go back in that same order starting with randolph i would encourage all even first-year students but transfer students you need to visit so you need to go visit everywhere you think you might want to go and if you ever had a dream of being astronaut you need to go visit a school like that um you need to go see these places and and find the place that speaks to you just just as you did um you know when you were first year um and ask questions don't be afraid there's no stupid questions admission counselors like to answer your questions we love to talk to you so reach out hey thank you uh unc wilmington yeah i actually would reiterate uh that very same uh you know message to the students is do your research visit when you can ask the questions when you can if it's a particular program or a career field that you're wanting to join do the research and look into those schools and see what the differences are in the programs not every program is going to be the exact same with every single school there's going to be different opportunities resources available so do your research for that and then another thing that i just want to add on and i'm sure everyone else would agree with is number one question is always how does your credit transfer into that new school and making sure that you're not going to lose much ground on what you've already accomplished and so us at uncw we have a resource on our website if you wanted to go to our website in the search bar you can search for our transfer articulation tool and that will show you how your previous completed uh credit will transfer to usw great thank you mississippi state my advice is to ask questions i think all of us are in this profession because we love our schools we love helping students and we want to guide you through the journey so ask us questions really dig deep know what you're looking for you cannot ask us something that's going to throw us off because we've heard everything so we're here as a resource and please use it thank you bridgewater being a smaller school i always encourage all of my students to ask to meet with professors ask to meet with financial aid and really get all of their questions answered because there's no better way of figuring out if the school is right for you then once you're on campus and in that environment so i always start off everything saying picture yourself on campus right now and over the course of your time here today like see if you can see yourself sitting in here so definitely make sure that you do that when you're visiting all schools of any size great thank you and saint leo um i always like to say just keep an open mind if you asked myself a senior in high school back in the day in new jersey if i would go to school in florida i would have said there's no way and then yet here i am today still in florida um so just keep an open mind when it comes to visiting your schools you never know just visiting the school it might surprise you so just keep an open mind throughout the process yes definitely all very good advice thank you before we wrap up does anybody have any last comments that popped into their head as others were speaking i open the floor to you if you do have any last comment you'd like to make okay fair enough um thank you to all of our presenters this evening for your very informative overviews of your schools and your insight into the college search process um thank you definitely to all of our attendees for joining us just a few quick housekeeping items before we end the session when you close your window you will receive a very quick four question survey that we ask that you take a minute and complete and also there is one other block of sessions this evening so please feel free to sign up for those at the same website where you signed up for this session and about one week from today recording the session will also be available on that registration website but thank you again and good luck in your college search have a great night you", "F8Xa4PQ53Ho": "[Music] good evening thanks for joining us happy st patrick's day this is ntd business and i'm paul grainey more of the same from jerome powell at the fed but it looks like he'll let treasury rates rise and powell also announcing interest rates to remain low until at least 2023 so how can your retirement fund manager preserve your savings and morgan stanley will start giving its clients access to bitcoin it's the first big u.s bank to do so but not everyone qualifies that and much more coming up an entity business [Music] a new bank of america survey says investors are now more worried about inflation than the ccp virus thirty seven percent of global fund managers say higher than expected inflation is the biggest tail risk for investors close second with 35 percent is so-called taper tantrums this is a sharp sell-off in the bond market driven by fears that faster economic growth will drive inflation even higher leading the federal reserve to raise interest rates virus fears drop from top spot in march down to third place in february with fewer than 15 percent of fund managers saying that this is the biggest risk what a difference a year makes the rise of inflation fears come as wall street looks beyond the pandemic it's now shifting its focus to the impact of that tidal wave of stimulus the unleashing of pent-up demand as the economy recovers but fed chairman jerome powell isn't worried about inflation he announced today that the federal reserve will keep its fed funds rate at near record low levels until at least 2023 keep the printing presses running good news for the government they can keep borrowing money cheap money and good news for the stock market rallied on the news but bad news for your savings they're being inflated away but powell didn't address rising treasury yields something the fed has less control over higher treasury yields make mortgages and other loans more expensive and in the fed's eyes that could slow down the economic recovery so we were all waiting to hear if the fed would step in and buy more treasuries keep the rate down powell didn't mention it so as to fx street senior analyst joseph trevasani how the markets reacted overall i think the markets took it pretty well what we've seen over the past three months has been increasing in u.s treasury rates at the farther end of the curve we've seen a steepening of the curve that happens in a situation where the economy is expected to get better and in fact the economy is getting better so that much hasn't changed mr powell said that that the the dot plot and the projections which of course the fed does not consider projections or forecasts shows a range of approaches to this they're not projections they're not forecasts and they still show that the fed funds rate will remain unchanged through the end of 2023 well the equity response to that of course was very pleasant equities went up currencies took it as a bit of a negative the dollar came off a little bit but the specific fact of the which i think is the most important fact of the economy right now is that the steep in the year curl does not seem that the fed is going to block it which the fed could do it could chairman powell could say something about it or they could actually go into the market to put more pressure on the farther reaches of the curb they're not doing that so i think that tells you that the fed is pretty confident that the u.s economy can stand higher commercial rates which key on the 10-year and other rates at the farther end of the curve how about all these worries that we heard in the last few weeks of oh if the if the treasury yield increases by another 50 basis points or 100 basis points then we're going to see a big sell-off there's going to be mass chaos in the streets you think is this still legitimate or well i think markets love to speculate about things that are going to happen and but people are not going to do that let's put it this way if treasury rates rise another 50 points the reason they're rising is because the u.s economy is strong the treasury market is keying on u.s statistics on what we're seeing actually come out of the economy so it would actually be a reflection rather than a cause for concern and if the u.s economy is strengthening and it's hard to see why the equities would sell off from a mere half point rise in say the 10-year if you look at the 10-year historically it's been much higher than this for many long periods of time very recently not going back to the days of paul volcker so i don't think that's a realistic concern you emailed something out recently can the real american consumer please stand up something like this we look at the recovery okay but if we if we compare the kind of stimulus boosted retail sales in january to the really lax ones in february and i think looking at march it's even worse again so in order to keep how much of this recovery is real and how much is artificially stimulated i think the january you know i take a double view of this one because if you look at the size of the increase in retail sales just using that as a parameter in january it can't be just a six hundred dollar stipend sent out to a number to many families and it was much more than that so i think that you will get that type of response throughout the year because we are you think of it as a mini roaring 20s the kind of echo the kind of emotional translating into economic release that happened after the end of the first world war i'm not making a comparison here but it's the same type of change in outlook and i think that will be reflected so although it seems that it's very much supported and even sponsored by these simple and short-term stimulus payments i think it will continue through so many things that people have done as part of their normal lives have been either short-circuited curtailed or simply haven't taken place over the past year and some of those things will take more time to recover but i think we're covered they will if we continue along the path that we are right now and i think that consumption boost continuing through the year is a lot of what equities and growth is being based on a lot to look forward to then joseph really appreciate it thank you so much thanks a lot so it's been exactly a year since the fed cut rates to near zero wants to make money cheap so governments and others can spend it spur the economy it's the idea but easy money devalues the money that you worked hard to get that's what retirement fund managers are worried about how do they observe your savings while the fed runs the printing presses entities conn fredrickson reports with regard to interest rates we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current zero to one quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate the federal reserve says keeping interest rates low will spur economic activity but what are the long-term consequences for your retirement savings does it make things harder for your financial advisor it's very difficult bonds are traditionally a low-risk way for fund managers to invest your money and hedge against stock market risk but well with rates so low i mean historically low and by historic we're talking about three you know since the birth of the united states in the 1700s there's very little cash flow that they spit out so fund managers like ria need to invest more in things like strong companies with dividends or other fixed income funds but this is much riskier than investing in bonds fund managers who do have pension plans and have to get a certain rate of return that's a high hurdle but if they're invested in the stock market which they're continuing to do they're making it they're making it since the fed cut rates last march that's true but stock market valuations are now at historic highs so many are asking if it's a bubble that could burst there's also the threat of inflation the fed and the government have printed trillions of new dollars in the past year devaluing your savings so your fund manager needs to somehow ensure your dollars maintain their purchasing power until you retire inflation is going to rear its ugly head um and once it does that it's going to start to spiral out of control it's going to start quickly it's going to jump in it's going to jump and it's going to jump again the fed chairman says he's not worried about inflation and is encouraging the government to print and spend more colin frederickson ntd news and even though the fed wants to keep rates low mortgage rates are rising anyway probably down to inflation fears this is cutting into mortgage demand applications fell over two percent last week from the week before refinance applications even fell as well they're nearly 40 percent lower than they were a year ago the 30-year mortgage rate is now at its highest level since june 2020. despite the rise it is still near record lows home construction also fell february construction was down 10 percent could be because of severe weather supply

to stay in business one uk-based platform says it's seen a huge increase in donations over the past year anthony's ellen lee reports faced with a ccp virus outbreak and a dispute with their landlord the india club restaurant in london saw its future threatened so it launched an online crowdfunding campaign in january so far it's raised over forty five thousand pounds or sixty two thousand dollars it's really shown i think human kindness in these really tough times because it's a difficult time for everyone she saw donations not only from old-time customers but even from people in australia who had never visited the restaurant but were moved by the story it was set up in the 50s and it's always meant to be a place of friendship between india and britain so it's so much more than just a restaurant and a bar so we really do feel a responsibility to carry it on for future generations and they're not the only ones the lamp pop in north london also turned to crowdfunding a successful campaign brought the pub which is over 140 years old back from the brink it raised nearly 25 000 pounds or 35 000 we knew there'd be life to the end of the tunnel eventually and to be unable to

las vegas great they said we're going to be here bringing you coverage here Monday Tuesday was it this way I was to minimum I'm John wall's we're joined now by Mike field it was the interim CTO baystate health Mike thanks for being with us you're on the cube we appreciate your time my pleasure let's set the table here about Bay State western Massachusetts based health care provider but a lot of hats you're wearing as interim CTO teaching hospital community hospital home care hospice care of 12,000 folks working in your organization political associates are you juggling all that today in the IT world uh difficulty but actually it's actually not that bad it's it's a pretty straightforward job love it it's just new stuff all the time I'm learning all the time I'm working it's just I'm having a great time we've talked a lot this week and hurt a lot this week but the digital transformation how very real that is and moving on to the digital economy if you will very important in your space in terms of patient care patient information patient data from a 30,000 foot level what concerns do you have in terms of that record protection and then that information is being sent about various diagnosis that you have to be concerned about sure well first of all we have to maintain up time I mean at the end of the day our doctors or clinical staff have to have access to all the tools all the systems all the time so we simply have to have everything operational all the time and in today's budgetary constraints a gar institution like many others is going through a lot of budgetary issues so that's the mate that what keeps me up other than security which is all another issue is how do i maintain the quality of RIT which is the foundation of much of the systems that patients will rely on that's it that's that's one of my major focuses Mike can you sketch out for us just kind of the scope of the responsibilities that you have how many locations number of kind of patients are employees however you measure the resin well thousand employees we had a little well over a million patients in our area where you know about three really for hospitals we have an insurance company we have a reference laboratory we have a life sciences vertically integrated health system teaching hospitals you my responsibilities are to help chart the technology direction of the institution as a whole with certain specific mandates one I have to increase up time I have to increase efficiency I have to work within essentially declining budgets I have to integrate new technologies all of the above all right so talk to us a little bit about what you've been doing the last couple of years from a technology standpoint I think most our audience will you know hear what you said about the challenges and it's like yeah that's it declining budgets flat to down on you know a head count more things coming in and you know some of them understand the governance and compliance things that you also need to deal with and I live in Massachusetts I hear all the things going on in health care there well technologically I would say the centerpieces hybrid convergence to us there really is no other way to control costs increase performance increase operations everything and that's been the major focus at the most fundamental level of our infrastructure we began about two years ago what we call infrastructure 20 which was essentially the replacement of all of our traditional storage compute and networking elements all based on VMware's NSX ESX and vm v san products we are now actually in production and we've seen phenomenal results from this all right so Mike tell us what was that replacing and this wasn't a project deployment you were trying to kind of sweep the floor the more well actually it's a good question you really can't it's interesting we come at this two ways one way is to say that there's an event like you put in Cerner epic and that's a natural point where you can as you say sweep the floor we didn't really have that as a case what we had was our normal budgets which by the way all of this work on mentioned was done within the existing budgets we didn't really require new dollars to this but what we had to do knowing the new systems coming on the new imaging platforms all of these things required that we build our new platforms to take care of those things at current or less dollars so we started with initial deployment very small side by side our typical infrastructure looked like any other hospital we add for example emc storage arrays IBM storage arrays we had a mainframe we had AIX equipment Lynn every plete salad bar approach to IT basically and then we began a active active active network three separate sites on which which combined storage networking and compute and have been increasing that while decreasing the other stuff and migrating to it it's an ongoing process alright seven sorry yeah um so two years ago virtual San was a relatively young product and paired to it where it is today it's at a huge growth especially the last 12 months so what led you to that and you know it sounds a little risky you know going out there you know I mean vmware's trusted sounds like you've used them for a while but you know why were you willing to be kind of an early adopter of that technology well if you want to make a significant change you're going to have to take some risks and typically healthcare is somewhat risk-averse but basically it's kind of blessed our CIO a gentleman named Joel venko is is very forward-looking and realize that to make these changes we had to make some very serious bets on technology VMware we're familiar with VMware everybody uses it it's a solid company prior to my work at baystate I've worked in other as a CTO and other relationships and other hospitals and VMware once again over there was well known so we knew that visa had potential we also knew to your point it was a new product so when we started this project we didn't have we didn't plan to migrate any of our very significant loads to it until the product progressed in its life cycle we were intimately in communication with VMware about what their plans fer and when those features would come on and we mapped our project to that so you talked about results oh yes get into this a little more specifically but the before and after what are your metrics your key metrics sir and how much did you improve on for well I guess one of the simplest things and most obvious is just cost of storage when we look at the true cost of storage and our old model which are the big sands the fibre channel arrays all the special people to do that all the special software and what we have now combined everything really under d-san our storage costs are about thirty to fifty percent less on any unit measurement like an eye out basis on a capacity basis and so on another enormous benefit was that we had like a lot of haas those silos we had the little storage guys here the networking guys here the compute guys there each one of those groups was understaffed highly stressed when we put in a hyper converged platform B San and a sex really being the glue of it they all start to learn each other's roles so the net result was we had a larger pool of people to learn communal skills on call pagers were neat is it much we have a larger pool of people to handle things in addition as they got better and better at it they slimmed the need of like real-time attention I they could kind of work on other projects so we had a backlog of many other things that the IT department simply couldn't get to because of keeping lights on this technology allows me to not only have everything cost less but I can deploy my resources outside of just keeping the lights on so the big benefit there's like an automation efficiency that all the sudden you're offloading people from having their eyes up here and they could be up here and doing things yeah absolutely like can you walk us through some of those operational issues there there's kind of an inherent fear sometimes if you know I'm own this domain this guy hand over the here I have our swim lanes we understand the back and forth you put us all in a pool it might be easier to kind of cut sounds like everybody's got more than enough work to keep them busy so it can help to help walks through some of those too well first of all I want to step out and say that when we propose this your point the fear right up front it's natural food will say oh my god this is a technology that could I could be replaced you know if I don't measure up i'll be out that just didn't happen most people really want to learn the problem is they don't have an option there's no there's no space within the organization organizations daily operations for which to learn something new so after initial fear and kind of trust me you know you're not going to get thrown out of here and they began to see the interaction they were involved with VMware at an engineering level we brought van where teams in along with my company's I said I'm a contract employee and we created a training regimen where we pushed the stores and networking the PC guys all into the same group they work through the actual design itself we didn't envy him or didn't just simply present the design it was a requirement that our staff actually be part of the design process so they learned this thing once that once that began no fear everybody jumped in all right so Mike you've lived through a lot of the maturity the last two years can you tell us you know what was it that was in the product when you said okay it can go in production and what things are you still asking VMware for to kind of you know bring it even further sure the the initial one of these we always wanted was the ability to put outside elements into the vsat environment for storage out so compute nodes that are completely outside the infrastructure need to be able to see the stores that's something that we know is coming once V sin was deployable in a three node architecture and that's what we are we are three separate almost exact copies with dark fiber between them so we can lose almost any conceivable combination of systems and still stay up we needed that capability VMware worked directly with us to give us essentially a pass as soon as their products were able to do it even if it wasn't generally stated we were willing to do that so that was number one number two your question about what we want them to do a couple of things they're all flash system represents right now some pricing elements where we're looking for we have a lot of customers on V San that have spinning disk and flash to take advantage of some of the new things like erase your coding certain compression they this all flash issue represents a potential capital increase that's something that we need to work out with vmware and vmware is aware of it one of the issues is encryption we're expecting encryption to be available that's something we know that VM is working basically most of our designs are in there and our requests are in their life cycle so we're confident they're going to get to it are there areas and is almost a loaded question its inherent in your business that there are areas that you need to be super sensitive about talk about imaging for example sir so what are those that create for you you think distinctively interesting challenges than others in your position well imaging it to us imaging means growth the real ish the real issue of imaging and related parts of it is the fact that it's an explosive growth on the growth in the quad the quantity of storage hospitals like Bay State are constantly exploring new forms of what we call modalities x-ray machines things like that and these devices have ever more complex requirements we really can't easily predict where storage go so I need a method where I have linear costs to storage right now and like the traditional model with let's say vm emc stuff i have a case certain number of drives in a case and i go to number of case two then i have to add an engine and so on and there's a stair-step cost i reach some maximum number and then i have to do the whole thing all over again what makes v san essential to us and it is a major issue in capacity is that that's a linear curve i simply buy more simple nodes i keep throwing node after node after node into the system allows me to if not predict where my storage is going in terms of quantity I know where my costs will go because I can I can manage that so so that's that's what keeps me up that's from us from this particular products point of view the security is another issue which as I said we know that VMware will be introducing all right so Mike with the benefit of hindsight if you talking to your peers what would you tell them kind of about virtual virtual San in general hyper converged you know overall you know that they might learn from what you've gone through well it's definitely worth it it's a little scary I think times on my side though I mean the vendors like VMware Cisco all of them are pushing towards this direction what I would say that would be very very careful about how you deploy in testing what we found is hyper convergence requires so many intricate parts working together that as versions change as vmware makes a new version of v san and cisco makes a new version of a word for example cisco shop of a ucs product and then nsx has another version these versions need to be tested very very very carefully if you don't you could have verte you out intended consequences one of the not weak points but one of the results of a highly compressed hyper converged architecture is that an error goes everywhere all at once it's not isolated to a corner somewhere so you would bet or test carefully teaching people to properly test model things is essential I would argue that that if you're not willing to do that be careful o sage advice from a man who has been there and done that and is doing that in health care Mike field thanks for being with my pleasure guys the cube continues here from vmworld and just a moment", "bpAi70WWBlw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] let me ask you something what if seattle is dying and we don't even know it this story is about a seething simmering anger that is now boiling over into outrage it is about people who have felt compassion yes but who no longer feel safe no longer feel like they are heard no longer feel protected it is about lost souls who wander our streets untethered to home or family or reality chasing a drug which in turn chases them it is about the damage they inflict on themselves to be sure but also on the fabric of this place where we live this story is about a beautiful jewel that has been violated and a crisis of faith amongst a generation of seattleites falling out of love with their home there is another part of this story too it's about a solution an idea for a city that has run out of them and i ask again what if seattle is dying and we don't even know it i drive my uh 12 year old's carpool through yesler when we do carpool and it's a good talking point about you know what they're seeing what we can do to help you know how we can make a difference and honestly at this point i don't have a good answer for how we can make a difference the last five to ten years it's not the place that i grew up in and it's been really sad matt campbell lives and works in seattle he's raising a family and like many others he's mad it's uh it's gotten to a point where i'm embarrassed of it i i don't want to have my friends and family come here anymore people didn't used to use the word embarrassing about seattle but if you listen closely you'll hear it a lot now you know it's embarrassing this is this is one of the most beautiful regions in the entire world and right now with lack of a better word it looks like and it's embarrassing [Music] this is merdot derek shande he runs an upholstery shop in ballard near the burke gilman trail see if you can't feel his frustration this is just this this is just a bunch of this is not right out his window he looks at this oh they're here with me yes i'm a human being too customers coming to his shop see the same thing i have known cops from compton watts south central they have some power in their hand here you see a bunch of twinkle toes running around here what the heck because they're on the city like that they're having problems they're having problems they're not having enough authority there were fires set outside his shop this past summer and mr derek shande does not blame police he believes their power has been stripped away the city mayor doesn't give the cops authority that's the problem we need somebody with some weights and tell them it's not legal living on the sidewalk it's city ordinance it's not legal living here why can't we enforce the law [Music] last may 2nd at a town hall meeting in ballard simmering anger boiled over into all-out rage so why do we see so many people living outdoors will you manage these camps and will you enforce the law there has evolved a profound disconnect and rarely has it been more vividly laid out than in this exchange if property crime is committed violence is committed you need to call 911 you've lost all credibility when you say you said two words you said call 911. do you understand that the police have told us to vote you all out so that they can do their jobs and you're telling us call 9-1-1 you're smiling you think it's funny you think it's funny the way we're living the way we're living in beautiful seattle people are angry furious about the way we are living let's look for a moment at property crimes for the 20 biggest cities in the country new york city in 2017 had 1448 property crimes per 100 000 residents los angeles was just over 2500 chicago 3263 and look at seattle 5258 the only major city with the worst number is san francisco which is dealing with the same problems for the same reasons that we are they top the 6 000 mark it's not your imagination the crime here the burglaries the theft the stealing of cars is worse than in other big cities and in most cases it's way worse [Music] and then you walk down the street and you see a wretched soul like this consumed by demons maybe madness maybe drugs maybe both this is what suffering looks like this is pain ranting and raving screaming silently coming completely unraveled before our eyes and then tomorrow he'll wake up and relive the nightmare all over again starving eating trash from a garbage can look at the people walk by of course they're not shocked how could they be they see it every day how can this be who we are how can this be what we allow how did the word compassion get twisted into this sickening reality the puget sound business journal estimates that seattle and its outlying areas spend one billion dollars addressing and responding to the homeless situation every year and they say that number is almost certainly underestimated non-profits city and county budgets police calls to homeless camps hospital services building tiny houses drug treatment and outreach picking up needles clearing out camps garbage details chain link fencing and the more money we throw at the problem the worse it gets but of course what is happening in king county and on the streets of seattle isn't about dollars it's about human lives how can this be the right thing to do how can watching human beings live and die in filth and degradation and madness be right the cost isn't a billion dollars a year the cost is quality of life the cost is people not wanting to take their families downtown anymore families not feeling safe in their own neighborhoods the cost is people no longer feeling like they are her no longer feeling protected the cost is people dying in the streets and the rest of us getting used to seeing it numb to the suffering the cost is incalculable how did we get to this point [Music] this is a list of familiar faces repeat offenders people who break the laws get caught get released and break the laws again and again and again there are a hundred names on the list scott lindsey is the man who dived into public records and researched the list take somebody into the jail don't give him meaningful help and then put them right back out on the streets we know they're going to commit the same crimes in the same places and our public records our criminal justice records really show that that's exactly what's happening look at the sheer volume of criminal cases calvin a 68 criminal cases since 2002 repeated random assaults on random individuals draynon b 54 criminal cases since 2016. michelle c 72 cases since 2000 and the list goes on and on seattle's mayor says this it is wrong to conflate homelessness with a rise in crime for at least 100 people it would at the very least appear to be a factor of the 100 that you looked at what percentage of them were homeless yeah from our criminal justice records 100 percent had indicators that they were currently homeless and what percent showed signs of addiction yeah 100 also showed signs of a substance use disorder and what percent uh were mentally ill yeah a little less than half had been evaluated by the courts formally for mental health conditions serious severe mental health conditions on average the people on the list had 36 criminal cases each in the state of washington and seven jail bookings in the last year what this report also shows is that the police are working hard they're making contacts they're making arrests for criminal behaviors of again the same people in the same places over and over and over what i think we need to focus on is what is our criminal justice system doing to support those police officers the 100 names had between them more than 3600 criminal cases for the most part few have done serious time they are out in our communities walking our streets the drain on the system the drain on resources and manpower is incalculable the fact that this system could go on with in effect 100 failure rate for so long without anybody raising questions without city council hosting hearings without any action being taken is something that it's hard for me to explain [Music] richard padden is 55 years old born and raised in seattle he works for the county he looks around at seattle's post-apocalyptic landscape and is amazed but this is this border's not insane i mean we're allowing ourselves to participate in an insane practice that that is affording people it's heartbreaking it's heartbreaking richard started a facebook page called seattle looks like [ __ ] it's not meant to be funny it's meant to be sad pictures speak for themselves uh i started grabbing a few photographs in the area posting those and and the the name of the site as i drive around look i just say to myself seattle looks like we're fed up with it i was fed up with that's why i started the page day after day one after another the pictures on the page from every corner of the emerald city paint a picture of rots and filth that is being allowed to fester on the streets and in the lots and under the overpasses of a once proud city [Music] it looks like a third world it looks you know junkyardish i'm not heartless but i don't see i don't see that what we're doing now is helping anybody and it hasn't gotten better [Music] seattle police are afraid to speak out for two years we've tried to get cops to talk about what they see every day about what's really happening on the streets and behind the scenes more than once the word terrified was used cops are terrified of losing their jobs and pensions terrified of retaliation and so we put out some generic questionnaires which were filled out by completely anonymous police officers their responses are eye-opening frightening and at times sad one officer wrote simply yes i am frustrated because i'm a law enforcement officer that is told not to enforce the law another wrote it's simple start keeping criminals in jail judges need to stop giving them ridiculously low sentences and prosecutors need to stop accepting cheesy plea deals and actually lock people up when they commit a crime that's all it would take to drastically lower seattle's crime rate another officer said people come here because it's called freedom and they believe if they come here they will get free food free medical treatment free mental health treatment a free tent free clothes and will be free of prosecution for just about everything and they're right it didn't used to be that way law enforcement officers used to be able to enforce the laws this officer continues in the last five years there has been a culture shift and it started with the legislature decriminalizing felonies and dumping convicts onto the streets and then there is this an officer says even if quality warrant arrests are made the judicial system sees fit to let them out of jail within a couple of days often the next day why are we risking our lives to take felony level fugitives into custody if they're just going to be released prosecutors office and judges alike seem to be drinking all the kool-aid causing a huge disconnect and a broken system with absolutely no teeth that is travis bergie stretching out before we interviewed him he came from reno four years ago he's a musician a big personality and he has problems you're a user right um what's your drug of choice um i use methamphetamines yeah and i try to at least use it once a day but i i don't really consider myself a drug abuser the [ __ ] is amazing you like the man i love it remember that list of familiar faces travis is on it 34 criminal cases in four years things like assault attempted rape trespassing you're on a list you know nice there's a list of the 100 they came out with the hunt 100 frequent flyers friendly faces everything of all the entire which one am i which number on the list yeah oh you're up there nice you're up there i was just saying like i've definitely been the most in seattle darren t travis put the bike down travis this is body cam footage of an incident on first and pike a little more than a year ago travis what's up what's up hey come on travis travis hey travis put the bike down it started with property destruction and escalated into assaulting police officers a bunch of cops were deployed stand up so we can get out of here fergie spit on them [ __ ] them hey no biting don't bite yourself either stand up travis we're going to the gurney here's the girl it lasted hours well i'm actually not even high right now travis is outrageously unapologetic about his life and his world he could care less about yours do you steal for your habit i actually just started stealing last monday i started stealing and um oh my god dude that was one of the hardest sacrifices is to like do unrighteous things in front of my dudes travis just relax travis do you want to smoke travis you want a smoke or a candy bar but um will you continue to do that oh i'm having a blast now it is so much fun what should the system do with a guy like you um i think that this system has has done uh what any viable um legitimate system would and they've really like exalted me uh and like shown uh deference and and and like i don't feel like i'll ever be arrested again i haven't been in jail for like a year and three months or so you know so a change like that responding to a big change definitely shows that uh i have conquered the criminal justice system want to know the sad part the truly frustrating part he's probably right [Music] there was a police officer named todd wiebke he prided himself on getting his boots dirty on meeting the people on the fringes in the camps he tried to find common ground as human beings and he tried to police he wrote a blog for a long time first person musings about patrolling what happens in the dark shadows of west seattle not long ago he wrote this this week i dealt with crisis with narcotics with heartache and with liars sometimes all at once sometimes one at a time i am helpless to unlock the doors when dealing with a person trapped in a horror inside of their own mind lord i try but i am a limited man with just a little skill i still love coming to work we have an awesome city with the ability to adapt and overcome the only way to lose is to not try we are trying to solve this crisis and we will not lose and then one day this past october todd wiebke was told by one superior to impound an rv and clean up the spot and when he did it another superior scolded him for doing so because of new protocol he had a belly full and he walked into hr and he quit retired just like that i feel like i abandoned the ship that i walked away that and and i did because i couldn't do it anymore it was just the bureaucracy built up to the point where i felt like i was no longer necessary as a police officer that the system had a different idea of how they wanted to handle it and i was an appendix i needed to be gone so i'm gone ask anyone they'll tell you this was a good cop the kind we want out there the kind we need but i will tell you that there is no morale there's a love for the job he says the drugs the camps the theft the rot and the disgrace of it all don't have to destroy seattle they're being allowed to everybody's trying to do the right thing is just coming out wrong listen to these next words carefully let them sink in you know i've said it before and i'll say it again that the only thing i can equate it to is we're running a concentration camp without barbed wire up to and including the medical experiment of poisoning these people with drugs i i don't know how else to put it and it's infuriating every camp i walk into there was a weapon multiple weapons i found modified weapons i was constantly on the side of the road talking to people that were swinging machetes holding an axe armed with knives our city has even gone so far as to say well this much of of of narcotics on your persons okay three grams yeah hey that's okay um so that's user quantity so you know when you start you know that process and people feel secure and okay having their drugs on them what's to stop them from doing it how do you now you're pretty much okaying narcotics and the same officers that used to go out there and arrest them are now rendered impotent and can't do anything about it and it's just a matter of political will on the part of our city to go out there and say hey you can't park your motorhome in this driveway with no engine in it with all this filth around it you can't do it it's wrong and stop them i gotta say man this is really nice i am in heaven he's in hobart now he bought a horse ranch and shares it with his family and these friends so this is griff here the white guy all right they're a little nervous of the camera so horses are amazing they they are 900-pound chickens and before we left this good cop who is now an ex-cop there was one more question for him and if you live in the city that todd wiebke used to patrol if the people you love and take care of are here with you trying to live a good life then his answer should send shivers down your spine let me ask you this knowing what you know having seen what you've seen if you had a young family would you raise them in seattle right now absolutely not not even no [Music] no there is a cemetery in seattle a jewish cemetery campers and rvs parked next to it and stay this man r.e hoffman this shouldn't be happening in civilized society says the cemetery has been violated repeatedly prostitutes were working the woods drug addicts were working the woods our groundskeepers come in on monday morning and they find everything from a weekend of fun which is needles in the ground crystal meth on the tombstones other drugs garbage they leave their garbage outside they see feces on the tombstones that's left over from whatever happened the night before by the way the name of the cemetery is beaker haleem it means helping those who are sick you're mad aren't you i'm furious i'm beyond furious this has pushed me to a whole new limit let's get the sandbags off this one and we're going to pull the whole thing forward ari has a company that sets up bouncy houses at concerts and festivals he says it's not just the jewish cemetery that's being desecrated it's everywhere and i used to say this place is great because the streets are so clean it's so beautiful you walk down the streets now they smell like urine the cemeteries are being desecrated people can't go to parks with their kids because there's needles everywhere my office bullets come flying through the windows at us it's out of control it's non-stop and this we we deserve better and it's all preventable it's all avoidable it's all fixable it didn't have to get like this i wish i had faith in my government but after two meetings with council members and nothing's changed i don't really expect anything to change we're gonna have to do this ourselves thanks for coming down guys yeah absolutely appreciate it a couple of months after that interview was done ari hoffman who was thrust into the spotlight because he voiced his outrage who had no political aspirations of any kind and who was urged by friends and frustrated citizens decided to run for city council and he has no future political aspirations beyond the council the other day he said i want to fix seattle and then go back to work [Music] a report received is when police file a report of a case requesting that the city attorney's office file charges on behalf of the city back in 2006 for every 100 reports received 25 of them didn't get filed how times have changed in 2016 the latest data we have for every 100 police reports 46 of them almost twice as many didn't get filed nothing happened at all they were completely ignored of the remaining 54 of the original 100 one-third of them were then outright dismissed thrown out another third were listed as other with no resolution so only 18 of the original 100 reports filed by police actually result in convictions 18 and of those 18 convictions after plea deals and lenient sentences very few cases end up with anyone really being held accountable those are 2016 numbers we have no reason to believe the trends haven't continued since then [Music] the real homeless you don't see out-of-work truckers or construction workers who've run into bad luck don't live like this in tents on mud patches this is something different this is drugs heroin meth citizens know it can we at least acknowledge the elephant in the room that this is also a drug problem i've only heard it being mentioned as a housing problem this is a drug problem the quote unquote homeless know it too i have not met anyone else on the street who's not in some phase of addiction i mean of use of serious use and i think that that's the starting point you just have to address that you have to figure that out so i want to make sure i got that correct i would say 100 of the people that i have met out here are in some level of addiction a hundred percent yeah every single person every single person i've met out here but listen closely we constantly refer to it as a homeless crisis not a drug crisis the fractured siloed approach of homelessness in our region to help combat the homelessness epidemic crisis we have a crisis around housing and homelessness if we won't even name the thing that is destroying seattle what hope do we have of fixing [Music] it matt markovich is a reporter for como he's out in the camps amongst the homeless and the addicted almost every day yeah that's the woman that i've been talking with right over there she's uh running they're trying to make this a park and she's leading the spearhead effort that woman who lives right there is that right what will it take for you to get off the street matt is responsible for como's project seattle stories his is a unique perspective a frequent witness to the underbelly of the emerald city with the eye of a reporter it's a miserable life it really is you have no place to go the bathroom fires are prohibited most places your biggest thing is theft everybody complains about theft there's no safe spot here at all he's seen it all the rats the human waste the cold the torment you wouldn't wish this life on your worst enemy no right no but it's remarkable that people are choosing this even though you hear the statistics from the city that oh people don't want to do this that they're it's miserable there's a compassion for people the people you see and i see in camps many of them are choosing to stay this way because of all the drug habits they have or that's all driven by the drugs drugs drives drives everything we see here right i would pretty much say that uh substance abuse heroin meth even marijuana to some extent is the driving factor why they stay out here you you've sat down with the city attorney you've asked him about repeat offenders who get arrested 60 70 times the thrown back on the streets what does he say you can't um you you you can't arrest your way out of this problem that's a firm belief for his why is the question should we hammer him now when the entire criminal record that you're citing is proof that what we've been doing hasn't worked do you ever hear about actual meaningful intervention taking place i really haven't i can't say one case i've been covering for the last year and a half that i know of somebody who's gotten treatment and has gotten off the streets police say that on july 20th of 2017 this man louis arby iii 41 years old removed the screen from a woman's window at an assisted living facility in seatac and crawled in the woman inside was brutalized for an hour she was raped and beaten and choked and robbed police say louis arby also urinated on the floor afterwards police say he left through the same window he'd entered through the victim was treated for bleeding on the brain a broken nose and other injuries she was 71 years old it was a shocking and disturbing crime but perhaps we shouldn't have been all that surprised just four days before the rape just 96 hours before police say he scarred one woman's life forever louis arby iii was arrested here sitting next to the fountain right outside the king county courthouse police say he was selling methamphetamine that's him in the back of the squad car after the arrest he was booked and then released almost immediately our criminal justice system decided that he shouldn't spend even 24 hours in jail but even a brief look at his record would have shown that louis arby had come from california where he'd spent 19 years in prison for kidnapping robbery and carjacking and had prosecutors looked a little more closely they'd have known that arby was the only suspect in a case three months prior in which a woman was taken hostage forcibly shot full of drugs and viciously raped and beaten for 15 hours the king county prosecutor's office says in this case we had information that he had a 1995 california conviction for kidnapped to commit robbery and other offenses the prosecutors assigned to the investigation had no knowledge of other pending investigation and so we are left with a question how is it that a man is arrested in front of a courthouse in possession of a deadly drug that destroys lives how is it that this man who has a long history of violence doesn't even spend 24 hours in jail how is it that he is sent right back onto the streets [Music] one seattle police officer told us synonymously i would say all of the people living in sidewalk tents doorways and encampments suffer from drug addiction or more rarely a serious debilitating mental illness another officer put it this way intervention of some sort has to be made on the people who are involved if there is no intervention there's no solution it's that simple this officer continues i used to be proud of the hard work i did and actually thought i was doing something important i took pride in working hard and making good arrests while treating everyone with the respect they deserved now it's just about trading hours for dollars and it's frustrating to me knowing i am becoming more apathetic and caring less about doing a good job another cop said homelessness and drug use have become such politically charged issues politically charged in that the city including spd administration have ceased to be interested in policing this population in a misguided attempt to help this population the city has allowed the streets to be essentially taken over the city is falling apart and becoming more unsafe due to politics surrounding low-level criminal activity and homelessness we don't want to screw over the homeless population we just want the ability to police them and yet another officer told us this drug dealers selling crack meth and heroin are evil people preying on the weakest part of society and belong in prison we arrest them and nothing happens to them they are back out on the street immediately we need to acknowledge the disregard for human life inherent in selling life-ending drugs and lock the dealers up for serious time [Music] campers show up they eventually get moved they show up again they set up where they please in front of tourists next to businesses it doesn't matter and they know that a lack of political will or an overwhelming of resources or indifference disguised as compassion will allow them to stay and don't think for a moment that the visitors to our city don't notice it was kind of surprising i don't know why the city would let that happen i mean this is your touristy spot you know what i mean this family is from tennessee they seem genuinely confused i just don't understand isn't it trespassing you know what i'm saying so so how can they they stay there why does the city put up with it why do you i mean that's a public spot why does somebody get to stay there i don't understand that i i would be arrested i thought my town if i did that i mean right by our parking garage it's there's just trash and the smell was off oh my god the smell is horrible in any stairwell you go into around here let me ask you something do you think they'll be back to visit again in the last three years you know it just has gone downhill steve danishek has spent his whole life in seattle he says when misdemeanors stopped being enforced it was the beginning of the end and at that point everyone got the message it's a free-for-all down here it's a wild west no laws apply do whatever you want i could go down here and pee on the street or crap over there or smoke a joint i i have no one's going to get arrested for doing that because they're not doing that they're not arresting anyone if i was a city council member i might say well we're overwhelmed we've got this homeless epidemic no no the city council is not overwhelmed by anything the city council are idiots they know that there are solutions out there they simply have turned their back on the solutions [Music] we don't sweat the small stuff anymore in seattle small acts of incivility are ignored and here's why if someone say urinates in front of the nordstrom store they used to be issued a civil infraction a 27 fine it used to be that a civility charge would become a criminal charge if you didn't pay the fine but the city attorney's office stopped filing civility cases they are dropped now almost without exception urinating or defecating in public sleeping in parks obstructing sidewalks failure to pay infractions all of it will get you nothing and so the police have stopped issuing the tickets altogether what's the use small acts of incivility things that cumulatively affect all of us no longer have any consequences in seattle [Music] the businesses of our city big and small are fit to be tied bob donegan is the president of ivers the conditions being allowed around our businesses are one thing there's needles and rats and garbage and feces it's not acceptable in a major urban city to have those kind of problems where there are lots of people but then with online shopping already threatening their existence along came a horde of shoplifters stealing every day to feed their addiction i would love to hear what the total is of if all the main the business in the downtown car would put their loss of theft millions and millions of dollars a year just kind of if they could compile that stat we would all just probably drop dead after we heard what the total was one of the officers who replied to the questionnaire we sent out agreed the amount of money lost due to thefts downtown he said is staggering unfortunately the businesses take the hit and the person caught stealing rarely has to deal with any consequences denise moriguchi is the ceo of owajumaya the grocery shopping hub of the international district the system's broken and i think that's creating the boldness huawei called 911 times over a 19-month stretch they're bold when they get caught they kind of just you know they don't really care and and they often times that we you know will put in a police report and they'll get a trespassing notification but then they'll just walk right back in and they and it's kind of like oh you have this trespassing okay what are you gonna do call the police and if you're wondering why that boldness she talks about exists of those 599 reports of shoplifting at her store in a 19-month stretch about eight of the cases ended in some form of prosecution most of those because they also involved assault it's huge and it costs these small mom and pop businesses and large retailers alike it costs them millions and millions of dollars per year and you know what the businesses don't like to talk about it themselves because nobody wants to say how much they're losing but we know it is millions of dollars citizens and shop owners had waited for the people running our city to come up with something a plan and then one day last may a group of construction workers got tired of waiting and took action coming here for this important discussion [Applause] as you know i am also a rank-and-file member of the labor movement on that day the tide turned against seattle's proposed business head tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing but if we fight against each other the bosses win the city council which had passed the tax unanimously you can say exactly what you think but rather than chanting against each other let's hear each other out [Applause] was forced to repeal 75 million dollars worth of business taxes [Applause] and for a moment in time anyway it felt as though something had changed was this your dream this shop yeah it's hardly i mean it's hard emotionally because i've been such a part of the neighborhood here you know karen dannenberg ran her boutique in belltown for many years and then things changed there was a guy shooting heroin or whatever he was shooting on the sidewalk i was in flip-flops walking by there was urine all over the sidewalk mattresses a pile of trash that was overflowing and it was appalling she called the police she wrote letters things only got worse and i go to bellevue and it's calm and it's quiet and there's none of this stuff going on and it's a joy being over there i i never thought i would say i'd be ready to leave seattle but i am true to her word she left her store is in bellevue now and it's thriving [Music] amongst the responses to our questionnaire one anonymous seattle police officer said there has to be some sort of intervention to break the cycle or people will continue to do what they do the addict won't quit because it has become too easy for them to use and the dealer won't quit as the consequences of getting caught are minimal another said seattle needs leaders who are willing to stand up for what is right and by doing so will ultimately help those who can't help themselves and hold accountable those who are hiding behind tents reading through the responses two things are crystal clear the level of frustration and the fact that in spite of it all they still care deeply one officer said crack cocaine heroin and especially meth use are on the rise unless someone contacted for low-level amounts of drug has a warrant they're not taking to jail they know this and have no problem using in open air drug dealers have caught on and have changed the amount they keep on them it is currently impossible to combat the open-air drug market in the city that officer was referring to the fact that in king county three grams of heroin or meth won't get you prosecuted or probably even arrested it's unofficial policy it's only the much larger quantity say 20 grams that get prosecuted and the dealers and the users know it three grams of heroin by the way is equal to 30 doses one officer summed it all up like this let's spend the millions of dollars on mandatory inpatient treatment programs instead of making excuses for their addiction and or crimes the option should be treatment or jail the cycle has to be intervened on or it will never end and maybe you're wondering why didn't they show the positive responses to the police questionnaire the answer to that is simple there weren't any [Music] they use deadly drugs and they sell those drugs for 10 bucks a dose and over and over they steal us blind to get the 10 bucks and they pollute our streets and parks and neighborhoods and they live in filth and despair like animals and we allow it all of it we used to talk about compassion and when the madness that is always patiently wading off in the distance finally moves in and wraps its arms around them and in the end it always does the suffering escalates exponentially until the misery is a white-hot pain that never stops never rests this man in the downtown core of our city was suffering in distress once he fell down he couldn't get back on his feet again so he sat there for a long time at the exact same time just across the street there was another man also apparently in the middle of a drug crisis staggering out of it lost in some other world you can see the same thing on a lot of corners every single day to leave them alone is a death sentence sooner or later they die on the streets or in tents or in low barrier tiny houses to leave them alone is to shame ourselves and that's why they need help they don't need camps and injection sites and bags of free socks they need help the kind that takes courage the kind that gives them and seattle a fighting chance they need intervention [Music] and so the city of seattle and king county seem to be struggling mightily to find answers we came all the way to the state of rhode island looking for answers and we may have found some right behind those prison walls providence is a medium-sized city in our tiniest state what they are working on here while not outwardly revolutionary or mind-boggling at first blush is a bold step towards saving lives and cities and giving tortured souls who've succumbed to the hell of heroin a fighting chance and in providence is a man who will tell you about the program they have developed but first he will tell you his own story i didn't have to do what i did i wanted to be something that i couldn't be i wanted to emulate the older fellas in the neighborhood his name is michael manfredi he used heroin for 35 years i became addicted out of february at the age of 15 i was a full-fledged addict 15 years old 15 years old this is his mug shot from the last time he came to the rhode island department of corrections 20 years of his life had been spent locked up well nothing seemed to work it was a life reeling out of control when i got the handcuffs put on me at my house that day when they kicked my door in um i looked at the lady detective and i said thank you she looked at me like i was crazy sugar partnerships guys nothing like she said i said you just saved my life because if she didn't stop me there i won't be sitting here today i would either be dead or i'd be doing life the question facing rhode island is similar to the question facing much of the united states how do we protect our society while at the same time showing compassion towards those who are sick and struggling it may be the question of our time i've wanted this program basically since the day i started dr jennifer clark is the head of what is referred to back east as the mat program medication assisted treatment we can't just ignore our way out of this we can't arrest our way out of this people are dying and there's something we can do to stop that it starts out here really because the first thing that they do in rhode island is enforce their laws drug dealers and the people who steal and commit crime to get their drugs eventually end up in this place the rhode island department of corrections it's not a nice place it's a prison but inside the walls something amazing happens every day the inmates who are in the map program line up and they take their medicine there are three opiate blockers that work methadone suboxone and vivitrol they are fda approved they get people off heroin they save lives prisoners who enter the program choose which medicine they want to use michael manfredi chose vivitrol he remembers when he first started taking it near the end of his last stint behind bars and one night i got a call it was about 6 30. come to the front desk i said oh no hey what do i do now i know i didn't do nothing wrong but they said go see the nurse i had tears in my eyes because i knew it was time for me to get that pill really this is the perfect setting because there isn't as there's not as much distraction actually linda hurley is the president of a non-profit called kodak it's been around for 50 years on the outside the state of rhode island hired kodak to distribute medicine inside the walls of the prison all three medications you carry on your life it's no different than if you were utilizing lisinoprol or something i don't know a blood pressure medication or insulin you have a family you have a job you build your life it what it does is it stabilizes it stabilizes us physically so that we can do the emotional work that we need to do to heal from the disease i started messing around with the pills and everything and then once i found opiates that was that was the end of it you know ray vincent has been behind bars for three years he was stealing to support his habit for a while then he upped the ante to robbery maybe if i didn't come in here i'd probably be dead so you think getting arrested was a good thing for you i think it saved my life ray takes suboxone he knows he may take it for the rest of his life you sound optimistic actually yeah well you know i don't i don't want to continue i don't want to continue to come here the rest of my life you know and if this medication is a stepping stone i need i'll do it that's the bottom line inside the prison inside the mat program the inmates have counselors there are one-on-one meetings with recovery coaches and group meetings as well they hit addiction with every tool they can throw at it and the recovery coaches come in and meet with anyone who's willing and interested in meeting with them so that they can develop a relationship with them on the inside and then have that relationship sustained on the outside kevin tangway says i wasn't arrested i was rescued and were you stealing to yeah that's that's my main thing what i do is i shoplift i'm a shoplifter he's been in prison eight over the last 10 years he's on methadone we get it at 12 o'clock and we we're monitored like we get those evaluations like the the doctors the counselors um that we stay in touch so that they can know if we're on at as far as a dose is holding me keeping me like so that i'm not really feeling that bad the mat system is a lifeline and these men are holding on for dear life i'm not afraid of a lot of things but i'm a little concerned about like i don't want to go back to it i don't want to go back to it because you don't even know what's real anymore and i'm just i'm a little afraid of that to die alone you know i want to kind of try to put things together my mother is still alive i want to kind of like make some kind of amends before something happens to one of us you know [Music] look at this place look at all the buildings the infrastructure what if this was a specialized facility where we could use all of our resources and knowledge to fight this thing that is happening what if it was a place where doctors and counselors and case workers were available along with the treatment drugs that we know work the ones we know save lives what if this was a very specific place where sick people learn how to live life again job training therapy treatment all of it in one place it would have to be a place where the patients couldn't simply get up and leave if they wanted because the sickness is such that that doesn't really work but eventually they would leave and have jobs and families and maybe continue to use methadone suboxone or vivitrol for the rest of their lives the way some people use insulin what you're looking at is mcneil island completely abandoned for the most part you might call it an answer waiting for the right question it wouldn't have to be here it could be somewhere else but maybe that billion dollars that we spent last year could be spent on a tough compassionate concept that actually works that saves lives as seattle and the rest of the west coast wander in the darkness searching for answers it's important to understand that the genius of what they're doing in rhode island isn't just that there is full drug treatment inside the prison walls the genius is what happens when the inmates leave priority number one being how they going to continue their medication the minute someone shows up in a program in the community they have to be registered in that database so we know if they're showing up or not are the numbers going up the figure that i saw yesterday was 93 percent of the people who leave here on mat are following up in the community that's amazing 93 93 percent are following through michael manfredi is one who stuck with the program after he was released he's alive to talk about it would i be where i am today if this program wasn't implemented no i wouldn't be here today honestly god i'd be dead this is a kodak center they are sprinkled throughout rhode island there are seven of them in providence alone once you come into the department of corrections and are medicated under methadone or suboxone or vivitrol you become a kodak patient you have a patient id number in our system and our agencies throughout rhode island are all connected former inmates or anyone else in the program show up anytime any day take home bottles so those will be filled and they get their medication no red tape no questions asked no doctors appointments no vouchers they're in the system they get their meds it's that simple josh broadfoot overdosed 12 times and somehow survived he got three years for selling drugs i'm grateful that i was arrested and taken out of the situation i was in because i mean it sounds [ __ ] to say i'm grateful i was arrested and i'm taken away from my family but i might not even be there to ever see my family again if that situation hadn't happened i might be gone completely on this day josh is on methadone the mat program he says gives him hope you got to get out there and do different but at the same time we have a little bit of help along the way we have this counseling we have something that we know is helping us to stay away from opiates and people that care and so that's a major help on the outside those group meetings continue and so does the counseling that is so very important up to three times a week and i changed by becoming someone i didn't want to be my psychiatrist my caseworker my my case manager and my doctor that prescribes my pills all in one facility i don't have to go all over the state of rhode island it's one facility you know with all the counseling and and all the support that i have it's like it's a very smooth transition you know i don't know how it would be if i wasn't on medication because i don't know if somebody if if the next day i get out i i see a bag of heroin you know somebody i know just sees me on the street hey hey you gives me a high five or something there's a bag of dope in his hand you know i don't wanna it's scary to think about but that's reality bray vincent got out of prison 19 days after we spoke to him he's going to school to become a welder he gets his medicine at a kodak center every week it saves lives so i don't think of it as being soft or compassionate it is the right thing to do it is what we're obligated to do as health care providers it's the smart thing to do patricia coyne feig who runs the entire correctional facility knows that one of the ways of measuring success is looking at the death rate for those leaving prison because i've seen it work i mean you see the numbers people who would be dead are not because of this program leaving the walls behind is dangerous because addicts who are clean will use the same amount of drugs they used before and then overdose the rate of that happening is way down in rhode island and what we found was a 65 percent decrease in mortality for people with a history of incarceration 65 and the program is still only about three years old and maybe it's just a coincidence that it's been a group of women who have spearheaded a program that is tough compassionate and innovative all at once maybe it's a coincidence maybe not michael manfredi has a job now he goes to meetings he's reconnected with his family he's productive he's happy he's alive my biggest thing is my granddaughter she's she melts my she lost my heart man absolutely i've never been happier in my life why is that because i've never lived a productive life like i am today my life's great man i can't i can't thank everybody enough man because always for this mit program michael wouldn't be here today i'm proud of myself part of my family and i'm part of everything i've done and that means so much to all of us me and the people who work in the program to do this work because the other reason we do it what they've done in rhode island and in other places can be boiled down to two simple concepts enforcement and intervention seattle and king county have retreated away from those things we've left sick tortured souls to wander the streets to rot in filth and die before us we've turned over our city to those who would steal from us and addict our children we've turned away from simple concepts that bind together society and keep it safe things like enforcement and intervention [Music] a city is a living thing it has a rhythm and a heartbeat a kind of soul it is a collection of ideas that we protect and defend old ideas and new ones and over time the ideas blend into a collective living ever-changing dream and the dream is nothing more and nothing less than a better life for our children but behind the beauty and the ideals behind the bridges and the ballparks and the beautiful buildings the dirty work is the fight great dreams and great cities don't survive without a fight seattle is dying maybe with all the wealth and growth we became so pleased with ourselves or so busy that we forgot about the hard part maybe good people who go to work every day and raise families and pay taxes the ones who built the city and dreamed the dream forgot about the dirty work maybe we forgot about the fight [Music] [Music] you", "1SeOcZxAtCo": "foreign

court becoming the only person to have served as both a u.s chief justice and president synopsis william howard taft was born in cincinnati ohio on september 15 1857. from a prominent political family he followed his forebears into law and was on track to be a career jurist well on his way to his dream job of sitting on the supreme court when he was sidetracked for a term as the 27th u.s president by his wife and theodore roosevelt taft finally achieved his dream of being appointed chief justice of the u.s supreme court in 1921 becoming the only person to have served both as a chief justice and president taft died in washington d.c on march 8 1930 early life william howard taft born on september 15 1857 in cincinnati ohio was one of six children of louisa maria torre and alfonso taft many taft ancestors who could be traced back to the massachusetts bay colony had gone into law including william's father alfonso taft alfonso taft had served under president ulysses s grant as both secretary of war and attorney general and as an ambassador under president chester a arthur taft went to private school land like his father attended yale college there he joined the now notorious secret society skull and bones which his father co-founded in 1832 taft graduated from yale in 1878 departing from tradition he went on to attend the university of cincinnati college of law and was admitted to the ohio state bar association in 1880 not long after in 1886 would a schoolhood chum of his only sister francis helen nelly herron whom taft had met at his leading party public service taft did even some political aspirations joking that if he ever made it to washington it would be because his wife was secretary of the treasury but he had always said his lifelong dream was to sit on the supreme court nelly however who had visited the hayes white house with her family as a child expressed a keen interest in living there as a young lawyer from a politically prominent family taft rose swiftly through the ranks as county prosecutor state judge then at 32 in 1890 he became the youngest appointee as u.s solicitor general by president benjamin harrison which moved the family to washington for two years to nellie's delight there they met theodore and edith roosevelt several other posts followed back in cincinnati but a decade later president william mckinley appointed taft governor general of the philippines the portly judge then took his wife and three children to southeast asia where they lived for four years visiting china japan and the vatican taft improved the filipino economy and infrastructure and expanded opportunities for governmental participation for filipinos back in washington dc by 1904 taft became president theodore roosevelt's secretary of war two years later when roosevelt offered him the choice to serve as either president or chief justice taft naturally chose his dream job however following a private meeting between nelly and roosevelt taft was swayed into running for the u.s presidency instead u.s presidency taft had an easy victory in the november 1908 election sliding in on the popularity and endorsement of predecessor theodore roosevelt he assumed the office of president on march 4th 1909 but the rest of his single term presidency was not as easy a stickler for the law taft was less inclined to push the envelope of presidential power as roosevelt had done he was more of a jovial academic than a savvy party politician and did not easily curry favor with possible political allies taft created a policy of harmony with congress which helped him move though much of his legislative agenda but misunderstandings about his stance on big business and a murky approach to tariff proposals on goods entering the united states resulting in the pain aldrich act frustrated both supporters and opponents of the policy it also further fractured the rift within the republican party between conservatives and progressives in the midterm elections he lost the republican majority in congress taft did impose a corporate income tax however which raised national revenue more than 13 million dollars under the taft administration the term shirt sleeve diplomacy open door policy and dollar diplomacy were created in regard to negotiations with china and latin america the latter involving guaranteed loans to stimulate growth trade and stability taft's wife nelly did her part for foreign relations as well initiating the planting of japan's gift of thousands of cherry trees that still grace the avenues and banks of the title basin changing the face of washington dc each spring on civil rights taft's record includes support for booker t washington's initiative to uplift african-american citizens endorsing free immigration as well as a presidential veto on a congressional law imposing a literacy test on unskilled laborers taft left office on march 4 1913 defeated by democrat woodrow wilson he had also been challenged by his predecessor theodore roosevelt who initiated a third party bull moose because he felt taft had broken their covenant on progressive principles roosevelt came in second weighty issues and post-presidency while in college taft earned the nickname big love due to his size he was almost six feet tall and weighed more than 240 pounds at that time but he managed it well never a drinker during his white house years but indulging in a copious appetite his size increased to morbid obesity he was often the butt of jokes for reported incidents of belching and flatulence as well as suffering from sleep deprivation due to apnea urban legend had it that the 350-pound taft got stuck in a bathtub while serving as president but all historical accounts show the story is most likely false less than a year after leaving the presidency taft dropped to about 270 which encouraged him to take a trip to alaska however the weight seemed to take a toll on his joints taft used a cane made of 250 000 year old petrified wood a gift from geology professor w s foster from 1920 onward taft became a law professor at yale university but took time after the outbreak of world war one to co-found the league for enforced peace the league to enforce peace a precursor to the league of nations with alexander graham bell and other prominent americans in the summer of 1921 taft finally achieved his long-desired position he was appointed chief justice of the supreme court by president warren g harding becoming the only president to hold a seat on the supreme court death and legacy william howard taft died on march 8 1930 at his home in washington dc he was the first president to be buried in arlington cemetery and the first to have a funeral broadcast on the radio in fact president taft's presidential career included a broad range of firsts he was the first president to have a presidential automobile converting the white house stables into garages the first to occupy the oval office which was operational as of october 1909 the first to throw the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game and the first to play golf as a hobby along with all of his firsts taft was the last american president to have facial hair taft's presidency is often thought of as lackluster but following a flashy personality like theodore roosevelt is no easy feat few are aware that taft the 27th u.s president actually busted more trusts over his four years in office than roosevelt did during his eight-year administration taft and roosevelt eventually reconciled not long before roosevelt's death in 1919 of his presidential term taft once wrote i don't remember that i ever was president", "XH4ruTofna8": "an agency created to protect you from bad lawyers has some of the highest paid public employees and a multi-million dollar problem there's a lot that's crawling underneath the surface that is not what it should be we investigate the California Bar Association and take our evidence to the woman in charge I think we're turning the ship around somewhat argue the ship is already sinking I've heard that I don't agree tonight it'll let on NBC Bay Area we investigate", "G4pI9OaLiMU": "bike setup is it a dark art i don't think so anymore arguably bikes are more complicated than they've ever been but a lot of them can be tweaked and changed on the fly or with all the resources available nowadays you can find out all the information you need to set your bike up properly but here are some of the most common bike setup [Music] mistakes [Music] number one and i think probably the most common set up mistake is the wrong tyre pressure because this is such a varied thing you can change your tyre pressure to suit the conditions the terrain so you can tweak it to your heart's content pretty much but also i think the main reason why people often have it wrong myself included is because tires do go down gradually over time if you're not checking your tire pressure all the time then you don't know what it is and it's probably not quite right so personally i kind of do have a base set in and that is 25 or 26 psi the front tire 26 to 28 in the rear and that's the sort of those uh brackets to try and stay within however if i'm not checking my tires every time i ride which i definitely don't then i'm probably straying outside of those a bit so this is one that i'm going to say i'm going to do more often is check on tire pressure get my pressure gauge out just before i go only takes a minute and i would encourage you to do the same [Music] suspension is one of the biggest ways i think uh modern mountain bikes for suspension bike scores have really changed in the last 10 years the amount of technology that goes into these suspension units now is incredible it's brilliant but if it's not set up right it can actually make your bike an absolute pig or just not perform like it should now of course we've done loads of videos on this but i also would really recommend going to the manufacturer's websites i did when i got this bike this is my new proof mega and when it was new i have to say it wasn't quite uh riding it as i would like and rather than start from scratch and working out what to do with these clickers on my shock all i did is go straight to the fox website and they'll give you um recommended base settings so first thing i'll do is set my sag at 30 percent and then i used that pressure whatever that number was i forget now to be honest what i put in to that shock and it will then give you a recommended amount of clicks on all of these settings so you've got load settings on this on this shock you've got high and low speed rebound high and low speed compression you've got your high speed compression down there i've said that right overnight but you've also got the lockout and it can make a really big difference when i set this to those bass settings it completely transformed this bike and made it ride brilliantly so that is my first recommendation is looking at manufacturer's website the first thing to do like i said is get your sag right so on air shocks that's making sure you get the right amount of air using your shot pump into these and i recommend 30 on the rear that suits me absolutely perfectly and everyone else seems to recommend that as well up front i go for less sort of 20 to 25 and once you've got that then you can do all the rest of the settings like i said all the clickers but also then you can think about adding air volume spaces or taking them away you feel like you need to make your bike more linear or more progressive when you look at it closely there's a big difference in tires designed for different conditions obviously the tread pattern is the most obvious one this is the motives of mud type deep knobs that are spread widely so i'll get rid of the mud they'll shed it and this is a martellos dry tire so much closely packed and sort of lower knobs on there but actually there's even a difference if you look closer at these things called sipes so these are slices in the tread and that's designed to sort of let that piece of tread deform and grip the ground and that's completely different on different tyres depending on what they're designed for so we'll make a massive difference how much grip you've got especially somewhere like the uk in winter sticking on some proper mud tyres it could be as simple as just having two sets of tyres summer and winter places like the uk where for some months and winter just doesn't dry out you might be surprised how much difference it makes to have a proper set of mud tyres and how much more fun it actually makes of riding also i think it's fairly common to see heavier or more aggressive riders running tires are just too thin if you find that you're pinching tubes or punching quite a lot then it might be an idea to think of getting a thicker side wall tire so a tougher tire or even think about tire inserts modern trail enduro and daniel box come with really wide handlebars which is great it gives the option to do something with them but i do see a lot of people with bars are super wide sometimes too wide for their shoulders and also probably too wide for the trails they're riding of course this is down to personal preference so i am five foot ten sort of average everything and i run my bars at 760 on my trail and durabites on a cross-country bike i do run slightly narrower 750 760 is my sort of go-to width but actually these bars on this bike this is a new proof mega medium comes 780 so i do need to chop a little bit off the end to suit me like i run maybe slightly narrow bars on some people but i find that if i'm riding trails in the woods some of my local trails there any widen that and i'm starting to whack my bars in places i don't want to so that's these trails i ride also my shoulder width but actually on the large mega there comes 800 so that's a proper wide bar that's a downhill width bar i think yes bigger eyes might want that but maybe other riders might want to just take a little bit off the end of them [Music] brake lever position can change wildly from person to person and from bike to bike and it's one thing that i really noticed forever jump on someone else's bike that sometimes it can almost feel dangerous or unrideable if the lever position isn't somewhere that i like it to be now for me i like to ride with my hands actually really on the edge of the bar so almost just hanging off the edge and my one finger comes right on the very end of lever but that works for me because you get maximum leverage on that lever i don't need two fingers just i've got enough power with one but also the angle i like them relatively high but not crazy so that when i'm off the back of the bike i'm not having to reach round and over the bar to get to them because that can give you arm pumps as well if you're trying to if your wrist is rolling over the top of the bar like to be relatively comfortable any high in that and he does hurt my wrist i've got dodgy recipe found and i broke a skateboard a long time ago so too high and it hurts me but comfortable and most importantly so that when you're riding your bike they're just in the most usable position where you get the most power and it's sort of your fingers length at all time you see with these new shimano levers i say new they're proven out here now but the newer style they've got the clamp here and you've got space for your dropper post and then they've got that sort of rest that comes up against the bar that makes them super stiff so they don't flex at all you can see how close i do get that to my grip so i've only got probably three mil left so quite far butted up and that suits me perfectly [Music] have you ever checked your rear mech limit screws it's a tedious business i'll give you that more suited to gm then tech probably sorry dolly love you really but more tedious is actually having to buy a brand new rear mac and rear wheel because you shift it into the rear wheel and it all explodes so it's something that is essential when you get a bike to make sure your rear mech doesn't go past the limits and absolutely ruin your bike simply put these two screws here on this shimano mech you'll get them in every map every brand they limit how far the mech will move this way and that way you need to set them so it doesn't go too far again doddie has done i'm sure a super interesting very useful video over on gmail tech telling you what every single screw on your rear mac does and i think these two are the most important save you loads of money if you get them set right [Music] i see a lot of people with really dirty black oily chains where they keep just re-putting thick lube on there and that's a bit of a short-term solution but at least a long-term problem because that thick black dirty oil just grinds away at your drivetrain and wears out super quick so making sure your cassette and chain and chamber are all nice and clean and using the correct lube for the conditions so it's nice and dry so i'm using this dry loop which is super thin you don't get mud sticking to it and it does the trick oh i like butter [Music] i'll admit one mistake that i probably make too much and that is not washing my bike off enough there you go one for me to finish with thanks for watching", "YxTgUWmHPqE": "the florida podcast network the voice of florida from mallory square in key west to the governor's mansion in tallahassee and all points beyond you're listening to the florida beer podcast powered by floridabeerblog.com your source for all things related to the craft beer community in the sunshine state and now your host dave butler welcome to episode 64 of the florida beer podcast powered by floridabeerblog.com this is dave your host and author we got a couple things to get to today before we do make sure to like us subscribe to our podcast raid us five stars make sure that all of your friends know you can also find us online at floridabearblog.com at floridabearpodcast.com as we were a proud member of the florida podcast network on socials at florida beer blog on instagram and twitter at fl beer blog on facebook and if you've been watching those socials you'll know that i'm a particularly big fan of curtain up that is a beer that was founded by the happy hour guys which is a podcast based out of new york by a couple of actors that are currently not doing what they want to do and a collaboration between them and gun hill brewing which is in the bronx that collaborated with them before for a special beer that's actually served if you go see hamilton at the richard rogers theater in new york city obviously they are dark right now but the beer was intended to not only bring awareness to what the current quarantine has done to the performing arts community in new york and abroad but also as a way to give funds to the actors fund which is a group that supports performers and technicians and everybody involved with the arts as they are not able to do their jobs at the present time there are three breweries in the state that are jumping on to brew curtain up at the present time and the first one is bay cannon out of west tampa we've had them on the podcast before and today you're going to be listening to co-founder matthew dware he was able to connect with me via zoom to talk a little bit more about why they decided to make this beer where the proceeds are going and what they learned from such an interesting interesting recipe enjoy first of all how did you find out about the curtain up project i don't know maybe somebody tagged us somewhere online i'm not really sure exactly i suppose it's possible that those guys reached out to us the happy hour guys or gun hill but i can't remember we we've been talking for a while now so i'm not sure exactly how the communication started but you know i brought it to our our one of my partners and and the head brewer joe who's a musician and an artist and asked if he had appetite for it and if we had room for that from a production standpoint for a while we were really really jammed up making xander in just was clogging up our production so it was tough through the middle of covid to get on board with a lot of extra creative stuff and we're starting to get back on top of the water with that but this became a time that we could do it plus it's tampa bay beer week and so we just sort of scheduled it when we could and are happy to be able to participate awesome and i know especially from speaking to other breweries that there are a lot of projects like this you know obviously resilience kind of kicked it off and then there's been all sorts of other ones like black is beautiful and so on so forth what was it specifically about curtain up that spoke to you was it the recipe or the meaning behind it no i mean a recipe helps because you know we do a good job with hazy ipas and and have some footing there despite our youth but i think for the most part i brought it up to joe just because he's you know he's a live performer he's participated in playing in bands for years you know successful little run with one back in the punk rock days and toured europe and learned a lot about you know beer which has obviously become his his passion and career and but still plays and and many times we've discussed just the the destruction to live entertainment because we've had live shows here and tried to do different things it's just been hard to manage that with the different policies and safety measures and whatnot that you want to try to you know wrap your your business around and so it just kind of made sense for us to try to help and do this and we don't have a lot of money so the idea that we can make a beer that we can sell and continue to make money but then also you know sell it for a little bit more and give back you know that creates a an opportunity for us to participate even without having you know much revenue because we know it's crazy ipas will will will sell and it'll be a beautiful beer and tastes good yeah especially with the recipe because you know like you said the recipe is available for anybody that wants to see it and for participating breweries that want to brew it and i noticed that it was very heavy on citra i do believe there was a good chunk of mosaic that was in there as well did you decide to kind of stick exactly with the recipe that gun hill created or were there little twists and tweaks there that you made it kind of big cannon's own little version we just stuck with the recipe what's cool is that we're always learning we're always figuring out what what different tweaks and whatnot in in recipes that we currently have and so seeing that recipe and it being hazy was something that we were interested in using just because it was a little bit different than what we've been doing to see what that comes out looking like and also its aromas and profile it was hopped a little bit differently than how we do it so it was cool to just use it the way it was and and see how it comes out and see what we think yeah centennial citra amarillo i think just uh it's not something that we've done with those with those hops matching up so i wanted to just follow the recipe and see what we could put together it'll be different than what we're doing and so since we have hazes on the on the menu it's nice to have something a little bit different awesome based on your experience brewing this do you think that it will be the starting point for making a few other beers that you want to put in rotation like what do you mean yeah just different recipes different ways of playing with some of the hops you know kind of like you had mentioned you know yeah that's all that we were doing everything we do is something new and different so you know we're uh just a seven barrel brewery most of the stuff that we do here is r d and if we can get some of it out to distribution to get some feedback on that you know we have relationships with a contract facility so that's where xander gets made we've got some other beers that'll be getting made there and if we find something that really works that we want to go large scale with then we'll take it out over there but we use this brewery as a pilot for the most part so everything is always different we're always messing with different ideas joe is always coming up with improvements for recipes new rays sometimes really really old recipes because you know traditional belgian beers are great nowadays traditional west coast ipa are are old and and but also great so yeah we just kind of mess around and at the tap room you got to have every box covered you know you want to have dark beers you want to have sour beers you want to have hazy beers you want to have bitter beers so we we got to continue to mix it up and and he does a good job doing that perfect obviously with uh gun hill and the happy hour guys they kind of had the actors fund as the main beneficiary for their beers are you going to be donating some of the proceeds to the actors fund or is there something local in town that you're going to try and give funds to we just planned to give it to the actors fund that was part of the program that when we read it and you know just wanted to participate that way we we got involved we got hooch and hive involved too their little bar over here by us and so they're going to buy a keg through our distributor and then they're going to sell it and they're going to donate some of the proceeds there too i know they do a ton of live shows and are that's you know really part of who they are and so when we have beer there usually and they're good people and so we just reached out see if they wanted to participate and so i believe next week they'll get that beer and and kind of kind of help you know it's like we're not we only we only did 20 cases we're not a big i'm just not a big brewery we we want it to move we want to sell and make some money we'll donate some some proceeds off of draft sales as well and and then yeah have it go to the actors fund i've read up a little bit about it and you know trust that it'll get to who it needs to get to we haven't haven't been able to do any research or or been approached by anybody locally so awesome and so four packs are coming on sale i would assume four packs and 16 ounce tall boys what's the price point where can people get it yeah four packs 24 bucks they're here right here in the tap room uh six dollars every four pack goes back to the extras fund we'll be selling draft beer too and a buck off every pint will go back as well

interview that you just heard was recorded before they released and by the time it comes out they will have released the beers for their four packs for off-site consumption he also mentioned a couple places where you can find it on draft it's a very good recipe it's a great great organization that you're helping out and a very worthy cause so i definitely recommend trying to search that out and get some we will also be talking to the other breweries that are going to be making it once it comes closer to them releasing but after that we are going to head down to naples and i'm very excited because it was one of the first breweries that i was actually able to go to since the quarantine began it's been quite a long time since since i've actually been able to let me try that again it's been quite a long time since i've been able to sit at a brewery and enjoy a beer and i was lucky to have my family with me as we went to riptide brewing which is in naples they've been around for a couple of years but they have recently gotten new ownership and with new ownership comes a whole new outlook new imagery new tap room location looks new backyard area which is where we work because there's plenty of space to sit outside and enjoy beers just new everything and even new beer recipes are going to be coming on and so we're talking to the co-owner kim west she is the driving force behind all of that awesome new newness uh to talk about what it was like to take over a brewery that already existed some of the plans that she put into motion making the new riptide and what they're gonna be doing let me try that again so there's no chime and so we sat down and spoke to co-owner kim west to learn a little bit more about the new hotness that is riptide brewing the changes that she made the changes that she wants to make and really the new focus for this great brewery in southwest florida enjoy [Music] well then i guess i will get started by asking the ownership structure because it seems like riptide has sort of changed hands a few times well it has initially we purchased it from three partners and when we initially purchased it it was understood that my son my oldest son who's 26 was going to run it with a couple of his friends well going to brewing school and learning how to brew and actually owning a brewery and having to do it evidently are two completely different things so the my son's friend that was the brewer he started brewing less and less and then one weekend he went he took a girl out to a social event came back had purchased a car and decided to leave and go um live on his cousin's couch in beaufort south carolina because he was going to marry this girl that's kind of jerry springer right there yeah it sort of is and so he stayed there for quite some time i understand a few months and nothing worked out with the girl evidently so now he's back home with his parents and the girl is still single and he's i think he's working in either a nike or an adidas uh warehouse stocking shoes so just like the traditional way of pair of pets and everything of course the kid wants it the kid doesn't take care of it and it is up for the parents to take care of things so chris then my son was covid hit so here's my son who's 26 who doesn't have a lot of business experience his brewer has just gone to live on someone's couch and i decided to step in and help a little awesome and in that time it seems like you've taken a brewery that was sort of a small brewery in a non-traditional market and it looks like you've got a very aggressive very forward thinking vision well my background and everything i did prior to this what i always had forward thinking for three or five year 10-year plans i don't like to be surprised i like to be out ahead of everything gotcha and that's the only way i know how to run a business you go bigger you go home so we sat together for about 48 hours and decided we were going big awesome and obviously the first thing the very obvious thing even looking at social media and whatnot something that we had talked about previously is sort of the iconography the image not just the logo but the whole feel of what riptide was supposed to be because the original riptide the one that we've been to several times my wife and our family and our friends traditionally was i guess the icon was kind of centered around either poseidon or neptune whichever one you go with a lot of golds a lot of reds and browns and now you're actually on the third iteration of the riptide logo but it's gone very whites and blues very cool very aquatic with the surfer now you've got the surfer with a pint of beer in his hand right i guess why was it so important to change that visual look of what it was what was that the first thing that you wanted to do well i think that realistically before you start coming out with a bunch of different merchandise a bunch of different beers all of that you need to have an idea of what your brand is and when our second alliteration when we left the brown and the gold and we moved into the surfer guy this is i mean this is naples people come here for the beach now do people come here to surf no but the surfer guy was just kind of a nod to whimsy because like i have penguins all around my house now there's no reason in the world he's a huge penguin fan she loves penguins yeah i have outdoor penguins and indoor penguins so i mean there's nothing penguiny about naples but it's just you know it's that that whimsy that fantasy so looking at that and looking at you know you look at beach colors it's it's creams the blues the greens it's got a lot of texture it's very comfortable that's what we wanted to go for and as we started to go that direction it then dawned on us that hey we really really you know we need to like circle back okay this guy this guy should be drinking a beer because the absolute epiphany of coming down here to surf would be if you're out there drinking a beer and surfing and i was extremely lucky i brought on kyle who is our head of sales and marketing so there's a lot of things i don't know how to do but i know how to find people that can do them and do them well which is always the hallmark of a good owner doing everything yourself getting the people that came oh yeah no if i was doing everything myself i i can't even imagine what this would look like we've got this visual change and like i was saying before you know this is a non-traditional beer market but it's starting to really grab hold starting to have teeth that's starting to really sort of sink into what kind of changes have you seen in the lee county collier county beer scene since you've had riptide and how has the new image been able to sort of sink in and resonate with the beer drinkers in this area that's a lot of question i know that is a lot that's a i think it's probably that's a two-pronged question because for people to really understand craft beer you have to understand what craft beer is and there's been a lot of mystery surrounding that because as you know some of the big beer houses you know buy up breweries or rebrand under other names and people think that they're drinking craft but they're really not exactly so you had education was the was the biggest piece we started talking to everybody who came in and everybody that we talked to about our beer be it someone that we speak with in the tap room or someone that we're when we're out selling or just talking to people when we're out about town we talk about why craft beer is craft beer and that it's it's an artisan type of mentality versus hey we're making you know five flagships and we're making these other three things that's what it is lyndon who is our director of operations and our head brewmaster he actually started here at riptide brewing and then went from here to ankro lab to help them open and then went to colorado and was going to his wife's family they were going to go into partnership they decided not to do that and so we were lucky enough to convince him to come back and so he's running all of our operations and he's absolutely amazing excellent and it seems interesting because i was taking a look in terms of the beers that you have on tap there are some beers that i remember from the old days obviously kraken double ipa right there and it kind of seems like it will always be there but it also looks the big cypress stout is another one that is kind of i don't i don't know if it's a holdover from the old days with the refresh of the brand with the refresh of the imagery did he also come through with a refresh of the recipes he absolutely came through with the refresh the reason that you still see kraken on there is because right now with what we're doing in terms of canning and making sure that our three main flagships are available to anyone that wants them is we have a 10 barrel brew house but essentially it's like a seven and a half so the new fun things that you see on there is a nod to what we're going to go forward with the kraken double ipa you come in three months it's not going to be there will we have a double ipa absolutely but it'll be different interesting and i guess especially with naples especially with the southwest florida beer community it doesn't seem like it's overly crazy it doesn't seem like it's overly deserty i know you do have at least one fruited sour that's on the menu right is that intentional because of the market or is that more of a these are baby steps and once you educate your clientele eventually you'll start bringing those in as much as it pains me to say this and i'll probably get hit for saying it oh in southwest florida we're a good two years behind the rest of the country in terms of what's going on in craft beer so these are what i would consider i don't know that i would consider them baby steps i would consider them more educational steps because the more that people understand craft beer and what goes into it and the different ways to pair it with food then we'll be able to offer different selections and we'll be able to go a little bit farther in in terms of what you want to do we want to do some really great we actually had the barrel age golden the second time that we do something like that then we're going to put it in the larger 22 to 24 ounce bottles and put the wax on it and it'll be a very special type of thing more than likely a tap room only release the first time we're not ready to do that yet because we need to be able to recreate it if we do it once we're not a one-and-done we want to make sure that we can recreate it we can recreate it exactly the way that it was and that people understand what it is awesome and yeah i was kind of going back to my original question because you know bone hook is really starting to explode they are they're all over the place momentum just had their huge new facility a couple years ago yeah i think they've only been in a year and a half yeah but it's it's enormous compared to the old one that they use it is yes there's a lot of them that are opening you mentioned anchor lab that just opened and then obviously there's other news that you had i don't know if we're gonna release that but it seems like it's really starting to come into its own and it seems like the two years behind that the area is starting to catch up i would agree with that i would say i think we're still it still will lag behind for a few years but i would definitely agree with that i think that people are actually also starting to see breweries down in southwest florida as more of a multi-use space we're having some wedding receptions here we're doing people are starting to see them as something other than go in have a beer and leave and how would you kind of define the beer drinker down here did you when you came in when you came on board about a year ago did you have a clientele that was starting to develop that taste that was starting to develop that sort of knowledge about craft beer or did you still have to do a lot of i guess from scratch education actually a lot of our beer drinkers or clientele did a lot of educating for us interesting um we have a very diversified here in 34102 we have you know the 21 year olds we have the 91 year olds we have people that have never had a craft beer we have a guy that comes in all the time gil gil like travels all over the world and has pitched his own hops he's grown his own hops so it's kind of a a meeting in the minds everybody when they come in it's it's sort of like a think tank people share everything about where they've been the type of beer they've had different experiences that they've had in breweries and or attached to breweries awesome um and we'll talk about experiences for a little bit because as we're recording this you do have an art installation on the inside of your tap room which is absolutely gorgeous i can't wait to go in there a little bit and just sort of browse and look around in terms of the naples clientele do you get a lot of snowbirds and when it comes to both the snowbirds and the locals what are you trying to do to really kind of keep things fresh and interesting other than just rotating the taps that's a really interesting question especially in 2021 well yeah i was gonna actually talk about that a little bit later because obviously that's the elephant in the room it is the elephant in the room this season has been a very unique season we've been very lucky that the changes that we've made and the different people that we have brought in have been able to keep it fresh and interesting so we have managed to pick up quite a few more locals than we originally had at the same time we just have updated our website we haven't actually even like published that it's launched interesting but it it quietly launched about a week and a half ago and we have over a thousand people that have looked at it have visited it and they're from all over the country we've got people from alaska we've got people from washington state we've got people from new york and they're all interacting with it which is great so i think that it's hard to say because this would have been well last year would have been the whole season but we closed down right before st patrick's day so and this year a lot of the snowbirds appear to be moving down permanently really yeah there's a lot we've got i think it's about i don't want to miss quote but i believe that the numbers in the thousands per day of people moving to southwest florida because you know we're still open while many of the states up north are closed interesting i did not realize that is that putting a pressure on all of the businesses like yours here in the area well if that's what you call pressure that's a great pressure to have come on down everybody bring the pressure not so far it's just the only thing that it makes is it's more difficult to forecast you know is is this seasonal or are the p are they gonna stay i don't think this year we really i can't speak to everybody but i don't think that we necessarily have a huge handle on that i would be willing to say that we're probably 30 to 40 percent off whichever way we think gotcha because there's really no way to gauge it this is also the first year that we're going out and actually advertising okay we are i think it's in a week we have a i don't know if you're familiar with slider it's the car that runs around and you know it can pick you up yes it can pick you up and take you where you want to go and it's free they just work for tips interesting so we are on a slider we've wrapped a slider with riptide interesting for a whole year okay that's kind of it's kind of neat i guess it's a lot more socially forward than you expect the area to be i think so i mean you know it's hard to say having had no prior brewery experience before i came into this it's it's kind of like sometimes you just throw some stuff at the wall and see if it sticks and i guess i was gonna say is this field sort of more ripe for experimentation like that is there something that's a little bit more forgiving and a little bit more risk-taking in the craft beer industry than say the other industries that you have been a part of i don't know if i call it risk-taking i would say that it's more welcoming for change so if you try something and it doesn't work i don't think that that is necessarily held against you as long as you try something else and i think the end result being good customer service and a good product i don't think i think they're very forgiving as to how you get there as long as you you check the boxes i mean we try we've worked very hard to try and be part of the community and support the community we have a strong partnership with das domestic animal services we have a strong partnership with the zoo we do brew for the zoo every year and we support the panthers although this year we're i think we're going to branch out and start supporting some other animals also with a limited uh can release oh really because i will say the first time that we were here we actually came actually no we hadn't gone to the zoo yet but we did notice or at least i noticed the one-eyed stuffed panther yes which led us to learn about the one-eyed panther that was at the naples zoo so that sounds like that is still a partnership that is still a partnership we all feel very strongly about giving back my team i mean i i probably shouldn't be the person here talking to you my team should probably be talking to you because i've got claire our taproom manager is amazing our other taproom manager christian that does a lot of back of house stuff i mean i can't say enough good things about him kyle's our you know media and sales guy the people that we have out selling in the market are fabulous lyndon i've already told you about ian who just recently came on board he's like passionate about uh cider which is what we're going to be adding to our line interesting yeah cider is his big thing so i mean i've just got great people that i can't that's why it seems a little ridiculous for me to be sitting here and talking about because this isn't a reflection of me this is a reflection of everybody that works at riptide well and i guess that's a good thing to hear because it doesn't seem like it's one person controlling and i've spoken to other breweries where it seems like it's just the one person and nobody can sort of get out from the shadow of that one person whereas it seems like you're more interested in hearing what your team has to say and what they're looking to do and sort of taking the ship in that direction the way that i've always looked at putting teams together is the person who puts the team together they're responsible for the vision and you hire people and they're responsible for what you hire them for so it makes no sense to me to hire like a tap room manager and then turn around and tell her what the tap room should be like or hire a brewer and say okay and these are like the 10 things i want you to make no there's no synergy in that it's kind of amazing and refreshing to hear i don't really believe it or not yes [Laughter] well trust me you're looking around kind of confused that somebody would actually believe the opposite of that so well i mean that's like i said that's the only way i know how to run a business so that is how riptide is currently being run we don't nobody really has titles we have group chat if anybody has a great idea they throw it out in group chat you know if you need me to cover the floor or watch the bathroom i'm fine gotcha you know it doesn't matter and i guess my question because we're sitting outdoors it's an absolutely gorgeous night and you're absolutely gorgeous sort of beer garden whose idea was this and kind of making this sort of come to fruition i guess this would be i can i think it's i love plants and i like outdoor space claire is absolutely like crazy about plants so claire took me to a place called williams magical gardens okay okay and we met um it's also women owned women owned sherlocks so we met tina and cheryl there so all of a sudden we had this beautiful partnership well then christian feels strongly about how space should go lyndon knows which of the components that we keep outside make a lot of noise and so how were we going to break that off and look good and how can we make it look good but we also it's a very small beer garden so you also have to worry about like when someone comes to deliver gas or somebody comes to pick up beer you know we can't have it look like this because they can't get through so everything's on wheels oh really yes yeah yeah you're going to look at it you've got pergolas are even on wheels interesting so if we had to and most of the planters on wheels not all but most so if we had to we could move everything out of the way huh that's funny so that's yeah did i forget oh kyle of course had some great ideas it was kyle's idea for it was kyle and claire maybe kyle and christian for the art installation that went with that so no i mean there is like i said there's if anything i'm just sort of like the person in the middle that kind of hears about all this and does all this but no it's really it's my team that's kind of amazing and it's sort of fortunate that you created such a nice big outdoor space and so many breweries that i've spoken to ever since covet happened once cove had hit they've really started to emphasize and try to expand their outdoor seating as part of this did you hear about the bubbles i heard about the bubbles i saw pictures of the bubbles i'm very disappointed that the bubbles were not here only because i really wanted to sit in a boat you wanted to sit in a bubble i wanted to sit in the bubble but please explain the bubbles well the bubbles are little forms that go over tables and they're not here right now because we're back in like the 80s or 90s and temperature wise and we tried fans we tried everything and you couldn't we had the great idea for about 15 minutes we were going to pump air conditioning into them but then we realized that the purpose of the bubbles was to make sure that the person in bubble number one didn't breathe bubble number two's there well that wasn't gonna work so well with air conditioning so we kind of had to like toss that off to the side yeah we we learn a lot by doing and screwing it up and then fixing it so that's why the bubbles are enough now that makes perfect sense but once people started coming out a little bit more once society started to reopen a little bit was your outdoor seating taken advantage of even more than you had originally anticipated it really was i mean initially it started with with just like the soft furniture so you'll see the groups of soft furniture around and then we started adding tables and then we added the two-seaters and there is a strong possibility that we will be able to pick up additional space soon nice that's that's amazing that's obviously great for you oh yeah we would love that but in terms of i guess where would you put it because you're in a sort of a strip mall and i guess technically as we're sitting out in the beer garden we're behind the pet store that's next door to you yes we're behind the pet store and we're behind the cabinet shop that's next door to me gotcha somebody may not be here for much longer you know i can't really say at this point but there's this there's a small rumor okay that's good but that's great and it's it's nice to see that the community can support craft beer enough to where you do have the ability to make these plans to grow absolutely i mean i think that i don't know which would you call it under supported because there's still so many people out there that because of what's going on now you know they don't come out as often as they did or they're down here they came down as snowbirds but nobody knows they're here because they only go to the grocery store they only do that so it's i would say that probably even as our social media is going up we have a lot of i'd say at least 50 percent of the people that come down especially the snowbirds don't necessarily use social media they look at the magazines you know that come in their mailboxes they go by word of mouth and if their friends aren't going anywhere if they're only going to the clubs the private clubs then i'd say at least 50 percent of the people have no idea that we're here maybe more because we still get people that come in every day and say did you guys just stop it and we're like no i think i was down here last week you weren't here right so i think it's just it's a matter of making people aware of what it is and why you would want to be there that's amazing and obviously one of the big ways that people get the word out is with distribution yes and it seems like you are really starting to ramp up distribution not just with kegs which i feel have been going out for a little bit gigs have been going out for a little bit but now you've got cans and i know the cans are available at the very least at um fresh market they're also available at the 7-eleven on central they're available at three i believe two or three of the abc stores that are in the naples fort myers area awesome we're working to get them into total wine our distributor is so we should be in there i would say within three to four weeks how difficult was that a decision to can in terms of not just the incredible investment that that would require but also i guess the amount of product that you have to pump through your system you know funnily funnily i don't even think that's a word strangely there the toughest decision was we can right now using a mobile canner because we don't have enough space yeah within our facility so to can we have to close down and they come in and they take all of the tap room and all of the um room in between the kegs and that's how we can so literally you can you start at like seven eight in the morning and you run through you know 20 some barrels iron heart canning is who we currently use they're a great mobile canner nice and then you clean up really fast and you try and open the tap room by four or five it's it's it's crazy that's amazing but it's it's a lot of fun and i think we look at it more as a not even really a canning expense we look at it as an advertising expense because the more places that we are and the more people that can identify our cans along with our logo the more people that will then start putting it together and i think that's what a number of breweries have really started to understand is that you don't get a lot of money from the canned sales themselves you get the money from the people that pick up the can and want to learn a little bit more that's it the cans just like a starting point the can i mean think of the can as a key and you want them to bring the key to the door and open it up so what beers are actually in cans because we've got the beer menu in front of us well figure out that old naples blonde old naples blonde well that's that's a story in itself oh i can't wait to hear this well okay so our favorite name for old naples blonde was geezer pleaser and so when old naples blonde when it first went out what would that have been probably four months ago it went out as geezer pleaser and we heard some people thought it was a great name and some people obviously didn't like it so we had to find a more palatable name which old nipples blonde sounded perfect but the cans that we just can't um we don't have any in the uh refrigerator right now but on the bottom of them not only do they say the date but they also say geezer pleaser because we're very irreverent here nice so we've got the beer formerly known as geezer please yes and then we've got porpoise party which is the ipa and then we've got west tide red ale it's interesting i can understand the blonde i can understand the ipa very few breweries in this state have a red ale as a year-round can release this is true it's very very strange so i guess what was the purpose and the story behind that well the purpose and story behind that is that it actually pairs with a lot more food choices than people think that it does and since very few people are currently offering it we thought that it was a hole in the market and that we determined that we would go after it we also try we try pretty hard to make sure that if we're going to go out into distribution with something we really don't want to go out into distribution with something that is a hundred percent in competition with the other crafts that are within our area our immediate area i just you know if we don't have to we just would rather not there's plenty of people out there there's no reason to try and take something that someone else has built we'd rather build it ourselves that makes perfect sense and yeah talking about you talking about that knowing the beers that are sort of released in this area you know obviously everybody's got the ipa well ever you have to because an ipa is the number one thing asked for wherever you go exactly got a couple blondes i'm thinking especially fort myers kind of comes to mind but i'm trying to think of the nearest red ale that gets released on a regular basis maybe tokobaga but that's all the way up in tampa and that's seasonal uh yeah it's actually kind of difficult to do so that's yeah that's what we try and do every decision that we make is to make riptide better and make it a better customer experience to make sure that you can come here and get things that you can't get from other people to make sure that when you come here this is the epitome of the experience that you want to have that's perfect and of course when you come here there are several beers on tap and i'm curious as to which ones are kind of your favorites oh i'm seafoam your seafood i am seafoam all the way that's your hazy you're kind of new england yes i'm seafoam all the way i i am a little an old naples blonde okay well actually i guess i am an old nipples blonde but i like the beer too exactly and i know i just had the lager which is right kind of your vienna lager which is beautifully crisp and nicely just just a touch on the sweet side get a little bit of hoppiness which is kind of beautiful so i really enjoyed kind of what that did my wife was having the vanilla pork tur that's true which is i know she she always loves the dark beers she loves having that nice kind of hit of flavor so it's got this just a touch of the vanilla give it that nice little rounded sweetness that works well with a strong not too terribly strong obviously being a porter right but it's got that strong malt build kind of big flavors of cocoa and a little bit of coffee and then having that vanilla come in is really one of the things that linden tries to do specifically with the dark beers is he wants to make sure that you can hit the notes separately that makes sense and i think he he does an excellent job with it of course i'm team linden so you know but i do find it interesting you know obviously you said that you're going to be doing a cider program yeah a cider and a salsa program i was going to ask about the seltzers because that is the big thing well it is and i i have to be honest yeah you know i mean they have like no carbs they have very little sugar i'm a seltzer person i mean you're drinking a seltzer right now there's no alcohol in it but you're drinking the seltzer and yeah absolutely you know my wife and i this is our cheat day because we've been doing keto for the past month oh so this is your cheat day yes this is our cheat day and we we i mean i hit the seltzer bandwagon hard and so many people have told me so many brewers have told me they obviously love beer it's you know near and dear into them but they just drink seltzers because they don't have to worry about all the stuff so you are going to do a seltzer yes we are doing a seltzer any details on that or are we still a little ways off we're a little ways off we're we will start testing out ciders and seltzers as soon as we have our production facility locked up and we're we're not quite there yet we did have a building that we were in due diligence under but with but that just that didn't come to fruition it just it was going to take too much of a build out to make it happen gotcha so you are looking at getting a production physique oh definitely will this be a production only facility or will you have it will not it will be a production facility and a tap room at the very least although i would also like to have an event space gotcha will you close the current space down absolutely not okay no if i want to own the back my backyard which would be naples fort myers possibly tampa you know i wouldn't even mind going over on the other coast hey i would love that as well i definitely wouldn't be closing riptides we would be opening riptides because it's a it's a lifestyle really i think it really is a lifestyle you want it's everybody's lifestyle find me somebody who doesn't want to just spend it spend an hour hour or two even someplace where you've got something good to drink it's comfortable to sit you've got really great people to talk to i mean i don't think there's anybody that would turn that down no absolutely and it's always been a viewpoint of mine that breweries really aren't bars per se because i know my daughter is not the only child out here no not at all we have kids all the time and it seems like all the breweries in this area just start being child friendly absolutely i've had one brewery turn a visit down because i would have my daughter with me yeah no i mean breweries are someplace that a family should be able to come i mean we've got a lot of outdoor games that are family friendly no one's playing any tonight but we have quite a few like i said it's a neighborhood hangout a neighborhood hangout by definition cannot exclude an entire group of people and children would be a group of people absolutely and you know like if you're if you're out with your child do you want to have to think about you know do i have to get a sitter do i have to like drop them off at friends or can i just take them home let's go to the brewery which is one of the reasons when we took over we added root beer they didn't have any type of thing on tap that was alcohol-free interesting yeah my uh my daughter is enjoying the root beer and that's made here in-house uh actually i believe our root beer comes from anchor lab interesting no we do not make we we don't have the space to make it i'd love to say that we made it in-house but we don't but it's still made here in southwestern and it's made in southwestern yes nice to know that the region is starting to boom so much and that riptide is going to be a bigger part of that well thank you thank you as well thank you so much for coming on the show i appreciate it well thank you so much for having me it was great [Music] [Music] so if their plans come to fruition you'll be able to see riptide brewing in most places in the state hopefully sooner rather than later because they had some amazing stuff and i will definitely say that if you read the review on floridabeerblog.com right

"jsDsJg7XoLs": "[Music] [Music] Nika Bay State Park is located in the Champlain Valley and it's a little warmer and a little drier here than a lot of the other parts of Vermont there's about seven miles of trails here and they range from pretty easy to moderate nothing here is difficult but there is some elevation gain and you can make your hike as easier as hard as you want this is our third year of hosting a poetry walk in collaboration with the Brno Memorial Library and we have 15 poems that are cited along our legislate it invites people to experience the land and experience the park in a whole new way this is a library that we built about three years ago there's a lot of nature and environmental themed kids books we have some field guides for adults that want to look up species or birds that they see in the park we also have a piece of eco art which is the insect hotel that is a habitat for insects it was done so that we can help people see the benefit of insects in our ecosystem even little ones could get down and get real close to it and take a look at the bugs and the insects we have a lake sand beach which is a rare natural community in Vermont and it's home to four different species of turtles it's a great place to bring kids it's about a half-mile walk so if you have little ones and you want to introduce them to hiking it's a nice reward after a little bit of work we have cone Cove which is the best place in the park to swim the water is clear it's deep right off the rocks we've got an enormous area out here to swim laps in if you want to do that and you can also bring your dog so if you want to come down and swim with your dog your dog can swim along with you it's pretty cool the unique topography and the geology allows us to have a lot of species that don't normally grow here and so we have a lot of trees that you normally wouldn't find in Vermont that are much farther south and we also have a huge natural diversity of Wildlife I think one of the fantastic things about Vermont State Parks is this land is conserved and it's going to be here for generations to come we're the closest State Park to downtown Burlington we're about 11 miles it's a 15 20 minute drive we can help you design a hike to get out and see nature experience the best of the park and have a great time this is a beautiful park and we love to share it with everybody who comes", "xY743P_5vss": "so welcome everyone to uh test max this is barmax uh our the number one bar preparation program rated in uh both app stores and um today we're talking about preparing for the bar exam as a foreign lawyer so i'm gonna assume that most of you here today are foreign lawyers and and will be benefited from this program we have stuff about a little bit about the content of the bar exam and then the process of taking the bar exam and i have a uh our presenter today is matthias gonzalez matias can you turn on your camera and join me here are you ready anyway matias gonzalez is a very popular tutor in our ube program he has familiarity with all of the bar exams hi but particularly teaches the ube including the new york bar exam and just a bit of housekeeping before we get started if you have questions for mathias um about the content of today's webinar go ahead and put those in q and a and he will try to handle that at the appropriate pausing points in his discussion but if you have other uh questions about your uh bar exam preparation or about bar max in general then you can put those in chat because i'm also an instructor here at barmax and i'll be um in the chat answering questions as well another staff person katie at barmax is also in chat helping us out so you have lots of help here today we're here for you um and one disclaimer can we go to the disclaimer what we're not talking about today is how to qualify to take a us bar exam that is beyond our expertise because it really depends on the state it depends on what educational requirements they um accept and what they don't and the absolutely best way to learn about that is to contact your jurisdiction directly now some law schools have people who help you with this that's good for them but we are not those people so um if you don't if you're not out of us law school that's helping you with this then contact i put a couple websites up here for new york in california or whatever the jurisdiction is where you want to take the exam the one thing i will say is that new york is accepting applications from everyone who qualifies again contact them about whether that's you but it will start on april 1st so you want all your materials ready before then because they're going to limit that to 10 000 people so you want to get your application in early it's very lengthy it involves a lot of components so make sure you get it in uh that you get it all prepared so that you can get that application in early and with that um i am not going to take any further time from mathias welcome thank you celeste thank you and uh welcome all good evening uh from new york uh so today we're gonna be discussing uh what it's gonna be like for you to take the bar exam as a foreign applicant so the idea behind this presentation is that you'll see some of the areas that you'll need to focus on a lot of it will show you how barmax will help you work towards it and through it but really this is generally applicable information that um we've uh through many meetings and sessions have determined that um is the most important for foreign bar takers to know so that being said we're going to basically cover two main sections the first one is going to be content and then we're also going to be doing process so when we're talking about content we're actually talking about some of the black letter law right the black letter law that is going to be different for uh applicants that come from other countries now some of you are coming i would assume the majority of you are already practicing attorneys in another country or licensed or whatever it may be uh some of you probably a lot of you are coming from civil law countries and then some uh might have some common law backgrounds so we're gonna try and speak to the things that you need to look out for that are uniquely american in the sense of the jurisprudence and then after that we're going to talk about how briefly how you can tackle each section because the bar exam is divided into three main sections there's a performance test there's essays and then there's um more multiple choice questions than i care to remember about but we're going to walk you through how you should approach each one so that being said as far as uh content goes a few notes the uh american jurisprudence system does common law so for those of you that are coming from common law countries will recognize a lot of the law around real property contracts torts and some criminal law but not the procedural part and then for what's going to be new for all of you is going to be the us constitution the federal rules of civil procedure and the rules of evidence so regarding uh the main things that will be different for you all which is constitutional law and as an extension of that will be criminal procedure which is based on the us constitution and also the takings clause in real property which is basically when the government can come and take your property before we jump into that uh here is what some of our foreign students have said about us so that you know that we are not going into uncharted waters on this subject so i'll leave that up for all of you to read for a quick second and also we'll be doing a q a at the end so feel free to drop your questions in the chat and hopefully we'll get through as many of them as we can okay so let's talk about the us constitution uh so the us constitution is is really unique in and of itself in the way that it was carved out the way that this worked was in the 1700s obviously the united states started out as british colonies and eventually decided that they were going to revolt against uh the king of england right so after they won the revolutionary war they had to sit down and try to form a government and they ran into a lot of differences of ideas essentially it was a bunch of old white men that locked themselves literally locked themselves into a i'd say 600 square foot room in philadelphia and decided that they were going to hash out a constitution now what happened was that you had the different colonies which would become the states were demographically and geographically very different so they couldn't come to an agreement about what they wanted to do what they did all agree on is that they didn't want a king they didn't want centralized power right this was coming from uh years of dealing with england taxing the colonies and not giving them representation etc etc so as these people these men locked themselves into a room in the middle of the hot summer they came out with in the us constitution they made three co-equal branches of government and which is called the doctrine of separation of powers and then they also developed some doctrines around federalism which was what weight would be given to the powers that the colonies which would then become the individual states would have versus the power that the federal government was going to have and again there was a lot of push and pull around well we don't want to have another king right some of the drafters of the constitution even opposed the idea of a president altogether they wanted to adhere to the rules of self-governance and we mentioned this because on the bar exam this is going to come up the constitutional law is tested right and when it's tested you're going to need to uh know the difference in the separations of powers right so you have congress which is the legislative branch we have the executive which is the head of is the president and then you have the judiciary and then you have what's called federalism which is power that is left to the individual states for the purposes of governing that the federal government at the inception of our country uh did not have and still does not have that's why for all of you that follow us news you repeatedly see things where a president irrespective of a political party he believes to gets taken to court by some state or some person somewhere and whatever law he tried to put into place gets stopped so that's all because of the doctrine of separation of power then you have the doctrine of federalism so in the doctrine of federalism at the constitutional convention the colonies wanted to make sure that they retained a certain level of self-governance if you will right because again we don't want to have another king that comes dressed not as a king but as a president and the way that you will see some of this come up in the bar exam will be in the 10th and 11th amendment right you'll see that some of the powers are left to the states but at the same time a lot of with the constitutional law that will be tested is around what powers does the federal government explicitly have and so you'll see a lot of questions on the commerce clause which is congress's ability to regulate interstate commerce is an enumerated power uh left to the federal government meaning that the states cannot make protectionist uh rules to protect their own state but to the detriment of another state this all comes back to the idea that we're trying to be the united states um and this as i said will affect everything that you look at in the constitutional law portion right and it will also go into okay so let me back up i went over the separation of powers here we go okay this will also come into play when you see questions about whether the issue is a state court issue or a federal court issue and these questions whether it be an essay or a multiple choice is going to ask you to decipher which is the court that has the proper jurisdiction or it will even ask you what court can adjudicate the cases or it'll even ask you what the ruling should be how the court should hold and a lot of times whether the court can hold one way or another will come down to um the jurisdiction and the independent judiciary so that brings us in this slide you'll see you have a federal court system and then parallel to that you have a state court system okay and they kind of mirror each other you have trial level courts you have a pelican you have courts of appellate jurisdiction which means that they will review the uh the decisions made at the trial court level so in and then you have the highest court of appeals of a state or in the federal system the supreme court of the united states so in the federal court system this is called the united states district courts then you have the circuit court of appeals which basically have jurisdiction over several regions of the united states which usually encompass several states and then you have the supreme court and then in the state courts you have essentially the same thing so they're modeled the same but they both maintain their own jurisdiction over some uh areas of law so for example if it's a state law issue unless it's it could be a constitutional issue generally that's left to the state and that goes back to uh both separation of powers and federalism it's this notion that united states law leaves a lot to the states to decide by themselves except for things that are enumerated in the constitution or have been interpreted by the united states supreme court to be part of the enumerated powers left to the federal government okay so this also brings up another area of law which is tested both in the mbes and in the essays as is constitutional law which is criminal procedure criminal procedure essentially is constitutional law it's part of the amendments it's the fourth fifth and sixth amendment of uh the u.s constitution and the way that they test this is essentially they want you to know what these amendments say and how it applies to live fire scenarios so you'll get a bunch of questions about criminal suspects and what their rights are and there aren't so going back to this notion about when the uh constitution was ratified even though arguably the constitution really did give a lot of divided powers under under uh federalism and separation of powers a lot of the the found the founding fathers believed that that still gave government too much power so they ratified what's called the bill of rights and then some and what you'll see in in the bill of rights are the first ten amendments so anytime you see first amendment second amendment is not tested usually um i've never heard of a third amendment question but the fourth fifth and sixth is regularly tested in criminal procedure and in criminal procedure what you'll see is that the fourth fifth and sixth amendment limit the power of government right so in criminal scenarios so the fourth amendment essentially says that there shall be no warrantless search or seizure which again this was after the revolutionary war where there was uh there was essentially uh quartering and the government aka the uh british could come into your house could seize your things you didn't have a right against self-incrimination there was really no due process people were being uh executed and so to prevent this they wrote in these amendments which are there to protect criminal defendants or criminal suspects so the fourth amendment prevents warrantless searches and seizures which again this was what the founding fathers did at its inception as you all study for the bar you're going to realize that apparently america changed their view a little bit on the fourth amendment because you'll see that there's about 600 exceptions to the fourth amendment warrantless warrant um but it is what it is so but you will see that again this all forms from this very uniquely american thing where we are going to curtail the power of government and then we're going to make a bunch of exceptions where the government can actually do this and that's the way that the that the bar exam will test this subject on the fifth amendment you're going to get a lot of questions so the fifth amendment protects the right against self-incrimination and typically this was only when it meant you couldn't testify against yourself you couldn't be compelled to testify against yourself in a criminal proceeding 200 years after this amendment was ratified in the 1960s justice earl warren decided that well policing has changed it's not just testifying against yourself in a trial and so we got the ruling of miranda and miranda essentially says that you are allowed to not incriminate yourself when you are subject to custodial interrogation that's something that once you all review criminal procedure you will go through over and over again and essentially it's an extension of the right against self-incrimination not only to when you're being asked to take the stand against yourself in a criminal trial but also when you are in police custody and being asked questions by the police so again these amendments are there to limit the power of government right this is uniquely american thing we don't trust the government we don't believe in the government we believe in self-governance and you're going to get a bunch of questions on this stuff and generally criminal procedure is one of those things that once you get it you got it and that's what what it is and then you can move on to other things but it's very important to understand these principles right the reason why these things got written into the constitution is that we believe that the government should not have this power or well i say we the founding fathers didn't um believe that uh the government should have this power over people and then the sixth amendment enumerates several rights but the most commonly tested is the right to counsel which is you are entitled to have a lawyer and you will see how that is tested also in the mbes they'll ask when the sixth amendment right the council attaches when it doesn't right and you will see how this again is there to curtail the power of government now when it comes to criminal procedure and also uh constitutional law in constitutional law you will see that again the first 10th 11th 14th amendment some of the fourth is there to curtail the power of government right and the way that they determine if the government has violated a person's rights is they subject the action the government action to a bunch of tests you're going to get tests based on scrutiny you're going to get tests based on whether it was a state actor or a private actor and this is essentially how you're going to get the questions right because you will need to know the legal standards that are met depending on the interaction that the government is having with the individual to see if the individual is protected by rights enumerated in the u.s constitution right so for example for the first amendment the first amendment protects many things one of which is the freedom of speech under the freedom of speech if the government tries to curtail a person's as someone as a person because they can be a citizen a green card holder or uh someone who's not from the us if they're within the jurisdiction of the united states they have a freedom of speech and if the government decides to curtail that freedom of speech then they have to be subjected to certain levels of scrutiny and what and what depends on that is where where the um the curtailing of the freedom of speech is happening if it's in a public forum in a private forum what is being curtailed meaning if it's content as in they're trying to keep you from saying what you're saying or they're just trying to keep you from talking generally right and all of those things will lead you to different tests and if you determine in your analysis that the government has passed the test the level of scrutiny then the action will be constitutional and if the action is constitutional then that's the answer you gotta pick right because that's really all this matters for unless you're going to wind up being a constitutional lawyer which i encourage every single one of you that want to be one to be one it's really about how useful is this for you on the exam and the same thing goes for criminal procedure they'll give you a scenario where somebody's belongings were searched or a person was seized and they will try and determine if there was a fourth amendment violation or not meaning did the police need a warrant to do the search that they did and you'll see all the exceptions to the warrant requirement and then the same thing will happen with the fifth amendment where somebody was interrogated by the police but maybe they were in custody maybe they weren't and so by deciding on this you will determine if there was a constitutional violation or not which is what's going to help you um essentially will help you answer the questions that are prompted to you and both of these i want to reiterate criminal procedure and constitutional law can come up in an essay which we'll discuss later what essays look like and or and it can also come up and will come up in multiple choice questions so it's important to understand both the nuances of the exceptions and also how to lay out all of the doctrine um in a bit more detail than you otherwise would need to know for a multiple choice question okay so now that we've discussed the content right these are these are the things that are uniquely american in the way that they are administered as we discussed we have constitutional law and then we have uh criminal procedure and then you see this come up also in property as well sometimes there's also a process right the bar exam is very very unique um depending on what jurisdiction it is that you're taking it in whether it's the uniform bar exam or the california exam then you have three different sections but generally both the california exam and the ub offer multiple choice and in writing there's a performance test which we're going to get into in a second about what it is and what it isn't and there's also essays and the essays as i said that's about your knowledge of law and being able to lay it out meaning explain the rules that are being tested analyze them and then conclude on them so the first part is usually the perform is the performance test now in ube jurisdictions the uniform bar exam it's 40 of the written score and 20 percent of the overall score my students repeatedly neglect this until two weeks before the exam under the guise of well it's all there because they give you the law and then they it's a not good approach right um generally what you want to do is you want to give these mpts the proper time so that you learn how to do them and we'll discuss uh briefly how how you should approach these and then in california it's uh so i'm sorry in the uv is two tasks so you get two of these scenarios and in california it's one task which is approximately 28 of the written score and 14 of the overall score and this is tested everywhere except in puerto rico and yes including the district of columbia meaning washington dc okay so now for the purposes of the uniform bar exam it's two tasks in three hours right so when i say task i mean literally they hand you a book and it's almost like you're in a law firm except it's not as we'll discuss and you are asked to do something you're asked to write a memo you're asked to write a brief you're asked to do lawyerly work in california it's one task and it's 90 minutes if any of you want to see this in more detail you can check out the performance tests uh webinar it's called performance tests what graders want webinar what graders want it's the webinar and as well as our other bar max videos so okay all right so what are some of the issues that are faced by we're really by all examining these but certainly by foreign examinees it's timing timing timing i cannot stress this enough anyone well maybe not anyone but most competent people can write a good performance test in an unlimited time because you're essentially given the whole universe in which you will be operating however you're not given that right on the ube you got three hours to do two of them or you have 90 minutes in california to do one right and i believe the biggest thing that will trip up foreign lawyers is that a lot of you are already practicing so you're used to being handed tasks like these and you're used to doing them well the problem is that you're used to doing them at most in a whole work day or in half a workday either way it's a longer period of time than what is allocated in the bar exam in the bar exam you have an hour and a half to read the assignment you have an hour and a half to read i'm sorry to read the assignment to look at your library which is your law the law that is being presented to you they give it to you whether it be statutes cases treatises etc then you have your facts in the case that you have to analyze you have to review those as well and you have to draft what it is that is being asked of you to draft in an hour and a half so whether it be the memo persuasive brief or whatever it is that is being asked of you everything has to happen in an hour and a half so when i say that they call this the performance test right because they want to see how good a lawyer you're going to be i can't imagine even at the most stringent law firm you will be asked to produce a document within an hour and a half that will actually be used in any legal context right it would probably border on malpractice but for the purposes of the bar exam they do want that so they'll call it a simulation but you need to not treat it like a simulation you need to actually review things at a much faster pace and i would say in less detail than you would in your work environment okay another thing will also be i'm sure that every single one of you speaks great english and can carry on a great conversation and um and so on and so forth however writing tends to be different um english is not my first language there's times where i spell things phonetically in spanish and i get them wrong and i grew up in the states and so um this will happen my advice to you all is to streamline the um the language issue which is essentially go forth as directly as you can don't be eloquent and we'll get to that in a second um going back to the uh mp the pt the performance test being a condensed version right so as i said this inter office memo has to happen in an hour and a half so you're not aiming for perfection right i mean you obviously want to put something out there that is readable because you're going to be graded on it but you're not aiming for perfection in the performance test they do ask you to follow memo format so they do want you to follow what would otherwise be the presentation of a formal document but it is not uh to the level of perfection and actually if you start spending time on that first of all there's no points allocated to formatting perfection and second of all you are taking away time from actually getting information on the paper or on the computer that will get you the points to pass so again you want to do the memo or persuasive brief whatever it is that is given to you after reviewing the library and the assignment in a topical way so what i mean by that is is if you are given three things that you're asked to analyze then you need to find the law and you need to find how it applies to your facts and you need to deliver that on the paper you do not need to write a theoretical uh paper you know going into each and every single one of the areas or interpretation of the law that you've been given if you do that you will run out of time on the ube you will run out of time into your second uh performance test because you'll spend more than an hour and a half on the uh on the first one this is assuming that the jurisdiction which you take it in does both of the performance tests in three hours now with the pandemic they're breaking up a lot of these depending on the jurisdiction they're doing an hour and a half so they actually stop you after the first performance test and then you begin the second one or so i'm sorry they stopped you before yeah the second performance test so i say this to basically tell you tear down everything that you know okay you are not trying to write a perfect performance test here you're not trying to write a perfect memo that is not what they're looking for to give you points they're looking to see that you are analyzing understanding what is being assigned to you and that you are delivering it in a written document within an hour and a half right they're testing comprehension and they're testing a little bit of uniformity because they do allocate some points to format they are not testing how good a lawyer you are even though that's what they call the performance test that's what they portray the performance test to be all of you are already amazing lawyers or will be amazing lawyers the performance test is not the time to show that the performance test is the time to get it done get in and get out and move on to the next things right because it is at the end of the day 20 of the um of the bar and we do want to do well on it but we don't want it to be the reason why we already start the bar exam behind um nor do we need to pay that much attention to it because it's only 20 okay so as i was touching on earlier about dealing with um potential language barriers so when it comes to language barriers you want to write directly when i say writing directly i mean try to think about how your parent probably your mother spoke to you after she told you things five or six times right you it doesn't matter what culture you come from moms are pretty consistently consistent throughout the world when they're telling you something for the fifth time they're telling you in few words and in a very direct statement because what's coming after that is not fun right so you want to channel your inner parent to some extent for some of you might be your father or other significant parental unit but that's who you want to channel when you're writing you want to say what you have to say obviously you can take the animosity off but you can uh you need to just say what it is you need to say directly so that means um don't write in past or future tense right english is a weird language we conjugate verbs in a very different way than a lot of other languages so don't try to speak in past tense or in in future tense or anything but directly act like you are speaking to that child that is apparently not understanding what you're trying to tell them right um eloquence is not your friend eloquence meaning showing how good you are at speaking english even though it's not your first language which i'm sure all of you speak and write it wonderfully is not going to help you on the performance test right just say what you need to say as long as you are conjugating verbs properly and you are speaking in complete sentences you will be fine right you don't need to be shakespeare for this i i can't emphasize that enough i would like to think that i can write really good motions in my work and i do good legal writing when i took the bar exam and i did the mpt or the performance test i did not care i just said what i had to say i got as much of it and all of it on the paper within an hour and a half and then i moved on and now after i pass the bar i take my dandy time on all the motions and legal briefs that i write because i take a lot of pride in my eloquence but again in the bar exam that is not what you want to do so make sure that again you're tearing down what you know because there's no points allocated for that so the way you want to approach this is if there's no points given to it then i'm not giving it any attention right so that also that brings me to making your points i feel like speaking another language we tend to be a bit more wordy this brings me back to speaking directly say what you have to say you don't need to preface uh statements or paragraphs with two three sentences given context do a half sentence of context and then get on to the things that are going to give you points um on these uh on on the performance test okay so after you do the performance test then you have the essay portion so the two subjects that we discussed earlier as i said they're tested both in the essay portion and they can be tested rather in the essay portion some they alternate what they test so some years they'll come up some years they won't um and it's tested on the mbe for the purposes of the ube you get six essays which is sixty percent of your written score and thirty percent of your overall score even though it's only thirty percent this tends to be what kind of makes or breaks a lot of test takers uh both foreign and um domestic so you want to make sure that you have your game plan going into essays i have unfortunately seen a good amount of very bright good legal legally knowledgeable people with great writing skills that did not perform well on the essay portion because they were not again giving them what it is that they wanted for the purposes of obtaining points in california it's five essays and you get one hour for each they actually want a bit more um detail actually quite a bit more and in that case it's 71 percent of the written score and 35 of the overall score so there is seven subjects that are tested in multiple choice plus there is there is other subjects which are tested in the uh essay portion okay so you get 30 minutes for each and it could be on any of the subjects that you all see there so the big seven which is civil procedure constitutional law contracts crimes evidence real property torts and and those are the ones that are also tested in the mbe which can be tested in um the uh the essays as well plus you're responsible for knowing everything you see there on the right column which is agency and partnership corporations family law secure transactions trust wills and conflicts of law which is like usually a crossover now obviously there's only six essays so they can't test all of these things they tend to take turns in each administration of the test in choosing what topics they will test we don't know which ones they'll test so and no one does even if they purport to based on 20 years of analyzing it's at best an educated guess so you need to make sure that you um that you know that you have enough knowledge to write about and discuss all of these subjects now obviously the big seven you're learning anyway because you have to do uh mbe uh questions on them multiple choice questions but the other ones you have to learn only for the purpose of they might appear on the bar exam um yes i agree with any of you that might be thinking that that might be too much but it it is it is the system that we operate in uh so some of the states that don't administer the uniform bar exam will substitute some of what you see there with state-specific material um which we won't get into today so what you can do is you can look up if you're planning on taking it in a state that is not a uniform bar exam state uh what they the law examiner the bar examiners there have determined his fair game to be tested so in the california bar it's the seven mbe subjects plus professional responsibility community property wills trusts agency and partnerships and corporations so those are again the you might get them you might not they're the the wild cards if you will of the uh well they're all wild cards but at least the big seven you're going to see in the multiple choice okay so challenges that foreign lawyers will face in in doing the essays a lot of countries still test this level of knowledge orally where you're asked to recite the things that that um the areas of law and analysis that is that you have to do that doesn't happen here right um other countries require very extensive writing again california requires a bit more extensive but for the purposes of the uniform bar exam they're only giving you a half hour to write this read and write it right so you're probably not writing at most more than 20 minutes so there's only so much that you can say in 20 minutes right so usually in the ube essays you might get about three to five issues right so you get presented a scenario you get a almost it's almost always a whole page of a factual hypo hypothetical and then at the end they tell you that somebody brought a motion to dismiss that somebody uh you know wants to exclude evidence or wants to do this or do that or they tell you how should the court rule either way which is not fun because it requires a bit more of understanding exactly what it is that is happening in the fact pattern but in this fact pattern issues will be triggered and generally they are three to five issues right and usually it's cohesive they tend to test one area of law right but they have over time gone more towards testing hybrid essays so that means that the question might have a it might be a contracts question but it might be that the litigants are in different states and so it might throw in there a jurisdictional issue which is civil procedure or they might throw in there a conflict of law issue um i believe the when i took the bar exam we got a constitutional law and civil procedure hybrid right so they're asking you things about how should the court rule on this from a standpoint of if do they even have jurisdiction to do this and also there was a question in there about is this even constitutional so they have shown a propensity to move a little bit more towards those things in california you get about six to ten issues for each essay but you have an hour to write them so it's essentially similar but just more extensive and so therefore they require a bit more detail but overall i would say comparatively speaking this is a much more concise format that they require of you in the written portion of or typed portion of the bar exam and lastly it's going to be very important that you follow iraq format okay so what is iraq iraq stands for issue rule application conclusion so the first thing that you need to do is you need to identify the issue or the legal principle that is being that is that that is the same word at issue in the fact pattern right so what is the problem right what is the why why did they give you this somebody needs legal advice right and so that's and you're being asked to analyze that right and so that's the issue you need to identify what the issue is what happens to every examinee until they practice and practice and get better is that they'll do one of two things though either or three things they'll spot issues that aren't there so they'll essentially create a controversy where there's not one they'll completely miss the issue which means they won't even realize it was a problem or they will over explain an issue or misinterpret an issue that they so that they did find it they found it but they interpreted the scope of the rule wrong maybe they were missing an element and so they got the wrong uh conclusion so that brings us to stating the applicable rule right so you're going to get this fact pattern it's going to be matias and celeste how to contract and uh matthias breached so celeste wants to sue right well that could be a hundred things it could be is there a defense to a breach of contract and obviously the fact pattern will give you a lot more because it's a whole page it'll tell you exactly what's happening but you need to be able to identify the issue and state the proper rule right and the rule is going to come from your outlines if you're using barmax it's going to be all the things which are on the ipad which you're able to highlight as well or if you're studying from or if you're starting from our book it'll be in the outlines there and that's what you'll need to deliver you will need to explain what the black letter law on this issue is right that's where you're testing your your you're beginning to test your legal knowledge after you've stated the rule which is hopefully the correct rule uh for the sake of doing well on the essay uh you need to analyze by explaining how the rule applies which is the application portion so you need to explain how the rule that you just stated applies to the facts of the fact pattern which you are given so matthias and celeste are suing each other well what is the problem that is going on there and based on your rule you need to take your rule as i call it elementize it which means separate it into separate elements separate portions of the rule and go through each of the elements and say okay is this element met is this element met or not met and then whatever you determine if you determine that all the elements of the rule are met then you have a legal conclusion which is number four to come to if you determine that the elements of the rule are not met then you your conclusion should be another way this kind of goes back to the criminal procedure and constitutional law things that i was saying they're essentially going to tell you in crim pro somebody was arrested did the police need a warrant or not you're going to take the exact rule right which is generally going to flow from one of the amendments plus the exceptions et cetera et cetera and then you will determine based on the facts who was correct was the government correct was the suspect uh were the suspects rights violated and so you give your conclusion and you answer the question right which the question will say should the case be dismissed should uh was the government correct things like that and you will do that three to five times in one of the essays now this sounds like a lot but you will spend so much time reviewing rules after rule after rule that you'll just be able to recite them off the top of your head and you will hopefully do enough questions to understand how all how each rule applies the proper scope of application for each rule which will lead you to the right conclusion so what the bar examiners do is they don't allocate any points for identifying the correct issue generally what they do do are at least in the ube jurisdictions in um what they get points for is did you state the right rule and did you state it completely did you apply the rule correctly meaning did you walk through the statute as i said did you go through the rule to determine what the analysis was and lastly did you conclude correctly and if you do so on all those things then you receive all the points that are allocated to that issue and then you do it over again and then you do it over again and then you do it over again and you finish that essay and then you do it five more times um but that's essentially what it is that's why learning process is just as important as learning content otherwise anyone that the state bars decide is eligible to take the bar exam would be able to take it and pass if all they had to do was memorize right it's about testing your knowledge and your application of the rules because although the bar exam does not really resemble how you practice law it does uh go into how legal work tends to play out a bit right which is you know the law you apply to the facts that your client comes in with and then you give them your legal advice right except in the bar exam you're doing it in a half hour three to five times um for three hours straight or now with the pandemic they break it up some jurisdictions do into an hour and a half at a time okay and as far as the mbe questions is concerned um they're just multiple choice questions four answer choices we won't get into that here but there's another webinar um that speaks to that um but they're essentially asking you to do the same thing which is analyze law and give your conclusion except your conclusion is actually going to be in one of the uh four answer choices that are there for you okay so with that i leave you with some of what what our students are saying and i know we want to open it up for uh a bit of q a sorry i muted myself um is the new york bar available for international applicant i am not sure i think that that was within the things that we said unfortunately we wouldn't be covering today um do you know if they have indicated the options taken online i i do not know um so again we're we're going to kind of speak to you know content versus process issues unfortunately um i mean i am admitted in new york but this was before the pandemic and i can't really speak to um what the um what it is that they're doing now okay uh do you think the remote version of the bar exam is here to stay oh that's a good question ah this is very convenient for foreign uh not based in california have you heard anything about it i personally haven't um yeah i okay other than my own personal opinion which seems to be what you're asking um i don't have i would imagine that that they should right because of how convenient it makes it however if i had to take a guess if at some point we ever go back to normal which who knows what the new normal will be um i would imagine they're going to start making people sit for it again but i don't know i have no idea this is usually decided though by judges at the highest level in each state right so it's not like it's a very democratic process that's all i can tell you about it what is black letter law black letter law means the law as it's actually written in the constitution in the rules of federal procedure in the rules of evidence etc anywhere that it is written um that is what is the black letter law meaning um for example the first amendment protects the freedom of speech right that is the black letter law it's it's almost your rule statement if you will that's what we we mean this comes from the saying of it got put into black ink right it's what's written down um i would appreciate some tips on how to pass california bar with the english as a second language experience okay well hopefully we gave you a um a few um i've noticed that i ran out of time during the bar exam even though i know the answer well we spoke to uh for victoria we spoke to some of those um those uh things here right about being concise in your writing if english is not your first language right in the present tense keep it moving right you don't have to be a law guru for the purposes of the bar exam the bar exam is a test of minimum competency um so yes uh and um this webinar will be available later so feel free to revisit it as a foreign lawyer when preparing for the bar i noticed that no matter how many times i read a subject and understanding my results in the mbe portion of the exam are very poor and this is very discouraging any tips would be very wrong um i would say do them open book uh untimed and the way that i would tell you to do this would be go through the read the question right the call of the question and the fact pattern think about what rule is triggered and then stop before you ever look at the answer choices go into your outline open the outline to the rule that you think is the one that applies to that question and fact pattern read through the rule ask yourself is that the whole rule that i was thinking about or is that the rule it was it most of it did i miss an exception was i not remembering the whole thing and then you take it as it is right so you read it kind of understand what's going on in the rules and then you go back to the fact pattern and you run the rule through the fact pattern so you apply it to the facts and without ever looking at the answer choices i encourage you all to use a flash card if you're doing it on paper to cover the answer choices you are going to apply the rule that you found and that you think is correct to the um to the uh rule uh i'm sorry to the fact pattern in the question and you're going to determine what the answer to the question is right so the answer is usually going to be there's is going to be yes because or no because right so you want to know okay the answer here is going to be yes because and it's this part of the rule or no because and it's this part of the rule is not triggered right and then after you already know what the answer is you take the flash card off or you do whatever it is you look at the answer choices and you did and you look for an answer choice which reflects your reasoning if you still get the question wrong you stop and you ask yourself what did i do wrong here right uh what did i what what went wrong did i not understand the scope of the rule did i just not understand the rule did i not understand the applicability of the rule and what i always tell my students is then go back and annotate your outline to reflect what it is that you got wrong in that question so that you're constantly dialing in right you're constantly adjusting the rule to make it work for you because the rule is only as good as it's going to help you get a question right on the uh on the bar okay so uh i would appreciate some tips on how to uh another second lineup notice okay yeah that's i think a repeat um louisa yes please give us tips to pass bar exam for esl students okay so i i believe that i uh that i touched on a few of those um you know the general principles that we've noticed um about english as a second language students again english is not my first language um so i fully empathize emphasize with all of you and um yeah again you know make sure you're concise speak in present tense um you don't have to show them your best english you just have to it just has to make sense so they can give you points uh do you recommend to state in the beginning of the paper that taking the bar exam as a foreign attorney please consider english as my second language should we let examiners know that uh merv i i think that's one of those things that goes without saying um i think that even people who america or american or native english speakers that don't test as well on the bar still at least you know lay their ideas out okay because they speak the language so i don't think it's necessary i'll give it to you this way i wouldn't i wouldn't say anything about it um also i've only met one bar grader they're kind of like unicorns you've heard about them but you've never seen one um and she didn't seem like a very animated or empathetic person generally so i don't know to what extent that'll help um i think that if you want to pass the bar exam you have to learn the law and learn how to take the bar exam not how to practice law not how to do anything else just learn what it is that they want from you i tell all my students the same thing i say this is seen behind the curtain for any of you that have seen the uh very old movie the wizard of oz um at the very end of the movie he says pay no attention to the man behind the curtain right or something i'm paraphrasing well once you see behind the curtain you can't unsee it remember once the in the in the movie once they saw behind the curtain they just there was no wizard anymore right um for me that's the way i felt when i was taking my bar exam and certainly thereafter when i when i've tutored is that once i saw behind the curtain and by that i mean i understood what they wanted for me on the mbes i understood how they were almost always testing exceptions to the rule or they were trying to make you fall into an emotional trap um right where they give you really bad egregious facts somebody that you just want to you know throw in jail for the rest of their lives and then it turns out that the law protects them right in some way um or on the essays understanding that you know what i'm just gonna give them what they want here's your issue here's your rule here's your application here's your conclusion goodbye i hope i never see you all again right on the performance test yes i knock on wood have never lost emotion have won every motion to dismiss and i will write to where the judge doesn't even want to keep reading the judge just says counselor please tell me what this is about right but i get to do that in practice on the performance test i gave them what they wanted in an hour and a half and i moved on and i finished both of them the majority of my friends the ones that passed and the ones that didn't did not finish the amputees and that essentially put them in a position where they were start they were trying to play catch-up already after the the first session so that's why it's very important to understand what it is that they want from you on the performance test like i said which is concise and good delivery versus you know this um extensive legal analysis or argument depending on what kind of scenario you get um so it was a bit long-winded but merv i hope that that answers your question okay um kiama um matthias do you provide tutorial services for california takers if you i unfortunately um i can i'm licensed in uh ube jurisdictions uh in new york not in california we have excellent california tutors uh can you recommend the tutor um yeah okay i see celeste is answering um see celeste is the wizard or uh behind the curtain today she's uh celeste is going to answer this question live okay all right let's see um i just lost my place here um how to download this handout okay so i guess it says celeste is going to answer this question live i'm guessing that's coming up at the end just an impact question can we also i i'm sorry i clicked that button by mistake oh you did okay blizzard behind the curtain huh anyway um the handout will not be available but the video itself will be viewable within barmax and on the test max youtube page keep answering these questions mathias bye i'm here for them i i love doing this uh technology is not my thing as you all figured out um you're lucky i can get on facebook um let's see john michael vita uh nitpicky question can we use crack instead of uh crac conclusion rule application um and then conclusion for the new york bar that you can do it you okay so my students ask me this question all the time they say matthias is this a stylistic choice iraq or is this um you you or or is this what's actually needed here's what i will say to you about it uh john that um let's say you do crack versus you know c-rack instead of um uh iraq um let's say that you have the right rule and the analysis is good but um your conclusion's wrong i i know for a fact that i concluded incorrectly on at least two of the essay uh not questions but you know issues um and still wind up scoring right when you can score which goes to show you you can get things wrong and still do well um but if your conclusion's wrong but everything else is right you'll pick up points for the right rule and a good analysis you're going to lose points in some of the analysis in the conclusion right so if you're doing the c-rack right you're already you're already letting the bar grader know hey i got this wrong right versus you're developing in iraq you're developing a good issue statement you're giving a good rule good analysis and then towards the latter part you're like oh but he got the conclusion wrong right so remember these uh bar examiners um have like three minutes to grade each essay i don't want to you know have any preconceived notions of anyone but i don't remember being 10 11 years old um for career day anybody standing up even the people that stood up and said i want to be a lawyer saying i want to be a bar grader right these people are probably doing it because it pays the bills and maybe they're in academia and they want some insight right so they're not going to spend an awful lot of time so give them what they want right i'm all about giving what they want so they give you the points you are in a transactional relationship with the bar grader uh you just need to give them what they want and they need to give you the points and that is it uh fernando mbe 50 uh how much time for mbe i don't know what you mean by mbe 50 if that's where you're testing or if that's um [Music] uh what they want but uh that's not that's not what jurisdictions generally want you generally need to score higher depending on where you are um usually in the mid 60s is where you want to fall um how much time for the mbe so it's 200 questions in six hours which is um which is before the pandemic was broken up into um two three hour segments with lunch in between uh a hundred questions each three hours since the pandemic uh they've started doing 50 questions an hour and a half half hour break and another hour and a half with another 50 questions you go to lunch for about an hour hour and a half depending on the jurisdiction you're in you come back in afternoon and you do again 50 questions in an hour and a half and then half hour break and then 50 questions for um the next 50 uh an hour and a half for the next 50 questions um and my understanding is that you can't go back once you've completed those 50. so um that's what i can tell you about timing for mbe it comes out to about a minute and 40 something seconds for each mbe question um so anyway look up your jurisdiction though right if you're taking it in new york check because it's a moving target but yeah um what was the format of the remote exam in february well again this uh depends on the jurisdiction uh different ube jurisdictions did it differently i had a student in missouri who basically took the exam like there was no pandemic i guess um except oh well they wore masks um and we're socially distanced but other than that um that's the format they did new york did um new york did an hour and a half for so the the two two amputees the two tasks which is usually three hours for the two tasks they divided up to an hour and a half each with a half hour break in between then you come back in afternoon and the first day and you have the six essays and in february they did three essays in an hour and a half you took a half hour break and in uh after the half hour break you came back and you did another three um another three uh essays and then for the mbes it's what i just said about 50 questions hour and a half half hour break 50 questions lunch 50 questions half hour break another 50 questions and you're done a total of 200 multiple choice questions evelyn there are some rules in the outline that take more than one sentence how can one condense into one sentence writing an essay um so i apologize if what i said if i misspoke or if it didn't make um sense not every rule will be one sentence but you still want to strive to be as concise as possible right so a lot of that is creating your own study materials right so if you take this big rule right like parole evidence for example take the elements that are important in it and make it into your own rule statement that still has all of the black letter law right but that is not as wordy that's what i mean about being concise um now listen this is not there's not a you know you can only be so concise but if you compress it enough it becomes less things to remember and less things to type back out which you will still receive full points for um okay is the remote new york exam different from the traditional exam uh so it's different in the process which i just discussed in detail a few times um should you study differently i think the only thing you should do differently if anything i personally wouldn't do anything differently but if you want to do something differently it would be um maybe when you do your practice um your practice exams for your mbes do them 50 questions an hour and a half so do it in test conditions right and what however it is they're going to test your administration of the bar exam which is a bit of a moving target but at least the last two october and february has been um um has been an hour and a half 50 questions half an hour so practice the way you're going to test is my short answer for that um let's see um okay i think maybe celeste answered that question i don't know it disappeared um okay uh how much time for the mbe we already did that one what is the law other than the black letter law there's not but there's interpretations of the law right so the scope of the rule but yeah black letter law means what's actually written in the uh in the uh in the rule book constitution whatever it be okay hold on i want to make sure i didn't skip any bodies okay what was the format i answered that um there's some rules and now yeah okay condensed how many parts what is the law other than the black letter law okay anna um for the performance test i found that certain cases were hard to understand which i consider a comprehension problem having to process the cases and notifications if you're challenging any suggestions to address that would the solution be to read the cases and make myself familiar so um so again in the performance test um you get the task memo then you have your lot your fax section then your library and then you have the right the task memo tells you what it is that you need to do the um the uh i would i would advise you to go from the task memo to the library right because you know what you need to do from the task memo and then in the library you know what um now you know what the law is around what it is that you need to answer and then after that you read the facts and the facts tell you what it is that you need to do um or rather give you everything to put it together and draft it um my suggestion other than that now obviously we can go we do go into a lot of detail with this with the students um but the the gist of it if i had to give you my my one liner on this would be compartmentalize your time so yes doing everything in 45 minutes is challenging so get used to doing the task memo reading it in three minutes get used to um get used to doing um the library in 10 to 15 minutes somewhere between that get used to reading the facts in about 15 minutes or so and then outline before you start writing so compartmentalize your time instead of saying i have to do these four these three things read the task memo read the library read the um the uh the uh what do you call it the facts section um in 45 minutes say okay i have 15 minutes for this 15 minutes for that 10 minutes for this also um outlining what you're about to write typically is a bit more tedious in the first 45 minutes but then makes the next 45 um easy or easier there's nothing easy on the bar we just need to write the rule or we need to cite it you don't need to cite rules citation is not required i mean like you can say something like you know under the rules of federal civil procedure a court has personal jurisdiction um when a person is domiciled in the state where the district in the forum state where the district court is located right um but you don't need to say under rule i don't even know what rule number that is but yeah so to your point you don't need to cite it right because i clearly don't know um now in your performance tests when you're taking your rule and putting into what you're analyzing it there you need to cite the case that is given to you um in in the library section there you do need to cite it so that's a small distinction there for uh louisa um muhammad i'm sorry i got confused there's a bar exam for foreigners different from those who got no it is the same bar exam uh because i heard before that california has one pt and two essays i think you might be talking about the baby bar i don't know i'm not a licensed in california i know that california offers what they call the baby bar but i think that's for that's just an alternate avenue to getting your law license in california which is available to international students as well as students that went to a um went to a law program in uh in the united states as well okay juan jose do you think the bar max calendar is suitable for foreign lawyers or would you advise us to go through the documents at our own pace structure um generally i think that the bar max calendar is is a good tool to start off with now what i tell my students is life doesn't happen in a vacuum right um what i do for my students is i give them their own count their own individual calendar which is usually based off of what bar max has but tailored to their specific needs um or time constraints so i would say uh for quanko said do do that um uh you know try to i don't know about doing it at your own pace i think you know the test is when the test is right so you can't delay the test and you got to know everything or not know everything but you have to study everything before the exam so um so yeah i would say maybe touch it up a bit to uh your needs but make sure that you've gotten through the material by the time you have to take the exam right so if that means you're working monday through friday well then guess what your friends are not going to see you on weekends for the next three months right this is the way it it is um but yeah so i would say tailor it a bit i definitely do that for my students um i mean like i said i give them a whole new thing but yeah i would say work off of that and make it work for you to where you're you're reaching the same end the goal line um at the same time but your own way or starter earlier okay thomas chambers uh matias what balance of time time split would you suggest in terms of preparing for the multiple choice tests and the essays uh great question thomas so i'll i'm going to tell you this anecdotally because i think that it's specific to each person's needs they gave us a course uh in law school my last semester and i remember like the first day of the course they had us do an essay and i remember i like got my name on there and that was it and so i was like so i said okay i need to personally focus a lot of time on um essays so i probably spent about 65 of my time or 70 of my time on essays but that is not to say everybody should do that i did that because i felt like my essay writing needed a lot of work and excuse me because i'm also a good multiple choice test taker i historically have been i used to not ever study for anything in school but if it was multiple choice i could figure out a way to pass it just by you know um understanding what it was that my teacher was trying to test um so i would say do if you feel like the essays will be a problem for you then maybe you allocate a little more time now i will say i wound up my situation was a bit weird i scored higher on the essays than i did on the mbes um because i allocated so much time to it and the mbe score my understanding is it's uh it's curved so even with the curve i still scored higher on the essays i scored i i scored up there um and then i think 90 something percentile but it was maybe a bit of over compensation um so you gotta you know i will say this though equal time is not the answer right it is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor with the bar exam where you see that the work is needed is where you allocate the work would you advise that again more time to multiple choice subjects or a complete balance that covers essay topics too so um so that's the big seven versus the plus right um i think inherently you have to spend more time on the big seven because those are going to come up if they don't come up in an essay they're going to come up on multiple choice um and you'll see when you guys uh take bar max that some of the other um uh you'll see the way that the time is allocated more time is allocated towards the big seven why because they're tested uh more so you have to do them uh you have to spend a little more time on them and also remember the the other subjects they might not even come up i and if you any of you guys wound up being my students you will hear the story again because i i lead with it um um for my bar exam i made the mistake of saying oh but wills has been tested like three years in a row and they only test it you know once every two years usually so there's no way that they're going to test it again and so and i didn't take the course in law school so to this day if a friend of mine if somebody wants me to write a will for them i refer it out you know like i'll just before go like i just had a bad experience with not wills as a subject to study now after years of teaching but it just left a bad taste in my mouth so i get to the uh my bar exam we do the performance test the second performance test is a hypothetical about wheels which was great because they give you everything you need in the performance test so i i thought great they already tested it here kinda they're sure as heck not gonna do it on the uh on the essays again um and then we come back in afternoon i open the essays and the first essay the first line says so and so wrote a will and so that just goes to show you that you don't know you can hedge your bets i did i want them doing fine um but i would advise you not to right like that if that's one thing if i could go back and get a higher score that i would do is i would give the other subjects a bit more time um so don't neglect them i guess is the short answer right but definitely the big seven do get more time because they're tested in both sections matias what was your memorization style from anonymous attendee okay so anonymous what i would say is for memorizing i so i did this in okay a little back story uh they tell you take a week between graduation here in the us and starting to study for the bar and i wasn't going to take that chance so i started a week early right we graduated on a friday and monday i was in there so i went back to my school and i stole commandeered a room uh in my law school and what i did is by the time i was done studying that room literally every square foot of the wall or square meter for those of you who are in other countries that do the metric system was covered in these huge sticky notes right um like literally it it looks like this right but it's as big as a poster but it sticks to the wall and i wrote things big enough even though i unfortunately one of the many things that law school gave me uh was uh bad vision um i could see it from where i was sitting in the room so i was in like this little spinny chair right and i could turn and see what rule it was so and it kept the flow going quicker especially in the latter part of the study so writing big things flash cards i never did flashcards in my life until i started studying for the bar but i found color-coded flashcards to work so if i found something that was commonly tested and that was um also something that two things right getting it wrong all the time or most of the time and commonly tested i put it in a red flash card right so like red meant i needed to give it attention so that's another thing i did i also made acronyms right things that would help me understand also the sticky note thing or whatever sticky posters or whatever they're called something that helped me but i don't know if this is individual to me was i could in the bar exam take myself back to the area of the room where that poster was and it was almost like i could see the poster and then i would just read off of it in my head right i don't know if that works for other people um i know people learn or memorize by listening i have a student who i'm very confident just passed the bar exam despite a bunch of adversity that got thrown at him um he listened to tapes he liked to listen to tapes uh i could listen that's a quick way to put me to sleep is getting me to listen to something so um you got to kind of find your own way what i will say is do what's been working for you if you've memorized the majority of your life doing it one way do that and then add to that don't just come in with a new idea um for the purpose of the bar exam that's a yeah you don't want to do that um uh chi with the remote exam how is the mpt done so my understanding is that essentially what they do is they give you two screens they give you the whole file which used to be a paper file um uh they give it to you and that's on one side of you can put that on one side of the screen and then you have what you draft is in another window if that makes sense um and i believe you get virtual scratch paper as well jane dixon um how do you suggest to cite the rule so again for the essays you don't need to cite um unless you mean yeah you know so there's no citation needed on the essays is it verbatim or or you mean given the rule giving the rule you want to be as close to verbatim as possible you don't want to paraphrase because that can change the legal meaning of a rule now being you know completely honest i absolutely um paraphrased some of the rules on the bar exam because i just couldn't remember them but you want to make sure you minimize how much you're doing that um let me uh stop sharing here there we go okay all right that's better um now i can see the questions bigger because as i said law school took my vision um okay let's see um let me see let me see all right um sometimes the rule itself is wordy and complicated yes jane um you're right they are so what i would say is make sure you have at a very minimum the buzzwords of each rule right um but yes some of the words some of the rules are just uh yeah very very wordy and just not any fun um how do you cite a juris prudence as a rule i don't i don't know what you mean by jurisprudence uh you mean you can just say under the constitution under the rules of federal civil procedure under the rules of evidence okay let's see um let's see uh merg i was just curious if grammar mistakes will cost us losing points uh on the essays my understanding is it doesn't on the performance test uh i think excessive misspelling they could take points off for um yeah it's they can understand but yeah so okay uh okay thank you for coma okay if one does not get all the points in the if one does not get all the points in the point sheet on the performance test can one still pass the performance test yes if you think about it the the bar exam is graded out of 400 points right the uniform bar exam and i mean i i yeah i scored a 303 right which is what 76 of the points is the raw score and my score was in the upper 90th percent or in the 90th percentile plus of the country so that goes to show you that the majority of passing people only get some around two-thirds depending on the jurisdiction they require a different score but generally it's around two-thirds of everything is what you need so yes you can lose points but again they're easy points to pick up so don't go in there thinking uh you know i'm going to give up the points here you don't need all of them but you want to still do well on it because again it sets you ahead it gives you wiggle room on the essays or it requires you to do perfectly on the essays um let's see okay on iraq you mentioned identify the issue and legal principle what do you consider the legal principle um that's kind of the same thing as the issue right which is what is what is the problem that's what i was speaking to maybe it was a bit um vague but yeah that's what i meant so the issue same thing is the issue um jasenya uh we we need to buy all the laws to study first or only with the bar max is enough for a foreign lawyer um just anyhow what i can tell you is is that um the bar max materials um the book the um the uh the outline which is also available electronically uh all of that is enough to get you to pass the bar exam um so i hope that answers your question which again that's gonna have the rules in the laws that are that are tested right in your experience in students how many months do you suggest studying um i studied uh 10 weeks no the bar exam no i studied late june july no i studied eight weeks i studied eight weeks but i think as a foreign student you want to make sure you uh give it more time um let me see yeah so you know again it's up to you right it's like you start engaging with the material you realize it's kind of dense then you need more time right okay david uh thank you sorry matthias that's okay layton decided to pop in any advice on how to more efficiently have a study group run i'm part of a group i was educated in the us but live in the u.s territory uh bar max is the best hands down i'll take july bar and waiting on february results i've learned toward i've leaned towards tutoring but don't want it to be expensive babysitting is your memory photographic all right so a few things um how to efficiently run a study group uh david i'm gonna tell you right now i don't study with other people i don't i don't study with other people i don't write motions with other people i i i don't know but that's just my style i know that people you know do well when when they do when they study with other people so but i'm the wrong guy to ask on that i think when it comes to studying i have a style and so i do it on my own obviously um i i i teach my style uh because it worked on the bar um you said you don't want it to be expensive babysitting well david here's what i can tell you the degrees you see behind me are not babysitting degrees so i don't babysit but um but and i don't and i would i know i'm speaking for all the other tutors we don't baby they don't babysit anyone at all um what we're there to do is is to give you the tools um to make sure that you're ready to go so we're certainly happy that you're um that you're happy with us uh sounds like you live in a beautiful place as well uh good for you i've been freezing in new york for four months um and uh yeah so if you go with the tutoring it's not expensive babysitting that there's very few um categorical truths in life um and that is one of them that you're not gonna get babysat um is my memory photographic uh i've had people tell me that i don't even know what that means um to be honest with you i i do learn better by seeing things than listening yes um so that's maybe why doing a lot of things where i was writing out helped um uh justinia thank you no thank you uh chi i want to take the bar this july can i start studying now i graduated 10 years ago from the uk uh chi i don't know if i'm saying your name correctly chi or key um yeah you can you can start studying anytime right and if you feel like you're a bit removed from the materials i think starting earlier is is a better decision um so yes you can study anytime you can start any time um if your my understanding is if you purchase our our uh course once you purchase it it's it it's available to you so um uh anonymous attendee do you have any thoughts on photo about photo reading i i'm sorry i don't know what photo reading is um yeah uh javier lopez just a comment i took twenty oh howie how are you i don't know if you're still connected i know that you sent that oh yeah you just sent that um uh well thank you kravi and i um uh worked together uh for this last cycle and i'm very confident that he just passed the bar exam um he's also a foreign student and we had a a lot of the conversations that we had today we had with javi as well um where we were um yeah you didn't read his comments what's that you didn't read his comment out loud oh i didn't no let everyone hear it well it disappeared on me it said i think he said something to the extent of uh it's worth every penny uh he said i took 20 hours with matthias and worth every penny something's that it disappeared on me so that is exactly what he said thank you yeah okay no problem um yes howie is um i look forward to getting in legal trouble in texas one day um so that i can call harvey uh he did he did some amazing work but a lot of the conversations that we had in his tutoring and some of them were in spanish um were about you know the constitutional system in the us and criminal procedure and how it's so unique and he also found torts to be a bit different um than in his home country and um and we just had to i remember in one of the lessons i just said listen copy this is the way the the green goes do it and let's just go with it so you can pass the bar exam so um but once but once we had those conversations it kind of opened up the floodgate i don't want to speak for him but i remember him telling me some of that um uh gee since i'm talking about his life do you think reading from now is enough time okay so i i don't know if you had asked yes okay you asked a similar question there chi uh yeah so you can start studying anytime uh therese uh gutierrez hi i'm a lawyer from the philippines beautiful country never been but it's on my list uh and i really want to take the bar is it hard to get eligibility are the qualifications the same in all states uh therese i'm sorry i i i can't i don't know i don't know the qualifications needed to take in each of the states as a foreign attorney but i would encourage you to look at the state bar website for ube states to see what it is that they require i think that that's the best uh place where you can find that information um janet dang um what do you cover in tutoring session i.e how is the time utilized um so the way that i individually do the these is we sit down our first lesson and we figure out what's what right uh if you already know some things that you've struggled with if it's not your first time taking the bar exam then we put those at the forefront um if this is your first time taking the bar exam then we start working on process i would say um first meaning the first i guess the second lesson first lesson is laying out a game plan okay how many hours do you have to study a week what are your other commitments you're gonna find me telling you a lot of times oh you used to do this well guess what you're not doing it the next 10 weeks right unless like it's a dire need i took the bar exam as a single parent i have joint custody of my daughter and it was incredibly difficult but it literally was the bar exam and my daughter the bar exam and my daughter those were the only two things i stopped working out the only thing i was doing is eating sleeping studying and spending time with maya um so um so that's the first thing that we talk about we build a calendar together then in the next sessions usually what i dive into immediately is how to write um the essays and i hit on a very very surface level about what is required in the um in the um in the essays um but uh in my lessons we just go deeper into it and i have a method if any of you wind up uh um wind up uh taking lessons with me you will get sick and tired of hearing me say law because fact because that to me is the golden key to unlocking the essay portion of the um of the uh of the bar exam so that's what i do and then it's always a moving target right so if three four lessons into it maybe not that early because three four lessons into it we're still working on developing a good writing style which will also help in analyzing mbes um but after i've worked with students over the span of three four months and um and you know by the third month were we're doing things really tailored to okay what went wrong right you took a test this week this went wrong okay this is the third time it's gone wrong and it's commonly tested so let's work on it right are you struggling with multiple choice questions okay so then here's what we're gonna do what is going wrong what i always tell my students is we can't move forward and act like nothing happened when there's a car wreck back there right um building a passing bar exam score is like building a house if it's not built on a good foundation it's going to fall on your head so and the falling on the head is the um you know the not passing um so it a lot of times it's readjusting it's moving the dial as new issues come up um sometimes it's also you know being here to say listen the process is fine you're not supposed to be scoring at passing six weeks out um which is something that uh all of my students struggled with uh last um last cycle and and i'm confident that they all did fine um if now until july is enough time should i take the july okay uh she all right so chi i see that you've posted a few questions on time um what i can tell you is start now see how you're feeling uh it depends on your time commitments um if you if you're available full time now then then you're you're probably going to be fine even if you're 10 years out of law school um do i think that someone needs to prepare for the bar exam for 11 months no especially you said you went to law school in the uk that's common law presumably yeah you had to do the law school in english so maybe not as big of a language barrier although british people love adding use to a lot of their words but that's not really detrimental uh yeah i don't i think if you start studying now you could take it in july depending on how much time you can allocate a week to it um it seems like a lot to study any ideas on how to effectively study uh it is a lot to study um how to study effectively um you know there's no silver bullet there really isn't the best way i can describe it is uh treat it like a job you clock in at 9 00 a.m if that's what you know if you don't have any other commitments you clock out at 6 7 pm at night treat it like a job you're not there to mess around you're not there to text your friends post on instagram right just focus and if you have other commitments then you need to carve out time that is only bar study time and stick to that i think if you do that you'll be fine um thank you bianca reese uh okay um so matthias do they have required format and essay answers um so they want iraq like i discussed earlier in the webinar do they prefer long and extensive answers short brief concise answers so therese we discussed this um but the ub tends to prefer concise answers um margaret um okay even though i am not foreign educated lawyer english is not my first language i just want to mention here to those debating whether to take any tutoring sessions that time spent in my tutoring sessions with matthias oh margaret from poland um okay she says uh time spent my tutoring sessions with metis i don't like reading these things about myself guys um but i i will since celeste okay it says that matthias is awesome [Music] yeah um yeah it just um yeah margaret is arguably one of the most intelligent people i've ever met um it was just getting her to understand she had 30 minutes to say what she had to say that was the main uh our main uh point of friction in our mentor mentee relationship um but um yeah and by the way hey i'm not someone who likes being tutored yeah be because you're extremely intelligent i yeah i i could see why not um but we're very hopeful that margaret did uh did well also um actually i'm very confident she did if she sticks if she stuck to the timing she was fine trust me margaret again extremely intelligent um medina uh does barmax predict like some bar reviews do i don't think we're in the business of predicting i don't know celeste do we usually predict anything i don't think we do do we no for the very reason that you gave the story that you told about how your own bar exam you decided not to prepare wills and then you open to the very first essay and holy holy it's will somebody and that can happen to anyone plus here's another fact the subjects that people like to skip you know those essay only subjects there's like about four or five issues to learn in each of them right so like if you get that essay there are those handful of issues that are tested over and over again you want to learn those issues you want to be ready on them so no predictions all right so medina unfortunately i i hope number one i'm pronouncing your name correctly and number two we don't predict um so okay um juan jose how do we contact tutors okay so um i know we get emails jose just send me your email or uh or uh a phone number in chat and and we'll we'll hook you up we'll hook you up with some tutoring yeah yeah uh yes what celeste said um yeah i think they give the list and again everyone is great that that tutor's with us um you know i don't think you can go wrong with any of us i think just sometimes styles work better for other people but that's on you all to choose and we're all here for you regardless um okay um all right so no oh that's oh that's not q a that's just the chat okay um what is the most benefit of bar max on preparing essays uh so i mean the course teaches you how to go through them i'm not sure if you're asking about the course or the tutoring the course uh has um other webinars and off under office hours which uh speak to um how to tackle essays which again your knowledge of the law is only as good as what you put on the paper and get points for within the amount of time um um yeah and then as far as tutoring well we work specifically on what you're doing wrong so and and how to what i do personally is i give a standardized way to approach every essay it doesn't matter if they're asking you about contracts towards conflict of laws or god forbid wills right we approach them all the same way so we standardize that which kind of cuts out some of um uh some of the um you know the um the uncertainty of the um the essay portion which again for me was the portion that i thought i wasn't going to do as well okay um so i did say your name right medina okay great by the way i'm so happy and thankful for my students that popped in um both charlie and margaret i'm positive that both of them did amazing on the bar they worked extremely hard um do you have any suggestions about issue spotting um you know the thing that will help you with issue spotting is doing the essays right do the essays do them over again after it's been a month since you've done that essay go back and do it again right get used to seeing factual scenarios that trigger certain rules that's what i would say um say okay no thank you how far back should we review the past bar exams is five years back enough um you know listen i when i give my students questions i give them questions sometimes there's a question i love testing from 2008 because i think it's a great question so i i don't i i don't know that uh i mean if you if you get bar max barmax gives you like everything so um is there a way to approach it um not in my opinion uh do you recommend reading the medina do you recommend reading then trying to practice questions or trying out questions and read along um i say it's a mixed bag i'd say early on you want to read and to make sure that you're you know reflecting on the on the law understanding what the law is getting to know the law and then doing practice but that doesn't mean you know do 80 practicing and um and then uh you know i'm sorry 80 reading and only 20 practicing you want to you'll see as the time goes on in the studying it's less just reading and more practicing and memorizing so uh medina i'm also interested in tutoring because i'm a repeat okay um when is the best um uh but when it's best to adopt tutoring medina uh in my opinion tutoring builds the foundation on the house right because i've and i've had students that you know uh came to me three weeks before the bar exam sure we can you know dial in some things and work and certainly improve absolutely but at that point you're trying to fix things right you're trying to fix the things that are wrong with the house versus early on you're building yourself a good house right which kind of gives you another thing for any of you that will wind up working together another thing you're going to get sick and tired of hearing me say is i'm all i am giving you the tools right you are building the house i'm giving you the tools and the tools are are how to tackle each part of the bar exam the correct way right um uh so how close to the exam i i think the earlier the better so that when you go off and practice on your own you're doing it the right way um is there okay i hope medina i hope that answers your question um anonymous attendee is there a test textbook by barmax i can purchase uh yes we have the outline book and we have an ope book which gives you four full-length 400 question uh um multiple choice tests um part of the course right which is not sold separately uh because that those outlines are really the heart of the barmacks course um we're very very proud of the streamlined outlines that accurately teach just what is tested on the exam so we do not sell those separate from the course itself thank you celeste um yeah so like like i said folks uh what i do is tutoring so i don't even know the basics of what we offer or what we sell um but i i can tell you i've probably spent more time with that book than i did with the bible growing up as a catholic so i can i can speak to how good it is um okay grace miranda rights and fifth amendment rights are they the same thing uh so we discussed this earlier um oh this is from four p.m okay so this oh well like i said another time zone whatever um so the fifth amendment just briefly we can't go into too much detail about it just for uh time we're almost running out um the fifth amendment of the u.s constitution protects the right against self-incrimination originally that meant that you could not testify against yourself in a criminal proceeding right i couldn't be forced in a trial to take the witness stand and say yes i did steal that i'm i'm trying to think of something that is not egregious uh steal that book right um 200 years later and after uh the fiasco that the post kennedy murder was um justice earl warren decided that we needed to extend that constitutional protection that the fifth amendment affords to encounters between citizens and the police when and when i say citizens i mean anyone within the jurisdiction of the united states irrespective of immigration status or lack thereof it extends to any time that a suspect is under in custody by the police as defined in miranda and being interrogated by the police so they have a miranda right against self-incrimination a

in love with a gorgeous American starlet we all went then things got even better Prince Harry and Megan marker were married and in doing so took on the role of Duke and Duchess of the world but now something has happened the couple appeared who want a little privacy too much to ask you bet the public feel cheated the tabloids have turned and the blame game much of it directed at Megan is fierce it hasn't yet progressed to off with her head but it's still a major headache for the royal family [Music] it started so well a dashing prince with the love of his life the announcement of an engagement it's beautiful and he designed it it's incredible and plans for a wedding [Music] sure there were a few hiccups she's not gonna tell me that I can't speak in law's acting like outlaws if I had a message for Harriet's kid over it I'm your new father-in-law Barba's Megan Markel walked down the aisle to be with Prince Harry the whole world was happy [Music] fast forward 15 months the fairy tale has fractured and one person is copying all the blame Andrew what on earth has Meaghan done well Megan seems to be a version of the Antichrist as far as fleet-street concerned and it's almost a royal rite of passage you've got to go through Andrew Morton has spent a lifetime making the private lives of the royal family public but he reckons Megan Markov bashing has gone too far you don't know what's going on really and yet the the the kind of casual vituperation of Megan and Harry is in his it makes you shudder I mean it's not like she's done anything wrong she's just basically living her life as a royal she's in my view she's done everything right it's quite revealing that Megan said when she joined the royal family that she was going to hit the ground running unlike Morton former palace insider Patrick Jefferson says Megan needs work to make it as a royal of course we love people who have the ground running energy enthusiasm motivation let's do it but you've got to know where you're running to and who's running with you and what are you gonna say when you get there at what should be the happiest time of the newlyweds lives things have gone famously arrived for Megan and in turn Harry two eyebrows were first raised when taxpayers funded their four million dollar house rent oh the Duke and Duchess have been criticised for demanding privacy yet still accepting taxpayers money for renovations on their home more tut-tutting when the couple kept little Archie away from public view I mean they could have come out in a glass carriage just to show us the baby in the christening gown then Megan was slammed for acting like a snob at the tennis this is not a private visit if you'll be duchess of Sussex getting a freebie your Wimbledon in the VIP see it's not private visit and now a further frenzy of outrage because these eco-warriors like to travel in style a lot of people have labeled them hypocrites because they've taken four private jet flights in just 11 days Andrew Morton says it's just not worth the hot air it seems to me that Megan really should be given applause not and bouquets rather than via taxes she and Harry are suffering from I don't think they're listening to you though who's they well the press has she really provoked the British media so badly the British media are notoriously fickle they have an antenna for when the royal family is not being entirely straight with them and this may be why Megan and other members of the family have taken far more control of their own image [Music] then look at all these tourists here a lot of people and it's a sunny day yeah well you know they've come to see Harry and Meg's they have not come to see Harry and Meg's they've come to see the Queen they've come to pay respect to the great British tradition of the monarchy they've come to see real Royals outside the gates of the world's most famous family home today there's only one winner in a popularity poll about young royal wives a billion times better Megan does not hold a candle to King I'm here with British commentator Katie Hopkins Meghan's interesting no she's fickle she's of the moment she's this deep who says someone has to speak for the commoners and expose the real Megan Markel Katie why do you hate Megan so much ah what has she ever done to you Oh everything it's my royal family this is my country Prince Harry is my Prince Harry so jealous I'm not jealous I'm like who wants to be Megan Marco like I'm unpopular I've known as the biggest [ __ ] in Britain the only person in Britain who's more unpopular than me Megan Marco I don't think that's right I think that's true katie is nothing if not outspoken but she genuinely believes the future of the royal family is at stake unless Megan Markel is banished forthwith megha Marco is the biggest hypocrite there is what does mega Marco do we've got to save the planet save the planet Oh do one good thing every day I'll burp up about them what does she do get on for private flights to wherever land at four hundred thousand pounds a week higher and then uses up half the co2 emissions that anyone else might have had it's pure hypocrisy and what is she really she's a no one she's a divorcee when did we want a divorcee in the royal family she wears bad clothes when did we ask for that we've just got so much better of our own strong words maybe some embellishment but here in Britain it's backed up by Megan's disapproval ratings a recent survey found the duchess divisive and ranked her the second most disliked female royal after camilla they were old knackered old skeptics like me old Haggard women gang I wasn't very good and then that's sort of the young beautiful people going oh we love her social media or fabulous fabulous Beyonce that's the split and the Haggard ones have got even more entrenched in their hatred and I think even the young ones are skeptical because Prince Harry's lost all of his Vava voom what irks Katie is the damage he thinks Megan is causing to Harry's reputation maybe Harry doesn't give us stuff when anyone thinks he's just chosen someone for himself and maybe he's sick of the media and maybe he doesn't like people like you having a running commentary on his life it is his life sort of but then again I just paid 2.3 million pounds as a taxpayer in order to redevelop frog mayor cottage for him and his wife I just paid for his wife to sit in the rule box at Wimbledon that went well I just yeah that was splendid she wouldn't let anyone take a photograph of herself and asked to be sat alone so give and take go leave the royal family abdicate off you go my concern about Megan is that she's allowing the her PR to be driven from America so she's at American friends her American caught as you will Oprah George Clooney Amal Clooney Serena Williams all standing up for her which is good but it's it's it's from the perspective of America as opposed to the perspective of Britain Andrew Morton famously wrote a best-seller about Harry's mum Princess Diana and in Megan Markel he sees history repeating itself I remember Princess Diana she was called the fairytale princess when she first married Prince Charles within a year she was being called a fiend and a monster because her because a lot of members of staff bodyguards valid private secretaries had left Fergie as Duchess of York starts offers a breath of fresh air great friend of the Queen goes carriage driving and goes horse riding with the Queen and Prince Philip and then within a matter of months she's dubbed free be Fergie because yes for a discount on a kitchen so you know is this is what's happened as colorful as the British royal families always been their whiteness has dominated and that brings us to a sensitive subject I think that's where people go with this if I criticized Megan as we can Here I am people say well you're racist and honestly it's only been a second thought to me only it only comes up in the minds of those who are truly racist and that's never people like me I'm just observing the dress is better on Kate has she wears it is better so this racist thing is really old and tired but I think it's just people's way of sort of saying you must not criticize Megan [Music] I think that the whole racial question is is entirely misleading it's irrelevant and I would warn against anybody taking that line as a any sort of explanation as to why Megan sometimes doesn't get the press she necessarily once in Prince Harry played the racism card to an extent yeah and I advise strongly against him doing that did you yeah if you take that point of view then you're gonna miss perhaps some more relevant reasons to why Megan isn't as popular as she should be for eight years Patrick Jefferson was Princess Diana's private secretary he saw the pressure public scrutiny brings but says like diana did the modern royals must learn to cope with it [Music] it's confusing for I'm sure royal life is very similar to celebrity life but celebrity lives are earned royal lives are granted coming up gotten friends come back to borrow just a jilted friend I'm not empty trailer oh I'm not and can the ghost of Diana save Harry and Megan's fractured fairy tale Megan doesn't need to look anywhere else but at the legacy of her mother Anna that's next on six units I'm not this high I'm not dissing the dirt on Megan not at all I'm being honest as a friend and someone that knew her before Harry knew I didn't even know she was famous when I met her I didn't know who she was with so-called friends like British media personality Lizzie Conde Megan Markel probably doesn't need enemies what did you think of her I thought she was great fun looking for a guy she loved England she says they were great buddies before Megan met Harry she said she wanted a boyfriend she wanted a celebrity boyfriend and never in my wildest dreams would I ever think that she would end up marrying Prince Harry [Music] but when Megan joined the firm this Lizzi was dumped in favor of another I think Megan changed to a girl that maybe was more manipulating and doing what Megan wants to do I kind of saw a different side come on you're just a jilted friend I'm not I promise I'm not I'm really not a jilted trained at all but I feel that they could do things so much better I don't think you can lecture about the planet and then take full private jets I wanted her to be the next Princess Diana I think she still can be but Princess Diana was about everyone else and it appears that Megan is about Megan a lot of the time [Music] and here's another problem for Megan could anyone live up to the memory of the mother-in-law from heaven Princess Diana's former private secretary Patrick Jefferson says in the eyes of the British public it's an almost impossible task but it could be the key to winning Megan's PR battle she was in the business of life and death of dealing with people regardless of race or gender or background who were at the bottom of the heap whose lives were miserable people who were stigmatized people who were Outsiders outcasts so today aids isn't stigmatized leprosy isn't Sigma ties mental illness is is transformed all Diana's work so what you're saying is that Megan doesn't need to look anywhere else but at the legacy of her mother-in-law Megan isn't and never has been an ordinary British person so part of her challenge is to work out what it feels like what it is to be an ordinary British person and not to be one but to understand therefore how best to use her extraordinary influence and high profile so what's the blueprint then for Megan to be a success the blueprint involves not doing more but probably doing less she is after all wife of the 6th in line to the throne that means that she is constitutionally irrelevant however that's not a very nice way everything however she is obviously very high profile and that combination has never really happened before [Music] back at Buckingham Palace Katie Hopkins is still railing against Megan but there's also an admission an economic Markel Sparkle parian Meg's a new money I can almost hear the tills yes they are new money and I do think in terms of a new kind of era of profitability the social media generation for the royal family and all of that of course Marvel's got that sewn up but but this is what it's all second I nearly said something nice about concede that she's good for Royal business no she's good for business she's good for Megan marshals business now while Megan thrashing seems to be a popular sport at the moment it also pays to remember her greatest supporter is also a great warrior I think Harry is the most interesting part of this whole story so true he's doing his own thing tree is almost winding everyone up to come get me come get me because I'm after a fight oh this is so true and it is very much like he is just determined to go anti-establishment he's flicking the V sign to everything that he was brought up by so it's not Megan it's Harry's fault its Harry but Harry is redeemable because Harry was in a uniform and he was in a helicopter and he was in Afghanistan Megan was only ever in cheap movies in reality the fate of the royal family doesn't rest on Harry or Megan there's an order of things and traditions one person can't make or break do you think Harry wants out well he's always said that you know if he could he'd love to be a safari grant a guide and I'm sure that he's just he does think to himself what on earth am I doing this for sometimes but at the end of the day Katherine's gonna be the queen and Megan is gonna always have to curtsy tower will there be any dramas there well there's always gonna be drama but I mean it you know everything is

is deaf and tongue this is business over drinks hey everybody welcome to another episode of business over drinks my name is tang and i'm calling in from singapore good evening everyone my name is david i'm calling in from brisbane so we got another really exciting episode today we've got a really really awesome guest with us from um actually i'm going to keep that a little bit of a secret while i do an introduction for him and then i'll introduce where he's from and we're going to talk about something that is uh pretty much in a big part of david's and my life because well we drink a lot so we're going to talk a lot about alcohol in this episode um so we've got a really awesome guest adrian sem so adrian is actually an entrepreneur with a long history and stock broking property and over the last actually quite a few years in beer and he represents actually many international brands right here in singapore where i'm based so one thing that he's seen is beer is technically a monopolistic market in which brands are able to really compete on their own merits right so adrian is now turning his attention to brand acquisition and development through his company east asia beverages um one of his most exciting and most recent acquisitions has been crossroads brand the crossroads brand which was really excited by the positioning quality adrian's also an avid sports person and is pretty much if you want to if you want to be friends adrian watch sports and drink beer that's pretty much all we have to say but you can check out his brand new craft beer crossroads at crossroadsbrewing.sg as always we'll put uh the link in our show notes and we'll share everything on our socials as well adrian welcome to the podcast it was great it's great having you here thank you sir i think um it's always wonderful to come out and share ideas with people and like-minded individuals like yourself who like beer um yeah so it's great to be here thank you excellent um so before we jump straight because i think we've got a ton of questions for you adrian is maybe we can just have a quick uh discussion about what we're drinking dave do you want to start off yeah definitely it's in honor of adrian you know thank you so much for sending me sending both turnarounds some samples of your beer so right now i'm drinking um um drinking steam ale and it's got a picture of i don't remember it is being called the dorian but what do you call it in singapore no that's the esplanade yes but but the local authorities want you to call it the esplanade it's just like lemonade you know i'm enjoying it it's gonna like a smoky reminds me like i'm just like having a good cigarette even though i don't work it's smoky flavoursome it's a little bit of a bit of a sweet tissue but i'm really liking it it reminds me of the the local brewed the beers here in brisbane well well you know i i basically like beers that i that i like i like to sell them so um starting with australian beers long ago i found that australian beers are always sessionable you guys get 40 degrees summers over there so you gotta you can't drink heavy beers in 40 degree summers so um the beers that we used to sell are basically the same kind of uh profile as what you're drinking now so you'll find that for the rest of the range of crossroads as well they're all very sessionable yeah okay you can try them all during this interview oh i think i think is that an invitation to drink food i think i think we plan to um so uh well well dave's gonna go through the entire crossroads uh product line i've got one of the other uh products that adrian's company distributes the magnets um irish cider i actually am a big fan of cider as well so i think just in just to give a little bit of variation because i knew you guys were going to be smashing through beers i thought i'll just pop on the side and just keep it a little bit different uh adrian what about you why are you drinking on your side well i'm drinking um the number one beer out of prague the most beautiful city in the world czech beer so it is actually full flavored the chicks make really good beers it's clean um and uh i like my beers full flavored so even you know but like you have a session ipa with you that is uh it's full flavored but it's sessionable this is clean and it's sessionable i love it too oh nice for the for the for the ignorant beer drinkers out there myself included what what do you mean what are you saying full flavored and uh sessionable well it's all no it's all in the hops and you you see a lot of new products coming on stream to take over the space that the commercial beers have filled over the last 50 years and i think there's a lot of experimentation going on with super strong hoppy double triple hop beers that you get yeah so for me as a beer drinker i really like something that i can drink five you know without worrying about but if i drink something that's a little bit too much it's probably a one or two beer session that's it so when i say sessionable it's something that you can keep drinking and and you don't feel you know you don't feel like no yes sweating especially it's hot in humans singapore it's you know humidity is crazy so you just want something that you can really just keep chugging along at for the whole night yep oh nice so um looks like adrian drinks like we do dave it's like one or two or five we just just ramp it up to five as quick as possible uh we can understand that and we just have to say this again uh drink responsibility everybody if you just want to make sure that we cover ourselves responsibly yes do not sell us drink responsibility this is this broadcast is for entertainment purposes only [Laughter] well uh adrian we're terrified of being uh cancelled at some point so we just gotta be careful with the things that we say who's gonna cancel you the internet so we always get worried about that okay okay so um i mean let's just translate into adrian because i know that uh times uh like we don't really have that much time with you um but would you like to know maybe you can just give us a little bit of an introduction about like you know how did your career start right were you always an entrepreneur was it something that kind of ran your blood or do you just kind of stumble into it well i've i've i've always had a problem with authority and i um so my dad tagged me off to australia um without any school fees but i was signing on in school so i had to work 70 hours a week and then you find work to do 70 hours we could pay for your school fees et cetera this was in the 80s uh so when so when i came back to sing yeah i did everything you know i drove forklifts on for ikea on the weekends and and those were the days where you had 30 you had triple pay on sunday so naturally you worked the whole day on sunday so i like working i enjoy it i came back to singapore i first stint i worked for somebody i worked as a i.t engineer for 18 months and then i quit and i became an entrepreneur in property and followed and i liked it but it was a very routine sort of business and so i didn't stay on for long and yes i've worked for people for 36 months in singapore in total since i started work 30 years ago and the rest of it has been in one business or another yes i believe that it's probably in my blood entrepreneurship and some people just like it some people don't it's a quick question where in australia did you go to i was in perth perfect okay yeah a lot of people from singapore go to perth i guess because it's closer right yes it's it's it's four hours it's four hours to my chicken rice so you know it's fantastic you know i like to go back then settle down yeah okay if you ever doubted adrian or singapore and the fact that he said he's four hours of chicken rice should dispel any doubt [Laughter] that was the best that's the best one i've ever had how do you say singaporean four hours yeah no it's visit is visit perth tourism board right they they should be doing this come on come on over there there's four obviously a chicken rice [Laughter] winner pandemic cans that could be the tagline for the tourism campaign yeah but um well look i've always liked the big party and when i was in uni in australia i mean beers are two dollars a point so um you know you need to carry coins man you had you needed five two dollar coins to get sloshed in union it was fantastic so yeah i came back to singapore i was uh property first then then um stock broking and stock broking i started off by trading for the house so i had to deal with the banks who were our customers and there was a lot of entertaining and naturally a lot of drinking and and it was easy when i decided to switch i went through the asian financial crisis in 1997 and so when that was all done and dusted in 2000 i decided hey let's not uh let's not deal in this anymore i don't really enjoy it so to break some sir set my cv out i got a job in in a big asia pacific breweries at that point in time um now owned by heineken so i was head of entertainment for singapore and i did it for 18 months and then um really enjoyed it i mean it was uh back to my call right drink beer and work i mean i mean it's a dream um not really here in singapore but when i go to australia and i go to the casino and i tell them i do that before living people tell me god you're a legend you know so such a head of entertainment for an alcohol company that's like every college student's dream job exactly you know i know i know but it was like mid-life crisis i started that at 34 and uh yeah so i i did it for 18 months and then uh some brands approached me cub and offered me to start this company called six trunk men so we started a company called six drunk men and uh we um from there we just grew until seven percent of the draft market was fosters um yeah it was easy it was actually very easy to do at that point in time oh nice okay i mean it seems like entrepreneurship was kind of i mean it was the only option from what i can tell you seem to be going down that path and that's that's interesting i think that's kind of how it was for me as well um we had it kind of things kind of fall into place when you when when it's kind of meant to be i guess i'm not i'm not that fatalistic but i mean you got you got to listen to the stars once in a while i think so i think so i mean i fall for for people out there tell them the same thing follow your heart like you know i've always i've always liked marketing and so i excelled at it in school you know it was easy a's were easy for me in school but my dad used to laugh at it so my dad i come from a military family and he'll be asking me what's all this marketing [ __ ] about me you're not doing not building anything it's you know so uh i went to finance economics and university and you know didn't really like it right stock broking et cetera et cetera and then what i do full circle back to airport alcohol and marketing you know so that's life exactly oh yeah for sure no that's definitely uh there's definitely something i think we wanna uh if anything this this podcast talks about is kind of just do your own thing follow what you follow what you wanna do yeah um so i mean just tapping into that right a little bit like so what advice would you give someone looking to be an alcohol entrepreneur in asia or like australia wherever like they want to enter they want they kind of want to follow the path you took but maybe not work forklift at ikea okay well they um firstly they've got to know how to drink um but you know on the more serious side they really need to understand the market they need to be sufficiently cashed up it's a very uh capex intensive industry and um you gotta it's not it's not a big party all the time you gotta understand your numbers especially in singapore where uh price it's very pricey lasting in singapore and uh you gotta understand human capital costs you know your cost of rental logistics everything in singapore's is elevated so you've got to make sure that you understand your numbers how to run your business not just the product itself yeah i mean with alcohol brands i find like that is such a brave thing to do especially with the amount of competition there is out there how like when you entered it how did you even differentiate and what kind of what was missing when you entered the market and what is what's missing now that you're kind of feeling well when i entered the market uh i believe tiger beer was maybe 90 of the whole market and heineken was five percent of the market and the rest of it the last five percent was between carlsberg and a few other brands so for me it was really very easy when you come to market with a monopoly in place with a long defensive line and you just go in there and figure out where there are weak spots and just go after those weak spots so the gap in the market at that point in time in the places of ill repute um the king's cross of australia that kind of places where what uh towers oh wow you know what you think okay tells me a lot about it oh no no no no no no no no i've never i've not told david a single thing about this dave used to live in singapore he's the one who took me there for the first time i've never been there mom i'd never been there before we've only heard rumors oh mom oh come on man he's a good boy but hey um no but that's the that's the touristy side of it right the local eye side in the east of singapore it was fantastic you got these little bars the 2000 square feet bars they could buy 50 000 worth of product from you every month if you could just put a draft tab in their bar so that was the kind of places that um our competitors senior management never ever went to and the salesman would never ever report that they lost so many outlets in these places in fact we didn't show up in the ac neilson reports for at least five years and then when we finally showed up in the ac news reports then at that point in time we had a big chunk of that market already so coming working in a opening a business in a in a country with where there's a big monopolistic uh company there unless to shoot you and kill you it's actually easier than if you want to start that business now in this current market and start this business i wouldn't do it i wouldn't put my money into doing what i did 20 years ago got it because i think when there are a lot of smaller brands competing for space that it's more competitive and the market's a lot more difficult to find uh niches that you can get into yeah i mean that's that's interesting because to me right that's that's for people looking for opportunities because they're always scared of the big guy well you literally said this makes my job easier because the big guy won't notice me coming and taking everything from him right and that's great i mean oddly enough that's uh that's announced to how um grab kind of came into the market as well like comfort in singapore didn't even notice them at the start not really so that was interesting um i mean so right now right so if you were to like you said you're not you're probably not going to enter the market right now um but if you were to look at it from an outsider's perspective like or maybe even from your own personal perspective perspective right what's missing from the beer market right now in in singapore in australia where were you you've seen it like what's missing what do you think is going to be the next big thing i think that um i i think australia's already seen it um with the growth of craft breweries and localized drinking i mean there are a lot of um brands from different districts in australia that are famous like i know perth a lot better like gage roads and fremantle uh little creatures there too and they've moved to the east as well and there's lots of other craft breweries around i think for singapore space being a premium uh is the drawback from starting a brewery in retail but we don't know with the pandemic whether this equation is going to hold or this equation is going to change um simple is very unique in that we've just gone through the worst pandemic 100 years and yet property prices are going up so something something's a miss so you know you got to sit back and see where it goes in singapore but my take is i think people are willing to try new things now uh when we started everybody i walked into would tell me my drink is drink tiger yeah but you know it doesn't it doesn't work that way anymore so now the craft bars in singapore actually look forward to changing the portfolio every now and then yep actually um sorry dave i don't cut you off but i've i've got a i've got a question um that is very very local and and singaporean uh drinkers uh like what did you think of concepts like the good beer company that opened up in like a hawker center selling uh craft beers and stuff like that was there something that was that for you was interesting is you did you see potential in something like that i think i think it's good i think it's experimental it's exciting that these things are happening i just think that uh i tell a lot of my craft friends that my worry for the craft industry is that there's no segmentation everybody just says it's craft so that's the worry i i like the idea that it comes up everywhere but i think that there must be segmentation in the craft beer side of it but it's still early days it needs to evolutionize it to metamorphosize is something else i think down the road so um yeah but i think in singapore like i said australia's seen the growth of craft brands i think in singapore you're gonna see more of it and more more usage of regional breweries because it's everything's close by over here for the uh for the for the beer drinkers who are listening to us right now do you want to kind of go over some of your portfolio love to talk about some of what do you have sure i um i just recently acquired you don't mind if i move my computer it's not going to give you a headache i recently acquired crossroads um so yeah that's what it so this session ipa this is actually my favorite um premium lager steam which is actually a very very light beer which is great for singapore and uh golden ale and this is starting to pick up really well and two sides summerset pair as you know there's someone said mrt and somerset you know in singapore so that's close to orchard and another cider called orchard road which was actually an orchard in the old days then so um these are from your hometown david tuhi can you see yeah tuis uh yeah hans super drive we've got the gluten free versions here uh hunt super dry and um james bold's premium from tessie for his goal from your hometown again okay yep no one brings it here but uh you all these are the worst evangelists for your mainstream beers so here we are for fosters and forex where exactly you know and so there's uh uh so i represent molson course for belgium white uh blue moon belgium point mgd and starro pramin that i showed you earlier on and we've got craft we've got craft beers from ireland as well from the biggest irish craft beer brewery that's oharas irishta 51st state and falling apple 51st state is a really good ipa very strong six percent six point five percent uh ohara's great coffee back background flavors oh wow i really love it you know it's it's a stout but um something that grows on you more and more we have it on draft everything here is on draft yeah and of course outside the category these two are traditional ciders falling apple and magnus we don't i don't like the really sweet cider so i'll never sell them so that's what we do and we carry a range of spirits too but i mean still to be a company well i'm guessing that each one is sold in its own unique way like they just going are they available in most bars in singapore online like how how would we find them well you you find them in bars um in predominantly the central areas um in some neighborhood bars the english-speaking ones predominantly um we don't do that chinese um places of ill-repeat much anymore but we do the nice places you can find them in greener bay sands you can go to the top restaurants you'll see our beers on tap or on bottles and we sell online at uh with amazon redmart celebrations our own our own website does it too um so you can find it at www.ead.sg east asian beverages nice we'll link to that in our show notes cool great thanks and uh dave what i got gathered from that is now there's more opportunity to get back get back into the places that will repeat at alcohol so you and i should start a alcohol company soon adrian's left adrian's left less space that's why thanks for that adrian okay okay are we all gonna get in trouble here my my girlfriend's gonna be looking at this too what uh don't worry we won't tell her that you always go there and have a look but you just don't sell to them anymore okay cool i'm not now i'm joking i'm joking you've awakened something within turn you've awakened something like that yeah in a dream yes no but i tell you a little secret right you know when when i started this business i was a one-man show i had to go back to the office in the mornings at five o'clock and get the contracts done for draft contracts because every time you've got a draft machine you got to do it there then you got to spend your nights in uh talking to customers et cetera et cetera and then i couldn't drive home naturally so i spent most of the nights when i was starting this business sleeping in the middle of hotels so there you go places love hotels [Laughter] okay i mean that's the excuse i'm gonna use from now on even though technically i don't drive i'm just gonna use that excuse now i'm like i couldn't drive all right that's why i was here thanks adrian that's really helpful for me personally but okay thank you sure you use it any time you're not plagiarizing um all right that no that's that's really that's really uh fascinating right so uh i mean a couple of things that we also want to talk about right is um like what happens what like now that we're in the time of kobe i know we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna make it a little bit more serious now that we're in the time of cobit right like how has it been like what's the impact you felt with kobe 19 really curtailing nightlife and you know like people going out that much anymore well i mean we we took an 80 hit in the top line when kovit hit um it was tough we um i think the main concern was about staff and how do you keep everybody going but being in singapore we were so fortunate that the government stepped in and helped us with a job support scheme we had to reposition some of them and we had to take make people finish off their annual leave so that if the market ever opens again everybody's ready to work and uh yeah but from the initial it was tough because you had to handle your staff who were who weren't in in possession of all the facts and they just thought that you're being a an [ __ ] of a boss who's trying to take advantage of of the situation but um towards the end of 2020 you know you get back and people say thank you very much i think we did a good job keeping everybody um the hardest part for us in the in covet situation was the um the fact that cash flow just dried up um i think the retail side was suffering that you know they they couldn't pay their bills people like us had to hunker down and how do you get through without any cash flow so um yeah that was the toughest part but like i said being in singapore is good government came in help helped us on the staffing front helped us on the loans from banks front and that that got us through but i don't think we're through yet i think it's still a long way because uh you know fmb is still closing at 10 30 every night but who are we to complain when you look at the countries around the world that some of them don't even have fmb till anything past six o'clock you know and millions of deaths hundreds of thousands of deaths in in the u.s alone so we can't complain you know just do what you got to do i mean i still think singaporeans are going to complain so we'll just we'll just leave it at that um uh no but but that's interesting though right because i think there's a shift in how people now are consuming as well so alcohol going out at night because i used to get i wouldn't say get drunk but i would get drunk around midnight now i get drunk at about 10 and i'm like all right i can i can leave the bar without getting too upset that they're cutting me off so that you that usually that usually help me um it helps me now i get i get more sleep but no but um it's true it's true i do get mostly but are you you're starting to see a little bit of pickup at in singapore yeah from uh even though technically closed at 10 30 there's more cash flow coming and i'm assuming yeah things are kind of picking up again no i mean yeah it's kind of picking up but and you're getting you get you you're more prepared for it now because you had a year if you had a year to prepare for something and you can't prepare for it then something is wrong with you so we've we've tried doing different things with you know restructured new partnerships cut out fixed costs fixed cost is the one that kills you in singapore right so cut your fixed costs and yeah just really have to drill down to the small numbers and make sure that you know you count your cents so the dollars looks after themselves oh yeah for sure um sorry sorry dave i got one more follow-up question one more question that like um do you see there ever being um because i i know that the beer industry and alcohol industry in general is really driven by nightlife but do you ever see a direct consumer route really helping like shore up the industry even in doing these parts where the nightlife industry is impacted because i mean from personal experience i've drunk more beer throughout the pandemic than i've ever done in my life when it was on complete lockdown we couldn't go out i bought and consumed more beer than i've ever done in my life and i think i personally help the alcoholic alcohol industry in singapore just by myself you're special you know you both need badges from the government but hey um i i don't i know volumes will never come back to what they were before with the on premise moving on you know opening their normal hours so i don't everybody's suffering at the moment you turn on your you're online if you go to online um venues and you try and buy beer there you'll notice how cheap it's become so and spirits and everything else because obviously everybody's suffering of falling revenues so it's about moving yeah it's about moving volumes and i you know it's uh it's interesting because i'm already eyeing what's going to happen during the recovery you know how is everybody going to get their pricing back to to a place where you actually make money if everybody's discounting the way they're discounting you know at rock bottom and knowing the numbers knowing the duties shipping costs and everything else you know those guys who are selling at the prices they're selling obviously are losing a lot of money interesting i didn't think about that fact because how are your australian sales going i still sell to australia no i i don't i don't sell anything to australia yeah he basically buys from there dave well done dave well research question yeah no it's because it's on the news it's it's been um australians spend an extra 2 billion on booze in 2020 mainly from house from like people in terms of buying at home so in democracy i guess the margin is still low like the alcohol spend is high but the the it's not really profitable no but look it's a different market right i mean in australia it's 80 20 as in 80 buy and off trade and 25 in the entree whereas in singapore is like 70 on trade and 30 off trade so oh wow when you lose your 70 on trade then you are going to um it's hard to make up for it because you know you because by virtue of like pandemic people are going to stay at home you still got 80 of the business which is off trade before you just grow there you are actually in an okay position but over here you are not because you've lost that entire trade business you can't not many people like to invite yourself trade and on trade okay off trade is what we term in my industry is supermarket business online supermarkets your you know your your your your liquidation yeah yeah um whereas your entree would be your your restaurants your italian restaurants your whatever restaurants your bars your stuff so um yeah your gentlemen's clubs we don't have over here yeah so that's the difference we are laughing yeah so for us to just lose 70 of the whole market it was a killer over here wow that's such a difference in consumer behavior i mean 80 i didn't know australia was 80 it is wow dave everybody has an alcoholic i always thought that you know in the hard times people would just buy more alcohol even if they they couldn't really afford it they'd buy it because of just being sad you know yeah no but look look the the the supermarket and online purchases have probably doubled in singapore but it still doesn't make up for that 70 loss in in the yeah you know the physical locations where people drink i mean houses are small in singapore you don't invite your mates home to drink because firstly the neighbors will complain secondly who's gonna clean up you know it's this doesn't really happen here it does happen but not not that much yeah interesting yeah that's true i was telling dave that there's there's not much of like a house party like a social gathering drinking uh culture in singapore like they're gathering but for hot pot right and they don't they don't gather for heavy drinking and then passing out and then pushing people on the street that that doesn't that doesn't happen in singapore that much unless it's me at your place yeah the number of times i did like basically just shove it yeah that's that's happened a couple times yeah um [Music] uh so yeah adrian i i know i think we're coming close to the end but i wanna ask a couple of things uh for you right so um if you could actually tell yourself like if you could go back in time right maybe when you were 30 20 30 what would what actually what advice would you impart on yourself during that time like from everything that you've learned right now i i'll just say just go for it you know whatever you want to do just you have a dream go for a dream um make sure that you understand your own risk profile your own risk tolerance i i accept very high risks so i generally put everything into my business so if i went back to my 20 30 year old self i'll say that hey you know do the same thing you know drive it like zorro have a passion but um yeah set something aside a little bit more for rainy day so so that when the rainy day comes like they did last year you got a little bit more prepared yep no fan just go forward but be have a bit of a savings account or have a bit of something yeah maybe something just in case yeah so what's what's in plan for you in the future what's coming up in 2021 well i think the next five years will be super exciting you know we have we are in the market to make a difference again and uh i think we're gonna we have set quite um quite awesome targets for ourselves to hit and uh we've got new brands coming on stream and i look forward to actually building a the team to run the new brands it's exciting and um so in a couple of years it's full-on working there's a regional focus as well so hopefully i can start to travel and [Music] sell more beer i'll be here a good time sounds good hopefully i'll be able to see you in these trails as well yeah i think so have a great time here anytime there i'll look you up sounds good sounds good i learned some really really interesting things uh from adrian something that's really surprising i mean the strategy you took in entering an extremely uh monopolistic market i i mean it's fascinating to me that's the most fascinating thing i've heard in a very long time and just just to bring everybody back uh four hours from chicken rice is the best way to say that you're singaporean without saying it's important genuinely i truly believe that yeah yeah yeah hey noodles [Laughter] yeah i really enjoy this this conversation it was really fun aaron thank you if someone wanted to to keep in touch with the journey of yourself and your portfolio and your companies where can they go well you can always drop us a line to me um and address it to me at uh buy beer at eab dot sg okay so um look forward to hearing from anybody awesome we'll put that we'll put that in show notes as well plus with uh's personal phone number address and all the other stuff um no joking we won't do it that you're in don't worry um oh no all of his relatives and loved ones their contact details on my social media everything um um yeah i mean this is great i think that we covered everything uh we're gonna put all adrian's uh uh links everything

it was a pleasure yeah yeah this is one of the most fun podcasts i think we've done in a while yeah we've been um i think i think it's because we did a couple of podcasts quite sober so that wasn't good yeah nothing's ever good when you're saying look david you've only gone through one man you're supposed to do the whole you whole lot me drinks in the morning just like his morning his morning coffee is just like yeah he's a problem you", "pbcpjum39Es": "[Music] last time on Brown sailing we visited Victoria on Vancouver Island for a second time we announced that we're having a baby and we want to thank you so much for all the congratulations and the heartwarming comments that we received we sail back to the US and found out that we didn't get an extension on our visas and then we set sail south out on open ocean during the first night at sea we sail close to a naval exercise area I couldn't see in enabling today but a lot of strobe lights on horizon probably markers on fishing nets or long lines further on [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so it's the second day on our sail south right now we're about 25 nautical miles outside the Columbia River and a story at work in here we still have around 160 170 nautical miles to go to choose Bay and I'm yeah I think we'll go there we might continue to Crescent City but we'll see how the wind is with the speed we're doing now going to be in Coos Bay tomorrow evening around 8:00 which is really great because that's when it's slack the current there so hopefully it will be pretty easy to enter because it's a river bar you need to cross to get in there yeah and on the shorts I've been reading a bit about it and doesn't seem to be too bad yeah last night there was a lot of fishing vessels the whole night and the wind totally died yeah I don't know around 12 so we motor from midnight and so this morning and then the wind has slowly been picking up now during the day a couple of hours ago we were a wing and wing but now we have a broad reach so now we have both sails on the same side but I kept the boom up because it might be that we will go deeper later today so just keep it up you can't keep any food or anything down but today I've been in here cause it's kind of it's in the middle of the boat and it's as slow as you can be in the boat so the movements are a bit less here but it's the role we cease that makes me sick a turn one banana and then a bit of rice but everything has come up again it's all exhaustion that's fun no and I'm no use at all and Johan takes care of me and the both dead the saving is good but we're saving quite fast so we'll be there in less than 24 hours then yeah tomorrow evening we're going to Coos Bay now it's good that I left the boom out because the wind is turning more and more to the north so in a while I will probably pull the sail over to the boom again so be wing and wing for the night the wind has picked up to around 16 I think it is true wind and the waves have started to build now but I think will calm down a bit when the Sun comes down it's always like this couple of hours you know when you're getting closer to sunset that the wind picks up a bit and then it's often dies down a bit when the when the Sun sets so that's what I'm hoping for we have one reef now in the main but we're still doing at the moment we do 7.5 knots and we're actually sailing a bit too fast the recommendation is still going in Tuesday at slack turns and that's quarter past 8:00 tomorrow evening I mean one hour either side is okay but still seven o'clock I think we'll be there already by 4:00 and then we will have to 2.5 knots of current coming out from that river and that's not good with these seas when you're crossing the bar so probably if the wind doesn't die down this night we'll reef down a lot tomorrow and go slow so we'll be a Tuesday around 7:00 tomorrow tomorrow evening and the balance in the boat is really good now since we cut the boom a bit shorter now the because normally when you have like a beam reach or a broad reach we always had to rebid early because you had too much pressure in the mainsail and a lot of that a bit too far aft which was pushing the front up when he was especially when it was gusty wind it feels a lot more balanced now the sail areas and also the the pressure on the main is a bit moved forward so it doesn't turn the boat up as much when you get when you have gusty winds when you're on a broad reach or on a broad reach we can sail in a bit higher winds we still have the same sail area in the main but we can use it a bit higher up I really need to pull that sail over now yeah we can use the main sail without briefing it into a bit more heavier wind down or heavier it can be a bit more windy before we need to take the first reef even if the sail area on the main is still the same as it's the dull one so that's really good and I really feel sorry for Marlin she's been feeling really seasick I was many years since I was that seasick that she's now you you know when you have starting to throw up it's like there's no turning back it will take a couple of days before you come back from seasickness like that you need to come ashore or you need to stay out at least three days before you feeling better again so probably this will last for her all the way until port tomorrow evening so yeah I feel it's not fun for her before leaving Port Angeles no one had suggested that I should be taking the bus south and he would solo sail but I felt that I really wanted to be part of the trip as well even if I'm been feeling quite nauseous [Music] it's two o'clock at night the wind has dropped a little bit which is good because we're going too fast before so now we're down to five and a half to six knots of speed and the wind is around yep 10 knots so we keep the reef in the main because we don't want to go too fast now right now there's a lot of fishing boats around us but it's getting shallower in this area so I guess the upwellings from the deep sea makes make this a good fishing round we have 88 nautical miles to go to the to space so if you can keep this speed we'll be there in good time the wind has started to east during the night so I shaked out the reef after sunrise no they don't morning I'm feeling a little bit better today haven't been there haven't grown up since last night no it's noon so that feels good we have 40 nautical miles left to cool space let's surround 8 hours so in a couple of hours we'll start listening to the beach if the coast guard has these broad cats where they are telling you how the conditions are at the different bars all along the coast here of Oregon and also I think in California so I think the broadcast is on channel 22 a but they say on some of these bars it can be dangerous even if if you come at the wrong time it can be dangerous even if the seas are you know even at the window that's so strong in the waves are not so big out of the ocean it could be dangerous conditions on the bar [Music] we're free miles three nautical miles outside the entrance now a couple of hours ago we took down the main and we've been briefing down a lot on the headsail to because we were going too fast right now I do only like four knots it's the time the slack current but we'll be there a bit early even so but I think it'll be okay it's not a lot of it's not so very big waves today so should be alright and there is no warnings or anything but of course it's always best to be as close as possible to slack current we will be entering about an hour before that as we had predicted the river bar was calm and it wasn't any problem and drinking use pay in hindsight we could probably have crossed the bar on any level of the tide in these well and wetter conditions however we always take extra precautions when arriving to a ports we haven't visited before and have no local knowledge about river bars like the one in Coos Bay can be really dangerous and there's a lot of different variables that can make the conditions hard to predict here are some shots from the same bar and a not-so company [Music] [Music] it felt great to tie up in the marina and I felt better straightaway now I was super hungry though so getting something to eat was first on the priority list this is Charleston a small fishing village in the coos bay area the actual town of Coos Bay is situated a bit further up the river [Music] [Music] it's windy since we got here the wind has picked up quite a lot which they say here the Localism pretty common so we have the key Blanco I think out here outside here just south from here and it's a windy spot and during the summers here at the north northwesterly winds are their prevailing winds and they are typically typically pretty strong so I'm hoping for at least like a two-day weather we know with a business wind so we can continue south and get past this cape [Music] [Music] [Music] life in Charleston revolves around crabbing and fishing the marina is home to quite many fishing vessels but also being Coast Guard Station [Music] the marina was quite affordable at $20 a night so was a good place for us to wait out the strong winds it's very much like home or at least in the south it's grass and the sand [Music] the Southwest of Sweden looks like this the beaches on the other side of the village lies the ocean and some really wonderful and spectacular beaches [Music] [Music] so that's the entrance the river bar it looks pretty okay even though it's very windy today there's no warnings so I guess when it becomes dangerous it's mostly when you have gale force winds from the southwest coming by like a low-pressure right now it's a really strong high pressure the Pacific high is strong and the winds are from the north along the coast at least here I guess that depends on in what direction the the bar entries is it I think like the Columbia River going into Portland and Astoria is more dangerous even if you have northerly winds [Music] [Music] thank you so much for watching we'd be so happy if you would subscribe and help us reach our next goal of 100,000 subscribers

But just how did the host of Bar Rescue develop\nhis unique style? Here's a look at the untold truth of Jon Taffer. The early years On Bar Rescue, one thing Taffer is always\non the lookout for is staffers who are skimming, either out of the registers, by overpouring,\nor by offering free drinks. And he told Vice that's for a good reason. After dropping out of college at 24, he got\na job at Barney's Beanery, and was immediately pulled aside by a shady co-worker and told\nthat the entire staff were colluding in a scheme to steal $100 every night from the\nbar. Rather than go along with it, though, Taffer\nimmediately told the bar's owner, who fired the rest of the staff and promoted Taffer\nto lead bartender. He failed upwards When it comes to bars failing, Taffer knows\nfrom personal experience just how easy it is to lose a fortune. In 2015, he told Business Insider that after\nignoring advice from his friends, he lost his entire life savings on his first business\ndeal. \"I did the deal. I got ripped off for $600,000 every dime I\nhad. And I've been very conscious about ever having\na partner since.\" Fake news In 2016, The Huffington Post ran an interview\nwith Taffer that had some members of the bar community up in arms. The biggest problem? His incorrect assertion that tequila and mezcal\nare related to mescaline and thus have hallucinogenic properties. Not only is this just wrong, but it's also\nwildly wrong, as mezcal and tequila come from agave, which is a type of lily, while mescaline\ncomes from a cactus. It's not the only thing Taffer has said that\ndrew the ire of other bartenders and bar owners who question his skills and knowledge. Hey, haters gonna hate especially when you're\nspreading fake news. Inappropriate bar-havior On Bar Rescue, Taffer is quick to call out\nowners and employees who create an uncomfortable atmosphere for women. Back in the day, though, Taffer apparently\nhad a very different attitude, as he told The New York Times in 2016 that he organized\na competition in 1982 where women competed to win a breast augmentation.The winners were\nrequired to give the bar before-and-after bras that were then bronzed and hung over\nthe men's room urinals. Taffer tried to justify it by explaining that\nsociety used to allow people to get away with all sorts of offensive behavior, while using\noffensive language himself to tell the paper, \"\u2026 it was a very different political time. I mean, I did midget-tossing in Long Beach,\nCalifornia. We would throw midgets. So this was a different time. I would never suggest doing anything like\nthat today.\" He created NFL Sunday Ticket Just about any football fan will tell you\nthat the NFL Sunday Ticket is the best idea of all time, as it allows fans to watch their\nfavorite teams play no matter where you live. And strangely enough, fans can thank Taffer\nfor the NFL Sunday Ticket. Turns out, he developed the plan in the '90s\nwhile working with a company called ComSat, which was looking for ideas on how to broaden\nsports programming in bars and restaurants. \"they took my work brought it to the NFL..\nyeah.. They said 'this is really great let's do it\nourselves.' and I went on the board of NFL enterprises\nfor three years.\" Focused rage A big part of Taffer's shtick on Bar Rescue\nis blowing a gasket and ranting at failing bar owners and employees. It's made him a minor pop culture icon he\neven appeared as himself in Showtime's Shameless \"Look at this fruit! It's g------ disgusting. Cocaine on your bar!\" But it turns out that this tough love is mostly\nfor show. On his official website, Taffer explains that\nthe angry outbursts are meant as a motivational tool to spur change at the bars he works with. \"It's not something I like to do, but when\nI do yell, it's deliberate. When I get angry, it's with a purpose. My purpose is to solve a problem, and I never\nlose sight of that.\" Despite his focused rage, not every bar reacts\npositively. In 2014, Taffer suggested to BroBible that\nabout 20 percent of the bars he tries to rescue end up going under anyway. But he explained to Entrepreneur that he doesn't\ntake those failures to heart. \"A big part is not to take things personally. It's all business. Projects and deals are not children or family. [\u2026] Businesses come and go. Treat businesses non-emotionally.\" \"that's your future - BROKEN!!\" Overall, though, he thinks opening a bar in\ntoday's climate is a bad business decision. Thanks to concerns like higher food, beverage,\nand labor costs, Taffer told Fox Business in 2017 he wouldn't open a bar today. \"I got in the bar business in 1978 and owned\nmy first one in 1989 and back then the music was different, the level of violence was different. I mean, people didn't even lock their front\ndoors. Today, there is a whole separate consideration\nwhen you go into this business.\" Hall of Famer Over the course of his career, Taffer has\nhad plenty of failures and controversial mistakes. But he's also well respected in some parts\nof the nightclub industry thanks to a track record that includes working with some of\nthe biggest names in music and comedy. So it's no real surprise that Taffer was one\nof the first inductees into the Nightclub Hall of Fame, which is a real thing that honors\nlegends of the industry like Lil Jon. Way to go, Jons!", "4ScY1wz9ypk": "The Bay State had become a pretty hip\nlittle bar You know, by 1993 it was more of a last\ncall bar.

It looks very different\nthen before. Oh my god. It's beautiful.\nIt's really amazing. It's f(bleep)** bada**. A whole new look out here.\nWood railings. Seating in front. Suddenly it's the kind of place where you don't expect to\nbring kids for a birthday party. It's an adult bar. It's a well needed fresh start\nright there. Real happy. Who wants to see the inside? All right. Go ahead. Oh my god. Holy (bleep). Look at the stove. Holy (bleep). I got a sexy bar. I know. This is exciting. This is really,\nreally like blows my mind. This is a different place. This is the concept that we\nshould have started from the beginning. Look at the wall.\nWe not only changed the color, we changed the texture\nof the walls. It creates warmth, intimacy. The Prohibition artwork\non the walls. Those are arrested bootleggers\nthat are around the room and of course the still. Now the still has two features\nin it in addition to the smoke of the still we have\nclear liquid running through it. Moonshine is clear. All of this was built\nin 36 hours by Glose Guy Services,\na local company. Great job. Now I want you guys to look good\nso no more crazy costumes. Oh.\nYes. Here you go guy.\nPut that hat on. There you go man.\nThat is moonshine. This was about far more\nthan a bar to me. This was always\nabout a family. You guys fought so hard\nfor this. That means more than any bar\nin the world Yes it does. And out of respect\nfor your family, there is one more thing\nthat has to be hung in this bar. A photograph of the family\nthat made this all happen. Go hang it any place you want,\nwe open in about an hour. Let's go to work.\nCongratulations. You guys ready to see\nyour new bar? One. Two. Three! Look how lit up it is inside. Yeah that's bad ass. Bars on Bourbon Street suffer from the sameness\nand to make this bar successful, I had to make it stand alone\nin a crowd of 55 other bars in the immediate neighborhood. I think it's great.\nEverything catches you eye. I can't wait to open it up and let these people\nhave a good time now. This bar is all about a guy\nby the name of Edward Du Bois. Edward Du Bois actually lived\nin this building, and he was a barber\nand a philanthropist and a womanizer\nand the legend has it that he was murdered\nby a bunch of his mistresses that in fact that his ghost\nis in that building. All right, go inside.\nTake a look. Oh my lordy. It's big back here. Not run into each other. This place is wow. Me too. This is better than\nI could even imagine. What do you think guys? It looks great. Edward Du Bois was a barber\nso this fits out concept. Somebody sits down.\nPour a shot and you watch how they line up to these shots\nwalking down the street. I bet you can sell a couple\nhundred shot a night from here. You agree? I'm ready for it. The shot chair\nis unbelievably cool. Twirl me. You walk by there, you see it. It makes you just want\nto get in it. This is a key point, I called\nmy buddies at Fry Fabrication and they did\na complete workstation course. Now rather than facing this way\nwhen people walk by, you face this way. It's a much cleaner bar\nback there. It's a lot more efficient. We will be able to pump drinks\nout as quickly as possible. That's what it's all\nabout on Bourbon Street. You gave me a challenge\nto create the best cup, right? Right. Guys. Say hello. The Resurrection cocktail. Pow. Think of this baby walking down\nBourbon Street. I love it. You see that and you see blue,\nsuddenly we're branded guys. Brand is that the best cup\non the street? Yeah it's the best cup.\nYou see it coming. Spinach is that the best cup\non the street buddy? Yeah it's the best. That cup has something\nthat no one else has. I'm happy with it, it's gonna\nmake people go to the new bar. One. Two. Three. Holy. Cow. Oh my god. Wow. Oh my god. Unbelievable. Wow. Sick. Holy Cow.\nAre you a serious? You guys ready Holy crap. Do a grass angel. It takes a lot to make me\nspeechless. I'm almost there. This past summer our best week\nwas a hundred thousand dollars. We thought we knew\nwhat we were doing and we thought we had\na good handle on it but this is a better bar\nand it's our and it's beautiful. When I got here, they saw\nthe homes that were gone but there was an American\nin front that wasn't destroyed. This is an incredibly\nresilient community and I want to create\nsomething special for this bar and here's what we created. Rules are never\nbroken down here. This makes you feel like home\nright here. It's like a front porch. I just want to open like\nI just really want to get people in the door.\nLet people see it now. You have no idea how much\nthis means to all of us. I feel so blessed. I do. Let's take a look inside. What do you think of those\nfrozen drink machine? Frosty factory gave me\nthat cocktail machine. Next I got big ass fans to give\nus all the fans for in here. Let's go see the kitchen. Oh my goodness. Oh my god. This is awesome. Look at this. Unbelievable. This is a Hoshizaki ice machine. Nobody makes the cubes\nlike this. Because it's thin,\nit has a lot of surface area, so it chills\nthe drink faster. Let me show you\nwhat we did back here. We had to get everything\nout of here then we had to put in\nall new equipment. Look at it now. Holy cow. It's so good. Very business. I love Tampa. I love Bar Rescue.\nThank you. Big Mike's has been serving\npeople in this town since 1989. I couldn't imagine\nrunning a place that wasn't called Big Mikes. I hope that they still\nhave our sign. Couldn't change that sign,\ncould I? Does that sign pop or what? Absolutely. You can't wait to go in can you? It's killing me. Go. Oh my god. Oh my god. For the main dining area,\nI put in a brand new floor, 13 tabletops, and 6 TVs. Oh my god. No way. We have two solid workstations,\nto future POS systems. Brand new beer taps. We had USB ports installed\nfrom Bar Juice. Four tabletops along the wall\nand eight brand new TV's. Look at this. Brand new Cisco\nkitchen equipment. A brand new double batch pizza\noven and Turbo Chef technologies and then I got Manitowoc\nice machines to give you that first ever\nof their new machine that makes that custom,\nhigh-end ice now. Wow. To see it like this\nis just phenomenal. You happy? Oh my gosh. I am speechless. That bar brought me to tears.\nIt feels like a brand new home. Being the biggest rescue ever, this remodel came down\nto the wire. I had to get\nthe entire playground done. Finished painting.\nRake the baseball field and put the final touches\non the bar in a matter of hours. Now it's time to see\nthe people's reaction to the remodel heart\nof their community. What a week this has been.\nThis is a community center. Kids play here.\nThe community meets here. It's an important part of Luisa. We wanted to make certain\nthat Luisa had pride again and a place\nwhere people could come and put these hurricanes\nbehind us. One. Two. Three! Wow. This is great. This is like wow. New fence. Fixed the playground\nfor the kids and their families. We created a whole new inside\nwith seating. We also fixed\nthe basketball court. Everything you need for families\nto come back and be in a center\nof the community again. There's one more thing\nI want to show you guys. Let's go over this way. Baseball is very important here.\nSee kids play here. It's very important\nso not only did we want to fix the field,\nwe fixed all the lights so that we can play night\nbaseball again. Whoa.\n*speaks Spanish. That is hot. You got your bar back. Oh my goodness.\n*speaks Spanish. I see a carajo and I\nalmost passed out. We never knew that we were\ngoing to come out of this and now look at it. Okay. You all can come in.", "z8JGzxM29SQ": "welcome everyone to video number three of the Illinois Bar preparation project in conjunction with the young law student section with Jennifer Byrne and Jonathan Aurelio and of the Chicago Bar Association otherwise known as the CBA here in Chicago Illinois now my name is Patrick Gould I'm an attorney in Illinois and Wisconsin and I'm a learning expert what we're going to discuss in this video is how to approach the study of multiple-choice questions otherwise known as MBEs MBE how do you improve in MBEs okay now over the over the years I've helped a lot of students improve in their ability to understand how to how to read MBEs multiple-choice questions for the bar examination and how to improve their scores so let me take you through a couple of techniques that work very very well for students now the first technique is to consider the nature of an MBE now when you when you consider let's just take one question I'll give you an example as we go through here but the first thing you want to do is to read the call of the question it will give you an indication of what area of law so but let me give you a let me give you an example did Johnny commit a battery in this situation period or question one so a battery would be commonly considered as either criminal law or torts so we've narrowed it down the area of law that we're going to consider it typically speaking it will be torts okay next thing is to consider the body of the question okay now other people might tell you oh look at the answer choices but over the years I've used different techniques and you know I suggest and I there's a very good technique that we're going to be discussing not to read the answer choice would you say why don't don't they help you well let's look at this how many of the answer choices are going to be incorrect out of four three of them will be incorrect now who makes the test the psychometrician is up it up in madison wisconsin at the National Conference of Bar Examiners they sit down and they think how can we trick students into choosing the wrong answer choice all right well they're able to do it very effectively okay so there's more than one question more than you have the right answer but some of the other questions are going to be very enticing or some of the other answer choices will be very enticing and if you look at them before you read the body of the question you could be very well drawn away from analyzing on your own and the way I put this metaphorically is if you when you're an attorney and a client comes in and they give you a certain situation you're not good they're not going to give you a list of four things that you should consider to analyze it you're going to have to do that on your own okay so it's a good place to start on MBEs to start thinking like an attorney in a disciplined way all right so you read the call to question first then the body of the question and then at that moment analyze the question analyze it so let me give you an example again the question was wha the call the question was did Johnny commit a battery and just to let let you know it's a torts question so one day Johnny got on the the Chicago bus and down in the downtown Loop area of Chicago was a crowded bus he sat down and he was reading the paper and Sally got on the bus and of course Sally just had an operation on her shoulder all right it was very sore and you know she she she found it difficult to find a place to sit when she got on the bus she lost her balance for a second in Johnny looking up for his from his newspaper okay immediately reached up to study her to study her for to stop her from falling oh nice guy you thinking what happens he touches her right on the shoulder where she had surgery she screams out in pain oh I can't leave you did that sir did Johnny commit a battery here so that's the body of the question you don't know what the answer choices are now but let's analyze it did Johnny commit a battery well what is a battery in torts to harm for essentially it's a harmful or offensive touching okay so did he touch her did he actually touch her yes he did yes he did he came into contact with his hand with with her shoulder now was it harmful or offensive well in this situation were told that Sally screamed out in pain that would be considered under the definition of battery it would be considered a harmful touching so we have harmful and we have touching now did he intentionally touch her well you can say it I don't really think he did we could he was just trying to help out well we're not looking at that we're looking at the definition of battery let's keep it simple is kind of reflexive but how did his hand get up there and touch your shoulder out of nowhere he decided in his mind immediately nonetheless he stole he still made that decision to reach up and steady her so she didn't fall he was concerned about her you say that doesn't enter into a battery does it the only things we're looking at are harmful touching with intent okay so he intentionally did reach up and grab her shoulder to study her from falling yes but by doing so I'm thinking that he committed a battery okay I'm thinking he committed a battery well out of luck out of luck for Johnny he committed well wait a minute now we have to look at the defense's okay was he acting in self-defense no but wait a minute where was he he was on a crowded city bus when we go out in the crowded ballgames when we go in crowded movie theaters when we go to a crowd on two crowded buses what do all of us know as a society but we know there's going to be a lot of people there and we know there's going to be bustling and maybe pushing and things of that sort don't we sure we do all right we understand that so all of us when we decide to engage in those activities what have we done we impliedly consent not express through a written agreement but we impliedly consent to the normal societal touches of society that's what that's what the woman did when she got on to the bus she was what impliedly consenting by getting onto the bus that someone might reach out to study her and that's what happened in this situation so even though it was a harmful or offensive touching even though Johnny made that touching with intent he has the defense of implied consent so there you go so now we've analyzed that situation without looking at the answer choices now the answer choices a B C and D an order could be something like yes Johnny committed a battery because he he intended to touch her be the answer choice B would be yes Johnny committed a battery because he did not intend to commit a battery okay well actually no Johnny didn't commit a battery because he did not intend would be C and then D would be what no battery and of course when you for if you were to have looked at those answer choices beforehand it would be very very confusing to you to answer the question but when you analyze it first and go through that it makes it much easier okay so try that technique now another advanced technique which I find very effective for students as this do what I just did analyze out loud it makes it a lot more effective for your learning curve for your fluidity for your ability to target where your thought processes are not on track okay and you can write down certain things like an having problem in this area I have to study this more so verbalize your analysis out loud to your own self for your own MBEs for your own MBE questions as you practice them it's a very very good technique and it makes the time go much quicker and you're more engaged in the process also of course you're not going to be able to do this on the bar exam itself but the verbalization of your thought processes help helps you understand where you need to what I call fix the areas that you need to fix in other in order to have a fluid thought process okay and another technique that works very very very well let's say you've gone through let's say 25 questions in Criminal Procedure well you maybe maybe you've got 17 out of 25 what you want to do is two things take those seven that you got wrong set them aside and come back to them and study them make sure you understand how to get those right and then take all 25 and redo them two or three times okay what you're doing is developing an level of expertise so don't just run through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of MBEs without revisiting them okay part of developing expertise in this area is to revisit and repeat the same questions things will become more familiar to you right the the thought process will come more quickly you'll become more fluid in your thinking and you hopefully will become much better at answering MDE questions and of course the ultimate goal is to grade out higher on the bar examination okay so hope this has been helpful to you and this will do it for video number three of the Illinois Bar

Michigan's on balance podcast where we talk about practice management at lawyer wellness for us thriving law practice with your hosts Jo Ann Hathaway and Tish Benson here on legal talk network take it away ladies hello and welcome to another edition of the State Bar Michigan's on balance podcast on legal talk network I am Robert Mathis pro bono service and justice initiatives counsel with the State Bar in Michigan sitting in today for your regular hosts Jo Ann Hathaway and Tish Vincent we're live from the State Bar Michigan's next conference 2018 and joining me today I have Cara Hart neglige from the young lawyers section welcome to the show thank you alright before we get started please tell us about yourself well I am the incoming chair to the game lawyers section which is the State Bar of Michigan's largest section we are a mandated membership section how many members approximately do you have well first I'd like to say that I am speaking here on behalf of the young lawyer section and not as an attorney for the state of Michigan but now that said we have about 8,000 members throughout the state of Michigan in the young lawyer section all right awesome so you want to tell us about the membership base of the young lawyer section yeah the membership base is it's an automatic membership where if you pass the bar in Michigan you are automatically a member of the young lawyers section it'll not a lot of people are aware of that when they first become lawyers so that's something that I am hoping to make more apparent to everyone and have more people be involved in the section so as far as the membership of the young lawyers section so it's a range of ages yes yep it does not matter how old you are if you have just passed the bar and you're 75 if you are still a member of the young lawyer section four I believe it's five to ten years I should get that right but I I'll top my head I don't know so what kind of events does the young lawyer section have coming up over the next year well we do both educational events for our members so we will have trainings and get to know judges that kind of thing and we also do public interest events so we'll do things like helping out in soup kitchens or expungement projects which is kind of both a an educational and a public service event but we also have networking events for our members because of the Keller ruling we actually can't have simply networking events we do actually have to have some sort of a legal training in in the event basis so that can complicate our process so usually in July or August of each year you the young lawyer section puts on a young lawyers orientation we do that's um something that started four or five years ago it at first it was connected to our summit which is our annual big event that we put on it was really popular the about five years ago when we had it the day before the summit and got the word out about the summit as well but yes so the orientation is something that we put on for the new newest lawyers and just go over what means what it means having your p number now and yeah Saqqara um would you like to share some of your plans for the upcoming barger yeah well one of the big things that i want to do is to create a committee that will both revise our bylaws because it's been seven or eight years since the latest bylaws had been put into place and I'd also like to change the name from Young Lawyers section to the new lawyers section or some other form of that just so that we can have more inclusion in this section because of the name currently a lot of people that maybe didn't go straight into law school after undergrad aren't comfortable being part of the section even though they automatically are so the obviously the young large section as it is now named um covers the entire state of Michigan which is the lower potential in the upper bench yes yep so what plans do you have for reaching those up in the U P well right now we have one council member who is from Marquette she does drive the seven hours to our meetings often and so mark Jane actually who was the Past Chair he started AUP committee so last year we had an event up in the U P that drew quite a few people and so I would like to continue with that yupi committee and get more people more young and any any aged lawyers from northern Michigan and the U P to be more involved and tend to know that we as a section are working for them and have them in mind - so Kerry if I was a member of the young large section as it is currently named and I there was an event coming up and I wasn't really sure why I should attend what are some of the benefits of attending well it's a great experience you can often learn something about a different area of law we do training so if you're not familiar with and say probate we could do a training on that you might so you'll learn about new areas of the law but you'll also meet other practitioners of the law and other newer lawyers as well as more seasoned lawyers who help with networking you can find jobs through various members it's been useful to me that way as well and I know that a lot of others have had that experience so it's a lot people say we should network so you know as far as the young large section goes what does networking really mean is it just means talking with attorneys or what are the benefits maybe that maybe aren't as obvious well I think that we have actually had sort of a a mentor-mentee situation a lot of times with council members so not just networking but also gaining that knowledge from someone who is more experienced even though they're still technically a young lawyer and getting friendships and other professional relationships can be very useful so the as you know the State Bar Michigan as a master lawyer section yes so is it been your experience that master lawyers have been willing to become mentors and reach out and bridge that gap with the young lawyers section to provide mentorship and if asked you know I actually am not familiar with specifically that master lawyer section reaching out and doing that I mean I we are partnering with the master lawyers section for the limited scope representation program but every other section of the State Bar has been very interested in working with the young lawyer section they each section comes to us numerous times a year asking for either representation at one of our events or to be able to come to our meetings and speak with the young lawyer section they all they all want a piece of us oh yeah so if you have some young lawyers in you know that you were speaking to and they were on the fence about attending a lawyer's section events would be the top a few favorite reasons for participating in an event I well I think a networking and then the education and training I think that it can be very useful for other young lawyers to get to know you know others in their profession so yeah that's about it all right so before we close the podcast out today would you like to provide your contact information so that some of our listeners could follow up sure you can contact at heart negra CH k at Michigan gov that's my last name but no - there and my first initial of my first name at Michigan all spelled out gov you like to spell it out for us for listeners would you like me to please okay let's let's do

bar is a fact of life for a lot of anglers on the east coast of Australia it's the only way they can access the open ocean to go fishing for their game fish or sports fish like ten years of snapper but bars are apparently really dangerous things and you need to know what you're doing before you actually attempt to cross one I really don't like crossing bars I've had a couple of really bad experience with bars up the North Coast and they're just not something that I like to do but unfortunately it's a fact of life and you've got to do it I'm just going to go out at my local bar here the crook Haven River bar it's it's not a bad bar by bar standards it's reasonably time but it can still get a bit gnarly and what I want to do is just give you the basic sort of tips on what you need to know about crossing bars and the sort of things used to think about when you actually go out and cross a bar the first thing you should know is how bars actually work what they are is is they're the opening of a river to the ocean and they're influenced it very much by wind and tide the worst time you can possibly cross a bar is at low tide wind blowing on it and a swell coming in as the waters really shallow there's big waves and the wind is messing everything up the best time you can cross the bar is at high tide when there's little or no wind and when there's minimal swell so if you can time the tides the time the tides for your arrival and coming back in again that would be fantastic ready to go unfortunately a lot of the time you can't really you know say I want to go out at 6 o'clock and it might be a low tide so you've just got to handle it and out there otherwise you can really go fishing but if you can get a high tide to go out on and a high tide to come back in on you're laughing because it's usually pretty fine we're lucky here the tides just turning from the fall so starting to run back out but there's plenty of water over this bar now there's probably a meter or so swell and only a light onshore breeze in summertime when you've got strong northeast Lee's flowing and a southerly swell and the tides boring out of the river this bar can be quite a nasty nasty little bar other thing is you should realize is that most bars have got things called leads and their markers on the shore which should give you the angle to come in on are the angle to go out on also always line up your markers and they give you the idea of the bits of the channel to come in on you should also ring up your local Coast Guard when you're heading out and just let them know that you're heading out the bar and maybe ask them if there's any issues with the bar oh I better tell you if there's a big swell or pristine Juris so you need common sense if you're gonna go out over a bar should wear a life jacket obviously and you South Wales for example you have to wear a life jacket when you're crossing a bar should ensure that your boats and your engine is in good working order you know when you're injured the conk out halfway across a bar and your boat has to be a seaworthy vessel obviously the fishing well bar crusher is purpose design for this sort of work so I'm pretty confident with this budget going out over over bars you should also snow the gear in your boat so there's nothing loose flapping around everywhere and you should also check that your bilge pumps aren't working just to taste you take a green one over the father over the side so you can get rid of that water as quickly as possible the other key thing is that if it's dodgy don't go out it's not worth not worth your life going out fishing over a bar that's going to be dangerous so for swells to big if the conditions are wrong and it go fishing for boom up the river like that another day it'll be it'll be fine and much easier to get out but if you are going to go out there's a few things you need to be aware of one is that once you commit it to the crossing you're committed you can't change your mind halfway through so you're going to go to assess the conditions maybe hang off before going out just check the swell pattern just keep an eye out for any odd little things that are happening so you don't get any nasty surprises when you're out there now the other thing is don't rush things a lot of people think you should gun up through a bar that's a really dangerous thing to do because you can hit a way of getting too fast flip it coming over it or damage you're both damaged yourself probably the best way to approach your wave if you have to climb over one is to you know motor forward at a reasonable pace and just when you're going to go over the wave maybe give it a little bit of power so but not enough that you actually get airborne you don't want to get airborne that's a badge might look fancy and pictures and things like that but it's a really bad thing to do when you're out on the water just keep a nice steady forward pace and you should better punch through most waves if you're in a position where you can actually you know some bands have got a sort of a situation in the middle where it's you know not not too turbulent you can sit there and wait and at some times if it's looking to die so you can actually turn around and zoom back in again get out of trouble that way but most of the time once you're once you're crossing a bar you're committed and you've got to do that you've got to go to hold on it's important that you judge where the waves are breaking and keep away from them a lot of bars have got channels that run through them and you should stick to the channel that's the deepest water and that's where you want to be over there it's quite shallow there's a rocky reef so I don't want to go too close to that out here where I am now you know it's about three fathoms and that's plenty deep for what I'm going through here as I turn turn around this little point here we sort of head southeast a little bit and she picks up a little bit more but it's quite safe here you can see the waves are breaking over there where we are on the shoal of the waves quite good coming up on a bit of a wave here I can say just power over gently and smash yourself through it all you're going to do is Rick your boat possibly wreck yourself can you get a bit turbulent out here that's just part of the go once you're through the rubbish stuff usually comes down quite quickly now once you're through the main action of the bar you can breathe a sigh of relief you're over the bar and you're in deep water this has gone down to about four fellows now and I'm out of whatever trouble might have been back there so now you know go fishing do whatever you like you've made it through the bar okay when it's time to come back in from your day's fishing back through the bar okay and you need to put your life jacket on need to make sure everything's stowed away and it's a good idea just to sit outside the bar and just check that everything's looking okay remember the tide will have changed from when you went out those either gone out more or to come back in again so the bar will have changed considerably since since when you went out before again you need to light up your marks your leads they give you the direction you need to go back in and when you're coming back in through a bar what you want to do is actually wait for a wave to come through and then follow that wave in so that waves actually puts water over the bar and that gives you a safe passage through so just want to hang out outside the bar check out the swells are coming in wait for a nice one to come through and then follow it in you don't want to let that wave overtake you or yeah well I would take it here's a nice one killing three and now go in with him say here I'm chasing away like I said coming back in is using a lot easier than going out that waves taking me all the way back in through the MA Lord are my legs okay so it made it back in no problems follow that wave all the way through lined up the marks got into the channel no drivers have a good day at fishing you", "V74v5lZRABA": "[Music] [Music] Newark's my second vlog since I moved to California today we are exploring Half Moon Bay California we're gonna go to Half Moon Bay State Park it's right along the beach we're maybe going to go to Moss Beach there's a brewery or a distillery there and haunted bar at one of my not favorite but one of the TV shows I like called the booze traveler on the Travel Channel he went there it's supposed to be haunted I believe it's called Moss Beach distillery it's right near Half Moon base I think we might check that place out eat some seafood and just explore Half Moon Bay so come along as I continue to explore my new home in California and let's go check out half of them Bay [Music] all right we have a lot of viewers we are now going to the Haunted Moss Beach distillery which is right there back in the early 1900's or something around there around the Prohibition time this place actually use to be called Franks and the story is that this place is haunted by a person they call the blue lady the blue lady was a female he's hence the lady named and she apparently would come to Frank's all the time and listen to the piano player and she end up having an affair with the opee a no player she was married but apparently her husband was abusive anyways the story is that the husband one day came in here ended up beating up the piano player and then they found her body on the beach she was dead as you can see the beach is right here so yeah let's go check out mas beach distillery have a drink have some food and you know maybe hang out the ghost [Music] are your haunted pockets the cool thing about Half

to mean you look forward to working with you thank you very much you", "JSJDNakmFto": "hey everybody ready Hayden here and this video is going to be part of the lost study series I've taken the California Bar Exam in February of 2018 right after I graduated in December of 2017 or January 2018 but very quickly after that I sat for the California Bar Exam knowing I was gonna fail I did and then the idea that I was to try to get a good understanding what's going on so that the next time I sat for it I would be better prepared for it I was my score went up but it was still dismal Ehlo so I needed to you know if you do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised when you still get bad results so what I had done is I went ahead and went with the Barbary Lost study program personally I kind of feel like a loser for doing that in the first place because I really wanted to bang this thing home I think that it's something it can be done without a prep program I know a number of people who have successfully passed the California bar exam without a prep program I think that it can be done but the problem is I need something that can really pack it into a very tight package and get it you know get me to where I need to be in a very short period of time so I decide to go with the barbary program I'm putting in a computer screen you can't see but I'm already working on the early start program and it is just before it's about a week before is it what it is today is Thursday it is one week before Thanksgiving in 2019 the program for the February 2020 bar exam starts on the 5th of December let's open this baby up and see what we got in the box is the unboxing video for the barbary program I live in the state of Florida I'm taking the California Bar Exam if you're really interested in why we chat about it but talk about that later in other videos this is just the unboxing in the materials and let's see what we got first things first is we got the California Bar berry review checklist of materials and material return form I have to actually look at this more detail because I've seen this a number of times where people have they return books so you can return two books and I don't know what that's all about quite frankly I've never seen you know I mean to resell your law books back to the bookstore or whatever is a losing proposition buying the books in the first place is a massively losing proposition because law books cost a fortune and you get nothing back for them so when I was in actual law study I didn't buy any books after the second year and I did I had to do four years because I had a part-time program alright so this first thing is a simulated bar scantron is enclosed not sure how this works but I know that to do a an MBE that's a multi-state bar examination the multiple choice multiple guess whatever hopefully it's not going to be a multiple guess for me this time and hopefully it'll be I thought I felt pretty good last time but in this package firmly stuck within the envelope is a scantron sheet and you know it does sort of kind of look like the real deal and but not really and I imagine I mail this in the barbary again off look at the fine details of that and I'll let you know how that goes later on but you say they want to simulate the real 200 questioned a hundred questions in the morning a hundred questions in the afternoon see how you do on it this that any other thing and that's all fine and dandy but I have no problem sitting for the 200 question multiple choice you know MBE I have I have feel no stress I feel my aggravation frustration their irritation and anyways with whatever but apparently I'm not scoring high enough so I would like to correct that now this is a QuickStart guide into the program check the contents sign on the barbary calm do the early I'll check on early and often I'm already working on the program as a matter of fact I have a lecture on contract sitting open right now and I paused it contracts is not a weak point for me I'm pretty good contracts so you know but I would like to be better you know because I had to take the first-year law students examination which is torts contracts in criminal law so torts contracts in criminal law I should be hitting grand slams on anyway but the problem is I need to be better so I hit Grand Slams I'm gonna hit Grand Slams and win the World Series - right number three start your personal study plan I've already started I plan on doing one hundred percent of the entire program there's no reason for me not to active adaptiq the active adaptive legal learning I've already experienced this in a QuickStart guide they do have some interesting technology aspects of this program that I like very very much I'm very happy with that so what we got here we got these might be used these might be books that somebody returned or whatever I'll just kind of look through and see if I see any pencil marks or anything in there but anyways they have outlines for California now I'm not sure exactly what this I'll have to look at it but let's just go through the books that they have here for us these kind of look like they meant manhandled a bit uh maybe maybe not maybe somebody treated them real nice and return them I don't know this is the mini mini size of that book this is minikin visor the conveyor mini review for California conveyor a mini review for California now I don't know anything about Barbara or anything quite yet but but except for it's like the main course that's out there for studying for bar exams but this thing here is the thing that I always thought was like this is the thing you need to master but you know eight weeks I don't think I'm gonna master this whole book in eight weeks so hopefully I will master everything that is on the bar exam and I'll get lucky with that but this is the book that I thought was like the thing you had to absolutely positively have so there's another thin book for you this is si testing for California july 2019 February 2020 alright again I'll have to look it through that and see what that's all about so there's three books so far this is outlines for the multi-state now outlines for the multi-state or outlines for the MBE the multi-state is the multi-state bar exam for California that's the multiple-choice questions so I look real quick all right they're pretty good so that's a pretty good book there and then they have the simulated MBE book all right so this is pretty interesting this is exactly what the MBE looks like I mean these are not exactly MBE questions cuz nobody's got them until exam day right but there's a question back pattern they'll have a call to question they say hey you just read that now answer this and then there's the ABCD that's the options alright so there's the fact pattern quality question is hey tell us something and then the options are what you're telling them and hopefully you get it right some questions are pretty long some questions are shorter all right on the real deal that's what I'm telling you I was taking this thing twice that's the real deal some of the MBE questions you might have three questions on one page you might have one or you might have to do you have one two or three questions on one page all right I don't think they should not ever ever ever do this and I don't think the real MBE does I honestly don't remember at this point but they should never ever ever go you should never have to turn the page you should never be the stupidest thing of any testing organization ever if they make you turn the stupid page what you couldn't left the blank spot and made it you know so it's all one page make it all on one page so even even a practice ones I've seen practice stuff where they'll have a question you got to turn the page to see the rest of it if what you be doing come on pay a couple extra pennies and put some blank space in there it's ridiculous now this is a California performance test this book is joyfully thin okay the California performance test is worth two essays so you have five essays in one performance test that seven grades you're gonna get you can get one grade for the performance test but it counts as two so if you get a 50 counts as 100 but across to two like essays right so the performance test is probably like the best sweetest deal you better write it out really really well because everything you need to answer that question is in front of you they give you the instructions they give you a fact file right and a law library fact file law library then they give you instructions and you basically have to produce a document like an attorney would write a brand new attorney newly minted attorney you have to produce a document i love the performance test i haven't done well enough on them yet but i really love them it's like a game okay to me it's like a game and i really enjoy them i wish i'd do a whole lot better with them so i'm really happy to see that this book is not quite so ginormous right that'd be great Lex your handouts ok these are huge right now I'm not going to be able to go to any lectures because I'm in Florida doing the California Bar Exam so thankfully Barberie has an online program for me to do alright and but you know I'll have to maybe like follow along in these pages while I go through lectures in the QuickStart guide and a QuickStart application it's on the internet it's online everybody can do it when if they sign up you're immediately in there and the thing to keep looking at the computer you can't see but in the QuickStart program or the QuickStart course for Barberie all of the lectures aren't there and in the early in the early good to go thing there are additional lectures but you have to go find them there in the to l3l immersion or something like that it's something you have to actually go look at your courses and then you'll see the 2 l 3o l it's probably highlighted like it's of course you can take and and then you just click on it you'll see all the lectures all this kind of practice material all the stuff is in there but it's in the 2 L 3 L thing but to me that's first stuff if you're in law school it's not really for bar prep but it can help you in my opinion it would probably help you and then the last book we have our MBE practice questions alright so I believe that they would have the MBE practice exam and that would be the deal that you fill out that you go ahead and use that practice scantron sheet and fill it in you play like you're playing the game for real and then but these are like MB practice questions and I don't think yeah I can tell you right now guarantee absolutely rock-solid the question three in question four have ABC ABC there's no question on the MBE exam that's only three options do you always have and then sit in the box you always have four options a B C and D because they want to give you a 25% chance of getting it right or a 75% chance of getting it wrong okay so that's the MBE which is the multi-state bar exam with the national committee of Bar Examiners great bunch of people just love them to pieces all right so I guess some jokes about that later so the California performance test book oh this is it the simulated MBE thing which has these the scantron sheet imagine these go together and you mail this back in it says do not do not return scantron by regular mail it says it right there on a package don't return this by regular mail I don't know if I FedExed the thing to him or what or if I just can take this and transfer it to a electronic thing I'll find out when I get there I'll make an update on that later but to simulate the MBE I imagine this is the booklet and of course it would be like half the size because you'd have an AM and a PM session I always want to see something real quick here yeah okay they do okay on the multi-state bar exam if you haven't taken a bar exam yet and you don't know it's all about everything else in a multi-state bar exam like you're in law school and you're freaking out about this test you got to take if you're doing to California got a really low pass rate so here's the deal the first questions in the morning are 100 RR 1 through 100 so 1 through 100 you had a 1 100 questions right in the afternoon you gotta wrap your brain around this it's not something that's really whole really confusing but the questions go 101 to 200 all right so you get 101 to 200 in the afternoon 1 through 100 in the morning 101 to 200 the afternoon when I first saw that thing I was like what that's going to goof it it's weird so you know it was kind of like made me you know sit back a second and try to pay attention a little bit more alright so simulate a bar exam outlines these are good I say testing for California Barbary says in their materials that the best opportunity to pick up your point is probably on the essay on a written side right so if you do everything right I can't talk about barberries ideas and theories and stuff like that that's proprietary copyrighted stuff and everything else so I won't do that but generally they say you know on general and anybody can find that information online it's it's the general sales pitch information it's you know free information for anybody basically and and it's a general idea to that you can pick up your scores better on the essays greater a greater extent so if you're getting 50s right it's better it's you have a better shot at getting your score up to 70 on the on the essay exam on a written exam then you do get an you know a perfect score on the MBE right so if you score on the MBE and you get you know fourteen hundred you need 1440 to the pass kind of thing California different scores for different states might be a different deal I'm talking about California but if you need a 1440 and you're only getting 1200 it's gonna be it's gonna be a stretch it's gonna be a big stretch to get up to the 1414 40 that you need to pass right so for folks like me who aren't hitting even 1,400 on the MBE then folks like me need to work really really hard to do the absolute best we can on the MBE but really really focus on nailing every possible thing on the essays that we possibly can to get the best you know possible boost to our grade as we can that said when I first took the bar exam in California in February 2018 I did all the prep I intended I'm doing for the MBE side of the exam and I did almost nothing for the written side of the exam okay I scored better on the written excited exam so the thing I didn't really study for anywhere near where I want from my own purpose to study for I did better on that part of the day on the exam that I did on the end or the multiple-choice questions right and it's like the right answers in front he's got to find it right and so that was kind of an eye-opener for me so I went hardcore MBE prep but I also spent like eight months of prep putting together my materials to study for the SAT exam right when I went into the exam in July of 2019 okay that's the most recent exam as of the making of this video but when he went into July of 2019 I saw everything I saw everything we needed to see I mean there was nothing hidden from me when I was reading the essays I saw every possible thing I could possibly see the problem that I had is I was very very poor in how I presented my answer I presented my answer just horribly right so when the exhibit graders when the graders are examining these things and I'll give you this much from the California Bar if I'm grading question number one and there's a bunch of us might be a bunch of people grading question number one for example right if I if the essay I'm grading is question number one that's the only exam I grade all right so if they give me two or three hundred exams to grade or four or five hundred whatever it is I don't know how many a greater gets but they probably get a bunch right you get a stack of exams on the exact same information imagine that you got to read the same exact information over and over and over again it's not gonna take you very long to know exactly what a winning answer looks like right and a winning answer on the bar exam is a 70 or above actually it's probably 63 or 62 and a half and above if everybody gets 62 and a half it's an impossible score to get in California is 65 60 or 65 there five point increments but on average if you do well with the caveat that you do very well on the MBE side of the exam and you get a 62 and a half on the written exam on all of them and a pt2 then you're in the realm of baby passing you might be able to pass if you did well on the MBE if you did really well on the MBE you got a fourteen sixty or fourteen seventy you're in the past and you get 65 s or 70s on the on all of your written stuff you're gonna pass it's gonna happen there's no doubt about it right so well certainly 70s yeah if you get 70 across the board you get a fourteen ninety or fourteen seventy or something like that which is above passing on the MBE your rock-solid guarantee the best right so so what the what the problem is is being able to make sure that you can get your answers on the written part to look the way they needed to look right so for me I spent like eight months preparing for july 2019 but what i didn't have is eight months of memorization of the materials i created right so what i need to do is i need to memorize all those rule statements the elements and stuff like that that's the stuff I didn't have locked down called what I did in there or is it just a poor presentation of everything I saw but I guarantee you I saw everything we needed to see to be able to pass I just didn't know how to present it well that's why I signed up with the barbary program to see if I could absolutely positively rock-solid get that information locked into my head and using their kind of machine learning program kind of hope it's like the military where they go in and it just drill the stuff in our head and then they give us an exam on it and boom it sticks we are able to put it back out on the paper get the job done and move along and that's really what I'm hoping for anyway that's gonna be the unboxing for the barbary online program so it's a california bar exam it's the barbary program specifically for online because i'm in the state of florida and i'm just not going to make that commute to california every day you can imagine what people in Southern California feel like when they are anywhere in California if they have to go jump on the five hey you have to go jump on i-5 and go anywhere in California good luck to you right in all honesty I got to tell you in my driving in California I've had to go up to the first year law students examination I had to do that six times to pass it right cuz I finally figured out what was going on because there's an 80 percent failure rate on that exam so by the sixth time I passed it and I've been out to California bunch of times anytime I've been at the California to the California drivers in Southern California thank you all very much it been a pleasure driving with y'all on the highways I've never had a problem traffic is tight traffic is rack and pack em and stack them out there but I personally anytime I was driving out there I've never had a problem driving into traffic in Southern California around LAX out to Pasadena and stuff I've never had a problem with it I was very thankful for everybody who's driving around me everybody got a job done and I was able to safely get from point A to point B however across the period of time I've determined it was a better more effective efficient and cost-effective and efficient way of getting travel done because I think the exam in Pasadena if you have a public transportation system that will get you into the neighborhood all right I absolutely positively rock-solid recommend that you get the hotel at the location either be right next to it at the location or within certainly no more than walking distance from the exam location all right you want to be there okay you don't want to depend on public transportations that a buddy of mine who wanted to sit for the first-year law student examination and the they had a BART strike in in San Francisco and she couldn't get to the BART to the first year again right she couldn't take it she couldn't get there and you're not going to be able to rent a car the BART thing goes on strike there's no rental car anywhere there's no way to get anyway let's go to stick a thumb out and hope that you know some murderer doesn't you know give you a ride you know forever it wasn't gonna happen if you're gonna take the bar exam anywhere you want to be if you're traveling in from a distance right you want to be right there at the site the day before the exam the days of the exam okay so that's what I have always done so basically I fly into LAX I hop on the bus I take that out the Union Station hop on the train take that out to the test site and once I get there I'm locked in until the test is over hop back on the train hop back on the bus get back to the airplane take the red-eye back home it's a hit and run mission I get in there get out get the job done and get home right now the only part of the job I haven't got done home on a California bar exam it's hopefully the third time's a charm get the job done get all this information put all these books back over here all right these are heavy heavy books that's it I don't have to join a gym now anyway so but get the job done get all this information lock stock and blocked into my head be able to produce it on on the exam and the software get the job done and be done with it alright I'll give you an update on that as time goes on but that was the unboxing of the materials there's something that I think that we get there's one more thing there's a product called the keys and I think that you know and they're kind of like they're kind of like flashcard kind of things or something like that I believe it's an application on the computer I'm point again one pointing at the computer you can't say but anyway so I think it's an application that either either an application on your cell phone or something like that or maybe it's an application on a website hopefully it's on the website I hope it's on the internet because I really don't want to use my cell phone to study for the bar exam right so but I'll let you know I'll give you an update on that and this law exam the law study series videos and I'll let you know how that works it's called the keys I know that they produce these things in a physical form like these books they actually have these things I've seen them online they're actually in a physical form I would have liked to have those in physical form I didn't know what was coming in a box myself until it got here but like I told my wife misdemeanor I figured the law studies series really liked that but anyways my wife misdemeanor I told her I said I was really hoping that the keys would be in this package but if the application is effective and efficient and I think that it's even better than having them physically in my hands then that would be a cool thing so I'll let you know about that too going on down the road and with that that's gonna wrap this one up don't forget give me a thumbs up like this video do me a favor drop a comment below let me know you came by to say hi give me questions comments whatever on that and if you haven't already done so please subscribe to the channel I greatly appreciate the growth on the network until I catch you in the next video take care and be well", "5RIUYlQrY9o": "well done guys so we got a question in today from a guy who's a freshwater fisherman that wanted to know can I use the the bay boats like you guys use in my freshwater lake answer that is absolutely everything that these boats have as far as their stainless steel components and rigging it's all strong stuff made for saltwater and it's it's going to hold up great on freshwater unlike you know a freshwater boat that you would put in saltwater that saltwater might it corrode some of those components on the bass load so yes they work great in freshwater and highly recommended another question we got in a really common question is about our power poles here guy asked us I got an old boat I've had for years thinking about putting a power pole on it you know what are the advantages of it really we've gotten to the point where it's hard to imagine fishing without a power pole we get so used to it for me personally you know there's certainly the fishing aspect that when I'm out there and I see a fish I can just with a push a button instantly stop so I don't float down and scare that fish I make sure I'm in the right position I can catch a lot more fish but just on an everyday boating basis when I take my family out kids whether we're snorkeling going lobstering or just just going to the sandbar I don't have to get an anchor out I can pull up to the spot to the sandbar wherever I'm at I just push the button and we're stopped it's it's that simple is that easy so the power pole is certainly super convenient very effective on the fishing and this year they came out this 10 footer which I absolutely love that allows me to to be in deeper water I can certainly an 8 to 9 feet of water anchor the boat very very quickly with the power pole there and then the coolest thing is this new sea monster remote they have man this has been the best improvement yet it's just with a double tap the power poles go down automatically touch the bottom and going just enough where they won't get stuck and not come out but but will hold the boat steady so a great improvement with that sea monster remote 10 footers I would highly recommend a powerful", "a6f-1PJZ4zg": "hi Barberie president Mike Sims here and I have to tell you I'm excited you're here because just by watching this video you're telling me you don't just want to pass the bar you want to own the bar and Barbie's been helping folks just like you own the bar for over 50 years now our bar view is driven by a powerful engine we call Isaac or your intuitive study assistant and coach in Isaac well it's a little bit artificial intelligence and a whole lot of real intelligence Isaac is an expert on your state's bar exam including the ube of course but it also learns from you Isaac exists to help you study smarter not harder Isaac adapts to you and fine-tuned your personal study plan or PSP as it learns what you already know and identifies areas that need your attention you'll watch lectures and use other resources to help you acquire knowledge and skills then Isaac will assign homework practice questions essays and simulations so you can apply and assess your knowledge Isaac adjusts your PSP as you go some days you may have less time available to study and some days you may feel like working ahead great Isaac will help you go for it want to do your entire Barberie bar review course online no problem want to attend lectures in a classroom that's fine too whichever you choose you'll learn the exact same material from the very best US law professors after lectures you'll apply and assess your knowledge learning and practice questions are designed to make sure you fully understand the most frequently tested rules for each subject first as you progress you'll encounter mixed subject questions just like the actual bar exam so when it's all said and done you'll have access to over 2000 MBE practice questions that are highly correlated to success on exam day of course multiple choice well it's just part of your bar exam you'll also face the written portions now writing for the bar exam is very different than what you're used to in law school and we found that writing practice essay after essay with no initial guidance and delayed professional feedback well that actually hurt your score it just reinforces bad habits or skills that won't work on the bar exam Barberie solution directed essay grading you'll start with essay architect to help you learn to critically read bar exam essay questions and construct quality answers best of all you'll get immediate feedback after working with essay architect you'll submit essays and performance tests to our highly trained graders they'll provide personal detailed feedback the entire directed essay grading methodology helps you write better essays faster Barberie is going to help you learn that's a proven fact but it's also a fact that you're studying for a pass/fail exam with results that always fall in a bell-curve pattern this is critical and the progress Center is going to help you use this to your advantage the completion progress report will help you gauge if you're doing enough work that's important but the more important an accurate measure of how you're doing during the course is percentile rank like the old joke about the two hunters who came upon a bear they were getting ready to run when one sat down and started changing from boots to running shoes you can't outrun a bear his buddy yell don't have to outrun the bear he replied just have to outrun you in law school you've been conditioned to think about your grade in terms of percentage correct I got a ninety on a test an a is irrelevant on the bar exam and studying that way can focus your attention in the wrong areas for the result that you want which is of course a passing score the bar exam is a pass/fail exam that covers a ton of material you have to make sure you're doing well enough and enough areas so that you pass you don't have to outrun everyone you just need to outrun the bottom twenty to forty percent of other people studying for the bar exam so how do you know since you and the majority of everyone else getting ready to sit for the bar exam are studying with Barberie you watch your percentile rank by subject as it populates over time in the progress Center used correctly that percentile rank by subject lets you know where the bear is your goal to be in the twentieth to fortieth percentile or above in each subject one significant advantage that Barbara Barr view students have is the opportunity to take a full simulated multi-state bar exam a few weeks before the actual bar exam just experiencing this simulated exam statistically increases your chances of passing the bar not only does it give you a true taste of what the actual bar exam feels like the pressure the difficulty the barbary simulated MBE is statistically correlated to the actual MBE best of all when you're finished with the simulated MBE you'll receive your pass predictor score report which includes your percentile rank on every topic and subtopic you'll see precisely where you're sitting on the curve in each area so you'll know exactly where to spend your precious remaining study time that's the barbary difference that's what gives you the barbary Swagger and that's how you own the bar", "p5j0_gKZq6k": "well tonight one restaurant in bonita springs is continuing to rebound after the pandemic shut them down on their grand opening nearly one year ago fox 4's leslie delaspore has been following their stories since the beginning and tonight one year later we're checking in to see how they've

family-friendly eatery says they would not be here today without the support of staff and the community i think we were one of the first to bring back live music so we've gotten a great name for that um on our team just being very resilient and showing up when sometimes you just don't want to show up the community coming and supporting us and helping us through this has been astounding but debbie toy a customer since the beginning says despite being older the seaside bar and grill gives her a safe place to regain some sort of normalcy during the pandemic when they started doing takeout i will admit we were a little bit reluctant because we're not take out kind of people however once they opened full time we were like okay we got to give them a shot i'm not the least bit hesitant to come here and be a part of this family in bonita springs leslie dullespoor fox 4 news that community support goes a long way thank you leslie now we looked at the numbers for florida's hospitality and tourism industry and they are stark once closures took effect at the start of the pandemic nearly two-thirds or 62 percent of florida's restaurant employees were laid off or furloughed now it's not clear how many of those have since been restored but we do know that ten thousand restaurants closed across the state and of course we know tourism took a hit current estimates stand at 86 million visitors that's compared with the record 134 million before cod came into our lives", "7Jg5iQ6AjEY": "hi ray Haydon here and this video is gonna be about what I call the California option for the study of law I also want to answer a question that somebody had asked me under a previous video in that because I do live in the state of Florida and because I used open the distance learning study law in the state of California I am limited to only being able to sit for the California Bar Exam okay that is the limit that's basically part of the package but if you live in California or you plan on moving to California this is an excellent opportunity that's all there is to it and if you maybe don't want to be an attorney by trade but you want to take a program of study that will qualify you to be able to sit for the California Bar Exam this is a very acceptable affordable program or process a way of doing it now I'm not going to talk about the ABA programs or any other program that doesn't require us to sit for the first-year law students examination because that's the route that I went that's the route that I know and that's the route that I figure I can talk about with with some level of expertise right painfully earned expertise let's go into how we can qualify to get into these programs according to the California legislative information page here and by the way I will have links to all of these pages in the comments below so check out the comments below at any time before during or after this video and look down there I will have links to all the pages that I'm going to use in this particular video all right according to this the short of it is we need an Associate of Arts degree or equivalent education if you're good at CLEP test you can take the CLEP test to get your 60 you know credits of education that's required to become you know to enter into one of these alternative education programs but basically you don't need to go to another two years of college to get a bachelor's degree if you have an Associate of Arts degree Associate of Science degree or maybe even a associate of Applied Science but you also meet the other educational requirements because there will be some for those then you can begin one of these programs alright you can check with the schools you might be interested in everything else talk about those later and they will help you out in determining whether or not you meet the requirements right and by all means ask the questions below because I know quite a bit about this - education is you know my forte I really am huge on education and affordable education and never borrowing a dime for education or never needing to borrow a dime for education all right so with that we talk about that in other videos but let's go into what this alternative legal education is going to require of us is its first-year law students examination this from the state park California again I'll have a link to this page below and what we're looking at here is the first-year law students examination painfully every now and then I hear somebody call it the baby bar I cringe because this baby Hall look at the baby this baby is gonna eat you for breakfast burp you for lunch and forget about you by dinner like nobody's business it's not going to care on average okay just to scare you up front honest - you only need an Associate of Arts degree associated Science degree to get into the program but after you finish your first year you're gonna have to pass this one-day exam given in June and October right in northern and southern parts of California you're gonna have to pass this thing and 80% of the people who take it on average are gonna fail every time every year year over year on average 80% of the people who take this exam are going to fail it's a very tough exam to pass if you're not properly prepared for it if you are properly prepared for it it's still a tough test but it's not as impossible or painful as it otherwise could be now I'll give you the example is me I failed this thing five times I figured out what I was doing wrong as soon as I figured out what I was doing wrong I passed all right so my sixth attempt I passed went right back into school at that point finished my second third and fourth year and it's an earned my juris doctorate degree all right so now we know the good news is we can start with just two years of college right but no matter who we are and how much education we have I have a master's degree we all have to pass this first year law students examination when we go this alternative method this is a very tough exam with it's a very difficult exam with it's eighty percent failure rate on average right and anybody can pass and fail this thing that it takes no prisoners okay so now that we know this stuff let's go into the process from the admissions page again I'll have the link below to all these pages what I want to do is I want to click on the requirements now we already know to get into the program right so now this is to get into an alternative this part of the video is going to talk about admission to the state of California to practice law by passing the bar exam so this is the process of what we need to do to qualify to sit for the California bar exam so let's go through it we're gonna look at the requirements so we're gonna open up this page here it's gonna say education you know so I was on the admissions page right I clicked on requirements and then from that I'm gonna click on the education page and let's see what we have all right now this is gonna be the legal education that we need all right and down here it says types of law schools and we scroll that up a little bit so you can see that it's gonna say law schools types of law schools we're looking for the alternative legal method not ABA programs or anything else we're looking for things are gonna make us sit for this first year bar the first year law students examination all right so with that if I click on the education that go down and click on types of law schools we're gonna come over to this page here now there's different types there's the ABA schools and the ones that are approved by the State Bar committee of Bar Examiners we're not gonna talk about those at all because those would allow you to skip having to sit for the first-year law students examination probably okay say that because there are some students that end up they go to a school where they don't normally have to sit for the first-year law students examination however there are situations where California or your law schools say you know what before you can continue we are gonna require you to pass that first-year law students examination maybe your GPA is too low maybe something happened usually it's your GPA but they're gonna force you to go sit through that first-year law students examination before you can continue as well and you know I have a website dedicated to helping people understand what they need to know to pass that exam all right so let's go back in the education here and look at the law schools and I'm gonna talk about the unaccredited law school now when I click on this if you look over here you see the scroll bar and I can scroll up and down I'm gonna click on this but I'm gonna use the back button because this is the kind of situation in the website where they programmed it it's where I click on this it basically jumps down the page and I'm gonna hit the back button to get back up here a couple of times you'll see it'll make sense in a second so let's look at the unaccredited law schools all right and you see the scroll bar jumped way down here and as we're talking about there are three types of these unaccredited law schools well one is an unaccredited Correspondence School one is a distance learning law school and the other one is a fixed base law school let's start from the bottom and work our ways up the fixed base law school is going to require a brick-and-mortar law education the student has to show up like an ABA accredited school or any other authorized school like that you show up you sit in class as designated place in time and you go through your loss study program it's just like any other traditional you know old school law school right and so that's the way that works they traditionally you must go sit in class and be in a classroom that way now some people learn best that way all right and that's what I want to talk about here as part of this process as well each of us learns best in our own way it is up for us to identify what way that is so that we can choose the right school in the right kind of program for us the next type that's a little bit more freeing as we can be anywhere in the country here you have to live relatively close to that school right let's say I'm Arafat let's look at them there's a couple of them down here we see two four six seven so that you have to live either in indio los angeles riverside cerritos san diego Bakersfield or Orange I guess that's the city of Orange in California there right I'm taking Orange County of summaries but anyways you have to live relatively close within driving distance of these schools reasonably in order to go ahead and attend these schools or you have to temporarily move there too in order to go there right in that area that's the subway that is because it's a brick-and-mortar kind of school right for the distance learning ones we can live anywhere we can live anywhere in the United States and go to these now these ones here are gonna have basically they try to mimic the idea of a brick-and-mortar school meaning they're gonna have classes where all the students show up at the same time from a distance right meaning you're getting on a videoconference you're getting on a chat conference some kind of a conference thing and you're all there at the same time communicating with your instructor at the same time all right through technological means you're gonna get your legal education that way then we have the kind of program that I use and it's an unaccredited correspondence program basically when I started this program I actually had to print out my assignments put them you know put them in an envelope take him down to the mailbox put him in the mail correspondence old-school correspondence right by the time I finish school they had evolved and migrated and everything and rather than going to the post office I went to the school's website and submitted my assignments through their proprietary website and then they got the assignment that way all right so that was a great bonus and benefiting everything and my school ended up being more like my online degree from Florida State University then a go to the post office mail something anyway right because they got the thing instantaneously saves a lot of time energy aggravation and frustration and it was a great progression for the school and correspondence law school programs in general right so I think it was a fantastic evolutionary process but for a fixed base school you have to go there brick-and-mortar live face to face that kind of thing distance learning live face to face but you can be anywhere in the world alright and an unaccredited correspondence we did have some live face to face stuff video chats text chats and things like that but they were optional the primary thing was the correspondence aspect of it so I agree with the classification that way but the program operated much like the more asynchronous Nick classes I had from Florida State and from AM Burton University out in Texas where I got my master's degree all right so if you need a more structured kind of program I'd recommend a fixed base facility if you can if you need kind of like the camaraderie of your fellow classmates or anything in fact communicating with each other in a live environment but you're at a distance but you kind of need a little more structure then I would say distance learning is probably your best way to go about it and if you are a individually motivated dedicated and determined person you know you got the motivation dedication and determination to get the job done and you're very much a self-starter then I highly recommend the unaccredited correspondence program because this is how I was able to get the job done for me alright because I can operate in that environment very well but so we should investigate these types of programs look at what matches our finances and our time and and everything for our capabilities and if we want to go that route you know knowing that we're all gonna have to sit for the first-year law students examination then we can go ahead and make a informed decision on which kind of program we would like to try to investigate all right so that is the California Bar the California option for the study of law and that's the process and going through it if you have any questions or anything questions comments or anything and make a comment below let me know you came by to say hi don't forget to give me a thumbs up like this video and if you haven't already please subscribe to the channel I will be making more videos along this line and when I pass the California Bar Exam I will absolutely positively know how and why I passed it and I will be sharing that information with everybody the same way I shared my information from my successfully passing the first-year law students examination as well alright so with that until I catch you in the next video take care and be well", "mM6bBb3q4_g": "let's talk about the fourth amendment shall we let's turn to your fourth amendment approach this approach is all you need to know that's it if Fourth Amendment search and seizure comes up this is what you need to know the last time the fourth amendment came up July 2015 so it's not as hot as thank you it's not as hot as homicide right homicide is the major area that we're gonna really make sure we know we're gonna know you know everything I've highlighted but we're gonna get a little bit more attention to that approach we could have like we've seen in some essays right we could have homicide plus Fourth Amendment search and search and seizure right crossover so that's a little bit of a racehorse is it not and that takes a lot of time to develop so we'll start when we start doing our in-class practice on Monday so the way that will work is I always will bring in the issue spot after the class we've done as a real review so I'm challenging you to see if you've retained any of the information okay but the point is what was my point I don't remember anything but my point is that you have to do the practice to see how this all comes into play and you couldn't definitely have a crossover coming up on your bar of criminal law and Criminal Procedure that type of cross is do to come up as well okay so if you're worried go to the practice look I've given you the practice do all of those questions don't shortchange yourself okay clear cool beautiful let's go Fourth Amendment search and seizure a lot of people start with the warrant exceptions please don't do that if you do you'll miss about 40 points up until that point okay we start with a heading search or seizure let's call it the glove the car enough with the glove who knew that one case was gonna just be there forever and ever and ever and never go away it's good case but how many different movies can you make on the OJ case laughter my husband I finished watching that first series then he told me there was another one I'm at an ikat emoji then I went to the JonBenet and then I didn't sleep for about a month but literally and I was checking my kids locks on their windows like every second yeah for those yeah whatever anyhow charge another car so we need what we need standing and we need government conduct tell us why the person has standing yeah no no I meant and you're great but I mean I'm in your analysis these are like my star Laura you're all with that's it yeah this is where you're sitting and you're all you're all great okay all of you but um you're all beautiful so yeah make sure that you are not conclusory here don't just say oh they had standing because they were in the car elaborate a little bit don't go into a whole three paragraph analysis but elaborate a little bit okay each one of these issues are about 10 to 15 points these are your foundational requirements you cannot I just wrote 15th you cannot bring a Fourth Amendment challenge if you do not establish standing and government conduct so please make sure that you hit both of them they're not very hard I just remembered something that I have to bring up make sure that you know the informant rule in regards to confessions it's in your outline okay I'll put it up here and you know what we'll actually conclude with it see how many issues there are that even I need to remind myself that's a wrinkle that they bring so it's not the police questioning I'm sorry to digress in the middle of a fourth approach but you're you're smart enough you can handle this okay just remember that the informant can be the one doing the questioning and it's a different standard okay and we'll get to it after we finish our fourth approach okay so there must be government conduct and there has to be standing reasonable expectation of privacy make sure you know per where it's listed in your long outline where the Supreme Court has ruled that one will and what one will not have standing okay next what's our next heading so always discuss standing always always government conduct okay what's our next heading good warrant thank you for not saying plain view are we always going to have a heading warrant requirement yes because logically and a lot of this is logic right you can't have an exception until you first talk about what is initially required right so we need a warrant so let's give the elements for a warrant in a little intro here and what is required we need probable cause by a neutral magistrate such a fancy word mom they just say judge okay and anything else it has to be stated with what is that particularly reasonable or not this particular tea standard specific or not it would be brought or I mean how particular does it have to be like is it the third house on the block or the actual address well it can it can be enough so that the cops would know which house as long as they have a clear understanding of where they're going that typically will suffice it can be challenged for sure but it typically will suffice so go into each now if you have a warrant in the fact pattern then you go into each one of these individually and you establish if the warrant is valid okay yes separate heading yes neutral magistrate and last particularly let's say you determine that the warrant is valid do you still go into the exceptions I don't know what do you think yes yes so in the law we will always go to the second option always because at the end of the day this warrant our analysis could be wrong okay so you'll never stop at a warrant ever you'll always then go into the exceptions so you want to make a little transition sentence and say in the event that the warrant is in fact invalid okay an exception must apply a warrant exception must apply and then go right into any of the exceptions that apply so in the event that the warrant is invalid or is in fact invalid I would say a warrant exception must apply and then go right into any exceptions so that's the scenario if there is a warrant what if there is not a warrant everyone understand this I can erase it yes okay what if there is not a warrant then what do you do well I still want you to introduce just the elements okay particularity and then just give me see how I'm so big on transition words cuz by the way that's going to make you look as lawyerly as possible okay most most applicants will not have transition words they will not even use transition words okay or transition sentences but that sets it up to let the grater know here because a warrant is not provided in the facts an exception to the warrant requirement must apply or the search of the car will be invalid under the Fourth Amendment pretty straightforward okay let me to repeat that here because the facts do not provide for a warrant or here because there is no warrant provided for in the facts either way to even make it shorter you could say unless a warrant exception applies the search of the car will be inadmissible under the Fourth Amendment got that all right and then you go into now you don't have to make a heading warrant exceptions it's not necessary you never have to make a heading defenses on the bar they know self defense intoxication that's the defense okay just go into the defenses and you list only ones that apply so let's go into some of them let's go into them if you think this lecture is long wait till we go to torts that's probably the longest lecture we may go over on Monday night by a little bit just so you know okay so I would anticipate maybe going over Monday night 15 minutes or so okay sorry for those of you that hate me now more more of this yes it's just a little bit more okay so what are some of our key exceptions plain view let's start with the exceptions in the context of car searches let's start with those so we have the automobile exception so your heading will be automobile exception how many do you need you just need one right but you're going to list all that apply all that apply when in doubt put it down you know when you're hitting an issue that you're a little bit unsure about when you start writing for it is when you'll probably know that it's not applicable because if you really know the law and the legal standard then the facts should be able to flow somewhat you should be able to make an eloquent legal argument based on the standard of the facts provided and if it really is not an issue then you're probably pushing it right you ever in an essay right and you're like this really doesn't fit my let me get out all right or just delete delete okay but by the way if that happens the key is to still keep your cool okay you always have to keep your composure there's so many times that I've been in court and I'm sometimes I have a great day and sometimes the other side is blowing me out of the water and what they're challenging you on when they throw you these challenging areas or these loops that they like to give is can you keep your composure in times of stress are you really ready to handle the stress of being an attorney and for those of us that have practiced it's stressful profession right right okay so yeah if you think this is hard justjust wait buckle up because it's it's it's a hard profession but it's great it's rewarding okay and you're doing this for a reason okay but at the same time my point is your stamina the stamina building it has to start now okay that moment in your practice where you're going you know what screw this I'm just gonna go like eat something or I'm just gonna go have a glass of wine okay stop yourself stop yourself now and finish it okay even if it's not great finish it because the composure the stamina the focus it has to start now okay all right I have given a few pep talks today probably gonna keep coming all right automobile exception what is the key here what do they try and trick you here on the search work in the search occur so the context is what the car is is it's speeding down the highway no if you just be stopped at the side of the street what is the context of the automobile exception what's usually the facts okay so that you're basically driving down the street right the defendants driving down the street something like that yes or no okay good thank you so the cop says all right we want to stop the car and that level is reasonable suspicion right and then it has to raise to what probable cause by the way there's a great rule for probable cause in the approach that you can use every time probable causes at issue it's on page 147 and it's on the top you see that bolded right there probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the arresting officers knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe that a suspect has committed is committing or is about to commit a crime you can use that definition every time probable cause that issue it's the best definition because it's probable cause one of those things that people define differently a lot so that's a really good definition for it okay so under the automobile exception States may allow the warrantless search of an auto Bo mobile if the police officer reasonably believes that the vehicle holds evidence of a crime the US Supreme Court has decided that this exception is not a lot violation of the fourth because drivers have a reduced expectation of privacy and because a vehicle is inherently mobile so when they stop the car and then they want to search where can they search the scope of the search that it should be in your rule statement so one should be to search means probable cause and then the scope of the search is where is it the front the trunk the whole thing where can they search the trunk you say no you say yes yes or no yes yes they can search the trunk make sure you know that come up with a song if you knew - I had a woman last bar who wrapped all of the law I was like I'll buy that off you I'm just a shoot you know but that would be cool like some song something to get the automobile exception includes the trunk I'm not going to try and wrap so at that point probable cause has already been met yes so in order to actually search the car they have that like they see something there's some actual evidence of a potential crime okay so that is the key for the automobile exception what else let's keep going what else is in the context of a car well we have search incident to arrest by the way these both tend to be tested at the same time you know every exception is about 10 points so if you miss one you know if you only hit the automobile exception you're like okay I got the car one no look for this two so it's important when you're going through your memorization that it's not just standing alone right so you're going government conduct what happens there so what about an informant standing and you know what places does one have a reasonable expectation of privacy right things held out to the public things held in private what about areas that are more murky what about like anyone remember the fact pattern of the dog on the steps of the house yes you took that okay yeah that was a nightmare question for sure for me as well looking at it going so basically they assigned an entire essay it was the last time it was tested it was the last time that fourth amendment was tested the assigns the entire essay almost was on standing so the exceptions were not highly applicable and if I haven't assigned that I say that it was July 15 I believe let me just tell you for sure so if you want to take a look at that oh it was for sure thank you okay how about that was a bad essay right it was a oh well then you know what can we see it it was it was it for most people it was a hard question because most people are wanting to get to these exceptions right but you can be in an essay where the standing is the major consideration okay so it's important that you know those standing rules and you know where one potentially could have or not have standing okay clear good let's move on search engine into arrest so there's two different standards with this one we have searches let's start with the context of a car because there's a separate standard for search incident to arrest anywhere else so the Supreme Court came down and you do have to know this new standard it's actually not that new anymore under Gant okay which changed Belton you don't have to know case names but for those of you that like case names or remembered the standard Belton was that contemporaneous in place in time okay that standard still stands in every search incident to arrest outside the context of a car so search incident to arrest on the sidewalk in a home typically is where it comes up contemporaneous in place and time and we'll go over that after we look at the context of a car however the Supreme Court in Gant came down with a new standard for search incident to arrest and it's pretty shitty okay it's pretty shitty there's hundreds and hundreds of blogs that have been written about this standard it's confusing for those that practice within this area but I've narrowed it down to how you can write for it and get it correct okay so I'll tell you'll see in a moment why it's kind of a shitty standard so we have if you look at page 148 you need a lawful arrest a lot of people miss that lawful arrest okay so what is a lawful arrest one that is supported by probable cause you may go over like five minutes today okay time is it yeah about five ten minutes we'll go over and then if you look at the paragraph under the heading search incident to arrest on page 148 the arrested person is unsecured huh anyone else find that standard a little but they're arrested Perseid blah the arrested person is unsecured the arrested person is unsecured and within reaching distance that's great of passenger compartment at the time of the search how could that be how could that be how could it so let's just does that anyone everyone understand why I have an issue with the standard okay right okay or so there's two ways two ways that they can search that's the first way okay unsecured both ways first start with lawful arrest okay unsecured that's one way or second way which is probably what most is supported by would say he's used most is police can conduct such a such a search when it is reasonable to believe that evidence relevant to the crime evidence relevant to the crime for which the occupant was arrested might be found that makes more sense right so it's an or it's very important that you've note that that's an or who did not know this discrepancy before today did anybody not know this discrepancy that has been changed everyone knew that this was a new standard fantastic great so let's talk about that quickly unsecured basically what that comes down to is there's just a way that the defendant could still access it maybe kick it maybe stomp on something like a bong or I don't know is that it's called the but what's the pipe a pipe a pipe some cocaine contraband something that there are some pretty violent people do get violent when they're arrested I know this is a touchy subject for a lot of people right now so please this is let's not get political okay I have nothing to do with politics in this class and I will never bring up politics in this class but for purposes of the bar and that's important because on the bar don't get heated I had a guy say to me once that scenario happened to my mother and so I just went off don't go off okay let's keep it politically correct and let's just not get emotional about the things they tested there and they agree so unsecured police can search a car following a lawful arrest only if they have a reasonable belief the person arrested could have accessed his car at the time of the search it does not make a hundred percent sense but basically the facts will have to tell you that maybe the defendant broke away okay maybe they still could have stepped on some sort of contraband I mean their feet are pretty loose right so the facts will have to tell you there's some way that they're still unsecured or they're searching for evidence related to the arrest that's probably the way you're going to get the search incident to arrest Matt okay so they're searching for evidence that's the second way I would okay and I've given you a lot more language and explanation here on that okay so make that make sure you read that on your own time okay the rest of page 148 because we do have to keep going and kind of wrap this up soon so okay we're almost there he's me where can the police search within this exception can they search the trunk no good they cannot search the trunk but what about the surrounding wingspan yes good make sure you know that okay and that is an all search incident to arrest which is within the context of a car for every other scenario search incident to arrest will remain within to the contemporaneous in place and time standard so for every other scenario outside the context of a car so if you look at [Applause] where is it it's somewhere here automobile and then be on page 148 on the bottom in order for the police to search an incident to arrest the search must be contemporaneous in place in time that is your standard okay for every other area okay other exceptions inventory search know those every other exception gets tested there is not an exception that does not come up plain view highly highly tested exception almost every single Fourth Amendment approach assume ESA will have this exception consent consent has a lot of different wrinkles you should know them can spout is consent on behalf of one another can roommates consent on behalf of one another you'll for sure see these questions on the MBE they like to test can parents consent on behalf on behalf of a minor okay so you should know the consent rules stop-and-frisk is another key exception if you were to say what are the five top ones automobile search incident to arrest plain view consent and stop-and-frisk those are the five main exceptions and you'll see that in the iro you'll see those exceptions over and over again border searches and inventory searches tend to come together that's really they're really minor they're not tested quite frequently and then I want you to always if this comes up bring up exigent circumstances we see it in almost every model so you list okay if you have questions on the exceptions you can ask me after class I know some of you have plans or so so I'm going to wrap this up in about five minutes total we have again standing government conduct always warrant requirement always at least bring up what is required for a warrant right then we go into if there is a warrant we have to separately head note out what a warrant requires right and then still say if the warrant is invalid however we still may need an exception and go into any exception if there is not a warrant say because there is not a warrant an exception must apply pretty straightforward and go into and separately headnote out any possible exception okay you're not done at the end of your exceptions analysis make a conclusion as to which exceptions if any apply so government conduct so I'm just going to do like the headings warrant exceptions always be on the lookout for at least two to three at least two to three exceptions always okay and then go into a conclusion as to if any of the exceptions apply based on the foregoing since there are no exceptions to the warrant requirement what will happen to the search of the car unlawful under the fort and then make a subheading for always the exclusionary rule and determine whether or not the search is going to be coming in or not and then always consider any exceptions exceptions to the exclusionary rule you could be done here you could be done at the exclusionary rule unless you have through evidence so if you have a confession or if you have some other item that was seized okay that's not part of that initial search right then you want to make a separate heading through to the poisonous tree now that could be a separate call as well give the general rule for the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine and then also consider any exceptions always exceptions and defenses separate eye racking right right okay and then last make sure you know the harmless error test okay that came up a long time ago but you should know it it's basically on appeal what is the standard if the defendant appeals saying that the search item should not have come in as a violation of the fourth there is a standard on appeal of the harmless error test that is that could be it will be a separate call specific whole and if you look just to conclude on appeal should be overturned unless the prosecution can show harmless error which is measured by a beyond a reasonable doubt standard so what's the argument there just to be clear what's the argument that the prosecution is going to make but tied into the beyond reasonable doubt standard great okay so it's important not only that you understand a standard but you also know how to analyze it okay all right so just before we go or y'all run out of here make sure I brought up all my points good good good good good good okay so crimp row could definitely come up as a crossover with Krim law could come up as an entire essay on

given you quite a few days with this these subjects okay because they are so hot and you know I like to spend some time with the MBE subjects if you are having any issues any questions come up I can

wisconsin law school was fortunate enough to have the benefit of Lee of the homo privilege I'm also remember the board of my retainers and we are charged with administering admission to the bar whether it's through our examination or former privilege at our meeting yesterday and the board of Bar Examiners decided that there are so many problems and flaws with this petition that we voted unanimously to oppose one of the principal weaknesses of the petition is the thought that by eliminating three words in the Supreme Court rules that we can very easily and without trouble open the door to graduates of all 197 accredited law schools in the United States and Puerto Rico to apply for admission in Wisconsin that's problematic on many levels first of all it would be a administrative nightmare to say the least but you know administrative problems can be worked through more fundamental problem with it is the idea that by simply graduating from ABA accredited law school you are by that reason alone competent to practice law in Wisconsin and what we know who our very long experience is at the faculty at UW law school and the faculty at Marquette law school stresses we're appropriate of a Content of Wisconsin law so over the course of a three-year legal education whether it's to doctrinal classroom courses or whether it's through the numerous clinical and internship placement sponsored by Marquette and UW our students get such a rich in deep exposure to Wisconsin law that somebody simply cramming for a bar exam cannot cannot duplicate and this has worked very very well for over 100 years in in Wisconsin so we just simply can't assume that the graduate of a law school in California or Florida by virtue of an ABA accredited degree is going to be competent to practice in this state the other thing is that the board of Bar Examiners is now actively re-examining the bar admission process generally and even taking a hard look at the bar exam itself to determine whether we are adequately custody not just the basic knowledge but also the skill sets that practicing lawyers need so I look forward to the hearing this Thursday before the Wisconsin

education and events director for the conte costa bar association and we are so very lucky today to have um brought together carol langford and dean mitch winick to tell us everything we need to know about the provisional license program and there's a lot to know uh for attorneys who want to be um sponsors or supervising lawyer and for uh recent graduates who want to be recent and not and past graduates um who want to be provisionally licensed lawyers so without further ado i'm just going to pass this on and quick introduction um we have carol langford with us and carol helped draft some of these provisions with the state bar she's a practicing attorney with doing state bar admissions and attorney discipline work she's an adjunct at usf and hastings law school and we also have with us dean mitchell winik he is the dean and president of the monterey college of law san luis obispo college law and kern county college of law thank you very much for joining us today and i'm going to turn the program over to you okay mitch and i talked initially and we decided that we'd give you a little background on it first uh and kind of how provisional licensing all came about um well you know it came about by an order of the california supreme court and my guess is that the state bar was uh hearing from different people perhaps students and deans and other people that hey these students are having a problem uh job offers are being revoked they're having a hard time studying um and they were i mean think about studying in your home and and you know i used to see on my video screen teaching at night sometimes the students were sitting on their bed you know falling asleep you know and it was like we have to do something about this and so it came by an order now remember the california supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of regulation of california attorneys in case you're doubting that for any reason i didn't research that issue when i sat on the commission for the revision of the rules of professional conduct just to see if that was the case uh and because we were looking at other rules and it is indeed the case they are the ultimate they're the ones who stamp all discipline they're the ones who order commissions and who review the work they act through the state bar and so you know and the state bar now is called the state bar board of trustees because of their public interest uh perspective so you know we had a problem coming they said we had to do something about it and then they said okay we need a working group and you know i don't forget how i got on it i don't know if someone told me to apply or it was there or what but i applied and so uh you know and i was willing to do the work i think that was a big part of it too and they told us it was going to be one or two sessions that's all it would take to write the law in provisional licensing which i have to tell you i thought that was funny because there is no possible way when you write law it takes one or two sessions um we had a very diverse group and by the way it didn't we met for months and we were doing a lot of work on our own too so it wasn't one or two sessions um but our group was very diverse we had a public defender uh we had um all kinds of viewpoints public defender was african-american we had robert barrett from a small uh law school laverne uh a we had a legal mall insurer we had uh one of the deans from hastings we had people who specialize in moral character like me we had um all kinds of public testimony so these rules were not just you know thrown out and um nobody got a chance to reveal it was reviewed by we had a ton of public testimony every time we met we had to listen and we had to listen we sat there and listened because we wanted to anyway and we read through it all we got stacks of it so it was a lot of uh work and a lot of issues came up and you know and i will tell you just before we you know mitchell talk more about some of the provisions and then i'll tell you kind of maybe some of the issues that we thought about but there's all kinds of issues that come up when you think of provisional licensing that even i hadn't thought about you know things like well what do you do about the moral character requirement how many hours are you going to require of supervision for the lawyers what kind of supervision what are the supervising lawyers gonna have to do and you think you know and are we gonna treat all schools equally which that was immediately there was no debate on that we immediately decided all schools are going to be treated equally whether it's you know stanford or you know a school that you know that has four students we're going to treat them all the same so that was immediately decided but there's a lot of issues can they handle trust accounts can they and all these issues came up and they took hours to debate so what you see is the product of much debate much public testimony uh and input from all stakeholders so i'll turn it over to you um dean winig and you can maybe start by you know elucidating some of the provisions well thanks carol you know i thought the committee did a wonderful job many of you probably followed the general discussion that really was going across the entire united states of what are you going to do with the disruption caused by covet and the worry was that it was so irregular across all the various jurisdictions and actually across different individual situations so you have you know some folks have access to technology some don't some are uh who are sheltering in place with family members packed in some were isolated alone and so you know carol reed didn't mention there were a lot of the human factors that this committee had to consider to how do you create whether it's a temporary or possibly a permanent alternative to the way we were licensing lawyers which is you show up twice a year at a designated place you sit for the bar exam you pass it or you don't and that's it you finish that piece then you go on to the moral character application and the various other forms and fees you have to pay so i i thought california did a really excellent job of of balancing all of those and the answer was after weighing doing nothing but waiting until exams come back online on one end a diploma privilege where you basically waive all licensure criteria and just say if you graduated law school you're in or something in between and the provisional licensing program along with moving the bar exam online rescheduling it moving it online i thought provided the greatest flexibility for lawyers to make that choice or for applicants to make that choice and so what you saw briefly and first of all let me point out over in the chat if you haven't opened it up over in the chat are links to all the details so there's one place to find everything the state bar of california is a home page for the provisional licensing you can go there and these other forms you will find there as well so i'm not going to re-read all of the details for you i have shown you where you can find them as carol mentioned there's two orders actually that the supreme court issued one was in october which created the original provisional licensure program and you will see under that link that it did the following and i'll just hit the highlights for you what it basically did is picked a period of time which was between december 1st 2019 and december 31st 2020 so that was the impacted time frame and what the court said that is if if you graduated law school in that time frame again december 1st 2019 through the december 31st 2020 that you would be able to in initiate practice as a provisionally licensed lawyer without sitting for the bar exam just that simple it's a fairly extraordinary step but it's only for that very limited time frame and then the court gave itself the right to expand that time frame if it thinks it needs to so that was the first step and then the question was how long the court said you'd be able to practice as a provisional licensee for two years under that program then the question was well how do you know they're doing the right thing they haven't passed the bar exam and the committee added that you must be supervised excuse me so if you look at the definitions you'll see the definition of a supervisory attorney and the requirement that during those two years the provisionally licensed lawyers must be supervised by a lawyer that has five years of experience and is willing to sign on to do the actual supervision so let me just kind of stop those are the big big pictures there's a few other details there but but that's the key item carol is there anything else there you wanted to highlight oh yeah there definitely is because um there's a couple i think of uh now are you talking mitch about like just the general basic requirements is that yes oh yes okay yeah there are um because you have okay so first you look the moral character requirement you don't have to have cleared moral character okay so somebody who's applying for this program does not have to have cleared moral character that's a huge thing because you're allowing them to practice in court and they have not cleared moral character and most lawyers have declared moral character um we talked a lot about that now they're going to be applying for moral character uh because you have to clear moral character eventually and so they're going to apply for it and you have to clear moral character but as long as they don't have a denial then that's okay uh they can be a provisionally licensed lawyer now that's a you know we had to talk a lot about that because you know you look at it and the people that get denied for moral character it's like maybe five percent that actually get denied by the bar on moral character grounds for getting into the bar which interestingly correlates to the amount of lawyers over 35 years getting disciplined so that's kind of interesting but um at the same time there are so many lawyers who are not caught by the bar that have real issues because i know they come into my office i you know i would say if i had to guess i'd say probably more like 20 25 they've got some issues but they're just not you know caught i mean people do things in the past and they get over it you know maybe when they were a juvenile they stole some stuff they had a drinking bout in college when they went to a frat party but i sometimes see some real sociopaths and they're very smart people and they and they are able to clear moral character so that part of it is not always shown in any statistics because so many people are cleared that you know if you get a good lawyer who understands moral character and you get a good explanation you can clear moral character so it's a little um that's that was a little little hard for us and the second thing is that you have to have a supervising lawyer who doesn't have um you know he hasn't been recently disciplined or he's under some kind of discipline order uh and that makes sense because you don't you know what do lawyers get disciplined for for the most part it's stealing money it's not for competence very rarely because there's many inherent problems without the disciplinary system it's going to be for money it's going to be for substance abuse it's going to be for you know competence is only going to be you know easy low-hanging fruit like failure to meet a deadline or something um conflicts are very rare they just let the civil courts deal with that but this if you read the new supervisory lawyer see it ties into that the new rule that came out in 2018 and which i helped draft we had the duty to supervise in our old 310 competence rule that you folks remember it was in the discussion section of the rule and it said uh you know that you have a duty to supervise the acts of your employees well nobody cared about that really i mean it was like yeah i guess i do you know i mean but it you it rarely it usually came up where the lawyer might be in trouble for example where the secretary's embezzling out of the trust account this is very different because when as soon as we put in 5.1 5.2 and 5.3 as a separate rule like the aba that really imposed different duties and i'm seeing it come up right now uh in a case i have and it's with a partnership and how much responsibility does one partner have for another when does that duty to supervise kick in i never would have asked that in the past i wouldn't have cared because under 310 i would have said no duty it's a partner partners go off on their own but now that we have separate rules and for these people who are provisionally licensed lawyers so lawyers are going to have to watch them i mean you're you know you're not just going to be signing a declaration saying i've supervised you're going to have to actually make sure because if that lawyer messes up you're going to be responsible so i think that is not appreciated as much as it should be that's in those rules um you're you know it's going to be very hard for you to say well that lawyer acted on their own you're supposed to be watching them and you're supposed to be able under the rules to step in and take over the cases so you know that part of it i mean i think you're gonna get lawyers who are highly motivated who are applying for the program there's about a thousand plus applying i just checked so you're going to get a lot of lawyers and they're going to um you know be you know wanting to work hard and wanting to be in their jobs so i don't think you're going to get a lot of bad people stumbling but they're going to have to be highly watched if you want your license to be okay so we should probably add in let's talk about that's great i'm glad you because we'll come back about that a bit as far as encouraging people to participate and then the other key item that would be next on your list is that you have to have either sat for the mpre or if you haven't sat for the mpre and passed it you need to complete the state bar's new attorney training program which i don't i is that actually been finalized i'm i'm not uh yeah no they have it there's courses to take but it's you know the general which is a problem uh mitch which i don't know i don't remember if you brought up in your paper or not but you know you get lawyers who just want to be transactional lawyers and then you have lawyers who want to litigate and so a lot of that new attorney training is always been geared just like law school bar exams to litigators because of evidence and civil procedure and you know so that issue kind of comes up with it um so the new attorney so the so taking the mpre certainly helps you got to do that the aba is going to make you do it after nixon resigned in disgrace or was impeached you know we had this requirement so we're still going to have it um there are reporting requirements for the lawyers so the provisionally licensed lawyers now that you know what these lawyers young lawyers have to understand is that they become lawyers and so i don't think you know people necessarily understand what that means because they've been lost students they're going to learn and if they have a good supervisor they'll learn but what it means is that if they get a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude of anything that could be the second dui because it's that it's not the first one i don't think but this unless it's a high blood alcohol level and an accident but the second one then you've got a repeated pattern of conduct you know anything involving a theft even if it's a minor petty theft or 25 bucks from whole foods um you know or a felony okay they have to report that three or more legal malpractice suits any judgment for breach of fiduciary duty so they're starting to have requirements of full-fledged lawyers and so i just you know you want to make sure as as a supervisor that they and and i think dean you would agree that the professors are going to have to make that known to uh the students that you know they're they're lawyers yes well we try to do that from the beginning we actually part of our orientation program talks about one of our goals in law school is to get you to stop thinking like a student start thinking like a lawyer from the very first day of law school so that you're analyzing the information you're being given not just so you can pass a test but so hopefully so you can you can use it someday let me add a couple other things so we don't forget just uh that i think get overlooked some of the new rules one is that the provisionally licensed lawyers must declare themselves as such so if you're signing documents you need to identify yourself as a provisionally licensed lawyer if you've got business cards you have to identify yourself as provisionally licensed lawyer but you also have to provide the information about your supervising lawyer or your law firm so people know you know where they can they can they get the type of backup that that carol was was talking about um so but i must say given all of the things you've just discussed i didn't think that it was overly burdened with requirements that would make it difficult for provision licensed lawyers to step into the practice probably the hardest thing will be to find a good fit for a supervising attorney don't you think you know what mitch you were absolutely right and that was one of the things that we talked a lot about because my worry and maybe it's because i do ethics right so i'm a little bit of someone who sees the bad first because i know how lawyers can get in trouble and students can get in trouble but we wanted to make it without much in there because we thought if we put too much burn and i said this in the meetings if you put too much burden on these supervising lawyers they won't do it and i do not blame them and if you put too much on the students they won't do it so you have to let it be open for god's sake first your practicing lawyers are open they go into a firm and you know it's kind of they get a boss and the boss kind of checks their work and we don't make it rigid so it has to be open the only thing you know like we did have a few rigid things like for example uh we did not we do not allow the provisionally licensed lawyer to access trust accounts now people talked a lot about that saying well why don't we they're second-class citizens well frankly i don't care if they're second-class citizens when it comes to the trust account because that is what they are likely to get disciplined for and trust accounting is byzantine i would say 40 percent of lawyers out there are not even in compliance with depressed accounting rules because the actual way you have to keep the books most lawyers do not do that which means they're technically out of trust even though they're not stealing money so we just decided you know what let the supervisor manage the trust account let's give this little lawyer you know their pathway let them practice and then when they get a license if they want to handle the trust account they can take a treat they offer the trust accounting handbook you know on the bar site they can speak with a supervising attorney so that was where you're right mitch that was where we were strict but with regard to everything else we decided why should we be uh you know with a microscope that's not gonna work i like the idea that there's no limitation on practice area so it's similar to if you had already passed the bar if you feel you're competent with the advice and supervision of the surprising lawyer there's no restriction in practice area so i i think that's good for the people of california because it expands access to justice through access to these provisional lawyers that can provide this help and it doesn't just uh cherry pick certain practice areas and say you can do it in family law but criminal not criminal law criminal law but not corporate law well and you know what mitch you know you're you that is one of your big things i can tell by reading your work your body of work you know is access to justice and so that was something that as a working group on these this law we really thought a lot about that and you know of course because i do ethics my first reaction with a group was now wait a minute you know family law personal injury real estate these are high international law these are going to be maybe not you know just in all the united states these are the high areas in california those top three you know it's going to be community i mean for what i'm i see too and sometimes transactional work particularly during a recession because people want to unwind deals um and so we talked about maybe not allowing them to practice in those areas and then we thought well you know wait a minute if we're saying 1390 and you know that's pretty close and they're gonna be supervised anyway they're they have to be supervised it's not like what happens in most not most but a lot of firms where they just throw the young associate out sink or swim they send them to court without supervising them they have to be supervised so we thought you know it's okay that they're practicing in every area plus we didn't want to take students who go to a opportunity school for example and maybe they go to that school to practice public interest law and we said okay we can't take them and say now we did have one thing which is interesting mitch is um our public defender she said she was a little worried because she was like you know i get a lot of people coming in and out here how am i going to supervise them and we finally decided with you know when you're going to get a lot of provisionally licensed people that you just have to have a program developed to make sure they're supervised and and everyone seemed to be okay with that we knew we couldn't come up with perfection on that right so i would i would say to those of you that are thinking of being a supervising lawyer it's it's it's right it's in the order it's on page six of the initial october order there are eight things that are listed uh just a hit on a couple of others not to go into great detail but i may have said five years of practice if i did i misspoke you have to have practiced four years in any jurisdiction practice in california within the last two so there's some some details there you cannot be inactive or ineligible to practice one of the things that i think also goes along with what carol mentioned is if you are employing a provisionally licensed lawyer and you have them working on a one of your clients matters you actually need to let the client know that they are a provisionally licensed lawyer that you'll be supervising their work and i think that's that's not all that different for most firms that have multiple tiers whether you've got an associate working on it many cases you may have a highly experienced paralegal working on a matter and i believe lawyers are have gotten into the habit of making those declarations but you need to do that as well and then if for any reason that you've terminated the relationship with them you have to notify the state bar so i've kind of hit the highlights on that of your requirements of a supervising attorney and and just a couple of things um you hit on something when you talked about disclosing their status we did talk a lot about that because the question was do we do it like conflicts which is informed written consent or do we do it you know so the client knows this is a provisionally licensed lawyer here's the benefits and burdens oh come on you do that no one wants to sign it so he said okay let's just do a disclosure now i would advise that all you attorneys that want to employ the provisionally license and by the way why wouldn't you sometimes they'll work for free and if they don't and you pay them good because they do need money um but it's just a disclosure requirement and so you know a lot of people are looking for work and looking for supervising attorneys to do it so you don't have to get even foreign but you do have to disclose clients should know that way if they're okay up front and the second thing is they have to do a certain number of hours and oh my god in heaven folks if i showed you the chart that we sent in because we spoke and debated for days on how many hours that the supervision should be it's like 300. we talked about everything from 600 to 100 to how about this kind you know this many hours and that many years it's impossible to figure out how many hours it's going to be so we set up numbers and we just figured do that but i would strongly advise you that if you uh have someone you're supervising to keep track of the hours because that way if you're ever questions as a supervisor you know just like you keep track of your billing you don't have to be perfect but just say you know uh sat down and reviewed over complaint drafted by you know pll pll jones if you have two of them or jones versus smith and you put the you know just some of the amount of time and you know that they it took them to do and they keep track of their hours everybody has to keep track of their hours so just know that that is it doesn't have to be perfect but it has to be some tracking and a lot of people i will tell you this right now especially young people they are bad at that because they figure oh so what i've been here for three you know it's not younger younger people sometimes they think it's okay if they do good enough and it's not gonna be okay they're gonna have to show their hours and they are doing them but they're gonna have to track them to prove it so just make sure that if you're you know you're working with them that they're tracking and you're tracking now carol i'm going to give i'm going to take up the defense of some of the young lawyers just for a moment i was involved in a law firm young involved in a law lawyers we had over 300 lawyers and and i can guarantee you the the worst the worst offenders of getting time sheets in in a timely fashion were our senior partners so i think actually our our associates and young lawyers are far more compliant in the rules than our more senior ones uh but let's let's transition just a bit and then let me remind everyone you can chat a question for us we'll take them as we go if you'd like uh happy to do if something we haven't gone into enough detail on there's really two pieces and you've actually touched base on a couple of the items there was a second order that the court put out that expanded the provisional licensing program the the first one is just for those who have never sat for the bar exam okay so they have two years to practice if they're within that one-year time frame of when they graduated and they can practice under the supervision of a lawyer for two years without sitting and passing the bar exam at the conclusion of those two years unless the court changes that date they must then sit and pass the california bar exam at a at a new past minimum passing score of 13.90 so that was where things sat initially the conversations continued and your committee was put back to work again because then the question was well if we as of october of 2020 are changing the minimum passing score of the bar exam to 1390 which is what the court did by order what about those of us who recently had scores of 1390 or better why shouldn't we be given the opportunity to now be considered licensed and that was another whole work effort for the committee i'll start with the end and then carol can share some of the stories of how you got there the court decided to go back five years and and i think some a number of people have asked well where did they come up with five years because i know two years was discussed three years was discussed five years and the rule of court 9.5 9.4 9.1 which had already said that a passing score in the bar exam is good for five years and frequently that came into play into what carol was talking about which is if you pass the bar exam but let's say you had an extended period of time in which you were trying to remediate an issue on moral character and that might take some time to if you even if you had to appeal it had to dispute it and the court has had a long-standing rule that said your score is good for five years but if you don't get it resolved and licensed within five years then you have to sit for the bar exam and pass it again i believe there was a you have to pick something as a basis and the court used that rule and said that's where we're going to come up with the five years so we'll go back for a five-year period for the 1390 to now be the minimum passing score retroactively that the difference being that with that 1390 you also need to still have supervision and that's where the 300 hours of supervised practice must come in while you're a provisional licensed lawyer under the retroactive portion will admit you know you're right and so what we did when we thought about going back five years was we thought to ourselves well wait you know we're allowing it for a year but like you say there are people who came really close at 1390 and they're struggling to and they're having a hard time you know they're trying to retake it with an impossible pass rate here of 1440. so what are we why not go back and then we thought how far to go back and believe it or not i have i take some credit i hope no one gets mad at me later for doing this but i said to the group wait a minute five years and they're like well why five years and i said because in discipline matters because i do a lot of state bar discipline matters lawyers are disciplined if they're if they're disbarred for five years and they can then try to get reinstated but they have to pass a bar exam because they've been out for five years so i said if that's the case and we have five years there and the bar exam's good for five years moral character clearance is good for three years although you have to continue updating so you have the five and three there why not make it five years and then it was like people were like yeah okay sure i mean we had to vote on it and we talked about it a lot but that's the background of how we came with the five years and i think that was good um surprisingly you know of 3 000 people eligible based on the criteria of five years and that we've had uh maybe a little over 1 000 actually apply um now there could be more coming and more in the pipeline the moral character department has been dealing with not just clearing moral character um but also the section 6 cheating incidents which increased with the use of technology now a lot of those were thrown out i represented five students where all the matters were thrown out they didn't cheat um but they were having to go through that and look through all the video of that plus the provisional licensing so um it could be that they're a little backlogged in getting through dealing with the applications they also knew in the back part of what we discussed was that was how is a bar gonna handle all this because moral characters i mean you apply for more character you're waiting six months on a clean application a dirty one you know dirty is a year to a year and a half so you know i think we're going to get more people but that was the thinking for the five years back there's also some specific dates put in the in the order that i've put in the chat that you'll see uh you must have scored 13.90 between the july 2015 and the february 2020 bar exams so there's a specific bracket of time before you qualify for that expanded provisional licensing program and you only have until may 31st of 2021 to actually apply under that provision of that extended order so so those are some key dates that if you have friends colleagues who are interested in this have them go to the website on the state bar the overall step bar website there's a q a that goes through great details of what if what if this what if that do i qualify and then there's also the form on the state bar's website for supervising lawyers to fill out to be the supervising lawyer of record you will also then notice that on the same place on the state bar's website where you can go and look up a lawyer to see if they're licensed in california you can look up to see if someone is provisionally licensed in california and you can look up and see who their supervising lawyer is all of those are now on the state bar's website so in a relatively short period of time i have to say um they've moved quickly to get all of those operational behind-the-scene details up and going uh they actually really have and it's surprising that tara clark and her crew has done that i don't know how they did so carol we talked about wrapping as we before we left all of this that's what's going on with the two portions of the provisional licensing program for those who get to practice two years without sitting for the bar and for those who scored 13 or 90 uh 1390 or better from july of 2015 to february of 2020 all of those are now covered by these provisional licensing rules but carol it's raised additional questions that have not been answered by the court by the bar or by the profession which is what is this going to do if anything going forward but for example let me just pose a question that i find interesting let's look at those who will have practiced for two years under the supervision of a licensed attorney and you get to 2022 they've done a great job their supervising attorney will sign off on all of the criteria that they say they've completed but the rule currently says that after two years of successful practice of law that individual now needs to sit for an exam that supposedly is for the purpose of measuring the minimum competence for the first year practice of law so i would pose what are we accomplishing at that point in time of having someone who's been practicing law for two years to now be required to go back first of all take off work to study pay a thousand dollars in fees and expenses and sit for an exam that is merely to test what we've already confirmed they can do so i knew all of that i'm confused by what you're asking because on the pathway part they're not taking the bar exactly if they've never sat for the bar they have to take it within the two years right but so question is why make them sit for that exam at the end of two years why not just uh allow them to be licensed by what we would call in in the british system articling they've articled for two years well you know that becomes a question of whether we should have the bar exam and what we're doing now is we didn't want to uh throw the baby out with the bath water at this point without enough data on it so what's going to happen is we have um the california supreme court seeing that they need to really examine this is going to form a blue ribbon commission and in fact i just had some uh you know uh i just sent an email about that and they are going to it's going to be basically psychometric value type of evaluation but my comment was you need to have somebody from discipline from the bar and you need to have somebody from a legal malpractice carrier also that or two that that understands how issues come up and they're going to have it's going to be a little different than the provisional licensing group the provisional licensing group was all practice areas people from the bar moral character people from uh you know all areas deans you know it was it was all kinds of people and this is going to be more people of the kappa group the kappa group did you know talked about testing and different bar testing people from the committee of bar examiners uh council on access and fairness because the big issue there is um why do we have uh pass rates that tend to be lower for people who are uh uh tend to be underrepresented racially in the bar and so they're going to try to figure that out law school deans are faculty judges california department of consumer affairs current state bar board of trustees it's going to be testing people and people who uh you know do software and security and and and techno technological people how do people basically process information how do they so that they can try to get rid of disparities in that in the the way uh people are passing the bar and it can be many things you know it could be that you have people coming from a different backgrounds some who came from wealthy backgrounds so didn't some who didn't and they want to try to get those disparities taken care of and so i think that until they do that and really look at that it's really hard right now to say here's how we need to change it or throw it out or keep it meaningful i'm not i i would posit that it's not in either or so i'm in favor of all the things you've just described and i hope we do some some detailed studies the those type of studies have been woefully absent in in the history of the california bar exam of validating those issues so i'm thrilled that we're going to get those things done but i question where's the risk of also being a little more open-minded and consider a dual pathway i could envision a day so you graduate law school you're ready to practice boom you sit for the bar you sit you take whatever the revised bar is that you've described and you're eligible to practice right away why not continue on or if you don't wish to do it that way you elect to become a provisionally licensed lawyer you practice under careful scrutiny and supervision for two years and at the end of those two years you're licensed to practice law if your lawyer has signed off on you being qualified for the practice of law so those who want to practice immediately sit for the exam and get it those who want to apprentice in essentially can go that direction you know i think because they it's the law of unintended consequences and i think that until we really know how this is all going to work the public protection has to be the foremost i mean opportunity that's up there right it's like a triangle right and you have opportunity you have uh serving the needs of a diverse california but at the very top you have public protection and who's going to bear the brunt it's going to be the state bar you know if something goes wrong and i think what they want to do is say wait a minute before we completely eliminate a bar exam or you know or continue the program see they could easily say let's continue it on a little while longer as this blue ribbon commission goes on i think we need to think of alternatives which is what they're going to do for example i can envision an exam because i think there should be some type of testing measure i mean over the years my exam papers have gotten way worse and i've taught at john f kennedy which is california accredited and i've taught at uc berkeley i taught at all different kinds of schools okay the writing is really gone downhill the analysis everything and so i think that there has to be a measure of testing that says one are you going to be a litigator or non-litigator now you could do an individual bar exam you want to practice in workers comp you take that bar exam uh you want to there's so many different approaches but the problem is once you give someone a license you give them access to a trust account and you give them the ability to practice in any area of law and i think that's also a concern and the second concern that i see that has never been looked at by any paper i've seen even yours mentioned you did a mitch did a great paper very recently on statistics with virus very interesting but nobody has really looked at malpractice statistics and the issue we're talking about is competence because substance abuse mental health and embezzlement of funds that's going to be taken care of by the bar the bar is not going to see competence because it's duty breach proximate cause damages it's really a civil thing it costs money to put experts on at the bar and what is competence and they would rather sit back and let the civil courts do it back even in 1992 something like 4 billion was spent on legal malpractice and 100 million on discipline so the disparity where you're going to see competence is going to be in legal malpractice statistics and that i have not seen in any paper really looked at competence comparison of where the people went to school with the bar exam you know that kind of thing i did see a paper in 2019 showing some small correlation between law school and where you went and and disciplined but discipline is only five percent of attorneys to seven percent i don't want to pick on it but that was a deeply flawed uh very summary paper that i don't think any statistician would would defend but uh let's but i agree with you i think those things are are important and uh you know the aba does collect some very nominal data we used it in our paper we actually part of the study you referenced that access lex funded was to research to find if there exists any cache of the data you've described the bar associations don't even capture it so i think to accomplish what you what you're suggesting it might require the the you know conference of chief justices or the national association of bar examiners of or bar uh executives to say you know part of our professional responsibility is to start collecting some of that data uh even if it's if it's collected in a way so that it's not identified to the individual so we can get it over groups of people and periods of year you know that's a great idea and i've never even thought of that that is a great idea to have other stakeholders like that involved i mean i as an expert witness in legal mal i was one i did i used to handle a ton of those cases i'll do a declaration now because i just don't like testifying even when the lawyers did terrible they still fight it but i did it for 20 years or something and you know you just see so many cases that the bar never captures why because the client's complaining about competence but they want that lawyer working to pay them back the money that that lawyer owes them they don't want the lawyer disciplined and suspended so they don't go to the bar you get a lot of settlements you get a lot of the bar says well keep going in court and then write us when the case is over because the bar can't they financially they can't do it they're not bad they just can't handle it so until we have like lawyers could report maybe um my name is because anyone can make a legal malpractice case that doesn't mean it's right right they have to prove the elements but i have this legal mail against me they could then report a settlement the problem is settlements are often done you know confidentially but i don't think they could get around a bar rule um and they're done a lot of times lawyers will tell you just to get rid of the case which can be true but i've also seen terrible ones where the jury can't find for the client because of so many problems inherent in legal mail and that to me mitch that's what your next paper should be i think because  is very good at this mitch really knows this stuff is you know legal male incompetence because that's going to be where lawyers are truly disciplined so we have one question i want to hit because russia we've got four minutes left in the hour and uh belinda mcauley asked how can bar associations help help with this and and my guess is uh some of you may be members of a variety of local bars and and i'm a big that you've hit the nail right on the head i think it's going to be really hard for provisionally licensed lawyers some of them to find sponsoring attorneys and so i would highly encourage the local bar associations i know our law school is going to do it my guess is most law schools will do it and what they'll do is set up basically a job board i mean for an old term but they'll job listings lawyers who are looking for provisionally licensed lawyers professionally licensed lawyers that are looking for positions i think that if nothing more than that is done at the local bar association you'll be able to pick up most of those who need to be provisionally licensed for those if you're on the call and you are provision license and you're worried about how to find it your local bar is not putting that type of a job match together go back to your law school if it's a if it's a california law school and ask them if they're coordinating provisionally licensed lawyers as far as a match a lot of the work does not have to be specific to geography you could be doing legal research you could be doing document drafting you know the supervising lawyer could be in los angeles you could be in san francisco as long as the core product is being supervised as carol outlined i believe you've got a lot of flexibility in that i also would contact any of the legal service associations crla legal services for seniors all of those that are in your community i would anticipate that they will be looking for positions with uh provisional license lawyers as well because it's good high quality help yeah and you can get like the state bar i think on their website somewhere i saw hey if you want to provisionally you know supervise a provisionally licensed lawyer tell us so tara clark is in charge of moral character and she's great by the way and if you wrote a letter to her hey i'm willing to take somebody send my name out you know sometimes things happen like that like the bar will hey i just got a letter you know uh laura mcgee is willing to supervise and you know so uh and give her a call you could do that too and and people can call you right well you know we've we've gotten a lot of people um a lot of people who want to be provisionally licensed attorneys contacting us and this is one of the reasons for this program is to hopefully get some attorneys who want to be supervising attorneys to step up and contact us um we probably what's going to happen is we'll have a a list of people who are interested in being provisionally licensed attorneys and if someone calls us and says i want to sponsor someone we'll just send them the list um and and and people can go from there so um i encourage anyone on the call as i have been previously if you want to be a provisionally licensed attorney or lawyer plls we got to get the lawyer back into that that phrase please make sure that you qualify um by by going to the state bar website and and taking that all that information the application all of that make sure that you're qualified and then please pass it then then be in touch and we will be happy to um to connect you with uh attorneys who want to be supervising attorneys and anna uh before you do it just so because i know you're about to sign us up maureen roberts asks us a question and maureen the answer is yes now you can go on in i wasn't gonna sign you up i know there are some other questions so i'm just gonna i just wanted to there's a perfect time for me to to interject is there anything else i mean i i think you were guys are right about how it sometimes it's going to be very organic and happen that way and i think the bar associations then can also have a structure um i know i i see steve derby in the chat uh thank you steve um suggested some sort of mentoring speed dating program i don't know how that might i can see how that might work we'd have to get you know people on each side together if we've got enough of them we could set up a set up a zoom call and do breakout rooms and do all that um but i think that we're gonna i think we're gonna initially start with the you know having a list of the the plls and then the super people who want to supervise and and and putting those together and last thought if you're gonna be a supervising lawyer you want to make sure your legal malpractice policy covers provisionally licensed lawyers the malpractice carrier person on our committee said something about that and we never really dove into it because that's up to the individual lawyer but if you're going to be one of the supervising lawyers you might want to give a call to your carrier and make sure that that's okay because that's a new thing and a lot of policies won't have it in there good good tip so is there i'm i'm not trying to cut everybody off if there are more questions if they're if you if carol admits you um think there's more to say go go right ahead i'm just going to sit here and uh you know they can also contact me offline like email me anybody here uh or give me a call uh at my office i i have an office in benicia california you can and i'm available online you'll see my name you can call me and ask me about the program or questions you might have okay i'll offer the same thing monterey college law montereylaw.edu my phone number emails there i'm happy to field any questions that you have should be glad to do it and maureen you got maureen's question just for the recording was what happens if he took the october exam but did not score 13.90 do you need can you apply um for provisional and need to retake in two years yes yes and the answer is yes yes you're not disqualified just because you scored under 13.90 if you're within the one-year bracket of graduates who qualify for the provisional licensing program so you'll you'll have two years that you can practice within the two years or before the end of it you will need to take and pass the bar at 1390 to then become permanently licensed again we wanted to make this real open yeah all right everybody i've got to go make some money here thank you for having me and and mitch it was great being on a panel with you always great to talk to you and i will talk to everybody later if you have a question thank you very much everybody have a great day and i'll be sending you the links and their contact information shortly thank you appreciate the opportunity really appreciate it bye", "lhB8mGumJA8": "we're gonna talk about bar reciprocity bar reciprocity is when one state allows you to wave in to their bar after passing the bar in another state a lot of attorneys will only look like in their current market or the current city or even the current state if you look at other markets you're going to drastically increase your chances of finding a job that matches what you're looking to do a lot of people will worry about a complicated admission process and in other states they kind of limit their search but in reality it can be very easy to wave into some space if you apply to several markets you're going to have many additional options for your lifestyle there's lifestyle differences in working in different markets your salary the prestige level of the firm you might get into a more prestigious firm you might be happier and there's other considerations as well and you may actually find a job you're the perfect fit for a firm and a given market and if you've never even considered that market opening yourself up can definitely help you quite a bit originally I was going to move to New York and I had a job lined up in New York for after I graduated from law school and then finished I had a clerkship - and I was thinking about going to New York but it was just New York to me seemed just everyone was so serious and ever took themselves so seriously and the communit in the subway in the summer it was like very hot you know and a lot of times there was an air-conditioned and I wasn't sure I wanted to do that so what I did is just on a whim I just sent my resume to a bunch of firms in California and went out there need to be with firms and thought I liked it much better and it seemed like a much better area for me to live salaries were just as high as they were in New York it was easy to drive back and forth and have a house and it just seemed to me like a better thing so that was the lifestyle consideration that I made some other people may not want to drive they may only want to use public transportation and live in New York or they may want to have access to the cultural things of the city like New York has but if you give yourself like the ability to look at different markets it's definitely going to help you out well one thing you can do is if you don't pass the bar in your home state you can always find an easier state take the bar in so Pennsylvania is always going to consider it very easy there's a lot of states where it's much easier and the reason to take the bar in another state is because it's easier but also you want to make sure that you get admitted somewhere so then you're a lawyer and you have that resume the best time to take the bar exam is really just as quickly as you can right after you get out of law school because you're still kind of in law student mode we're used to studying and and applying yourself over a long period of time the concept of law school are still fresh in your mind the longer you wait the more difficult it's going to be also when people are out of law school for a while they have kids they have other responsibilities you may have a job and so you should really take it as quickly as you possibly can I personally didn't take the bar exam until after a clerkship and that was a bad time to take it because I didn't have a lot of time to study it was working and it just wasn't the right time so the faster you take it the better there's a growing trend of using the uniform bar exam which was a set of three testing devices designed to provide a uniform way of measuring performance for people take the bar exam across the country and in theory the uniform bar exam fosters portability of a law license which is a good thing some states have additional requirements the ube is comprised of the multi-state bar exam which is 200 multiple-choice questions generally unconstitutional law contracts criminal law and procedure federal Civil Procedure evidence real property torts and then there's a multi-state essay examination and a multi-state performance test some states utilize all our different portions of that a recent graduate generally should take multiple bar exams if they can right away right after law school so a lot of states will structure the bar exam so for example in New York you could take New York and in New Jersey at the same time and so people can take multiple exams to the you know the same time so they arrange them that way admission emotion is when one state allows an attorney admit in another state to wave into the bar not all states do this some states have individual requirements such as being sponsored by a local attorney and some states allow admission of motion only from states that have reciprocity to that state so not every states going to have reciprocity and that just means it's tarnished from state and waiving to state B and vice-versa though some states were that's difficult to do like for example California it's very difficult but for most states it can be done another way an attorney can do that the practice law in a different state is being emitted pro hac BJ and then give them and brought me J means just for that a particular occasion so it would just be for one case or matter that they're working on normally a lawyer must be experienced it's sponsored by the member of the local bar association and so there are some exceptions as well for being admitted in one state to work there there's an exception for in-house counsel at work you don't necessarily need a bid admitting the bar in California for example to be in-house counsel but you do need to be admitted for that purpose only to House Counsel the first thing is not to get discouraged if you failed the bar exam get back up and keep going and trying you need to study harder the next time for the bar exam and really put in a lot of effort and don't make sure you're not working you need at least six weeks generally nothing but full-time study to pass another option too is just to take a bar exam in the state with a high pass rate depending what you want to do because then you'll be an attorney and that's important if you're asked in an interview why you took a bar exam and it's given state that you took it because there was an easy pass right just say you fell in love with the city and you really want to be or thinking about working there even if you never do but the big thing is that most of the people you're competing with for jobs will have be admitted to the bar so you need to make sure that you have that", "jS9DhtWG9zg": "One, two, three. - Oh.\n- Oh. -

And I'm gonna try all the\nmost popular menu items. Be like. (cracking)\n(laughing) Really excited, mainly for\nthe cheddar bay biscuits. I'm gonna try and eat those in between every single meal possible. I feel all this energy\nand I'm ready to go. Let's fast forward and see how I really feel in a like few hours. I'm telling you, we are\ngoing to walk out of here as 90% butter, 10% seafood. I'm looking at the menu, and we're doing a lobsterita, which at\nfirst makes me think there's gonna be a lobster tail in it. But then at second I'm like, it's probably just a pinkish color. And then we have cheddar bay biscuits. (screeching) No, no, no I'm not done. Did you follow along, I didn't. Holy (bleeping). (upbeat music) Oh my god. It's like the eyes water\nbefore the mouth does. This is the lobsterita,\nwhich is approximately the size of my entire face. And me holding it with one hand feels very precarious right now. You drink one of these at your happy hour and you're definitely spilling like all the company trade secrets\nby the end of the night. I love me a cheesy dip. That's actual little lobster\nbits on there, isn't that? There you go, you're\ngetting the real deal here. This is insanely just comforting, cheesy, savory, lobstery. We have to do the cheddar bay biscuits because they are a classic here. They are the staple. They're garlicky, they're\nsalty, they're fluffy. You just can't stop eating them. They truly have some sort of\nlike addictive quality to them. Although, fun fact,\nthey haven't always had cheddar bay biscuits, before\nthey had hush puppies. And then in '92 they introduced\nthe cheddar bay biscuits. They also go through almost\na million biscuits a day. Oh. I've actually never had\ntheir like veggie sides or appetizers here, so\nI'm pretty interested. I have never had broccoli\ntaste like this before. It's really soft, and just\nthe right amount of fried. The sauce on it is like the perfect amount of spiciness for me. I have a pretty high tolerance for it, and this is actually spicy to me. You have one and you just\nkeep popping them in. It's almost like popcorn to me, I could just keep on packing them down. That broccoli was indeed a little spicy, so I'm cooling off. I think we've all had this before, but you just got your fresh shrimp, you dunk it in here. I think like giving you six\nbig ones is pretty good. I feel like you have to have\nyou pinky out while you do it. Like that. You could kinda like sip\none and eat the other. Seafood stuffed mushrooms. And these are not just stuffed, ooh. (laughing)\n(silly music) Man down! Let me try it again. These are like really fancy,\nrich stuffed mushrooms. I know there's six of them to share, but I feel like I would\nwant this almost as a meal. I would almost take the biscuit and dip some of it into\nthis like sauce down here. Um-hm. It looks like it's a tartar sauce? It's like coconutty. It's like fruity tartar sauce? (smacking) Pina colada sauce. See I knew it wasn't tartar. How did they come up with that? That's so fancy, very intriguing. Big momma. Woo! That's a whole hunk of\nlobster right there. I thought that was just\nlike a baby shrimp. Oh I like this one. I've had a PTSD moment. I ordered shrimp pizza one time and I got very sick after. So sometimes when I see seafood pizza I get really nervous, but I'm happy to say I'm not nervous about this one. I'd say the sauce is actually pretty light compared to like your\ntypical white seafood pizza. Bring on round two. (screeching) (laughing) Could we get some more\ncheddar bay biscuits? Thank you. I have to say, I love this cup. I would love to take one\nhome for my apartment. Again, you can't taste\nthe alcohol in these. I like the tiki passion drink\nmore than the lobsterita. I've actually never had anything like this at Red Lobster before. And it has like blueberries,\nwe got some beans, we got some strawberries. They're really like going the\nhealthy route on this one. You stop into Red Lobster for lunch, I feel like you would eat this and it'd be like your healthy option here. I'm really excited by\nthis one because one, you get a little baby\nbaked potato for yourself. And this butter sauce\nright here, it reminds me, Delish has a Tuscan butter salmon recipe, and it kinda looks the same. Mm. I don't personally see the\npoint in baked potatoes. I'll take a bite out of it, but I also only like the\nskin of baked potatoes. The inside really could go elsewhere. I don't like. It's nothing against Red Lobster, I'm just not a baked potato fan. I'm a broccoli fan though. I'll eat the broccoli. Holy, this just looks beautiful. If I tried to recreate this at home it would not look like this. This is luxury in a bite. Holy. And you get like a lobster tail. I don't know if I can do this on camera. I think I'm really bad at it. You gotta work for it sometimes. That is made with love\nand a lot of butter. If you love seafood and you never can pick between a bunch of\ndifferent items on the menu, I think this one's a real good mix of a bunch of different\nseafood items in one dish. I like this one a lot. If you don't get to eat that much seafood, depending where you live, I feel like this is the way to try\nit and experience it all. You have your little\nfried shrimps right here. Then we have them tossed in\na bunch of butter and garlic. Then we have the lobster over here. If you order lobster\nit's like cooked live. They don't cook it until\nyou get your little ticket. And then you have, of\ncourse, our beautiful crab. It's like my hands. I grew up in Hawaii. We ate a lot of king crab and snow crab. And one of the only places you\ncould get it was Red Lobster. I love crab so much. It's so good. And then everyone has their\nown way of cracking the crab. I choose this method. But I'm gonna get critiqued so much for doing this not the\nway other people do it. Honestly, it really doesn't\nmatter how you open it as long as you get the meat out. I like being kind of like a\ncave woman while I'm doing it and like I feel like\nI'm discovering my food and hunting for it. I'm very happy, this is so good. Oh my god, I've already decided\nI'm being gross about it. This is a lot of lobster. This is crazy. I don't want this round to be over. I feel really happy. I feel like I'm at home on this one. (upbeat music) It looks like I haven't eaten any of them 'cause we keep replenishing them. So it's like kind of my own\nlittle secret over here. I'm expecting this to be\nextremely extremely rich, extremely creamy, and\nmost of all very cheesy. Let's see. I'm gonna learn how to eat\npasta correctly, at least once. It truly hits the spot. You definitely aren't looking\nat the nutrition count on this when you're eating it, you're just enjoying yourself. I don't even wanna say goodbye. See you later. I am not an admiral whatsoever, whoever the admiral's named after this this looks like this would\nprobably be very fitting. Dunk. I feel like this is a seafood\nversion of a chicken tender. Doesn't that look like Florida? No? Did you know that Red\nLobster started in Florida? I did. No one cares about my fun facts. I would almost consider\nordering this as an app, and then having everyone from the table get a little bite of everything. This is the first place\nat a beauty pageant. That looks like a little dress. If you don't have the steak\nand lobster on the menu are you really a seafood place? Also, I'm not cutting\nthis with a steak knife and that cut really well. I think I would cook mine\na little bit more rare 'cause I don't like to chew ever. You really don't need more sauce or more anything on the steak. And I feel like when you\ncan just eat the steak with just a little bit of seasoning and it's still good, I\nfeel like that says a lot. I think by the end of today I'm gonna be 90% butter, and 10% seafood. I seriously don't even\nthink you need the steak, I think you just need the lobster. But if you're someone who likes both you might as well get\nboth, you deserve both. A snow crab is more delicate. Not as intense feeling. (laughing) As a kid that always gave me delight. I'm gonna try to crack it. Although these, I haven't had good success with cracking these. (cracking)\nOh, hey. Hey. Look at that. (gasping) For what I can't do with\nlobster, I can do with crab. So I feel like I've made up for it. Depending on the season you come in you can kinda get\ndifferent things on here. We have lobster here, but\nyou got the skewer of shrimp. And then you have your\nlittle filet of salmon, broccoli, and then a bed of rice. It kinda looks like the\nrice is on top of it, but maybe not. Let me see. I don't know what that is. Ooh, like a bruschetta almost. But a cheesy one. A cheesy garlic bruschetta. There's still like sauce in the actual, I hate to call it this, but carcass. You can drip it on top. I like that this one\nhas the seasoning on it. It reminds me of like a cheesy bruschetta. That's what I'm gonna call it in my mind. I feel like I want this\ntopping on all of the seafood. I have never been friends with a skewer. Mm-hm. I'm pretty sure it's\nabout to be dessert round. After this cheddar bay biscuit break. \u266a For seafood lovers too \u266a - [Announcer] Now, about\nthat craving for... - Dessert. \u266a Red Lobster for the\nseafood lover in you \u266a (upbeat music) - Wow. I'm not sure where I wanna start. Let's just start with the\nvanilla bean cheesecake. I like that you can actually\nsee the little vanilla beans, I feel like that's a nice little touch. Mm. It's light, it's not that dense. I feel like sometimes cheesecakes can be really thick and creamy. \u266a Warm apple crostada \u266a I'm hoping this tastes like\na deconstructed apple pie. Mm. It tastes (laughing), did it\nsound like I had an accent? It tastes, a warm fall day. Out picking apples. It's like warm, and\ncaramel-y, and vanilla-y. The perfect amount of\nsweet but not too sweet. That's a good way to end your meal. This looks beautiful. Wow. Ooh, look at all those little\nbaby chips on the side. If the icing is good enough, you should be able to eat it on its own. I think. Oh my god. I don't know why I bother going to the gym the days before these shoots. I mean, it doesn't even matter. It truly doesn't matter\n'cause then I just do that, I just eat the entire\nthing of icing on the side. And the last but not least. This is my last thing I'm\neating at Red Lobster. And I feel like this seems right. I'm kind of sad. But I do need to leave, I\ndo need to get out of here. Alas. \u266a Touch me \u266a \u266a It's so easy to leave \u266a Tastes like a Snickers. Very much like a Snickers. Are there nuts in here? Is it a nutty brownie? I don't know. No, it's chocolate chips in there. Little fudge chips. I thought it was nuts. Fudge chips, just more chocolate. This is the first time, I think, in a long time on these shoots that I've ended not feeling\ncompletely destroyed. What have I gotten myself into? I need a moment. This is the face of joy. You're laughing at me. That might turn into a dark slumber. So I'm just gonna continue\nworking on my brownie overboard. And we're packing up all\nthe rest of the food. Bringing it back to the office. If there's anything that I forgot to order or that you feel like\nI truly missed out on let me know and I'll make\nsure I make a trip back. Until then.

So but first we have to\nget through this plane ride which I don't think is\ngoing to be too bad, I mean it's just normal so, yeah. So guys, we just got off our plane, we didn't really record\nit 'cause it was small, it was kinda boring, it\nwas really squishy, so, we didn't record that,\nbut we're definitely gonna record the next one, oh gosh, Ron, we're definitely gonna record the next one 'cause it's seven hours long, it's the longest plane and\nit's gonna be super awesome 'cause we're gonna have a nice bed because it's gonna be over night, and we're gonna show\nyou every little detail, anything that's on the plane,\nwe're gonna show you it.

Are you having a good time? You excited to go on the plane? - Think she said yes. - So guys, we just sat down on our seats, we didn't even get a good look around, but it already looks pretty awesome, I'm sitting right next to Ronald, right behind this little board thing, and Ronald said he wants\nto show me something 'cause I think he just\nfound something out. - Okay, so. - Oh, fancy, can make it go down. - (woman off-screen)\nOrange or apple juice? - Apple juice. - [Karina] You got some\nfresh apple juice, Ronald. - Yes. - I already had some apple\njuice but I drank all mine 'cause I was thirsty.

You being fancy drinking your apple juice, your fancy apple juice. - Hi, I'm posh. - [Karina] All right, I'm gonna try and turn my thing into a bed. So gotta keep my feet up and get ready and press the bed thing, maybe I have to hold it. Aw yeah, look at that. It's going into a bed! - [Ronald] You have to hold it? - Yeah. This is the most epic bed ever. - Karina, this is any normal bed. (laughing) - You guys, we are fully lying down, well I can't really lie down\nbecause my bag is over there. But this is still pretty epic. - I'm sitting on the seat belts. - Very, very nice. - Okay, but for take off, we need to put it to normal, though. - [Karina] 'cause we're not that fancy. - Yes. - Okay, so we are\ndefinitely gonna take off, and if we find something\nnew about this place, we're gonna show it off. Okay, good, they have outlets. If they didn't have outlets\nI probably would scream, so. Guys, we're gonna see\nyou guys when we take off or when we get a drink,\n'cause I'm really hungry.

It's almost ten o'clock,\nhaven't had any breakfast except for like a tiny\ncroissant so that's wonderful. - Karina, that wasn't tiny that was huge. - Yeah, but croissants aren't\nthat filling, okay Ronald. - Okay. - So hopefully on this\nplane they have some food 'cause I am so hungry. And we're gonna be posting on our stories, also I'm going to be opening advent calendar 'cause it's the morning, I still haven't opened my\nadvent calendar for today, so I'm posting it on my\nstories so stay tuned. (singing) So guys, we are sitting in\nthe seats of the next airplane and I didn't expect the\nseats to be like nice because this plane's only four hours long, but it's pretty epic,\nI've got lots of leg room, we got a chair that folds out into a bed, we got Ronald right here,\nsitting right next to me as always.\n- And I come with the flight. - We have another screen here in case I don't want\nto talk to Ron anymore 'cause Ron's just being\nannoying, like bye Ronald. Wait how do you put up the screen? It's kinda useless 'cause I\ncan just peer over like that. - Well why would you? - I don't know. We got a little, tiny TV, very, very nice. Right here we got our tray table, I think. Here is Ronald, once again. And also we see all these\nlike weird, puddle things, I think they're coral reefs, you see these light blue\npatches in the water? I think those are coral reefs. Also, there's an island in this center, I don't know if you can\nsee it, I can zoom in, oh, oh, clouds, it's very cloudy. Guys, now I have a clear\nview of this island. And if you look closely, I'm pretty sure that's a resort there. - Maybe it's our resort! - Maybe. No, I'm pretty sure\nwe're landing somewhere, like on a big island and we're gonna take a boat to our resort. - Well, it has to be big\nenough to fit an airplane. - Yeah, so we're landing on\n- Why are you zoomed in on me - Wait, whoa, look at that,\nthat's a way bigger island. And it has like these\nhuge, one of those huge like puddle things we saw around it. Wait oh, wait, look. And this is one of the\nislands, I'm assuming. Look, there's so many\nlittle houses on there if you zoom in, and look, and these islands, there's like houses sticking out of the islands, and like in Bora Bora. Yeah, oh nope, the clouds are coming back, oh nope, please, clouds be gone, we would like to see the islands, please. So guys we just landed in the Maldives. We're still alive, so that means we're gonna have a great trip in\nthe Maldives, I'm so excited. - Karina, you're dancing. - Yeah, first we have to go on a boat, get to our island, I see the city. (Ronald mumbling) - The security. I wonder if the airport's gonna be like the same airport in Hawaii, I don't know if you guys\nhave been to Hawaii, but their airport is\nlike made of like straw and the room's made of\nstraw and everything is like outside and I remember\nthe one time we went to Hawaii it was raining so much, we all got soaked. But today it looks extremely\nsunny, not a sign of rain, maybe cloudy, but that's\nthe least of our worries. - But clouds bring rain. - Okay, hopefully no rain, then. Let's get off this plane\nand get to our island. - Ah! - So guys, we are in the\nairport and I'm so hot. I'm wearing leggings, so you\ncan imagine how hot I am. I'm like, I'm gonna turn into a puddle of Karina on the floor, and\nif you wanna take me any place you gotta grab a bucket.\n- Yes, you're a snowman and you're gonna melt. - Yeah, but soon we're gonna be going on a boat to our resort, I'm super excited to jump in the water, I think I might jump in\nthe water fully clothed, I don't care, I'm just so hot, so there's this little, these\ncouple of fans over there, but I don't think those\nare doing me much good 'cause it's just so hot here. What do you have to say about this, what's your opinion?\n- Your mom. (gasping) - Okay guys, we'll see you on the boat. Okay guys, we are now inside the boat, there's like a really\ngood air-conditioner, so I'm gonna survive it, thankfully. And we got some nice life jackets in here and we are sailing away from shore, goodbye airports that brought us here. So guys! (Ronald screaming) We are at our villa, so that means it's time for a villa tour! So this is the front gate\nand over here we got walls to protect like us from like strangers. And right here we got a chill path, to know you gonna walk the path to chill. - [Ronald Sing-Song] Mining away. - Mining away, sure. And we're gonna walk, you know, and then ba-bayum, it's a pool! Like we got a pool, like\nright in front of our door. This is the front door, but\nwe don't like using this door because this door is boring,\nwe got a better door. And we got this pool,\nit's an L-shaped pool, it goes around there. - And then kung-fu fight! - Put down the bamboo stick,\nno one has to get hurt. Okay, no more kung-fu fighting. All right so right here\nwe have our little deck, this is the front entrance that we use. Got some cool couches and\nright here we got the beach, we got sand, we're\ngonna walk on the beach, oh yeah, there's crabs, be careful. Right here we got some places to sit, we got little bean baggos. And then right here is the\nwater, like it's so close, like I can touch it, I'm\ngonna touch the water. Touch. I touched the water. - Okay, I'm gonna touch the water. Oh that's nice. - The water is really nice. So the beach is right\nin front of our door. So let's now go back\nto our door right here and show you the inside. - Karina, we have to show off this. This cleans our feets. - Okay, you can clean\nyour feet with the water, but I'm gonna clean my\nfeet with this hedgehog, 'cause you like wipe your feet on here and it gets the sand off. Ron's doing it the newbie way. (laughing) Now you got sand all over your feet again, 'cause you just made your feet wet. (laughing) Ronald is a newb. (laughing) Let's go inside the villa. So now we are inside the villa, inside air conditioning, finally, I'm not gonna sweat my guts out. So right here we have the entrance. - Karina, are you okay? (laughing) - I don't know, it's so hot here. We have our entrance way, we\ngot lots of space to do yoga. That's Ronald's yoga. Do a yoga move. Very nice. Wait no, don't get the, no! (beeping) All right so here we\ngot a nice sitting area, and right here is the master bedroom, we got Alia's little bed, aw. - Oh yeah! - Okay. (laughing) Got a master bedroom, it's really cool, it's got a canopy bed it's\nlike hanging from the ceiling. - This is where you do\nyour parkour and breathing. - Okay, parkour breathing. (farting) Here we got the drinks\nso we can be all fancy. Right here is the closet, we have this area to change our outfits. - Spiderman. - So you can like, this outfit's cute, maybe this outfit's not cute, Ronald's outfit's not cute. - You're fat. (laughing) - All right, so right here, - Shelf, you have to mention the shelf. - Ron wants to mention the shelf. - This is the ultimate shelf. - Right here we got some\nsinkies, got some suitcases here, and right here is super awesome because we have an outdoor shower. Look how big this shower is, you can fit like 15 people here. - Karina, I think that's a bit too harsh, because at least one of\nthem is gonna be obese. (record scratching) - What? - So you cannot fit 15 people. - Okay, maybe, but right\nhere we got the bathtub, we got some leaves in\nthis, it's a little gross, but you know, it's\nstill an outdoor bathtub so it's super epic. - So it counts. - We got this pointless umbrella, because there's no like\numbrella, it's just sticks. All right, so. - It's pull, Karina, do\nyou know how to read? - Yes, I do. - Karina's retarded. - Welcome to our bedroom! - I dibs everything in this house. - No, this is my bed\nright next to the window, that's Ronald's bed next\nto the boring old wall. - I like walls. (laughing) - Okay, I dibs this beanbag thing, though. - I already dibs that. - No, it's mine, it's\non my side of the bed. - But it's about to be on mine. - Okay, fine, you can\nhave the beanbag thing, I don't know what you're\ngonna do with it, though. (Ronald groaning) Okay, that's very nice. Right here we got our closet and right here we got the bathroom, got a nice sink we got a mirror, we got the toilet, we got\nthe shower, very nice.

attorney admissions and the pandemic a conversation about employment issues for new law graduates in 2020. this program is sponsored by the city bar of new york and we're happy to be joining today a conversation about how the pandemic has impacted particularly bar exam administration and admission to the bar for thousands of law graduates across the country obviously the pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to all aspects of american life and legal education is no exception there's a great deal of uncertainty at the moment around the bar exam and attorney admissions around the nation we hope to be able to shed some light on how those matters are evolving this afternoon and take your questions as you share them with us and we have a great panel and at this time i'm going to ask each of the panelists to just introduce themselves and say just a bit about their background and uh perspective so why don't we just go alphabetically and begin with maryland billet thanks craig hi i'm mary lou bilik i'm the dean of community law school his mission is to create access to legal education and create excellent social justice lawyers for the purposes of this panel i guess my short bio would be that in 1985 i was the secretary of the city bar committee um that called for a serious examination of the bar exam um wondering whether and how it was related to competent practice as opposed to recovered knowledge um under high-stakes circumstances about the law but since that's not going to be the question posed to me i'm going to try to just be descriptive in answering uh and answering my questions i'm really pleased to be here today all right thank you um hank greenberg you dean um i am the immediate past president of the new york state bar association i stepped down a couple of weeks ago when my term ended i'm a partner with the law firm of greenberg uh primarily uh doing litigation and i recently became the chair of the newly formed uh state commission chief judge d fiori created it to reimagine the future of new york all right great glad to have you um ann lefevre thank you i'm also very pleased to be joining the panel today uh i'm a partner in the litigation group at pillsbury winthrop uh and i've been there since uh started as a first year in 2007 so i can tell you somebody who was started her career during right before the the lehman's brother crash um and starting her career during a time period of great uncertainty i really empathize with with the class of 2020. and i also serve as the hiring partner for the new york office of pillsbury winthrop a position that i've had for three years uh now and so i uh and prior to that serving on the recruiting committee for about six years thank you anne good to have you uh deborah jones merit hi thank you craig um i too am very happy to be here i am the daughter of a professor who taught at a law school located in new york for most of his lifetime and i also graduated from a school located in the great state of new york so i feel great ties to you i'm currently a distinguished university professor at the ohio state university i do a lot of my research on licensing and the competencies that lawyers need including having just finished up a study that involved 50 focus groups in 14 states rural urban all sorts of input about what it is that new lawyers really need to know and be able to do i might drop a few hints about the results of that study which won't be out until december i also i co-authored a policy paper this summer with mary lou and some others about options for states and we jointly maintain a website called barcovid19 dot that continues to update people on those options thank you deborah good to have you here my name is craig boyce and i'm the dean of syracuse university college of law and um prior to i've been here four years uh prior to that i was a dean of cleveland marshall college of law for five years it's very difficult to be a dean and not be deeply engaged in issues around the bar and around licensing of new lawyers and so this is certainly a topic that's very near and dear to my heart so um our format will be that i will ask um a question of each of the panelists as an initial matter and they will spend several minutes uh sort of responding to that question and uh then we will turn to the q a and get questions from the audience you may ask questions by hitting the q a button at the bottom of your screen and then typing that in i will monitor those questions and share those questions with the panelists so if we can just step back a few months uh covet 19 strikes in march as most of us were in the middle of our spring semester [Music] by april virtually every law school in the country had had close to in-person instruction was providing distance remote instruction so that people could um be in lockdown quarantine to promote safety around this this virus i i recall a great deal of uncertainty about how long it was going to last what things we would need to cancel whether we could continue to do things it became clear as infection rates grew that events a couple of months out were clearly going to have to be canceled or postponed and that happened one of the biggest for all graduates of law schools is the bar exam which happens in july and february of each year the largest administration the exam is is in july and the uncertainty there created a great deal of concern among my students and among students across the country our exam boards the national council bar examiners state courts all began to look at this problem they were confronted with really not a lot of good options they could delay the bar simply cancel the one in july and wait to the one that that uh rolled around in february they could delay the bar and offer an interim bar uh later in the fall as they were able to ramp up to that of course that presented problems of uh capacity uh because with social distancing and the need for personal protective equipment um it was going to be challenging to be able to administer the bar to all of uh those uh who wanted to take it uh this would be uh a particular problem if the bar was canceled in july and simply put off to february you'd have even more people wanting to take the bar then and so capacity has been a central issue some states have looked at spreading students graduates out as they take the exam and and offering an administering exam in a number of locations of course there's not enough capacity and so then that led to questions of who's going to be able to take the bar exam we limit it to those who are taking it for the first time we exclude limbs and so that has caused a great deal of concern about equity as well um is it safe for students to travel around the country the different states where they want to take the bar exam are some sorts of measures that should be taken to protect bar takers from one another if they're coming from highly infected areas and so forth do we simply waive the bar exam this year and provide for some alternative way for graduates to be admitted to practice perhaps practice orders perhaps a different perhaps a different kind of exam maybe an online exam so um these are all the things that are sort of uh swirling uh in the air at the moment and i will begin by asking the first question of deborah jones merit uh debbie obviously huge impact from covet 19 on how the bar exam and the bar process will work in 2020 and the ability of our law graduates to practice law i know that you've done a lot of work in summarizing and maintaining an updated index of things that different states are doing can you share how the different states have responded to the pandemic i'd be happy to and let me share my screen i think that works there since i'm going to be talking about a few numbers i thought i'd throw up a powerpoint slide or two before we talk about what states are doing for those of you in the audience who are not complete bar exam nerds i need to give you just a little bit of background about what is available for the bar exam the national conference of bar examiners known as nce prepares many of the materials that states use many states use all of the ncbe materials and all except louisiana use at least some what ncbe prepares are a set of multiple choice questions a set of essay questions and also a performance two performance tests which are closed case files that test takers are given to read to analyze and then to prepare some sort of written document maybe a memo to a partner or a letter to a client or even a complaint so those are the materials that ncbe controls and what they have decided this year is that they will make all of those materials available on three sets of dates the originally scheduled date in july plus two dates in september recently just a few days ago they also announced that they will provide a half of their materials in october early october this will be for online administration the first three opportunities are solely for in person states cannot use those ncbe materials and put them online but in this early october session they will provide half the number of multiple tutorials questions half the number of essays and half the performance tests for a six hour bar exam rather than a 12 hour one and we'll talk in a few minutes about what kind of impact that might have let's look though first at what states are doing now that we know what materials they have from ncbe well 20 of them have decided to go ahead with the in-person exam in july 17 are going to give an in-person exam on one of those two september dates and five have decided to offer the in-person exam in both july and september as a way of spreading out test takers and also as a possible hedge if they're not able to give the exam on those states now before we go on and talk about the other approaches states are taking what are the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches well one advantage is that this sticks as closely as possible to the status quo which is comforting to a lot of people both to test takers and to bar examiners and perhaps also to some employers and also at least from the time that states made these decisions which was back now in april and early may it provided some certainty to test takers they knew that they could go ahead and they could begin studying for this regular bar exam that was quite familiar to people the disadvantages unfortunately are now growing with these approaches one is that it's becoming increasingly clear that these exams will still be dangerous in fact and this is something we don't talk about quite enough they will probably be more dangerous to the staff overseeing the exam the support people who are cleaning and otherwise working in the building and the community that hosts the exam rather than the test takers themselves that's because of the number of people that some of those will be exposed to and the types of exposures that they will suffer because of those disadvantages and the fact that the virus is actually increasing in many states now at least some of these states maybe even many of them will end up canceling these exams perhaps even at the last minute that is going to be potentially expensive for the states if they have binding contracts with the arenas and other places they plan to offer the exam it's going to be devastating for test takers who will have spent 10 to 12 weeks preparing for these exams and then are not able to take them and it's also going to create a hole in legal services in those states especially for employers who serve low income and other disadvantaged people because they rely very heavily on new lawyers to do their work and these new lawyers won't become available until sometime in 2021 this approach also overlooks some rather extraordinary circumstances affecting this year's test takers circumstances that have actually uh changed quite a bit even since states made these decisions back in april and may we are seeing even more and more uh the psychological and practical challenges of this pandemic about how difficult it is for test takers to study how challenged all of us are feeling after so many months in lockdown and limited social contact now we of course are facing ongoing murders of black men and women compounded by police violence towards peaceful protesters this is creating enormous emotional turmoil in many of our test takers actually approaching secondary post-traumatic stress disorder in some especially those who are black or other candidates of color and while it's true that lawyers must learn to operate in stressful conditions we have a stressful stressful profession we have to remember that the bar exam is designed as a uniform measure of minimum competence that is administered each year under what are supposed to be standardized conditions it is scored based on the assumption of those standardized conditions the conditions this summer simply are not standard uh they are very far from standard and when we administer these exams uh the scores are going to fall that is um inevitable so we have to think in these states whether we're ready to fail a record number of examinees not because they came to law school with lower lsdt scores or because their preparation wasn't as good but simply because of the circumstances of this summer and the fact that this summer differs so greatly from each of the last 40 summers now responding in part to some of these concerns a few states are doing something different four are developing their own online exams that they will offer in july most of these or i'm sorry two of these will be all essay exams in michigan and nevada the nevada one will actually be open book which nevada is doing in part to avoid security issues with test takers online and in part is one of the as the supreme court said in its order because this actually parallels what we do in practice in any event washington have recently decided to offer a diploma privilege that will be available to any graduate of any aba accredited law school who had already registered for the washington bar exam so people can't flock to washington to become washington lawyers and then hope to transfer elsewhere utah has taken perhaps the most complicated approach it is offering a limited diploma privilege which applies only to graduates of law schools that have first-time bar pass rates of 86 percent or better that's a measure by law school not by the individual and then in addition to presenting that diploma the individuals have to engage in 360 hours of supervised practice two jurisdictions maryland and dc have decided to use the ncbe's online exam and then finally we have california which is still undecided they are have postponed the exam until the fall and they are favoring an online exam but they haven't decided yet whether or not they will be able to do that now what are some of the pros and cons of these approaches um a pro is that all of these protect the health of the test takers in the community uh better than in-person exams they also at this point offer more certainty than the conventional exam because none of these are subject to being cancelled or they're very unlikely to be canceled between now and when the scheduled dates are they also partially respond to the extraordinary stresses of this summer in the way that they've reconfigured the exam and at least the first three offer as much assurance of minimum competence as the traditional bar exam now that may sound puzzling or you may wonder about that that is based in part on my long research in this area the current bar exam has never been validated with respect to law practice we know that it correlates to law school performance but we don't know that either law school performance or the bar exam correspond to minimum competence and practice studies on this issue are underway i am as i said directing one of them and i have all of the data the results suggest that the current exam is is mediocre at best in predicting minimum competence to practice law and that these alternatives would not be worse in fact some of them would probably be better in terms of detecting minimum the half a ube oddly is the outlier here it sounds most like the regular exam but a half exam is quite problematic you have to think about the fact that these candidates will write only three essays and do one performance test and are people really comfortable with that being a measure of their writing and analytic ability the test may also turn out to be more stressful for the test takers because on a high stakes exam like this they still have to study and memorize all of the legal principles that are tested but they will have half the chance to show what they know and that makes the test even more high stakes than usual another disadvantage which applies to all these approaches is that none of them offer transferability to other jurisdictions although studies including one recently done in new york show that that has not been as attractive to new lawyers as usual i want to finish up here by mentioning a story that's often told in decision making seminars about making decisions under unusual circumstances there's a cardinal principle among firefighters that you should never drop your equipment you must always hold on to your equipment but there was one unfortunate circumstance in which a group of firefighters hitting a forest fire they were at the bottom of a hill and the fire was rapidly closing in on them from behind so they began running up the hill most of them kept their equipment because they had been told never to drop their equipment one realized that this was an extraordinary time and it was time to drop the equipment he was the only one who made it successfully to the top of the hill so that's just a thought about how when you feature extraordinary time sometimes we need to drop our usual standards and think about what will work best in this circumstance thank you thanks deborah um we have a question that is uh relevant to what you've just been sharing so i'll go ahead and ask you this as a follow-up before we move on any word if states will accept the portability of an online ube score there is no online ube the exam that will be offered in october online is a half of the ube and so that ncbe is not going to to validate as a ube exam now states can make their own arrangements i've heard for example just this morning that both dc and maryland are working on a deal that they will recognize one another's results so that if you take that half ube in either state either jurisdiction you would be recognized in the other and the same is possible with these other approaches utah for example is only licensing people for utah practice but nevada could decide to accept what utah has done and transfer that admission if they wanted to all right thank you so dean billick and i are our deans of law schools in new york and over the last several weeks we've had a number of conversations with every one of the other deans in new york and a couple in new jersey everybody very concerned about this issue um dean billick do you want to uh share with us how new york's law students are responding uh and how the law schools are responding uh to this crisis around the bar exam hey i thanks craig um i think i'm going to try to do kind of a chronology um because this has been a really a really a moving target um and i think it starts i'll start on march 27th when the new york board of law examiners um the court of appeals announced that the bar exam would not be administered in july on the 28th and the 29th um on march 31st they uh they announced that it would be well march 27th what and march 31st is we're going to we're going to give the exam on september 9th and september 10. on april 1st craig and i and the 13 other new york teams and two new jersey deans met um several times and worked on a letter to the court um proposing laying out the costs of what the court proposed to do and the risky uh the uncertainty about whether the exam would happen um and urging the court to consider um extending a supervised practice order so that the graduates of the law schools could get out there and do the work and supervise under practice and if the period became extended for a long enough time to allow those graduates uh with a kind of an affidavit from their supervisor that they were practicing law competently um to be admitted without taking a bar exam on april 3rd students from all 15 law schools in new york state uh sent the chief judge d fiore a petition um incredibly well-written well-researched uh petition um enumerating the costs to law graduates starting with just making sure the court understood how much average indebtedness our law graduates have in new york state it's between 93 000 and 158 000 is that 172 000 depending on which law school you went to including talking about how how much it would cost just just to extend the study period an additional month and pay for rent uh depending on where you lived in new york state um talking as well about the employment uncertainty the toll on students physical and mental health um the effects of denying this class of graduates um the opportunity to serve clients who needed them more now than ever during during covid um and then they urged the court to adopt a diploma privilege plus their particular proposal was that um the graduates of new york law schools be permitted to practice under supervision and at the same time complete online courses or exams that the state develops um both the npre and the ny the new york law exam would be models for that an affidavit from their employer that the candidate possesses the knowledge and skills to practice law the completion of any cle programs that the court or the board wants wanted to designate and maybe the completion of some specified um lessons that come from an organization called computer assistant law instruction which also permit for uh require the takers to do quizzes so they were urging um a universal system of provisional temporary authorization to be supplemented by some online learning and proof of learning um and then admission for the class that came on april 3rd um on i'm looking for number four here on april 9th there was an announcement that the court um had appointed uh judge michael garcia to chair a task force to look at and evaluate solutions that the court might have to employ in case of persisting public health concerns not permitting the bar exam to go forward um on april 28th the court um issued an order extending a temporary authorization for law graduates to engage in the limited practice of law under supervision for a period of up to three years um if the bar exam um isn't administered on june 17th oh so so once the bar it was announced the bar exam was going to be offered on september 9th and 10th uh then what happened was we needed to the court needed to figure out places to offer it so all of the law schools in the state were asked to find space um in their building to offer the exam to their first time taker grads of the class of 2020 which caused the deans to urge the court to consider what would happen to the llm students and and to retakers it also caused members of the board of law examiners to visit law schools across the state defeat to see if in fact their facilities would be adequate understand that in order for the bar exam to be administered so we they mean to get into the building the night before the first day and really take over any building the uh exam is being offered in for the first day um the night in between and the second day which would mean you know excluding our other students um most of the law schools stepped up although some law schools were very concerned law schools in particular with llm programs were very concerned about the failure um what they thought would be a failure to accommodate um the llm students um other law schools were concerned about retakers long story short there's been a lot of looking at sites all across new york my understanding is that in fact two of the law schools have procured the javits center um so the exam that was not going to happen at the javits center will for the graduates of those of those two law schools um the court the board has been registering permitting applicants to register in waves and the waves now include the first grade was just the graduates of new york law schools who have from the class of 2020 who have not yet taken the bar exam i think the second way was i might get these two out of order but um llms the third wave is graduate graduate of law schools from other states who want to take the new york blogs in them and just yesterday they opened a registration period for retakers um not promising um that they would be able to sit but giving them an opportunity to register in case there is space for them to sit um you know as this was all let me see if there's any other important dates so so the june the dean's recently met and on june 15 sent the quarter letter asking them to consider moving to the october online exam instead of september um and permit and asking them again to make space for retakers who hadn't yet been um included retakers happened um we have not heard yet back from the court about um the june 15th um uh about the october online our request for them to reconsider the october online exam um there have been some good dialogues between judge garcia and the deans um where i think the um deans were alerted to some of the concerns and perspectives of the court and where i think judge garcia learned some about the concerns and the perspectives of the deans and their students um i will say that um in the middle of all this kind of as this was rolling out there was a moment when students were trying to figure out um should they register for the ube in another state and go there because they didn't know what new york was going to do particularly retakers and that was at a period in time when some states were making you quarantine right so they were thinking they'd have to go two weeks early and they'd have to go into motel and they you know some of that has sorted itself out but none of my students are convinced that the exam's going to happen um and so um the issues and i guess the the concerns raised by my students which is part of our students started craig's question you know they don't hit all students equally if what happened on march 31st when you're 17th when you left your law school is you went back home to your parents house um and you know it's a house where your own room is the way you left it when you graduated from high school um and all you have to do is you know move the yearbook off the desk um and set up a study space that's a really different situation than for our graduates who are living in elmhurst queens who have two or three roommates who have not very good internet or are graduates who live in brooklyn or flushing who who have kids running around underneath their feet um who uh so so there's there we see at least at my school a real disparate impact of this way to handle this circumstances depending on the economic conditions of our students um the they are scared about taking the bags in they think that anybody who spent three years going to law school and is in debt for 140 160 000 um if they are starting to feel sick on the morning of the bar exam they don't have any confidence that that student is not going to walk in that room um they don't have any confidence that people who have been exposed are going to voluntarily say well for the good of those other takers i'm not going to try to take this exam i'm going to forego for another four months my opportunity to either serve clients or earn income as a as a lawyer um they are you know they're they're concerned about other things that people might think trifling but wearing a mess for the full day both days is not nothing and not possible for students with asthma um the ones who have immunocompromised systems themselves are very concerned the ones who are living with and caring for people who are at high risk are very concerned and so the effect of this for those students has has put them in a group of people um based on you know um some medical accommodation needs but also some other real needs put them in a position of deciding um not to not to take the exam i think you know when washington state went to the diploma privilege um one of the the arguments that was made was an equity argument and i guess in this moment i'm going to take this opportunity to say that i would really want to applaud justice d piori for establishing a task force um for the evaluation of institutional racism um and to note that it's really important to look at whether or not there is institutional racism that exists in this method of delivering this bar exam at this moment clearly the most important function of any licensing mechanism is to protect future clients and no licensing mechanism is perfect some are better than others at eliminating both false positives and false negatives almost everybody would agree that their more perfect measures in the current bar exam is separating out those who have the knowledge skills and values to practice law competently we just think they're way too expensive we see it in the medical field where doctors do 20 30 surgeries before they're allowed to and then have a rounds reflection period before they're allowed to operate on someone themselves we can identify supervised practice simulated client observations of trial practice internships of the type of medical practice as more perfect ways to decide how to license to license people before we let them lose on clients but we know that those feel too hard too expensive so we have made the choice a choice to use a reliable licensing system which is our bar exam so that was a choice that was made after weighing costs and benefits the best device after weighing the quests and benefits to sort those who might harm clients from those who might not by any analysis the current pandemic with all its dangers and its unknowns has added significantly to the costs of an in-person exam i i think you know we're in a position what my students are saying to me is is make sure they understand the costs and then finally i'll just say the bar exam was instituted and became widespread to create more access to the profession it was a time when everybody be entered the profession by doing supervised internships with some lawyer who adopted them and took them under their wing um the bar exam was to be a source of equity a leveling of the playing field to create opportunities for those who did not have someone who would mentor them through an internship and maybe they did not have to have someone because they weren't kin to them they weren't the same color as them they weren't the same ethnicity as them um they came from a different class we are at a moment when we know that moving forward with an in-person bar exam in september rather than july will have a disparate impact on those graduates who are poorer who are not white who are physically vulnerable the pandemic itself has magnified our underlying health and economic disparities i wonder if this is the right moment when we're finally waking up to what equity means to go ahead with the status quo without reevaluating the costs all right thank you dean billick um one follow-up um uh do we know at this point uh where the exam in new york will be administered i know that there were uh all of the law schools were submitting information about our space availability i understand some of the spaces were offered up by law schools were not conducive to administering the exam for various reasons the size ability to control the space and so forth but i have not seen a list of of places where it will be administered and we actually here in syracuse uh plan to um secure space at the on center which is our convention center here uh for our our contribution of space but we've not yet gotten confirmation about that do you know where where the court is in that process or the board of law examiners no i don't i mean i know that a number of people who have volunteered spaces have been told those phases are inadequate others have been told by preliminary evaluation that their spaces are adequate but we don't yet have like a fully worked out agreement you know like there's no they haven't told us um we haven't talked through the issues of security um and and other things and who's gonna uh do that take account of that i know that there are some law schools that have found sites other than their own buildings to accommodate their graduates um and i know of at least one site um if if we were um if we were physically in this space we would be in one site where students who need accommodations are going to be accommodated but i there there isn't a list okay hank greenberg as uh the the recently you just recently completed your your your term as the president of new york state bar association i can tell your shoulders look like a little higher you had a tremendous year did a great number of things in that role you sit at the juncture of the bar the practicing bar the courts on legal education what is your thirty thousand foot view of how uh this is played out are you happy satisfied with the response of the court with the board of law examiner's response uh what kinds of challenges do you see ahead um uh over the next several months um and then um you know what are your broader thoughts about this whole idea of of um reform of our our bar licensing process so uh i will strike a slightly more optimistic tone um than our prior speakers at least about the prospects for the september exam and the short answer to your question is i think chief judge steve fiore and judge garcia in an extraordinarily challenging situation have done as as good a job as would have been possible and have really done magnificent work given all of the issues and challenges one thing i think that's very important to note at the outset when we talk about new york and particularly in light of professor merits i think excellent survey of what's going on around the rest of the country new york is different than the rest of the country in a lot of ways and the legal profession as practiced in new york is notably different than the rest of the country in a lot of ways new york is exceptional for among other reasons because we have more admitted attorneys than any other state in the nation we have over 300 000 i repeat 300 000 admitted attorneys over 180 000 practice in new york state our resident in new york state in fact california and new york represent as admit attorneys one out of every four admitted attorneys in the entire country but no state has as many admitted lawyers as new york why well new york is the lawyer capital of the nation if not the world new york has the highest concentration of high caliber talented committed lawyers than any other state in the nation new york law is the gold standard i would submit for the world lawyers all throughout america all throughout the world want the new york bar credential so talk a little bit more in a moment but when we hear about wisconsin or utah having diploma privileges keep in mind those are states where probably don't admit more than a thousand lawyers a year all year in new york traditionally the july bar exam is taken by more than 10 000 law students so we can talk about what other states are doing but just keep in mind to administer a bar exam in new york is far more challenging logistically involves far more people far more proctors far more venues than any other state in the nation so i think chief judge cpr and judge garcia have done an extraordinary job recognizing that they were presented with a situation that also involved um in march and april when most of the significant decisions were made about the september exam new york was the epicenter of covet 19. the absolute epicenter new york city had more confirmed cases more reported daily deaths than any other city in the nation now let's fast forward to where we are today june 18th uh thankfully thank god thanks to the extraordinary leadership of governor cuomo new york now has the lowest infection rate in the nation and that's thanks to the extraordinary leadership of our state government the extraordinary dedication and devotion of the public that voluntarily complied with a shut-in order so that when we were having this conversation in march and april we were all cloistered in our homes today and i'm speaking from albany new york i'm in my lawrence now keep in mind we have very strict uh like all offices that have opened in those regions of the state that are in what we call in new york phase two or phase three we have very uh strict standards and requirements to actually be in our workspace but where we are today is a state on june 18th thankfully uh is a much brighter situation than where we were on march 22. sunday at 8 pm when governor cuomo's new york pois executive order went into place and we all you know were forced to be cloistered in our homes no class of graduating class of law students has experienced more stress greater crisis or struggle than the class of 2020. i suppose maybe we could talk about the law school classes of during the vietnam war era the world war ii era that had their own sort of struggles but the class of 2020 is experiencing sort of a perfect storm of bad news the economy is now depression error levels of unemployment many graduating law students had your job offers that have been rescinded the job market is grim that is awful uh the uncertainty of when they will take the bar exam if they will be able to take it in september that is awful um law school debt in many cases undergraduate and law school debt mounting over a couple hundred thousand dollars if not more for the class of 2020 is awful and the two things and not so old but i don't remember what i thought about when i was a rising uh graduating law student i thought about getting a job and i thought about taking the bar exam and the class of 2020 is just living with that uncertainty and it is beyond awful and uh dean bilick and dean boyz and and the other 13 deans of new york's law schools have been magnificent advocates for the law students at every turn and every day um urging um leaders of the court of appeals chief joshi fiori judge garcia to do everything possible to sort of address those concerns and those uncertainties and i applaud them for your advocacy and for your passion i think you've done a magnificent job the challenge for policymakers though in this case and decision makers is that they have to balance a variety of concerns uh not only the the despair that the law students are facing but also keeping in mind the enormous number of people that want to be new york admitted lawyers so at the very outset for those states that have you know sort of said diploma privileges work for them well if we said diploma privileges work for the graduating class of law students in every aba admitted lawyer law school well we would have 40 000 new admitted new york uh lawyers um and that i think for multiple reasons is a bad outcome in a bad scenario and why diploma privileges don't really at least the diploma privileges is described as i graduated from an aba admitted school let me into new york doesn't really work but let's just spend a moment about where we are today um and the new york state bar association when i was president was deeply active in this issue we had an emergency task force on the bar exam which included by the way judge garcia as a member that came up with a set of recommendations that were adopted by the court of appeals within 42 hours that basically provide the framework for where we said today one was that the bar exam should be cancelled in july which it was and it should be taken at around labor day so now it'll be taken on september 9 or 10 in new york my best information and i think it's relatively current is that the board of law examiners is not only working hard but having considerable success identifying venues where the exam can be taken assuming the trajectory of covet 19 in new york in the fall proceeding at or about the same lines that they are today on june 18th uh if they are i think we can be optimistic uh about the prospect of the exam being taken in september 9 and ten with physical distancing rules in a safe and secure manner and i believe the board of law examiners are optimistic that that will happen there's a lot of unknowns we didn't know in march where we would be today there's talk of second waves so hopefully or at or about labor day like i said new york will be in a place new york city new york city law offices are going to begin to open up next week hopefully that reopening process across the state phased in carefully uh evaluated by the governor and health department on a daily if not hourly basis proceeds on track so the exam optimistically will be held on the 9th and 10th fingers and toes crossed but it's looking that way it appears as though there will be as many as 20 as many as 20 separate venues that will allow for physical distancing across the state so that appears to be good news at the same time the court system is adopted in new york practice orders to address those students who will not be able to take the exam assume the exam can't be taken in september 9th 1910 i think dean billick indicated it now appears as though every student from every law school in new york and across the country graduating student class of 2020 will be able to take the exam um on september 9th or 10th in new york um as dean billick also mentioned yesterday the board of law examiners opened up their process to llm students that's more good news so um unfortunately second time test takers are not going to be able to take the exam on september 9 and 10. but it does appear as though the vast majority of students who would otherwise take the july exam will be able to take the exam september 9 or 10. if they can't if the exam can't be administered then the court of appeals is allowed for practice orders which means that graduating law students under the supervision of a new york attorney will be able to practice certain forms of law um and and provided uh that they take and pass the bar exam by the end of 2021 so that means there will be at least three it appears as though three opportunities for them to take the bar exam september 9th or 10th if for some reason that's not possible then the february bar exam in 2021 um and for some reason or other that's not possible if they can pass the bar exam um in july of 2021 then under these practice orders there will be fully admitted attorneys one last word of comment about online testing i spoke a little bit about diploma privileges the new york state bar association's position has been it's my understanding this is where the court of appeals is today diploma privileges don't work in new york i talked a little bit about the enormous number of attorneys that would seek those privileges we all care we all empathize with the plight of law students but policy makers also have to protect the public from unqualified practitioners they also have to pay heed to the respect that the profession has for lawyers and the confidence of newly admitted lawyers wholesale diploma privileges just seemed like the bad strategy in new york and in terms of online testing again we're talking about as many as 10 000 people how does one administer in new york by september 9 or 10 an online exam without proctors how does one ensure the safety and security of the exam that is one makes certain the people who take the exam aren't looking at a book aren't texting someone while they're taking the exam without proctors the other thing i would sort of mention is if we focus the energy of the board of law examiners today on online and keep in mind this is not a large state agency it has limited resources and capacity if we ask them to start focusing on how they would administer an online exam that will take their eye off the ball of administering the exam in september for as many students as possible so again enormous praise to the deans of new york's law school who have been passionate advocates and enormous praise as well to our policymakers chief judge d fiore judge garcia and the court of appeals for doing the best that they possibly can hope to do under extraordinarily challenging circumstances thank you hank i particularly appreciate your comments regarding online if you know anything about syracuse you know we are big advocates of online as part of the education for jd's it strikes me yes the new york board of law examiners is a small agency but but it seems to me that the national conference of bar examiners should be the ones looking at how to deliver exam online it is complicated it's difficult but i can tell you that you know as as a law school that by choice before covert 19 engage in online system it's possible uh to do remote proctoring it's possible to deal with all of the issues that you described i think the ncb is probably much better resource to be able to explore that and from my perspective i think that's exactly what we ought to be thinking about as we as we look forward you know the law school admissions test is moving towards online ac act sat no reason why our exam if we continue to have an exam and of course that's a question we can we can debate as well should not be available online for just these kinds of contingencies so anne lefevre you've been very patiently uh waiting uh while uh others have been talking as a hiring partner of a major firm uh this has has a huge impact on you law firms generally look after the july bar in particular to those who have passed as the newest lawyers in their firms and uh this has thrown a bit of wrench into the works from from your perspective what is the impact of this confusion and uncertainty around the bar exam uh although a lot of the uncertainty is being clarified but but how is this going to impact you your hiring is it even a problem giving given the economic impact of cobit 19 perhaps law firms are now contracting a way that does not make this so big an issue can you share your thoughts about these things thank you dean boris absolutely um one of the things that has actually the delay in the bar exam has actually i think mitigated some of the issues for law firms uh just because the predominant approach um and i'm speaking here really limited to the larger scale law firms the more national law firms um has been to delay the start date typically first years come in in you know september october november uh and and the predominant approach among the law firms um in response to hope it has been to push those start dates out in most cases to january 2021 uh in some cases february as well um there's there's definitely precedent for doing this it's the same response that a lot of firms took back in 2009 with the great recession um as in 2009 there are a handful of firms that have kept their start date the same or only pushed it back a few weeks um so they may have a bigger issue with with the the deferral the delay in the bar exam um so far uh we're not seeing there's been there's been some rescission of offers absolutely um nationwide um but we're not seeing in my opinion um layoffs of first-year incoming associates rescission of offers on the same scale that it happened back in 2009-2010 my own view is that i think that maybe because some law firms experienced or perceived that they experienced a significant backlash with the layoffs last time around and so i think there may be a perception that the reputational damage from doing deferrals is is less among law students um in their recruiting abilities their their stature on the walk on campuses um than the the repercussion if you do deferral of start dates um so just as a practical matter deferral of start dates obviously affects compensation and and uh uh i feel nothing but empathy for for the graduates who are you know coming out of school with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and we're expecting to earn a pretty hefty salary starting in the fall and and now that's not happening um so the law firms are showing sensitivity to that um many are offering um stipends for the deferred period uh as far as i know most law firms have cons paid out the bar exam stipend that typically happens in accordance with the regular schedule even though the bar exam is pushed back um some firms have chosen to go the route of cash advances for the the fall period um and uh in terms of what firms are actually doing in terms of of the bar exam and in the different jurisdictions a lot of the firms in the jurisdictions um where professor merritt explained that the exam is indeed being pushed off um a lot of firms in those states are encouraging their incoming first years to write the bar in another state where it's going forward um they're also proposing this to people that are don't make it in that's the september round even where it's being deferred and instead are going to be pushed to february so a lot of firms are encouraging their their incoming first years to go to another state and then apply to have the the result transferred to to the state in which they'll be practicing um and they're doing they're doing the encouragement by offering to um cover the expenses that that the incoming first years are going to incur if they go that route um and other i've seen a couple of law firms as well uh for students who might find themselves facing a february bar exam um guaranteeing paid time off at that in the month of february to to accommodate the situation um obviously the the bar exam is not the only thing being deferred here there's also um going to be issues with the admissions process and a backlog there when the courts start to reopen um i have not seen in in the data that i've gathered a huge impact that that is having on law firms in terms of changes of in their practices uh and i suspect again this is just my opinion it may be because of the the orders and that are being introduced that are expanding the circumstances under which students can work under the supervision of other attorneys so it could be that law firms just don't see that as a as a practical issue um the other thing that that firms are are doing is or that people are wondering is you know let's let's assume that things go forward and and the vast majority of firms that are starting their students in january of 2021 will that be in person um if firms are back up and running on their feet in the jurisdictions where people are still working remotely or will it be remote and the short answer there is that nobody really knows yet because nobody knows what the world is going to look like next week much less in january so i think what will inform firms decisions on that front is what their experience turns out to be with the summer programs um the class of 2021 which is either has or is shortly going to be starting their own summer programs and the statistics there nationwide are showing that the vast majority of the summer programs um a the dates have been shortened significantly um most programs run around 10 weeks and most programs now have been shortened to five to six weeks some have gone as short as two weeks some have canceled them all together um but i think that will that will inform how the first year um class is treated and also all those summer programs again the vast majority i think it's 65 nationwide and significantly higher in the more hardly hit jurisdictions those programs are all remote um again as i'm talking about the summer class the class of 2021 because the class of 2020 isn't the only one that will be impacted here um so some of the firms um are saying the ones that have canceled the program a lot of them have said uh we're canceling your program some form of compensation is usually provided but we guarantee you an offer in the incoming first year class of 2021. i'm only aware of one firm that that has cancelled their program and not made that offer of a guaranteed offer and a lot the firms that are going forward with uh some sort of truncated version of a summer program um what they're saying pillsbury included is um it's business as usual so we'll do the same thing we've done in past years notwithstanding the current crisis um in terms of a summer program up summer associate position being turned into an offer to come back as a first year we're going to keep we're going to do the same thing that we've done in all our past years that's very helpful um do you have a sense or or any of the other panelists have a sense of what will happen to the roughly 85 90 of uh grads who don't go to farms that hire them before they've taken the bar exam uh this as you pointed out is a very difficult situation it's hard enough when you've got a firm that that has made an offer and is hiring you and is is paying you while you're taking the bar but a huge number of students don't uh deborah deborah yeah i do want to speak to that um less than 20 percent of law graduates go to firms of 100 lawyers or more and an even smaller percentage go to the very big firms that may be most able to offer these programs the prosecutor's offices the public defenders the legal aid offices the small law firms are not going to be paying people to take the month of february off to study for the exam in fact most of those offices have people doing client work immediately i i teach both a prosecution clinic and a defense clinic and so i have students actually who've gone to new york from ohio to do both of those things and they begin doing direct client representation right from maybe the third week they have two weeks maybe a boot camp so these are not solutions for the vast majority of people who are being admitted to the bar in either new york or elsewhere and i think we really have to think about our commitment to access to justice when we're thinking about how to design these things the practice orders are sort of ironic because they are actually a temporary diploma privilege most of these practice orders uh depends on what the particular division in new york does but they allow people to go even into the courtroom without their supervisor with them they check in with the supervisor from time to time and people do a wonderful job it's not a problem but to then ask these people who are actually actively defending clients or representing people in employment discrimination cases in january to drop those clients in order to study for eight weeks to take a bar exam just strikes me as is kind of confused i i understand all the problems that new york is facing and other states are facing but i just don't see that as a solution i really think we need to remember the eighty percent i think if i can just respond to that question i think it's an excellent point the the perspective that i have and that i see is obviously um you know big firms have the luxury of doing what a lot of these firms are doing so so it's an excellent point and in effect it's a fraction of the the you know graduating class um so i actually have a question i guess primarily for hank and anne who are currently thank you you you you have some time to practice law don't you or do you give all your talents to the state for the good of the people oh i'm starting to practice law more more actively now okay so and this is a genuine question because i it is entirely possible that i have a blind spot here but if you had somebody working at your firm who you were on a case with supervising for 18 months and the bar exam was delayed that long and this was a person who'd been preparing memos for you and i don't know doing the document review and maybe carrying going with you to court and those kinds of things um i guess it's a two-part question one would you need the bar exam to know whether they were competent to practice would like it would it give you would it add anything to know that they'd pass the bar exam and two do you really want to give them two months off to study um if they've turned out to be a valuable associate and that's a question that was also in the q a uh a version of it in the q and a hank so uh you're you're on the hot seat here and let me just throw another one in where you thought thinking about that here we are in the midst of cove at 19 and it sounds like we're about to engage in a debate about the value with bards as a mechanism for assessing the competence of attorneys now i'm going to share my own personal view if someone took the old new york bar exam and we were talking about new york litigation or a case i would have a much greater confidence that they had a clue about what the cplr was an acronym for than i would if they merely graduated even from a new york law school today and took the ube i'd have to tell them civil practice law rules um but that's another conversation right uva versus the old bar exam um you know your question dean um so much of this discussion uh depends on what your perspective and point of view is deans of law schools have a confess constituency they're called law students um about whom um you know you are passionate and rightly so advocates for um attorneys and law firms if i'm working with a lawyer on a case and you ask me if they're deeply involved in the case and performing a really valuable role although for talking about a first-year associate you know six seven eight months into their first year position that's very different than the fifth or sixth or seventh-year associate in terms of their professional development would i want to lose them to study for the bar exam if they were playing an integral role 18 months into it the short answer is no of course not i want them to continue to work on the case and then there is the systemic question about how to policy makers knowing how many people want to be new york admitted lawyers and understanding that not all law schools are created the same not law schools all you know 100 nearly 200 plus law schools around the country you know don't all provide exactly the same kind of education so as a general proposition i think the bar exam continues to make sense uh and i think kova 19 does not provide a particularly excellent vehicle for us to have um you know debate about whether we should or we shouldn't have it or make those kind of decisions as we're all trying to manage a crisis so i i just want to say my constituency is the future clients of my students um so i just i you know and i know you don't you assume maybe it's both but i just want to make i think law schools have an obligation to future clients and the only way i think it's relevant hank is because i think it's always a cost benefit analysis what the what the best licensing mechanism is but i take your point it's maybe not fair to shift the conversation to whether we should have a bar exam at all if i could just uh follow up hank uh diploma privilege if it applied only to graduates of new york law schools with which the board of law examiners is quite familiar i think if we were talking about the old bar exam that might be interesting if i knew that new york's law schools were teaching new york loan as they once did but the perfect truth is even since the ube the data that i've seen makes it very very clear the new york law schools are no longer at least on the whole by and large teaching very much new york law um and um so the idea and here's the other point too about new york law not all laws created equal and of course the ub teaches the law of nowhere right not a particular state but general principles of law just take civil procedure right law students who graduate from new york's law schools like the other 49 states right are largely taught civil procedure in terms of the federal rules of simple procedure they're not taught the cplr and people aren't taking new york practice on the whole inviting larger new york's law schools anymore so um i no longer have very much confidence that graduates of new york law schools know a whole lot about new york law that's but that's not to suggest they don't know a lot about a lot of legal principles but we're talking your question is about diploma privileges so you know taking all 3 000 plus graduating law students from new york 15 law schools and saying without any test at all you're now new york lawyers i don't think that's a proven decision i don't think it's terribly fair to all those people who took the bar exam and didn't pass it the first time and i'll have to take it a second time right so uh you're when you talk about new york law uh hank are you talking about essentially one course the the the cpr so proceed along rules because that's a very small percentage if it's one if i know that's a course that's not taught uh in some law schools in new york um students didn't enroll in it i think is for one of the reasons but um that's a small part of the 90 credit hours overall um where else do you see a potential deficiency there well at least when i graduated law school in the late 1980s most of my professors would point out differences in the course of t is assuming we're not talking about like federal tax right but your basic common law subjects uh most of my law professors if there was a significant difference between new york law and general standard principles would point that out in the classroom so the idea of being given a well-rounded education about new york law when you graduated from a new york law school was a meaningful thing and by the way let's talk about wisconsin because wisconsin's diploma privileges i think kinds of makes my point in wisconsin as i understand it diploma privileges are extended to only two law schools the university of wisconsin law school and marquette why because the board of law examiners in wisconsin understands that the graduates of those law schools are steeped or at least taught something about wisconsin law i think those are the only two law schools in wisconsin i believe right but um want to get to a couple questions uh if we could that are specific coming from the q a uh before we we uh run out of time i know we could discuss uh the the bar exam but just any any of the panelists can answer these two things one is that there was um right after the lockdown um the appellate division first department character and fitness office was unable to process applications for some time um and so now there's a current process of submitting applications electronically with virtual interviews and admissions does anybody have knowledge about the impact and where the backlog is right now how much of that has been recovered okay uh so confirm that most of what's in that question is true that there is a bet another question um any advocacy discussion in new york around making fees refundable of students who are registering in june are not seated right now these students are charged non-refundable fees not only for non-guaranteed seats but also for laptop registration etc before before they know if they have seats so if you've heard anything about that i know i i'm not aware of that but no but what i'd say is that they registered in june and their the court the board is now taking applications from people who you know were at the third wave past the june uh oh we're in june this is somebody who's just registering that yeah okay sorry so um craig i don't know more than that more than mary lou did on that but i want to point to a broader quest brought a problem with the fees which is people talked about their new york students we have students in ohio who take the new york bar and when new york told them to go to other states several of them went to dc because they thought they would get to take the ube in dc and wave into new york they've now paid fees in both new york and in dc and are not going to get to take a uniform bar exam or wave into new york because dc has decided not to offer the uniform bar accident when you have a chance i'd love to tell hank how much i agree with him on a couple of points could i do that for him well just one moment i think we've had a couple of questions pop up uh about the new york law exam uh hank as as addressing the issue that you raised about not uh grads not being familiar with new york uh law is that not a fix for your concerns um so the current new york bar exam has a 50 question multiple choice open book test uh that the state bar exhaust association our our new york bar exam task force reviewed um and found it not at all either challenging to take in pass or in any way incentivizing new york's law schools to teach more new york law so one of the recommendations of our task force was that that part of the new york bar exam be retooled be made more rigorous than it currently is right um any update on whether students from non-aba accredited law schools particularly those in canada will be able to apply or sit for the new york bar exam dean bilic are they included in any of these waves your music mary lou questions magnify and and amplify what hank said because there is a lot that the court and the board are trying to figure out right now um and for the court this is their side job right their their primary job is to administer justice in the state so but it's a very good question i don't know the answer okay all right uh deborah you want to go ahead and respond yeah um i just i agree with hank on two very important points one is that um state law and even local rules are more important than federal law my study has shown that um very strongly and in fact even ncbe's own study has shown that one that they're releasing and so we need to deal with that with the bar exam um we also need to deal with the fact that research is after writing the most important skill for new lawyers and the uniform bar exam doesn't test that at all so i agree with you entirely and i think you'll be seeing more about that in coming months the other thing i agree with you on is i would not do a diploma privilege in new york first of all you can't do it just for new york law schools that violates the dormant commerce clause which is probably a question that appears on the uniform bar exam so we shouldn't go there what i would do is a series of things i would start with first making a special rule for people who are doing public service we actually have a piece i have a piece co-authored with a few others coming out in bloomberg law tomorrow morning that will talk about creating a lawyer's justice corps and how those lawyers who do actually get good supervision even in the run a usual course of things in legal aid and public defender and government offices could be licensed based on several months maybe even as much as a year of that service rather than having to take the time off to take the bar exam in february another step from that would be to license people generally who have good supervised practice if they've had several months of supervised practice they need to take off time from either of your firms and then one final component one could think about there is what about people who have done 15 credits worth of clinics or externships during law school in other words a full semester plus of that work they will certainly have had if they're in new york exposure to the new york civil or criminal procedure rules they will also have had the kind of experience that we know that new lawyers really need so it's not really diploma privilege or exam i think that actually these options and any of these options by the way would coexist with the exam it would greatly reduce the number of seats needed and so you know llms who don't aren't able to get supervised practice or weren't eligible for clinics could still take the exam ever how does wisconsin avoid the dormant commerce clause wisconsin's um privilege as i have co-authored a piece that is out there is unconstitutional as it currently stands um they were challenged a number of years ago judge posner in the 7th circuit wrote an opinion in which he went no no no no no no let's send this back for more factual development and the party's settled it is possible to create a constitutional diploma privilege limited to to schools within the state but it has to be very carefully tailored to special knowledge that the court has of the schools in that state or the fact that they're teaching that state's law even then you probably need to extend it to other schools like take seton hall for example right across the river from manhattan they might teach as much new york law as colombia does so um if you go to barcode 19 our website you will find all of our articles linked wouldn't you argue that just giving the diploma privilege to the public schools does this violate the dormant terrorist class there isn't an argument i could get behind that one right right right right there's an i could too ohio state right um there's an argument that that satisfies the market um exemption exception hey do we know our constitutional law or what right this question and about whether uh law firms have thought about uh providing scholarships for students that are not part of their incoming classes but are in financial need due to the effects of the pandemic i gather uh generally um uh providing assistance to to law students generally i i've not seen anything created i'm not personally aware in connection with in response to covid right now i mean obviously many law firms offer um a lot of financial support and scholarships um and stipends but i haven't seen anything specifically linked to copen all right uh dean billick would llm graduates currently be able to sit for the exam um in new york state i think we may have answered this one but uh yes yes if they if they register um in the fourth wave they missed their wave if they haven't registered yet um and the fourth wave just opened yesterday so i would leave the session and go online and register if you're an llm candidate who wants to take the new york arsenal okay i have a question for you deborah you've mentioned at the outset research that reflects that the bar exam is not particularly predictive of success as a lawyer uh why is that what what what kinds of things ought to be in a bar exam if we wanted to have one that was actually uh validated for law practice well i said i chose the word mediocre purposely it doesn't fail um it might get a b or something like that um it certainly has some correlation the biggest thing that's well the biggest thing that's missing is any kind of assessment of ability to interact with clients particularly when we think that people worry about the bar exam you know worry about solo practitioners solo practitioners interact with clients so do all the people at the other eighty percent even within large law firms we have found that people who do transactional work as opposed to litigation interact quite frequently with clients in their first year in fact one person explained that on any deal you have a whole hierarchy of people and so if there's somebody at the client in the lower end of the totem pole who has a question they'll call the lawyer who's lowest on the totem pole so lots of interaction with clients and that's not just people skills there's specific things it actually overlaps a lot with professional responsibility as applied how do you talk to a client how do you really counsel them how do you tell them about your do your duties with confidentiality the other big one that's missing right now is um research right i mean the the bar exam seems to be based on a notion that you come into the workplace with a measuring cup that's filled with knowledge and then you're going to draw upon that cup and you know pour it on all your but that's not how lawyers function in fact they rely almost never in the first year on memory they check and recheck everything many of them practice in fields that are not tested at all on the bar exam sometimes that they never even took in law school so it's that ability to do research that really matters so those are the two biggest halls there are some others that i could point to as well i think the first one also is probably directly related to the highest percentage of complaints that come in to come in from from people about their attorneys is that the interaction the failure to communicate and that kind of thing so there's a there's certainly a validating connection with the kinds of things that that the court wants to protect the public from uh absolutely and when you think about interactions with clients also means being ability and being able to get the facts that are important for resolving the matter we asked people in our focus groups to talk about mistakes that they had made in their first year or we also had groups with supervisors of new lawyers mistakes that their lawyers had made and the mistakes often related to something having to do with client interaction somebody failed to get a key fact from the client somebody was unable to really counsel the client in a way that respected the client's autonomy while also giving the expert advice or somebody wasn't able to give good bad news we give bad news to clients a lot of times and the new lawyer was ineffective at doing it or often that the new lawyer promised too much the client thought that this hearing was going to go entirely in their favor and it didn't so i mean these are specific types of skills it's it's on law schools too right we don't teach nearly enough client skills in law schools did you uh have a comment anne i i didn't i agree with everybody because i agree with a lot of those points that that um neither the bar exam nor nor law schools um right now necessarily teach those um i mean i wouldn't even call them as the point professor mayor was saying soft skills they're they're real substantive skills too so we only have five minutes left so i'm going to give each of you a chance to close with uh a minute or so um and uh and then we will be done um so uh let's let's begin with you anne put you on the spot no this has been incredibly informative it's it's fantastic to hear perspectives from um academia and the people that are preparing uh the associates that that we're fortunate to have um join us so so again i empathize with with what the student bodies are going through but the class of 2020 and the class of 2021 and and i like um to see certain law firms kind of trying to take creative approaches to how we can balance you know the changes in our business needs with um the pressure that these students are under so so it's been a pleasure to to be with you all today deborah so my pleasure as well and you know having agreed with hank i'm not sure what else i have to say here right but that's right well i think i may just actually finish by agreeing also with something mary lou said and what ann embodies along with frank which is hank which is that you know my constituency is future clients i got into this work studying licensing and competency because of my own family's experiences as medical patients and missing that the quality of doctors just really affects us so deeply and it made me feel that every student i see is going to touch so many lives and i have to make sure that student is prepared to do the very best that our profession can do for those lives good i'm glad i didn't have to go after him um so so i just want to say that i really do believe that the court of appeals and the board of law examiner are trying very hard to protect clients and figure out like what's possible um and i don't have any doubt of that i don't think this is some machiavellian scheme to torture students um and i actually don't primarily come out of this i care deeply about my students because i've seen them all practice for a full semester in a intensive clinical program and they are ready to go and i care for their future clients and and i care for my students because i'm a human being and i have empathy but for me this is really not about how um extraordinarily um emotionally hard this is for them this isn't my sympathy for my students um it is i think a difference of opinion about whether the bar exam um is enough of a benefit to um to to to be to to be able to be spending so much energy trying to figure out how to do it at this moment and it is for me a question when from where i sit from my lens the the people who will not be able to afford this extended unlicensed period the students who come from the communities most exposed to the virus with the poorest access to health care and with the highest likelihood of having underlying conditions that make the virus more fatal are the people that the people in the street are trying to tell us to recognize that we're planning for a planet that those people don't inhabit and that we have to start understanding the effects and the different impacts through a lens that's so different than ours that it's going to take a lot of work i have strong feelings about the need for revisiting the bar exam myself and an example is the fact that i practiced tax law for almost nine years before i went into academia i took three different bars ohio new york and missouri and none of them had anything about tax law on them so from that perspective i spent nine years of practice totally untested in terms of my confidence to do that work so i do think it's something it's it's both over broad and and under broad in terms of of what it covers and i think it's worth re-looking at but i'm going to give hank the final word before we close uh then just a couple of first of all my deepest gratitude to the new york city heart association and my fellow panelists for this fabulous discussion i've learned a lot uh and so many of the ideas um especially ones that have been generated by the deans in new york and professor merritt description of what's going on in other states i can't emphasize enough the fluidity of the time in which we now live the die i think from a public policy point of view is now cast for the september exam um i think that our board of lord examiners is climbing forward they're going to do their best they are doing their best to try to put that exam on september 9 or 10. but covet 19 has puzzled and baffled us in so many different ways who's to say if the exam isn't administered in september because it can't be right if there is this second wave god willing there won't be but if that exam can't be administered in september then the class of 2020 what they're struggling with what they're suffering with would be worthy i think of another look in revisiting some of these issues and ideas that dean bilik and the boys and the other deans have sort of put forward for sure because that's a different world who would have thought in february we'd be having this discussion today so if in september all of a sudden we're shut down again in new york you know i think everyone court of appeals the new york state bar the organized bar law firms all of us should be open to sort of figuring out how we deal with the justifiable concerns being raised by the clans of 20 i'm also left with this enormous sense of pride frankly in how our profession has grappled with this issue in new york i could not be prouder of our deans um how conscientious they have been how earnest they have been um in in in percolating ideas and creativity i could not be prouder of our court system our chief judge and the way they dealt with that i could not be prouder of how the organized barn has uh discussions like this sort of risen to the challenge really really proud of new york state and how we really bent the curve um and now we're in a position where there's some cause for optimism and i'm left with the thought above all the class of 2020. for those of you who are on this call you need to know you are in all of your thoughts um [Music] and representing sort of hiring partners in law firms myself as a leader at least once was the leader of the organized bar as of a couple of weeks ago our dean's professor merit you are foremost in our minds about trying to meet your needs right now and understand your your challenges and we are doing everything in our power collectively as a profession to try to do that good words thank you hank and thank you to uh the other three panelists as well it's been a pleasure to talk with you today i think we've shared some very helpful information with our audience thank you audience for joining us and again um barcode19.org is a place you can go to keep updated on um developments around the

(HE) 12 NEWS REPORTER BRANDON TRUITT IS LIVE IN FALL RIVER WITH WHAT RESTAURANTS THINK ABOUT THE CHANGES. HI BRANDON. MOST OF THE PLACES WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS SAY THEY LIKE THE NEW OPTIONS. RESTAURANTS LIKE THE TIPSEY SEAGULL - CLOSING FOR THE SEASON IN JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS - ARE TRYING TO SERVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS THEY CAN. \"we are all just doing the best we can, and just have to work together.\" IT'S A MANTRA OF SORTS -- HEARD FROM BUSINESSES TIME AND TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC. \"I think it's really going to help us.\" BUT FOR JENNIFER LECORN -- THE NEW EXPANDED DINING OPTIONS -- ARE PUTTING WIND UNDER THE WINGS OF HER FELLOW EMPLOYEES AT THE TIPSY SEAGULL. SAYING MORE PEOPLE MEANS MORE BUSINESS. STARTING TODAY -- RESTAURANTS IN THE BAY STATE CAN HAVE UP TO 10 PEOPLE AT A TABLE. THAT NUMBER IS UP FROM SIX. SPACING BETWEEN TABLES MUST STAY THE SAME. BUT NOW RESTAURANTS WITH BARS CAN SEAT PEOPLE - ALTHOUGH FOOD HAS TO BE ORDERED AS WELL. \"it helps quite a bit.\" JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN SEEKONK YOU'LL FIND GREG ESMAY AND THE OLD GRIST MILL TAVERN. THE RESTAURANT KNOWS A THING OR TWO ABOUT ADJUSTING. (FIRE VO) THE PLACE WAS SEVERLY DAMAGED DURING THIS FIRE FROM 2012. NOW - GOOD AS NEW. THE RESTAURANT SAYS AFTER A RECENT 15-THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO EXPAND OUTDOOR DINING -- THEY'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO WINTER. HOPING TO GET CUSTOMERS INSIDE FOR THE COLDER MONTHS. \"most people when they get in here they see it's pretty spaced out.\" BACK AT THE TIPSY SEAGULL -- THE COUNTDOWN IS ON UNTIL THE SEASON ENDS. A SUMMER FOR THE BOOKS - AS INNOVATION HAS CARRIED THE BUSINESS THROUGH. \"and it's worked out well. not perfectly but it's been good.\" BOSTON WORCESTER AND FRAMINGHAM ARE NOT MAKING THESE CHANGES - THEY ARE STICKING WITH THE OLD GUIDLINES. BARS WITHOUT FOOD AND CLUBS ARE ORDERED TO STAY CLOSED. NUMBERS LATER TODAY OR TOMORROW. (HE) IN MASSACHUSETTS --- RESTAURANTS CAN NOW SEAT MORE PEOPLE AT TABLES, *AND* USE THEIR BAR SPACES AGAIN. 12 NEWS REPORTER BRANDON TRUITT GOT LOCAL REACTION ABOUT THE RULE CHANGE --- AND JOINS US LIVE. TODAY'S ON AND OFF SHOWERS NOT THE BEST FOR OUTDOOR DINING THIS AFTERNOON. BUT THE RESTAURANTS WE SPOKE WITH SAY THESE CHANGES SHOULD HELP GET THEM THROUGH THE FALL. \"we've learned a lot. We've moved forward.\" GREG ESMAY OWNS THE OLD GRIST MILL TAVERN IN SEEKONK. THE RESTAURANT FINDS ITSELF MAKING ADJUSTMENTS YET AGAIN. \"I think that is a very good change.\" AS OF TODAY - RESTAURANTS CAN NOW SIT UP TO TEN PEOPLE AT A TABLE. THAT'S UP FROM SIX. THE CHANGES APPLY TO INDOOR AND OUTDOOR DINING. BUT TABLES MUST STAY AT LEAT SIX FEET A PART. BAR SEATING - NOW AN OPTION. BUT FOOD HAS TO BE ORDERED WITH DRINKS. ESMAY SAYING *THAT PART IS WELCOME NEWS FOR BARTENDERS WHOSE SOURCE OF INCOME HAS BEEN RUNNING DRY. \"They have been having a really rough time. If you can't serve directly to a guest, they have been depending on the tip out from the rest of the restaurant and it's not the same at all.\" DOWN THE ROAD IN FALL RIVER -- THE TIPSY SEAGULL WORKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHANGES. \"I think it is really going to help us.\" LECORN SAYING THE TABLE SEATING INCREASE - WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. \"we've had some difficulties where people will come down with 7, or 8, or 9. So we have to break them up.\" WITH JUST A FEW WEEKS LEFT IN THEIR SEASON - LECORN SAYS THEY'RE ADJUSTING TO THIS LATEST ROUND OF CHANGES. THESE AT LEAST - ARE WELCOMED. \"We are all just doing the best we can and we have to work together.\" (BT) THESE CHANGES ARE ALLOWED STATEWIDE -- BUT BOSTON, WORCESTER AND FRAMINGHAM ARE OPTING OUT.

AS THE BAY STATE LOOSENS SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE PANDEMIC. 12 NEWS REPORTER ERICA RICCI JOINS US WITH A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE CHANGES. STARTING TODAY, MORE PEOPLE WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AT RESTAURANTS HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS... AS THE NUMBER INCREASES FROM SIX TO TEN PER TABLE. THE BOOST COMES UNDER GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER'S LATEST GUIDELINES. THE SAME GUIDELINES THAT ALSO ALLOW RESTAURANTS TO BEGIN UTILIZING THEIR BAR AREAS FOR DINING. SO STARTING TODAY, PATRONS WON'T BE ABLE TO STAND AT THE BAR, HAVE A DRINK AND WATCH THE GAME... BUT IN MASSACHUSETTS, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BE SEATED FOR DINNER AT THE BAR. FOR SOME RESTAURANT OWNERS, THIS IS A WELCOMED RELIEF... PARTICULARLY AS WE ENTER THE COOLER, EVENTUALLY COLDER, MONTHS, WHEN OUTDOOR DINING WON'T BE AN OPTION ANYMORE. \"the bartenders will have a better season in the winter with us being able to open the bars again, you know, within reason, so that's good for us and for them because alot of people that come here want to sit at the bar\" IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SOME MASSACUSETTS CITIES LIKE WORCESTER, BOSTON AND FRAMINGHAM HAVE CHOSEN TO KEEP RESTAURANT CAPACITY AS IS BECAUSE OF COVID NUMBERS IN THEIR AREAS. AND SOME RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE CHOOSING TO DO THE SAME, BUT THEY'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT NUMBERS TO BASE THEIR DECISION ON. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AT 6-30. CLEVELAND. (PL) TURNING TO OUR TOP *LOCAL STORY... NEW RULES IN PLACE FOR RESTAURANTS ACROSS MASSACHUSETTS. 12 NEWS REPORTER ERICA RICCI TELLS US WHAT DINERS CAN EXPECT, BEGINNING TODAY. SINCE RESTAURANTS REOPENED IN MASSACHUSETTS, NO MORE THAN SIX COULD BE SEATED AT A TABLE. TODAY, THAT NUMBER INCREASES TO TEN... AND PATRONS CAN NOW EAT AT THE BAR. ALL OF THIS COMES UNDER GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER'S LATEST GUIDELINES FOR DINING ESTABLISHMENTS. EVEN THOUGH TABLES CAN NOW SEAT FOUR MORE PEOPLE EACH, THEY STILL MUST REMAIN SIX FEET APART. BUT RESTAURANT OWNERS SAY BY FITTING MORE PEOPLE AT A TABLE, THEY CAN SEAT MORE PARTIES AT ONE TIME WHILE CONTINUING TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR BEING ABLE TO SEAT PEOPLE AT THE BAR FOR DINING PURPOSES. THE PROBLEM FOR SOME RESTAURANTS, LIKE BARRET'S WATERFRONT RESTAURANT AND LOUNGE IN FALL RIVER... THEY'VE ALREADY CONVERTED THEIR BAR AREA INTO DINING. CHANGING IT BACK COULD ACTUALLY *COST THEM PATRONS. \"we're torn between actually having bar seating or keeping the tables the way they are. right now I have three high tops pushed up against the bar and I can fit seven people at each high top I don't know that I can fit 7 people socially disatanced together\" \"people want bar seating because they haven't had bar seating, but is it best for the business financially right now?\" SO SOME BAR AND RESTAURANT OWNERS, ALONG WITH SOME MASSACHUSETTS CITIES, WILL OPT OUT OF LOOSENING RESTRICTIONS. AND SOME PATRONS MAY STAY AWAY FROM THE ONES THAT DO OUT OF CONCERN OVER INCREASED CROWDS. SO LIKE ALL THINGS PANDEMIC-- WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS GOES.", "5mjxZj3ohHs": ". THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. TODAY THE COUNCIL RECEIVED AN  UPDATE ON THE 2021 GENERAL  ASSEMBLY SESSION, ESPECIALLY ON  POLICE REFORM AND ENVIRONMENTAL  ISSUES AS WELL AS AN UPDATE ON  HOUSE OPERATING BUDGET. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN  THE COUNCIL IS INTERESTED IN OR  TAKEN A POSITION ON. WE DON'T HAVE ANY VOTE  SCHEDULED FOR TODAY FOR THE  LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I DO WANT TO THANK CENTRAL  STAFF AND OIR FOR WORKING ON  THIS GREAT PACKET AND I WILL  TURN IT OVER TO CAROLYN TO TAKE  US THROUGH THE PACKET. >> AWESOME. THANK YOU. LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS WITH THE  CENTRAL STAFF. WE WILL BE GETTING AN UPDATE ON  THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION, AS  WELL AS POLICE REFORM. IN ADDITION, VERY FUN DAY. WE WILL BE DOING A CLIMATE  SOLUTIONS NOW ACTIVE 2021. JUST ANOTHER NOTE IS OF THE  BOND BILLS AND BEEN IN THE  HOUSE AND WE DID RECEIVE A COPY  OF THAT AND WE WILL GIVE YOU AN  UPDATE ONCE IT GOES THROUGH. YOU. >> ARE YOU READY QUICK. >> WE ARE READY. >> ALL RIGHT. SO4 BULLET ITEMS TODAY. WE HAVE AN HOUR TO GET THROUGH  THEM SO WE WILL TRY TO ANSWER  AS MANY QUESTIONS AND DO A  THOROUGH PRESENTATION AS WE CAN  WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM  US FOR AN UPDATE ON THE 2021  SESSION. TODAY IS CROSS OVER. WHAT THAT MEANS IS HOUSE BILLS  NEED TO GET ACROSS TO THE OTHER  HOUSE TODAY IN ORDER TO  BASICALLY BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY  THE OTHER HOUSE. THAT THEY HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER  THEM. IS A RUSH OF ACTIVITY OF THE  END OF LAST WEEK ON THE ALSO  SESSIONS OVER THE WEEKEND AND  SESSIONS HAVE STARTED TO MAKE  THIS DEADLINE HAPPEN. SO THAT MEANS THERE ARE THREE  LATE WEEKS LEFT IN THE SESSION. WE A BIG ISSUES STILL  OUTSTANDING. WHICH THREE ARE ON THE AGENDA  TODAY. WE WILL GO OUT AND START WITH  HOW THE HOUSE AND SENATE POLICE  REFORM PACKAGES COMPARED TO ONE  ANOTHER. JUST SO YOU KNOW, BOTH PACKAGES  HAVE CROSSED. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS TWO WEEKS  AGO. BUT NOW WE HAVE KIND OF DOWN TO  CRUNCH TIME TO GET THESE  PACKAGES OF WHICH AND SOME  AREAS ARE VERY DIFFERENT  RECONCILED. AFTER SPENDING A LOT OF TIMES  COMPARING HIS GREAT BIG DEALS  IN WRITING OF THE INFORMATION  THAT WE PROVIDED YOU, MARYLAND  MATTERS THIS MORNING COMES OUT  WITH A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE AND  GOOD SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES IN  THESE TWO PACKAGES.THIS IS  WHAT IS REFLECTED IN THE  PACKAGE WE SENT YOU ON FRIDAY  ARE THE COMPARISONS THAT  KATHLEEN IS ON THE CALL  COMMITMENT AND LANTER WORKED ON  TOGETHER. AND SO IF YOU ARE READY, WE  WILL START WALKING THROUGH THE  PACKAGE. IF IT IS TOO SLOW LET US KNOW,  IF IT IS TOO FAST LET US KNOW. WE WILL JUSTGO FROM THERE. >> SOUNDS REASONABLE .>>  OKAY. ON THE ACTUAL MEMO WE SENT,  KIND OF A GOOD OVERVIEW OF  WHERE WE STAND BUT LOTS OF BILLS .SO THE  HOUSE INTO THE PASSING ONE BIG  BILL, HOUSE BILL 670. EVERYTHING THEY WERE INTERESTED  IN DOING IS IN ONE BILL AND IT  INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT  ARE NOT IN THE SENATE PACKAGE. THE SENATE PASSED IN EIGHT OR  10 SEPARATE BILLS. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE SOME  KIND OF AN EFFORT TO RECONCILE  THE PACKAGE SO WE ARE LOOKING  FORWARD TO HOW WE APPROACH  THIS. SO THE THINGS WE WROTE ABOUT IS  THE DISCIPLINARY ISSUE, THE  REPEAL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT  BILL OF RIGHTS AND KATHLEEN AND  ED, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE  TWO OF YOU. OR NOT. >> SORRY. I WAS ON MUTE. THANK YOU. LAST TIME WE DISCUSSED THE  SENATE PACKAGE. AND WE STARTED OFF WITH A REAL  OVERVIEW. IN THE GUIDANCE FROM COUNCIL  PRESIDENT AND COUNCILMEMBERS  INTO HOW MUCH DETAIL TO GO  INTO. SO WE WILL KIND OF FOLLOW THAT  MODEL. SUGGESTS QUICKLY ON THE  DISCIPLINARY PROCESS COMMIT  WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE SENATE  PACKAGE WE TALKED ABOUT THE  FACT THE SENATE BILL THAT  REPLACES THE OLD PIR, TO BE  SIMPLE ABOUT IT, RELIES ON THE  CHIEF TO SUPERVISE AN  INVESTIGATION AND ULTIMATELY  FOR THE CHIEF TO MAKE A  DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO  CHARGE AN OFFICER AND  RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE. IN AN OFFICER THEN HAS A  CHOICE. DOES THE OFFICER EXCEPT THE  CHIEFS DECISIONS OR APPEAL TO A  HEARING BOARD.AND HEARING  BOARD IS MADE UP OF A LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF HIGHER  RANK AND TO CIVILIANS. THAT HEARING BOARD ONLY MAKES  FINDING THE FACT AND RECOMMENDS  DISCIPLINE. AND THE CHIEF HAS THE FINAL  AUTHORITY REGARDING DISCIPLINE. AND SUGGEST WITH THAT  BACKGROUND IN MIND, THE  HOSPITAL IS ALMOST NOT A  COMPARISON. BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY  ABSOLUTELY A TOTALLY DIFFERENT  BILL AND DIFFERENT WAYS OF  APPROACHING IT. AS HE SOUGHT IN THE PACKET, THE  HOUSE BILL CREATES THREE NEW  ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED  IN THE PROCESS IN ADDITION TO  THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY.IN THE FIRST IT  CREATES IS CALLED THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD, WHICH IS  NOT JUST RELATED TO DISCIPLINE. INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE  COMMISSION AUTHORITY BUT  ESTABLISH THAT THE MEMBERSHIP  WOULD ACTUALLY BE ESTABLISHED  BY LOCAL LEGISLATION. AND IT IS REQUIRED TO MEET  REGULARLY AND IT IS REQUIRED TO  DISCUSS POLICING MATTERS WITH  POLICE OFFICIALS, HAVE  COORDINATION. AND THEN ALSO IT HAS A ROLE  RECEIVING US COMPLAINTS AND  SELF AND RECEIVING THEM.BUT  NOT INVESTIGATING THEM.MAKING  DECISIONS ABOUT THE FACT OR  DISCIPLINE. AND IT ALSO HAS THE  RESPONSIBILITY OF SURVEILLANCE  TO THE TWO THAT WE ARE GOING TO  DISCUSS NOW. UNDER THE HOUSE BILL, IT DOES  CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS. BUT VERY LITTLE SAID ABOUT THAT  INVESTIGATION. AND IN THE BILLS IS A LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TURNS OUT  THE FILE TO WHAT IS CALLED THE  ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING  COMMITTEE.AND THAT CHARGING  COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF FIVE  MEMBERS.AND IS THE CHAIR OF  THE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY  BOARD. IT IS ONCE A BUILDING SELECTED  BY THE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY  BOARD. IS THE COUNTY ATTORNEY IN OUR  PLACE IN THE LEAD LAWYER IN THE  JURISDICTION. AND THEN END DESIGNEES OF THE  PUBLIC DEFENDER. ONCE THE CHIEF TURNS OVER  INVESTIGATORY FILES TO THE  CHARGING COMMITTEE IT REVIEWS  THOSE FILES. I APOLOGIZE. I MIGHT GO DOWN NOW. AND IF I LOSE THAT YOU CAN JUMP  IN. IT INVESTIGATES THE FILES I  MEAN, IT REVIEWS THE FILES. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE MORE  INVESTIGATIONS NECESSARY. BUT ULTIMATELY THE CHARGING  COMMITTEE DOES WITH THE SENATE  BILL ACHIEVES. THE CHARGING COMMITTEE WILL  DECIDE WILL DO THE FACT AND  RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE. AND IS OFTEN DOES IT DOESN'T  AGREE WITH THAT THEY CANAPPEAL  TO A TRIAL BOARD . AND IN THIS CASE THE TRIAL  BOARD IS THROUGH MEMBERS AND AS  AN OFFICER OF EQUAL RIGHTS, NOT  HIGHER RIGHTS. IN A CIVILIAN APPOINTED BY THE  POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD AND  ACTIVE OR RETIRED LAW JUDGE. AND SO THAT TRIAL, THE TRIAL  HAS OCCURRED IN THE TRIAL  BOARDS FINAL DECISION OUR  FINAL. THAT CAN APPEAL TO THE CIRCUIT  COURT, BUT IT IS FINAL. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER  DETAILS THAT ARE DIFFERENT. ONE SIGNIFICANT ONE IN TERMS  OF DISCIPLINE IS THAT AN  OFFICER CAN LOSE HIS OR HER  PENSION AS A PART OF THE  DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AND IF THEY ARE CONVICTED OF A  FELONY OR ANOTHER MISDEMEANOR  RELATED TO TRUTHFULNESS  COMMITTED IN THE COURTS OF OF  FORMING OFFICIAL DUTIES. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER  DIFFERENCES. IN TERMS OF EXPUNGING, YOU MAY  RECALL THE SENATE BILL ALLOWED  EXPUNGEMENT. IF THE CHIEF FOUND UNFOUNDED OR  SUSTAINED DURING THE HEARING  BOARD ACQUITTED OR FOUND THE  OFFICER NOT GUILTY, AFTER THREE  YEARS IT'S ALL THE RECORDS CAN  BE EXPUNGED FROM THE HOSPITAL  EXPRESSLY SAYS NO EXPUNGEMENT. NOW SCOPE MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT  CHANGES TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF  THE POLICE TRAINING AND  STANDARDS COMMISSION. IN THE DUTIES AND RESPONSE  ABILITIES OF THAT COMMISSION IS  A VERY INTERESTING DIFFERENCE  ON THE ASSESSMENT DATE. THE HOUSE BILL FOR THIS PART OF  THE HOUSE WILL IS DELAYED BY A  YEAR JULY 1, 2022. THE SENATE BILL IS EFFECTIVE  IMMEDIATELY UPON IT AND NEXT  ANNOUNCEMENT. YOU MAY RECALL THE SENATE BILL  FOR EXISTING COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT  EXIST ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF  THE ACT CONTINUE TO EXIST UNTIL  THEY EXPIRE. THIS EXCEPT THAT THE BILL  PASSES THIS YEAR. IS NOT ACCEPTED IN JULY OF NEXT  YEAR. AND IS ONLY IT WILL ALLOW  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING  AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN  ENTERED INTO JULY ONE OF NEXT  YEAR TO CONTINUE. UNTIL THEY EXPIRE. MANY OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF  THE BILL. AND, WOULD YOU LIKE TO JUMP IN  ON ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR? >> IT WAS JUST ONE THING I WAS  GOING TO ADD, WHICH IS UNIQUE  TO THE HOUSE BILL. AND REQUIRES THE POLICE  STANDARDS COMMISSION TO ADOPT  THIS, CALL THE DISCIPLINARY  MATRIX. IT REQUIRES ALL THE LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE  DISCIPLINARY MATRIX. AND WHEN THE ADMINISTRATOR  CHARGING COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE  INVESTIGATION AND THEY DECIDE  WE HAVE A VIOLATION OF THE  RECOMMENDED DISCIPLINE WITHIN  THE DISCIPLINARY MATRIX AND THE  CHIEF COULD INCLUDE THE  DISCIPLINE MUST BUT MUST STAY  WITHIN THE DISCIPLINARY MATRIX. YOU LOSE A MEASURE OF LOCAL  CONTROL. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DID NOT  HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM YOU AND IS  BEING SET UP BY THE STATE AND  WITHSTANDS ALL THE DIFFERENT  LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THAT IS A NEW CONCEPT. I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT. >> THERE ARE NO DISCUSSIONS ON  THAT BILL, SHOULD WE MOVE ON. >> COUNCIL MEMBER REIMER AS A  QUESTION. >>Hans Reimer: THANK YOU. FOR SOMEONE TO THINK MELANIE  AND KATHLEEN AND ED AND  EVERYONE WHO HELPED PREPARE  THIS PACKET. I HAVE SEEN THAT MARILYN  MANNERS ARTICLE YET BUT DON'T  BE SURPRISEDIF IT DOES A BETTER  JOB THAN WHAT YOU HAVE DONE  HERE . UNDER IS IMPORTANT TO LAY THIS  INFORMATION OUT FOR THE PUBLIC. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THUS FAR HAVE  NOT BEEN CLEAR AT ALL. IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. AND SO THANK YOU. SECONDLY, EITHER OF THESE BILLS  WOULD BE A BIG IMPROVEMENT FOR  THE STATUS QUO IN THE COUNTY  WHERE DISCIPLINARY MATTERS ARE  REFERRED TO AN ARBITRATION  PANEL THAT THE OFFICER CHOOSES. AND AS A RESULT THE OF THE  LABOR ARBITRATOR DECIDING  DISCIPLINE, WHICH IS NATIONALLY  NOW VERY CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS  A VERY BAD PRACTICE THAT HAS  LED TO ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS  AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH  OFFICERS NOT FACING DISCIPLINE  IN A TIMELY MANNER AND SHE'S  NOT BEING ABLE TO OPPOSE THE  STANDARDS THEY SEEK TO UPHOLD  FOR THE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS  REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. FOR THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE  STANDARDS AND COMMUNITY VALUES  EMBEDDED IN POLICING AND FOR  THE CHIEF TO HAVE POLICIES AND  HAVE THE COMMUNITY ABLE TO HOLD  OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT. I WANTED TO HEAR, AND BE  SURPRISED AT THE COUNTY  EXECUTIVE HAD A VIEW ON THESE  YET. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT  DOESN'T DEFINE. WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IT  PROVISIONALLY WE WOULD BE  INTERESTED IN HEARING THE  THOUGHTS OF THE CHIEFS AND ED  ABOUT ED, YOU ARE THE COUNTY  ATTORNEYS LEAD AS I UNDERSTAND  IT ON THESE ISSUES. I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING WHAT  YOU THINK ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE  APPROACHES. THE COUNTY HAS A LOT RIDING ON  THIS SO I THINK WE NEED TO  CONSIDER WHETHER WE WANT TO  WEIGH IN ON WHICH BILL WE  PREFER. IS HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE  THINGS THAT MAKE UP BIGGER  DIFFERENCE IN POLICING APOLOGY  THAN WHAT DISCIPLINARY  PROCEDURES WE HAVE.I WOULDN'T  RECOMMEND WE DO THAT TODAY. I'M CERTAINLY NOT PREPARED TO  DO THAT TODAY. BUT I THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL  TO HEAR SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE  CHIEF AND FROM THEN. >> I WILL JUST SAY THESE ARE  BOTH VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT  WE HAVE. BUT THEY ARE BOTH VERY  DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. SO IT'S A LOT OF POLICY ABOUT  HOW WE WANT TO GO ABOUT THE  PROCESS OF DISCIPLINING POLICE  OFFICERS. THE SENATE BILL I GUESS IS  CLOSER THAN WHAT WE HAVE ONLY  IN THE SENSE THAT THERE IS  STILL AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION  AND THE CHIEF THEN MAKES A  DECISION AND OFFERS DISCIPLINE  TO A HEARING BOARD. THE HEARING BOARD MAKES A  DECISION THAT IS BINDING ON THE  CHIEF LIQUIDATION AS  PUNISHMENT. HOUSE BILL IS MORE DIFFERENT  THAN IT ESTABLISHES WAS  MENTIONING. A LOT OF NEW IN TODAY'S. SO YOU STILL HAVE AN INTERNAL  INVESTIGATION, BUT IT IS TURNED  OVER TO THEADMINISTRATIVE  CHARGING COMMITTEE.MOST OF  THE COUNTY ATTORNEYS, THE STATE  ATTORNEYS, PUBLIC DEFENDER . AND THEY MAKE A DETERMINATION,  WHETHER IT IS FOUNDED OR  SUSTAINED OR NOT. AND ANOTHER THING THAT IS  DIFFERENT IS THE DISCIPLINARY  MATRIX PUSHED OUT ACROSS ALL  THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IT'S A SENTENCING DEADLINE IF  THAT IS WHAT THE PUNISHMENT IS  GOING TO BE FOR THE DIFFERENT  CRIMES. YOU AGAIN HAVE A TRIAL BOARD,  BUT THE TRIAL BOARD IS COMPOSED  OVER THE BOTH HAVE CIVILIANS ON  THEM OVER THE TRIAL BOARD IS  THE FINAL WORD UNDER THE HOUSE  BILL ALTOGETHER. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF  DEALING WITH DISCIPLINE IN THE  POLICE OFFICERS. >> WAS THAT MATRIX INCLUDED IN  THE LEGISLATION OR IS THAT JUST  THAT THERE WILL BE A MATRIX. THE ABOVE YOU ON THE  APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MATRIX  MEANS? >> IT JUST SAYS THE STATE  COMMISSION WILL ADOPT A MODEL  UNIFORM DISCIPLINARY MATRIX FOR  THE USE OF EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENCY IN THE STATE. EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY  SHALL ADOPT THE UNIFORM STATE  DISCIPLINARY MATRIX. IT DOESN'T SAY MUCH ELSE ABOUT  IT EXCEPT THAT IS WHAT IS GOING  TO GOVERN PERMITTED DEPENDS  UPON YOUR REVIEW. YOU LOSE SOME MEASURE OF LOCAL  CONTROL IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU  THINK WHAT PUNISHMENT IS  APPROPRIATE FOR A CRIME. YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE HAVING TO  WORRY ABOUT THAT. HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. SO YOU LOSE THAT DISCRETION  HOOD ONCE YOU ACHIEVE  UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE  STATE, THAT WILL DO IT. BUT THAT IS A NEW CONCEPT. ALSO ANOTHER THING THE HOUSE  BILL IS, I THINK THERE IS ONE  HEARING BOARD AND ONE  ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGING AGENCY  FOR ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT  AGENCIES THAT IS ALSO A NEW  CONCEPT NOT GOOD OR BAD, JUST A  DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THIS FOR  IT CHOCK-FULL OF ALL THE OTHER  THINGS. FROM SEARCH WARRANTS TO USE OF  FORCE. DEAR ALL STOP SHOPPING. >> ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD. >> THE SENATE BILL MAKES IT A  LOT CLEARER OF A PROCESS AND  ALSO GIVES THE AUTHORITY TO  DISCIPLINE TO THE CHIEF OR  SHERIFF MANY OF CHIEF SUCH AS  MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO THE  COMMUNITY AND IT IS OUR  RESPONSE ABILITY TO HOLD OUR  OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE  THINGS THAT THEY DO. THINK OF THE SENATE BILL IS  CLEAR THAT AGAINST THE CHIEF  THAT AUTHORITY IN THE HOUSE  BILL IT DOES NOT GIVE THAT  AUTHORITY TO THE CHIEF. AND GIVES THAT TO THE GROUP OF  FOLKS THAT IT COULD BE APPEALED  BY SIMPLY TAKING OUT THE  ABILITY FOR ME AS A LEADER OF  THE CHIEF OF POLICE, AS A  LEADER OF THE ORGANIZATION TO  PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE  COMMUNITY. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THING TO ME THAT IS AN  ISSUE. >> SO ON THE CHIEF MAKES A  DECISION, THE LOCAL ELECTED  OFFICIALS A CHIEF, WE DON'T  APPRECIATE HOW YOU HAVE  APPROACHED THIS ONE AND YOU'RE  NOT GOING TO HAVE YOUR  CONTRACTOR MOVED. ABOUT IS THE BASIC EXECUTIVE IN  THAT CASE WE THINK YOU'RE NOT  INDISCIPLINE CORRECTLY IN OUR  ACCOUNTABILITY AS ELECTED  OFFICIALS AS WE ARE GOING TO FIND A NEW CHIEF . THAT IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY FOR  THE SYSTEM TO WORK.NOT SAYING  IT ALWAYS WORKS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ARE  SAYING THIS IS A BODY THAT  WOULD BE AN ENDURING BODY AND  IT WOULD BE COMPOSED OF THESE  DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND IT IS  WHERE ACCOUNTABILITY LIES FOR  THE PARTICULAR DECISION. BACK IN THE PROS OR CONS A  DECISION GOES THE WAY THAT  PEOPLE DON'T, OF ELECTED  OFFICIALS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE  FOR THE COMMUNITY ON THIS IS AN  WORKING. IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW YOU FIX  THAT. >> I WOULD ALSO ADD AS MR.  LACKNER NOTED ABOUT THE MATRIX,  I THINK IT DOES PUT IN A  BINDING SORT OF AN AGREEMENT  YOU MIGHT SAY AS TO WHAT ACTUAL  DISCIPLINE IS. AND THERE ARE EXTENUATING  FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED ON ALL  CASES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED  WHAT YOU ARE PRODUCING IS A  ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL FOR THE  ENTIRE STATE OF MARYLAND. AND I'M NOT SAYING I DON'T  THINK EVERY POLICE DEPARTMENT  STANDARD WEISS ARE ALL BUILT  FROM THE SAME PLATFORM. I THINK YOU HAVE SOME  DEPARTMENTS THAT HOLD CERTAIN  THINGS MUCH MORE DEAR WHEN IT  COMES TO CERTAIN THIS BINARY  PROCESSES WOULD YOU SAY ARE  EVENTS OR OFFENSES THAT AN  OFFICER COMMITS THAT AGAIN, I  THINK IT IS LIKE A JUDGE WHO  HAS NO, MONEY IS FACED WITH  GUIDELINES HE HAS LITTLE  DISCRETION ABOUT HOW HE COULD  GO OUTSIDE OF THOSE GUIDELINES. I THINK THAT IS A SLIPPERY  SLOPE FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. >> THANKS. I WILL PASS IT BACK. I JUST WANT TO OBSERVE AGAIN  THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS WE HAVE  AN ACCOUNTING OUT OF THE CHIEF  IS NOT IN CHARGE PER FRANKLY IN  MY OPINION NOBODY IS IN CHARGE. AND IT IS A PROFOUNDLY FLAWED  SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T PRODUCE  RESULTS AND WE NEED TO FIX IT. AND SO JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT  POINT AGAIN IN CASE FOLKS ARE  WATCHING. THANKS. >> THINKING ORIGINALS MEMBER  CATS QUICK. >>Sidney Katz: THANK YOU VERY  MUCH MR. PRESIDENT. AND THANK YOU TO ALL INVOLVED  IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS  PACKET. TO SAY IT REALLY IS HELPFUL IS  TRUE, BUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS  REALLY CONFUSING IS AWESOME  ALSO TRUE. COULD YOU PLEASE WALK ME  THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WE HAVE TWO VERY DIFFERENT  DISCUSSIONS GOING ON. IS THERE A RECONCILIATION  MEETING? HOW DOES THAT WORK? >> THIS IS A VERY HIGH-PROFILE  ISSUE FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. AND SO YOU THINK OH WELL, YOU  SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN  AND MAYBE IT JUST DOESN'T GET  RECONCILED. I THINK THIS PACKET WILL GET  RECONCILED. AND I'M NOT GOING TO BORE YOU  WITH THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW  THINGS LIKE THIS GET  RECONCILED. FACET SUFFICE IT TO SAY I THINK  THIS ONE WILL GO INTO A  CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. SO BOTH SIDES WILL APPOINT, I  BELIEVE THEY WILL APPOINT  CONFERENCE MEETING. MOSTLY TO GET TOO MUCH OF A  HURRY THAN THEY WILL WORK ON  THE PACKAGE AND GET IT TO COME  TOGETHER. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE  ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DO  KNOW THAT. I WOULD JUST SAY IF THERE IS  ANY CONCERN THAT ANYTHING WOULD  BE VETOED HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO  OVERRIDE A VETO DURING THE  SESSION . AND THEY REALLY NEED TO HAVE A  PACKAGE BY APRIL 5. SO I  ANTICIPATE THERE ARE  CONVERSATIONS GOING ON NOW. BUT I HAVE NOT TALKED TO  ANYONE, ANY INSIDER WHO KNOWS  EXACTLY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PACKAGE  THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AND THEN  THERE IS THIS PACKAGE. SPECIAL DIFFERENCES. AND AGAIN, HIGH-PROFILE,  HIGH-PRESSURE. BUT I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE  PACKAGE THAT GETS RECONCILED. >> AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT. I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT JERRY BUT  THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION. AND SO APRIL 5 IS THE DATE THAT  NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED. OR THAT THEY NEED TO COME  TOGETHER. AND YOU ALREADY ANSWERED THE  QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF  THE GOVERNOR VETOES IT.SO  THAT IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. AND I DON'T KNOW, MR.  PRESIDENT, YOU ARE GOING TO GET  INTO THE ACTUAL WEEDS OF EVERY  PART OF THIS. BUT AS AN EXAMPLE, THE  PROVISION ON BODY WORN CAMERAS. I GUESS IT IS THE HOUSE SIDE. GUESS BOTH OF THEM TALK ABOUT  BODY WORN CAMERAS. BUT ONE OF THEM SAID THEY HAVE  TO HAVE A PROVISION THAT IT  STARTS 60 SECONDS BEFORE AND IS  ACTUALLY TURNED ON AND IT CAN  GO BACK 60 SECONDS FOR  SOMETHING LIKE THAT. HAVE DEFINED THE ACTUAL PART OF  THAT. BUT TO OUR BODY WORN CAMERAS  THAT WE HAVE NOW, DO THEY NEED  THAT PROVISION? IF THAT PART WERE TO PASS? >> MR. KATZ, NOW. CURRENTLY OUR BODY WORN CAMERAS  HAVE 30 SECONDS OF BUFFERING. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE COULD,  WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS BUT I'VE  DISCUSSED THIS WITH MY STAFF WE  HAVE ALREADY MADE THAT  CONSIDERATION TO ACTUALLY GO TO  60 SECONDS OF BUFFERING. WHAT IT REQUIRES IS THEN THERE  IS GOING TO BE MORE VIDEO, MORE  DATA THAT IS GOING TO BE FOR  STORAGE COST. BUT BEYOND THAT, WE ARE LOOKING  TO GO TO 60 SECONDS OF  BUFFERING ON THE CAMERA  ACTUALLY IS ACTIVATED. >>Sidney Katz: OKAY. AND IF THAT INVOLVES, IT WOULD  INVOLVE ANY TYPE OF BUDGETARY  CONSIDERATION FOR IT EVEN IF  THIS WERE NOT TO GO INTO EFFECT  UNTIL AFTER THIS BUDGET. I WOULD HOPE WE COULD INCLUDE  WHATEVER IS NECESSARY SO THAT  WE CAN HAVE THE FUNDS TO TAKE  OVER. AND ANY NEW CAMERAS WE ARE  BUYING WOULD ALSO BE FOLLOWING  THOSE PROVISIONS. AND THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS  AN EXAMPLE FOR THE SENATE SIDE. IT SUPERSEDES LOCAL LAW DIRIDON  OUTSIDE YOU SAY IN YOUR PACKET  NOW. BUT IT'S THE SENATE SIDE OF THE  BILL. AND THAT PROVISION ACTUALLY  DOES HAPPEN. SO AT THAT POINT THE COUNTY  WOULD NOT HAVE ANY VALIDITY AT  ALL ON ANY TOPIC ON THE POLICE  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BILL  OF RIGHTS OR ANY OTHER  PROVISION TO HAVE ANY  DISCUSSION ON IT WHATSOEVER. EVERYTHING WOULD GO TO THE  STATE TO READ IS THAT ACCURATE? >> I'M GOING TO LET ED TAKE  THAT QUESTION. >> THAT IS ONE OF THE  DIFFERENCES FOR THE SENATE BILL  HAS SOME FAIRLY WELL CONTOURED  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT IS  BARGAINABLE AND WHAT IS NOT. THE HOUSE BILL DOES NOT. IT WOULD DEPEND UPON WHAT  LANGUAGE IS IN THEIR. DEVITIS TOTAL PREEMPTION THAN  THE COUNTY CAN BE TOTALLY  OUT-OF-THE-BOX THE SENATE BILL  WAS A TOTAL PREEMPTION. IT WAS PREEMPTION A LOT OF  THINGS. BUT IT LEFT LOCAL AUTHORITY ON  THE INVESTIGATION AND  INTERROGATION FILL IN THE GAP  IF YOU WILL FOR AN THE HOSPITAL  IS SILENT ALTOGETHER AND EVEN  LANGUAGE ABOUT COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING IS DIFFERENT IN  TALKS WITH THE LAUNCH  ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CAN OF A  COLLECTIVEBARGAINING AGREEMENT  THAT ALTERS CERTAIN  REQUIREMENTS , WHICH IS  LANGUAGE I FIND A BIT  LOOSEY-GOOSEY. DOES THAT MEAN IT COULD  SUPPLEMENT. AND CISCO SUPPLEMENT DOESN'T  NEGATE THE RED AND I HAVE  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ABOUT  SOMETHING ELSE. THAT COULD USE CLEANING UP. >> SO AND THIS WAS MY LAST  QUESTION ON THIS. THE WHOLE IDEA THAT SOMEONE  COULD LOSE THEIR RETIREMENT. TO GIVE SPECIFICS ON WHAT THAT  MEANS? IF SOMEONE IS IN THEIR OWN  FUNDS INTO THE RETIREMENT, DO  THEY LOSE THAT TOO? HOW DOES THAT WORK?THEIR  PENSION. >> I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE  PROVISIONS IN THEIR THAT ALLOW  A PAYOUT OF INDIVIDUAL  CONTRIBUTIONS. IF I RECALL. >> IT IS VERY NARROW FOR THIS  IS THE END BILL. FIRST OFF IT'S ONLY GOING  FORWARD. IT DOESN'T APPLY RETROACTIVELY. IT IS ONLY FOR A PENSION FROM  THE EFFECTIVE GOING FORWARD. AND THINK IT WAS ONLY UPON  CONVICTION OF CERTAIN  QUALIFYING CRIMES LIKE A FELONY  OR A PERJURY TYPE CRIME. I THINK THE COURT HAS TO MAKE  SURE IT'S FINDING BY CLEAR AND  CONVINCING EVIDENCE, WHICH IS A  HIGHER BAR THAN NORMAL HERE IT  WASN'T NARROW. IT IS QUITE A HAMMER, BUT IT  WAS NARROWLY TAPERED AND HOW  THAT HAMMER COULD BE USED. >> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND  I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP VERY  MUCH. THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. >> THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER JAWANDO? >> THANK YOU. CAN HEAR ME? >> YOU ARE A LITTLE MUFFLED. >> I NEED A NEW PAIR OF  EARPHONES. THEY'VE GOTTEN A YEARS WORTH OF  USE.SO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENCES, BUT  BETWEEN THE TWO DISCIPLINE  PROCEDURES, HOUSE AND SENATE,  THE CIVILIAN COMPRISED LISA  COENEN ABILITY BOARD IN THE  HOUSE BILL. REMIND ME. HOW THAT DIFFERS FROM THE  CIVILIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE  SENATE BILL. OR REMIND THE PUBLIC TOO. >> YOU MENTIONED CIVILIAN  INVOLVEMENT IN THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD. THERE IS CIVILIAN INVOLVEMENT  IN THE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY  BOARD, THE TRIAL BOARD ON THE  HOUSE BILL. SO FOR THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD, THAT  REMAINS TO BE SEEN. BECAUSE YOU WILL ESTABLISH THE  MEMBERSHIP FOR THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD. >> THE JURISDICTION WILL? >> THE PARTICULAR LOCAL  JURISDICTION IS GOING TO  ESTABLISH THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE  POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD. THE CHARGING COMMITTEE, IT IS A  FIVE-MEMBER COMMITTEE IN TERMS  OF CIVILIAN INVOLVEMENT THERE  IN IT IS ALSO MATURE THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD, WHOEVER  THAT IS. THAT CAN BE A CIVILIAN, ETC.  THERE ARE FIVE MEMBERS THERE. ON THE TRIAL BOARD, THERE WILL  BE ONE CIVILIAN FORGET THERE  WILL BE AN ACTIVE OR RETIRED  ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON THE  TRIAL BOARD.IS CIVILIAN  APPOINTED BY THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD AND A  POLICE OFFICER OF INK WILL  RANK. >> SO OUR ROLE ON THE COUNTY  COUNCIL AND ANY OTHER LOCAL  JURISDICTIONS AND TAKING THE  MEMBERS OF THE BOARD, WHAT IS  THE ROLE.I'M A LITTLE  CONFUSED ON THAT PIECE. >> FOR THE POLICE  ACCOUNTABILITY BOARD, AND  EXPRESS LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THE  MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD IS  DETERMINED BY A LOCAL  LEGISLATIVE BODY, BUT THEN IT  REQUIRES THAT BOARD TO READILY  MEET OFFICERS TO DO POLICING,  TO APPOINT MEMBERS, APPOINT  CIVILIAN MEMBERS TO THE TRIAL  BOARDS ARE TO COMPLAINTS OF  POLICE MISCONDUCT AND REVIEW  OUTCOME. SO IT SIMPLIFIES SOME DUTIES. BUT THE MEMBERSHIP LEFT OF THE  LOCAL BRITISH LEGISLATIVE BODY. >> THAT WAS MY READING TOO. I THINK IT WAS SAID IN THIS IS  OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF BOUNCING  BALLS HERE. WE WOULD HAVE A ROLE IN  APPOINTING THAT BODY, WHICH  WOULD BE KEY IN THE HOUSE BILL  AS FAR AS THE DECISION TO MOVE  FORWARD WITH DISCIPLINE. THE CHIEF STILL HAS A ROLE IN  THAT JURISDICTION WOULD STILL  HAVE A ROLE TO CHARGE AND DOLE  OUT THE DISCIPLINE ONCE THE  DECISION IS MADE. THE CHIEF WOULD, I SEE YOU  NODDING. GO AHEAD. >> UNDER THE BILL, THE TRIAL  BOARD, IF AN OFFICER APPEALS  THE DECISION TO THE TRIAL BOARD  FOR THE TRIAL BOARD DECISIONS  ARE FINAL. >> THE CHIEF DOESN'T IMPOSE  DISCIPLINE UNDER THE HOUSE BILL  LIKE SHE DOES UNDER THE SENATE  BILL IS THE DETERMINATION OR  NOT IS MADE BY THE TRADITION  WITH THE CHARGE RECOMMENDS  DISCIPLINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE MATRIX. THE CHIEF CAN INCREASE THE  DISCIPLINE BUT STILL HAS TO  STAY WITHIN THE MATRIX. I AM MAKING THIS A. THE MATRIX  THAT YOU COULD GET BETWEEN  THREE WEEKS AND SIX WEEKS IN  THE CHURCH COMMITTEE SAID THRE\n  . THE CHIEF COULD TAKE IT TO THE  SIX WITH AND CALLING LIKE  SENTENCING GUIDELINES. >> OKAY. THAT MAKE SENSE FOR IT IT IS  INTERESTING. A CERTAIN LOOK AT THE LOGICAL  WHAT MR. REIMER WAS SAYING  HERE'S ONE PERSON ACCOUNTABLE  FOR IT WE HAD A BIT OF A  PICKING OUR NEXT CHIEF. THAT IS NOT AN EASY PROCESS. I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF  DISCIPLINE THAT HAPPENS AND  THERE'S VERY LITTLE  TRANSPARENCY. ONE THING WE ALL AGREED UPON  REARVIEW COUNCILMEMBERS KNOW  WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN  REGARDS TO DISCIPLINE. THE ABILITY OF US TO HOLD THE  CHIEF OR ANY HEAD LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ACCOUNTABLE  BASED ON INDIVIDUAL DISCIPLINE  DECISIONS, I THINK THAT IS A  VERY DIFFICULT PATH. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS A  POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE OF THE  HOUSE MODEL IS THAT YOU HAVE  MORE CIVILIAN AND NON-CIVILIAN. THERE ARE NON-CIVILIANS. ALJ AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT  POTENTIALLY INVOLVED IN THIS  BOARD IS MANDATED WHAT THEY  HAVE TO DO THE CHARGING  COMMITTEE AND VARIOUS ENTITIES. AND SO HAVEN'T MADE A  DETERMINATION. AND WE ARE NOT TAKING ANY  BOATS. I WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE  BECAUSE I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT  FOR THEM NOT TO PLAY IN OUR  DEPARTMENT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT  THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS. I THINK IT MIGHT BE AN EVEN  HEAVIER LEFT TO HAVE THAT  PERSON. AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY MORE  ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT REGARD. I DO THINK THAT THE SHIELDING. I DO LIKE IN THE HOSPITAL THEY  REMOVE THE EXPUNGEMENT  PROVISION. PART OF THE PREMISES THIS, AND  THINK FOR MOST OF US ARE FROM  OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THERE  SHOULD BE NO EXTRA RIGHTS HERE. IF A CITIZEN CANNOT HAVE  SOMETHING SHIELDING AFTER THREE  YEARS OF POLICE OFFICER I  RECOMMEND IF WE TAKE ACTION TO  SUPPORT PROVISIONS ARE IN AS IT  MOVES THROUGH THE CONFERENCE,  BUT THAT ONE. I HAVE COMMENTS ON OTHER BILLS,  BUT I WILL STOP BECAUSE I WANT  TO TALK ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATION BILL AND I KNOW  WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET. >> THANK YOU. COUNCILMEMBER RICE?>> NO, I'M  GOOD. >> FOLKS, WE CAN TAKE ANY  POSITIONS THE BODY WANTS. I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY IN THE  CONFERENCE COMMITTEE,  ESPECIALLY, IS ASKING FOR THE  POINT OF VIEW OF THE MONTGOMERY  COUNTY COUNCIL. WILL STATE LAWMAKERS, IT'S PAST  THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE  ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS WHAT  COMES OUT OF THE COMMITTEE IS  GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY THE  SPEAKER, THE SENATE PRESIDENT  THE CHAIRS OF THE APPROPRIATE  COMMITTEES FORGET THE MEMBERS. COUNCILMEMBER REIMER? P1 AND THINK WE ARE  UNDERSELLING OUR INFLUENCE  HERE. THE BOARD THE HOSPITAL CREATES  LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THE  POLICING ADVISORY COMMISSION WE  AND REENACTED. IN THE SENATE DISCIPLINE MODEL  IS VERY CLOSE TO THE  LEGISLATION FOR THE MONGOMERY  COUNTY COUNCIL RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK THE COUNTY HAS BEEN  HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL.AND I  BELIEVE OURTEAM HAS BEEN PART  OF THE CONVERSATION . >> IS A QUESTION WHETHER THE  SIX OR SO MEMBERS OF THE  CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, INCLUDING  THE APPOINTEES AND THE SPEAKER  OF THE SENATE PRESIDENT. AT THIS POINT. >> RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW YET BUT I DO THINK  WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE WE ARE  PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE HERE  THE CONVERSATION. >> WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF  THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY  CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATEWIDE  POLICY AND THIS IS NOT THE  FIRST ONE. >> THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO  SAY BRIEFLY, THINKING OUT LOUD. WHICH I THINK IS UNAVOIDABLE AT  THIS POINT. I DO WORRY ABOUT THE BOARDS  CONCEPT REPLACING UNACCOUNTABLE  PROCESS WITH ANOTHER. ONE UNACCOUNTABLE PERSON WITH  ANOTHER. NO ONE CAN BE FIRED. THEY DON'T GET REHIRED. THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PUBLIC  PRESSURE.I THINK THAT YOU CAN  SEE RESULTING IN THAT OUTCOME  AND JURISDICTIONS WERE THOSE  INDIVIDUALS ARE APPOINTED PARIS  JUST AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT,  PERHAPS SOMEWHAT NAOVELY HOPED  THAT IT WOULD RESULT IN THE  OPPOSITE WERE THE CIVILIAN,  SOME OF THE ACTIVIST COMMUNITY  IS HOPING THAT JUST BECAUSE  THERE IS A CIVILIAN THAT PERSON  WOULD AGREE WITH YOU. I AM CONCERNED. I THINK ACCOUNTABILITY IS A  SECRET INGREDIENT HERE. AND SO THAT WILL BE MY GUIDE AS  I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OF  THESE I PREFER. MARTY PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE  IMMUNE TO THE PRESSURE OR  PUBLIC IDEAS OR WHERE ARE THEY  NOT. >> THANK YOU. OKAY, I THINK WE CAN MOVE ON! I'M GOING TO ASK YOUR QUESTION  MR. PRESIDENT. YOU WANT TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT  TOPIC OR GO AHEAD AND MOVE  THROUGH THE PACKAGE OR A PUPIL  OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE  PACKAGE? I'M JUST THROWING THAT OUT  THERE. WE ARE GLAD TO GO THROUGH THE  PACKAGE ENTIRELY TOO. >> THERE ARE NO OTHER  ADDITIONAL REQUESTS THAT I HAVE  ABOUT THIS TOPIC. BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST  MOVING THROUGH THE BACK IT. COUNCIL MEMBER JAWANDO? >> I HAVE ONE COMMENT TO MAKE. THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  PROVISION IN THE HOUSE IS MUCH,  MUCH BETTER. AND ACTUALLY TO YOUR LAST  POINT, BASICALLY THE BILL WE  PASSED DIDN'T CREATE THIS  INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT WOULD  TAKE ANY USE OF FORCE. GOES ONE STEP FURTHER. IN A SERIOUS USE OF FORCE. AND I THINK WE SHOULD  ABSOLUTELY CONSISTENT WITH THE  BILL WE PASSED IN THE COUNCIL,  I THINK THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY  EASY ONE. END OF THIS WILL PACKAGE IT IS  A PRETTY CLEAR CUT DIFFERENT  SPIRIT MELANIE MARTIN COULD  EXPOUND ON THAT. BUT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT  IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CHIEF IS  IN FAVOR OF TOO, AN INDEPENDENT  BODY THAT WOULD TAKE THESE  THINGS UP. >> OKAY. >> ALL RIGHT. KATHLEEN, DO YOU WANT TO KEEP  WALKING THROUGH THIS PACKAGE? >> SURE. AND SOME MOVING TO DISCUSSING  THE MARYLAND PUBLIC INFORMATION  ACT ANDRECORDS RELATING TO A  COMPLAINT AND AN INVESTIGATION  , YOU WILL RECALL THAT THIS  RELATES TO THE CURRENT  REQUIREMENT IN THE INFORMATION  ACT THAT PERSONNEL RECORDS  THERE IS A REQUEST TO REVIEW  PERSONNEL RECORDS. THAT MUST BE DENIED WITH  SEVERAL CAVEATS. PERSONNEL RECORDS WITH NOT BE  GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE. AND INCLUDED IN PERSONNEL  RECORDS AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE  COMPLAINTS AGAINST AN OFFICER  OR RECORDS RELATING TOTHAT  COMPLAINT . BOTH BILLS FROM THE MANDATORY  DENIAL INTO A DISCRETIONARY  DECISION TO DENY OR ALLOW AND  INCORPORATE CRITERIA TO GUIDE  THAT DISCRETION. THEY ARE SIMILAR IN THAT WAY. HEALTH BILL DOES HAVE  DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF  DISCRETION. IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES AN  INSPECTION BE DENIED AS A  RELATES TO AN ACTIVE  INVESTIGATION OR CONTAIN  CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION. THAT WOULD BE DISCRETIONARY ON  THE SENATE BILL AND REQUIRES  THAT A CUSTODIAN ALLOW ESTATES  ATTORNEY, THE US ATTORNEY,  ATTORNEY GENERAL AND  PROSECUTORS HAVE ACCESS. SO THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED  INSPECTION. THE HOUSE BILL ALSO CREATES AN  INTERESTING MECHANISM FOR THE  CURRENT MARYLAND COMPLIANCE  BOARD FOR IT CREATES A PROCESS  WHEREBY A CUSTODIAN HAS A  CONCERN THAT SOMEBODY IS ASKING  FOR RECORDS IN A FRIVOLOUS  MANNER THAT A CUSTODIAN COULD  GO TO THE CURRENT BOARD AND ASK  FOR PERMISSION IN ORDER TO NOT  HAVE TO DISCLOSE THE RECORD FOR  THAT PROCESS IS SET UP. IT IS IN THE HOUSE BILL. IT IS NOT IN THE SENATE BILL. AND THIS BILL TAKES EFFECT ON  OCTOBER 1.  >> I AM A LITTLE WORRIED WE  WILL NOT HAVE TIME FOR THE  OTHER TOPICS. SO I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER  QUESTIONS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. AT THIS POINT. AND WE ARE THREE WEEKS SINCE IT  WILL BE RESOLVED. >> WE ARE FOLLOWING YOUR LEAD  MR. PRESIDENT. >> AND TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE  FROM THE TEST I'M GETTING. I THINK WE CAN MOVE AHEAD. WE CAN PROBABLY GET AND BEGIN  AT THE CLIMATE SOLUTIONS NOW  ACT. >> LET'S GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. AMY, ARE YOU READY?>> GOOD  AFTERNOON EVERYONE. >> THANKS KATHLEEN THIS IS THE  ONLY LARGE PIECE OF CLIMATE  LEGISLATION THAT IS MOVING THAT  ARE ADDRESSED IN THE NOTES  THERE IN THE HOSPITAL WAS IN  THE HOUSE COMMITTEE HERE TO  WALK TO THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF  THE BILL AND IF YOU HAVE ANY  QUESTIONS, JUST LET ME KNOW. >> WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO  PRIMARILY IS GAS OMISSION  REDUCTION REQUIREMENT. CURRENTLY IT IS 40 PERCENT. AND THIS WILL ALTER IT TO BE 60  PERCENT FOR 2006 LEVELS. BY 2030. AND THEN ACHIEVE NET ZERO BY  2025. THE BILL HAS REQUIREMENTS FOR  ANY ENERGY CONSERVATION OF  BUILDING. THE REGULATION REQUIRED  BUILDINGS TO ACHIEVE ENERGY  PRODUCTIONS THAT EXCEED THE  2018 CONSERVATION CODE. STARTED 30 PERCENT FOR BUILDING  PERMITS FROM 2024. AND INCREASING APPLICATION OR  FEE ON OR AFTER 2033 MUST  ACHIEVE A ZERO ENERGY BALANCE. IF YOU WANT TO NOTE THAT A  LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS MORE  STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS AT THIS  TIME IN THE BUILDING PERMIT TO  PROCEED THE BILL FOR IT. AND IS AN INTERESTING COMPONENT  TO IT. FROM JULY 1, 2022 TO JULY 30 WE  CONSTRUCTED TO MEET NET ZERO  ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND ANY  OTHER SCHOOLS WOULD BE READY. ABOUT THE NET ZERO SCHOOLS IS  SUBJECT TO FUNDING FROM THE NET  ZERO LOAN FUND THAT IS SET UP  UNDER THE BILL. WE HAD REQUIREMENTS FOR THE  STATE VEHICLE SEAT TO GO TO NET  ZERO OMISSIONS AND HAVE  COMPONENTS THAT HAVE  ALTERNATIVE. [ INAUDIBLE ] THEY START WITH  THE BUSES AND MOVED TO THE  PASSENGER IN A LARGE COMPONENT  OF THE BILL IS IT ESTABLISHES A  POLICY FOR THE STATE TO PLANT 5  MILLION SUSTAINABLE TREES BY  THE END OF 2030. AND AS A PROGRAM UNDER SHARES  AREAS BY MAKING GRANTS FOR  QUALIFIED ORGANIZATIONS IN  THOSE AREAS. AND THEN THERE IS ASKED  DISSENSIONS TO CERTAIN  COMMISSION ENERGY AND  CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND OFTEN  REQUIRED TARGETED ANNUAL GROWTH  ENERGY SAVINGS IN THIS PROGRAM. THERE IS A LOCAL TAX AND THEIR  THE MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT  THAT IS INSTALLED, THAT IS  GROUNDS OVERWEIGHT PARKING LOT  FOR THAT AS PART OF COMMUNITY  SOLAR PROJECT AND SERVICES 651  PERCENT OF THE OUTCOME FOR LOW  OR MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION THERE IS A  COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENT  OBJECTIVES AND SUSTAINABILITY. THEY ARE LOOKING AT A  METHODOLOGY TO IDENTIFY  COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY  AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND  WE HAVE TO GET TO A REPORT ON  THAT AT THE END OF 2022.IT  SETS UP A WORKING GROUP TO  TRANSITION EMPLOYMENT AND  TRAINING HERE THIS IS GOING TO  BE CREATED. [ INAUDIBLE ] IN THE COUNTER  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO JOBS  THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE  TRANSITION AS WELL THEY HAVE TO  REPORT BY 2022. AND THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR  MONEY FROM DIFFERENT AREAS. IT IS JUST STRATEGIC ENERGY  INVESTMENT FUNDS. CHESAPEAKE BAY AND ATLANTA  BASED TRUST FUND AND THEN THE  TRANSPORTATION TRUST FUND. AND SO LIKE I SAID, THAT BILL  HAS MOVED OVER TO THE HOUSE. AND IT IS EXPECTED THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU AMY. THAT IS TERRIFIC. CLIMATES ON THE SOLUTIONS NOW  ACT? OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE  BODY FOR OUR TEAM? >> DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT  THE BUDGET ALL REAL QUICKLY? >> PLEASE. >> THE OPERATING BUDGET IS  ACROSS THE WAY. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL NOT BE  CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THE STATE  IS LITERALLY TURNING IN MONEY. AND SO EVERYTHING THAT WAS BAD. THINGS LIKE THE FORMULA WAS  GOING TO BE REDUCED. WE WERE GOING TO PICK UP THE  TAB AGAIN FROM THE STATE  DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENTS AND  TAX UNIT INDEPENDENT COLLEGES  AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN  REVERSED. THE STATE DID WELL.THEY HAVE  NEW REVENUE ESTIMATES, WE HAVE  MITIGATED. THIS IS JUST THE STATE BUDGET  20 BILL IN IT AND SO WHEN YOU  TALK ABOUT NUMBERS IT IS A VERY  BIG BUDGET. BUT THEY HAD REVENUE RIGHT UP. THEY HAD 3.9 MILLION AND HR 123  MONEY IN DECEMBER. THINGS JUST STARTED TO COME UP  ROSES FOR THEM FOR IT AND AS A  RESULT THEY ARE ABLE TO LEAVE  ABOVE WHAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO  DO BY THE GROUP. REQUESTED BY THE BOND RATING  AGENCIES THEY FIND OUT SIX  PERCENT RESERVES. THEY HAVE BASICALLY ELIMINATED  THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT FOR  SEVERAL YEARS. THIS IS LIKE UNHEARD OF. BECAUSE ALMOST ALL PUBLIC  SECTOR ENTITIES CARRY  STRUCTURAL DEFICIT.AND THEY  ARE LEAVING A LOT OF CASH. THERE'S A LOT OF RISK OUT  THERE. AS YOU KNOW. YOU'RE ABOUT TO WORK ON YOUR  BUDGET. BUT THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR THEM. THE HOUSE PUT TOGETHER THEIR  CAPITAL BUDGET. I WANTED TO RUN THROUGH THINGS  GOOD FOR THE COUNTY FOR THE  HOUSE PUT INTO MILLION DOLLARS  FOR PARKS AND TRAILS THAT WILL  BE FLEXIBLE MONEY TO SPEND. THEY ADDED FIVE AND HALF  MILLION FOR THE HR RC FOR THE  BUBBLE MIDDLE SCHOOL  CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. AS MENTIONED THE MONTGOMERY  COUNTY COLLEGE THAT WAS  UNDERFUNDED WAS FAIRLY EASY TO  RESOLVE AND IT HAS BEEN  RESOLVED WITH AN ADDITIONAL  AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MAKE THAT  PROJECT WILL PARIS THERE ARE 5  1/2 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A  GARAGE. THERE WAS ANOTHER 400,000 ADDED  TO THE ONE PROJECT THAT MAYBE  YOU KNOW MORE THAN I DO. AND THEN YOU THE LOCAL BOND  INITIATIVE SHEET AND THAT IS  3.2 BILLION. SO GOOD NEWS THERE AND WE WILL  SEE WHAT THE SENATE DOES. BUT AGAIN, MY GUESS IS A LOT OF  THAT STUFF HOLDS. AND THAT IS THE STORY. >> HOW MUCH IS MONTGOMERY  COUNTY? >> THAT IS ALL MONTGOMERY. IS A 3.2 MILLION PROJECT COMING  OUT OF THE HOUSE TO THE BENEFIT  OF MONTGOMERY. >> 3.2 MILLION. >> CORRECT. >> YOU SAID BILLION. >> IF I DID, I APOLOGIZE. OTHERWISE WE WOULD CELEBRATE  RIGHT NOW. BUT NO, IT IS 2.2 MILLION. >> OKAY. COLLEAGUES, AND QUESTIONS ON  THE BUDGET? >> WE COULD BE LIKE OPRAH USED  TO BE. YOU GET A SCHOOL, YOU GET A  PARK. >> YOU GET YOUR HOUSE REBUILT! >> I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU SUFFICIENTLY  EDUCATED EVERYBODY.>> LET ME  SAY THIS IS A REALLY BUSY TIME. FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT DIRECTLY  TO US UNTO YOUR STAFF AND WE  ARE WILLING TO TELL YOU  ANYTHING OR ANSWER ANY  QUESTIONS. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU WHILE. >> THANKS EVERYON", "bIF8cFYQrpo": "[Music] which activities and assignments matter most or least our data scientists constantly evaluate assignments in their correlation to actual bar passage everything assigned during your barbary course is correlated to success on the bar exam", "a4MlNSVWbD4": "hi everybody Shawna carp Ellis here with CA bar-style I wanted to explain why you might need to purchase either one or multiple si approaches that are now for sale on our shop page of our website at CA our style comm so why might you need an approach to the essay portion so the si approaches are obviously geared towards the essay portion of the California Bar Exam and it is a major part of the CA bar style program and course I'm known for them I've been teaching them now this will be my 20th bar in july 2019 and they are all my own I developed them many many years ago over 10 years ago and what they are the approach is obviously there's written approach where I teach applicants every single possible way that a given categorical area of law is tested so there's a very big difference between just learning law let's think of an area like homicide where the California Bar will test an area of homicide in six to seven different ways meaning different types of fact patterns different types of calls of question and it is fundamental that you know going in not only to your practice but also to the exam every possible way that that area is tested now what does that mean that means that you know what the different cause of questions look like given those cause of questions and fact patterns what issues will always need to be discussed what issues will only sometimes need to be discussed and considered still within the gamut of your checklist and universe universe excuse me for that area of law also part of approach is knowing what your rule statements look like so we're going through the iraq and knowing what issues will always be a minor issue or you'll quickly get in and out so timing is a consideration and major issues where you will stop and give more of an analysis and possibly a counter-argument so there are a lot of commercial approaches online you can buy them off Amazon or maybe other resources but mine are really spectacular I mean there's nothing like them on the market they are very thorough and they're based on the last 25 to 30 years of the exam so nothing in my teachings really misses what could possibly come up in that area so if you're dealing with a voluminous amount of WOD let's say you're in a commercial bar prep and you're going from law and tons of law ok I know because I took one of those when I took the exam and started developing si bar style you can read more about how to my bio if you're interested but when you're going through a lot of law and you don't stop and go to now ok how is this law tested and not only how is it a test how is it tested on the essay portion but how is the law applied because remember that the standard is lawyerly and you need to know how to write for these areas of law so a lot of repeaters will bring me blue books from they're not passing essays and we will see structural issues a lot of issues missed which is the number one reason that you'll not pass an essay and analysis that is not either where it needs to be it might be storytelling it might be way too to the point conclusory and not giving the examiners what they're looking for so you're not maximizing your points and you're missing an abundance of points and you really want to avoid that so if you're not looking for a big course you've done the course and you don't you know you've done a course maybe somewhere else so you don't have the budget for another full course where you get tutoring and grading and all the other services that a package may entail but you are curious and you do know yourself and need to know how to write for these areas or if you're a repeater and you're missing tons of points if you're scoring 55 and 60s on essay you definitely want to take a look at my approaches you can purchase just an individual subject you can purchase the entire bundle of all of the approaches that I offer and they will definitely bring you a significant amount of clarity as to not only how to write for the areas but where to spend your time and areas that you wouldn't even know to discuss in a giving categorical area of law I'll give you another example um a number of bars ago they tested injunctions so obviously you're in red towards remedies and you had to discuss the three different types of injunctions temporary restraining order II order preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction now a lot of applicants that had to repeat that exam came to me with their blue book and said I don't get it I discussed the three types of injunctions why did I not pass the essay and you didn't pass the essay because maybe you missed the equitable defenses now in my injunctions approach I will tell you that not only what the elements will be for each type of injunction and when to go into all three or maybe just one or more but also that you'll always go into the equitable defenses that's got to be on your radar and within your checklist in that area so it is fundamental approach doesn't just mean it's fundamental to understand that approach is not just a cookie cutter little checklist you can buy online where someone just knows the elements to the cause of action and has mapped it out for you but California is so particular in the way that they test these areas you've got to know the entire testable issues in a given categorical area of law and when to go into them and when to not or else you can give them just a you know what your idea is of the law or what the cause of action is but if you don't really give them the full enchilada everything they're looking for you're going to miss points and it means a lot of different things so you know if you have questions on you know what these approaches are more about please feel free to contact me now there are a lot of little examples that I've given YouTube of me teaching the approaches and I know a lot of followers have signed up with me because they've been following me over the years and I'm so flattered and humbled that people obviously love these things and they've helped so many of my applicants passed the exam because a lot of people struggle with the essays and it can be overwhelming the amount of love but the good news is that if you have approach and strategy and structure and you learn from someone like me who really knows what to give them and what to expect you can cut a lot of corners and stop wasting time focusing in on areas that are not even tested especially on the essay portion because there is an abundance of repetition in the way they test these areas now the approaches for those of you who may be asking are definitely always part of the CFR style program and offered in every single package that we have thank you for watching and I wish you a great day", "eVN3oVys3cs": "In this video we\u2019ll show you how to install\nbase cabinets. If you haven\u2019t already watched the measure\nand prep video, do that first. And remember - if you plan on installing a\nfloating floor as part of your kitchen project, the cabinets go in first but must be raised\nto a height just above the flooring. Otherwise you might have trouble installing\nunder countertop appliances. You can cut plywood strips that are the thickness\nof the floor and underlayment. Here\u2019s a trick. Before you screw down the strips, level them\nwith shims. This will make the install much easier. It\u2019s also easier if you remove the doors\nand drawers. Then just like installing the wall cabinets,\nstart at a corner. Use the guides on the walls to transfer the\nstud locations to the cabinets, accounting for the face frame. Drill the holes, and set the corner cab in\nplace. The horizontal line is your main guide. Line up the top\u2014shim underneath the base\nand at the back to get it level and plumb. If the wall is extremely bowed, shims can\nhelp keep the cabinet square and fill the space between the base and wall. When it looks good, drive in the screws at\nthe back\u2014just enough to hold it for now. You\u2019ll tighten them later. For the next cabinet, drill the pilot holes\nthrough the back, and position the cabinet next to the first. Even up the faces\u2014 shimming where needed\u2014and\nclamp the faces together. Drive screws in the back just to hold it for\nnow. Next, drill pilot holes with a countersink/taper\nbit through the face frames, and connect the cabinets with #8 screws. And that\u2019s the gist of it. Here\u2019s a tip if your wall is bowed. Glue shims over the stud lines where you\u2019ll\nsecure the mounting screws. This will prevent the cabinet backs from bowing\nwhen you drive in the screws. To even up the cabinet tops near the wall,\nyou\u2019ll need to shim under the cabinet base against the wall. You can use the shim under the adjacent cabinet\nas a guide. When you cut that shim, cut another for the\nnext cabinet and leave it in place. Where you have plumbing or gas, cut the holes\nin the back and install like the rest. Continue installing the cabinets but don\u2019t\ntighten the rear screws yet. Remember to keep the faces even and the tops\nlined up with your reference line. All right, so what about that space at the\nend? Easy fix with a filler strip. Mark and cut the filler strip. For uneven walls, clamp the filler piece to\nthe frame, use a compass to scribe a line following the contours of the wall. And it helps to cut at a 7- to 10-degree bevel\nto help fit the piece against the wall. Mark the width of the piece, and cut the cabinet\nside. Use a plane for minor adjustments. Place the piece, drill holes through the frame,\nand attach with screws. Once you have all of the cabinets in, tighten\nthe rear screws and remove the clamps. Any places where you don\u2019t have a cabinet\nframe to support the countertop, like end walls and corners, attach 1x2s with screws. After your cabinets are secured, cut toekicks\nto fit and attach with finish nails. For floating floors do this after they\u2019re\ninstalled. Don\u2019t add the doors and drawers just yet. You still have to attach the countertops. Want more great ideas and how-to\u2019s? Go to Lowes.com/HowTo or just click to subscribe.

people who otherwise would not have a lawyer because they can't afford one to have representation and have their legal problems resolved there's really no program like it in the country that kind of collaboration partnership to help fill the Justice gap having all of us together working for justice makes us accomplish so much more and also I think models the right approach to really making change the program is existed for a little over five years now and it served over 3,000 clients who otherwise would not have had access to legal services and over 300 students across the three law schools have been able to participate it really has opened up the dialogue around how many people do have need one of the things that's been so gratifying is that the ability for our law students to volunteer maybe for only an hour or two during their day and really talk with someone who was going through a tremendously person a difficult time and having students walk out shaken up for the first time I needing to go to class the first time that someone's told them they've been abused oftentimes it's the students first opportunity to kind of hold that sacred trust that attorneys do when someone tells you the most personal details of their lives and felt that responsibility that attorneys carry and that's not me impactful thing that's going on every day here at the school the experience has inspired me quite a bit where I came into law school not knowing really what I wanted to do but then with working with my remains program I now know that I want to do public service and if I'm not able to do public service work I'd like to work at a private firm work and then continue to volunteer with the moderate means program as a participating attorney with the moderate means program have really benefited from it as being kind of mentor mentee relationship that I've developed with the attorneys that work with the program they always are available to answer questions if I have any and they also are quick to offer you know solutions to different problems that I might be having with working with a client for a lot of new lawyers young lawyers looking to start their practice this is a great way to get and build clients and build their practice and build their experience if you're an attorney and you're watching this and you want to get some experience and family law you should sign up for our program because we'll be able to get you some clients they're certainly our communities in Central and Eastern Washington where you're in desperate need of attorneys to continue to take these cases thank you so much to the Washington State Bar Association and the foundation for giving this a war to the moderate means program the Sally savage award means a lot to I'm sure all three

So, if you're watching this\nvideo, chances are you are in your last year of law school and you're getting\nready to take the bar exam. And I am here today to show you guys my bar prep\nexperience using the BARBRI bar preparation course. And I'm going to take\nyou through everything from the minute I receive my books to exactly how\neverything went. How I studied, what materials I used. I hope that this helps\nyou make an informed decision because a bar prep course is definitely something\nyou want to be comfortable with and you want to make sure that it suits your\nlifestyle, so I'm going to share with you guys why I chose BARBRI. I really love\nthe Early Start interface. It's very clean, very simple, easy to use ... and so\nwhat it does is, it gives you a set of questions that you answer. And it's great\nbecause, if you don't remember, you don't necessarily have to guess. You can\ndefinitely choose \"I don't know\" and then, in the end, it'll show you what the\ncorrect answer was and give you a full thought-out explanation as to why it's\ncorrect. And I really like it, as well, because if you think you know the answer\nbut you're not 100% sure, you can choose more than one, and it really kind of\nhelps to ingrain the information in your head. It tells you why the\none that you thought was correct was wrong and it tells you why the one\nthat's correct is correct. So it sounds pretty straightforward and it definitely\nis, but it's such an engaging and such a very useful tool that it really helped\nme to grasp a lot of things prior to starting bar prep, so once I've actually\nstarted bar prep in May, it was a little bit of a breeze at first because\nI had already reviewed everything during Early Start. So the first reason why I\nchose BARBRI is obviously because they have such convenient study methods. You\ncan do all your course work at home, in the library, in a cafe, wherever you'd\nlike. But it also gives you the option to actually go in to a physical class\nsession and get a live lecture. If you find that you really don't like a\nclassroom setting and you prefer to study by yourself from home, it's great\nbecause the same exact course lecture that you get online is the exact lecture\nthat you're going to get in the live classroom sessions. So there's virtually\nno way that you'll be missing out on any material. The BARBRI Mobile App \noffers everything from lectures to lessons to written outlines and\nthen my favorite are the sessions where you can do practice questions. And the\ngreat thing is that you can also time yourself. You can do a 30-minute pace\nprogram where you do a series of questions within a 30-minute time span\nand it'll also show you on average how many you've gotten correct and then\nit'll show you the average amount of time that you took on each question,\nwhich is absolutely critical when you're studying for the bar. So before beginning your bar prep course,\nyou will receive a large box from BARBRI with all of your BARBRI\nworkbooks. So it's a pretty heavy set of books. You have your MBE practice\nquestions workbook. You have your Multistate Performance Test workbook,\nConviser Mini Review for Illinois, outlines for Illinois, and then your\nSimulated MBE workbook and scantron. So studying usually happens about six days\na week for me. I like to choose different locations. I usually go to the library\nbut I like to switch up where I sit. So I normally just bring a couple of my\nBARBRI books that I'm going to focus on that day and, of course, my laptop so\nthat I can log into my PSP and see what I have to do for the day. So this is the\nPSP home screen. It's great because it always provides you with an\ninspirational quote to start your day. And then, once you actually log in, you\nget to see all of the things that are labeled as to-do for the day ahead. So I\nstart every day with the substantive lectures. And this one that I'm going to\nbe completing today is the Secured Transactions lecture. I like it because\nit also divides the lectures into chapters, so whenever I want to go back\nand review a specific lecture I can find the specific subtopic within the lecture\nreally quickly. The online lectures go hand-in-hand with the lecture handout\nbook that you're going to receive from BARBRI. And so you'll get the same exact\nlecture online as you would in person. Personally, my favorite lecturer was\nProfessor David Epstein. He teaches Contracts and Sales, and I really\nappreciated how easily he broke down all of the lecture and he just made\nContracts so easy to learn and actually kind of fun. Another great feature BARBRI offers is Essay Architect. This feature is critical\nbecause it shows you how to best structure your essays prior to actually\ntaking pen to paper and writing it down. Essay Architect really helped me to get\nused to the best structure to write my essays and identify relevant facts. This\nallowed me to feel more confident and comfortable submitting my essays for grading. BARBRI offers multiple opportunities to\nsubmit essays for grading and I highly recommend you utilize each and every one\nof those opportunities because it will only help you to hone in on your\nstrengths and weaknesses. I definitely recommend BARBRI's Private Tutoring\nsessions. I took three during my bar prep course and I really thought they were\nextremely helpful. Emily, my tutor (hi, Emily, if you're watching!), she was so\ngreat and she was just so supportive. So Emily would assign essays for me to do\nbased off of the different subjects that I wasn't exactly hitting at the moment. \nSo, for example, she'd give me a Corporations essay. She'd give me a\nIncome Tax essay. She'd give me a Torts essay. What I loved about this was that\nshe actually scores my essays the way a our examiner would score them. She really\ngave me a lot of tips and tricks that I definitely utilized during the bar exam.\nNext up is the Simulated MBE experience, which occurs just weeks before the\nactual bar examination. So I took the Simulated MBE at Chicago-Kent Law \nSchool in Chicago, Illinois, and I took it in a large auditorium. And what you're\ngoing to utilize during this exam is your Simulated MBE workbook that you're\nprovided with at the beginning of your bar prep course. So you're going to make\nsure you bring that workbook with you to the exam and this is going to be the\nmorning and afternoon workbook. And basically what you do is you get timed\nexactly as you would during the bar exam and once you're done, you can either turn\nin your scantron and mail it or you can go ahead and implement your answers into\nthe online database to get an immediate result. So when you get your results, it's\ngoing to look something like this. It's going to show you where you ranked among\nall the other BARBRI students. And it's going to show you each subject area and\nyour percentile ranking. So this is a great indicator of where you're strong\nand where you're weak and where you should continue to study before the exam.\nAlright so it's bar exam day. It is six in the morning. I'm getting ready to\ngo to the facility where we're going to take the test. I don't know how to feel\nright now but I feel like I did everything that I could and I utilized\nthe BARBRI program pretty well. It held me accountable and, you know, there's\ngonna be law that I don't know. I know that going in, so just got a \ndo what I gotta do. Try to keep the nerves down.

((MIMI)) LOCAL HEALTH", "LCTdVd4BEwI": "we like to first of all thank you for coming good afternoon and i am mike gaston the co-chair for the a bee staff diversity council here in chicago and i like to just take the time thank you for taking the time of your schedules today to join us we particularly like to thank our president and decline executive director Jack rise and I associate executive director and human resources chief human resources officer Valyria Stokes for joining us as well last Friday was Veterans Day November 11 this day under those persons who served in the United States Armed Forces at this time for those veterans who are present with us we'd like to ask you to stand for those folks on the DC staff and Chicago staff would you please stand if you are veteran thank you for your service some confused veterans day with memorials day however Memorial Day is celebrated in May and it actually honors those who died while in military service they made the ultimate sacrifice too many veterans too many veterans returned from active duty to confront urgent legal issues including evictions child custody issues and disputes wrongful denials and credit complications and according to the study by the US Department of Veterans Affairs legal expertise is needed to solve at least half of the top 10 problems that lead to veterans homelessness today President client was share with us her plans to help veterans through the legal services initiative Jason veiled and Mary Mix nur our legal services staff personnel right here in Chicago will also share with us the ABS pro bono project and other programs that the ABA has in place to assist veterans next I would like to just introduce Valyria Stokes our associate executive director and chief human resources officer thank you and I have thought Michael because Michael is one of our veterans as well and we are very proud to be able to host this program and what's most important is that we have a very strong commitment to veterans and in fact I don't know whether holly is there in DC but i do want to think Holly cook because she has attended and represented the ABA on Veterans recruiting programs in the DC area we have a strong commitment to the hiring of veterans and to that end I would like to introduce our number one veteran our executive director and chief operating officer Jack Reeves well thank you I good afternoon we see an empty podium NDC on our camera here earlier we saw present yeah you're not just empty suit okay but we don't know who all is there my point was going to be here in Chicago we've got a full room and I hope there's good attendance in DC as well so I do want to thank everyone who's participating today to recognize the veterans I would point out that Mike gasps and who of course we know as one of our paralegals in the lead paralegal in the Office of General Counsel here at the ABA did have a history before he came here Mike served 28 years in the United States Air Force most at that time as a paralegal in the Judge Advocate General's Corps and he retired as a senior master sergeant which is one of the very highest enlisted great so Mike I know is very proud of his service and we're proud to have him on staff and the service he did with the Air Force certainly prepared him well for us [Applause] the main reason we're gathered here today is to learn more about the ABA veterans legal services initiative which will show us how lawyers really do make a difference I know that from my prior service in the military where there was a lot the military legal community could do both active duty military attorneys and paralegals and the civilians who supported the active duty as well as the reserve components which is both the reserve and the guard but most importantly what I recognized when I was in the military before were the limits on what the active-duty military could do especially for veterans even the veterans who had disabilities there's a limit to what the active duty forces can do but there's hardly any limit especially in the legal area to what the veterans can do and what the volunteer leaders can do the American Bar Association for a long time has had a large group of people who are pro bono volunteers and that represents the very best of pro bono service when I was active duty and since I've been here I've seen a very large number of attorneys who are willing to do things to help the veterans and to help those who serve in that regard I would point out that the current issue of the ABA journal the November issue has a signature piece from our president and it's entitled serving those who served and it really is a well-written article that gives an anecdote of how lawyers help one lady in particular but it's the larger group that were able to help our program today will have presentations as Mike said from Jason who's been with us for eight and a half years and has worked with the legal assistance project with the military throughout that time and also Mary who's been directing the APA's military pro bono project for about six years now my real purpose today is to introduce the president the American Bar Association she needs little introduction to our group of staff leaders but Linda Klein 20 years ago became the first woman to be President of the state bar of georgia in 2004 she received one of the high awards you can receive from the American Bar Association when she received the Margaret Brent won't of distinction award from the american bar association from 2010 2 2012 linda served as the chair of our house of delegates and i need to let people know that linda has a busy schedule we're delighted she made the time to open the session today following this she has an appointment at the Department of Veterans Affairs so she won't be able to stay for the entire program that we have today but it's my privilege to introduce the president of the American Bar Association when declined an afternoon Chicago you hear me yes sure I was asking the people in the room here in Washington because someone in the back might want to change spaces with someone in the front were more importantly vice versa that once happened to me I said can anybody hear me and somebody in the front offered to change places with somebody into that but uh but thank you so very much for inviting me to speak at this very special celebration and and thank you jack those of you don't know jack is from East Polk County Georgia so and he knows how important that is to the fje when I say that so I truly appreciate Jax Jax warm welcome to but you know the real praise and thanks should go to the Chicago staff diversity Council and all those who've been involved in helping to bring this successful and necessary program to the American Bar Association so before I begin my remarks I want to recognize the staff whose time and commitment to this program and this issue made this day possible and that of course includes two speakers who are going to follow Jason who you already know especially those of you in Chicago the senior attorney and chief counsel for the Standing Committee on legal assistance to military personnel of course Mary Meixner the director of the military pro bono project I had this idea that we would get the APA more involved in helping veterans and candidly I barely knew Jason and Mary and they have warmly welcomed me into the community and have done so many things things I couldn't even imagine to try to make this dream of helping more veterans a reality and I thank them so very much I also want to recognize him goldsmith from the government affairs office who will be joining me at our meeting later today in the General Counsel's office of the VA as we talk about some things that we can do here Amy hort Newell is here in Washington with us at the director of the coordinating committee on veterans benefits and services maybe Cheryl zalenski is is out there somewhere the director of the ABA Center for pro bono Cheryl thank you for doing such a wonderful job organizing the National pro bono celebration this year and then we've already seen her stand up holly cook our associate executive director of DC operations a veteran and a key resource to the veterans legal services initiative I thank you so very much and maybe Jackie Casey's out there in chicagoland thank you the director of the fje for all the help you've given as we try to raise money to make the veterans legal services initiative a permanent part of what we do here at the ABA and thank you to each and every one of you for your dedication excellence in service to the ABA you guys make all of us look so good every day and I can't thank you enough but just as important your excellence in service to our nation's nearly 22 million veterans so this program is a testament not only to the sacrifices and contributions of our veterans but also to the ABA s focus on making a positive difference in the lives of veterans who need our help after they've done so much for us that includes the 1.4 million veterans who live below the poverty line and another 1.4 million veterans who live just above the poverty line according to some government estimates there are about forty thousand veterans in the United it's that are homeless and women veterans will account for only ten percent of all veterans are the fastest growing homeless population in America like many Americans many veterans don't recognize that the problems that they face our legal problems issues that only lawyers can help them resolve you've heard earlier mentions of what some of the problems are like employment and family matters and evictions and wrongful denial of benefits and unfortunately involved in the criminal justice system that often results from homelessness in fact according to a study by the vet Department of Veterans Affairs legal expertise is needed to solve at least half of the top 10 problems that leave veterans to homelessness the lawyers can do so much to transform the lives of veterans for example out there in Illinois there was a Gulf War veteran who suffered from an aneurysm while on active duty and was medically discharged but he was only awarded seventy percent in disability despite being absolutely unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities but a lawyer a volunteer lawyer was able to help them obtain a hundred percent disability and got him several thousand dollars back pay and made all the difference in the world for this veteran can be able to live there was a 92 year old a world war two veteran who fought in the Battle of Norman and saw an increase in his seventy percent disability pay for his service connected PTSD because he was unable to work and a lawyer was able to obtain a hundred percent disability pay for him and now he receives a blue less than three thousand dollars a month that was almost double what he previously received and he was also awarded back pay and these additional amounts make all the difference to this veteran who was struggling very much financially lawyers assistance can help families of our nation's heroes there was a Vietnam veteran who died of heart disease it was related to Agent Orange and a lawyer represented the widow of this Vietnam veteran and was able to get 70 five hundred dollars in bad paper and that makes such a difference for people who are struggling so Miley the make ends meet good day now here at the ABA we've got a proud history of working on behalf of our military i'd like to tell you a little bit about our veterans legal service initiative that we started this year it's a multi-prong holistic effort led by a distinguished 20-member commission that's headed by & orezi who's a retired three-star vice admiral and many of you probably know our other co-chair Dwight Smith who is an attorney who held several viewership roles in the 8k of course we have Jason and Mary and can Jackie and Colin and so sherilyn PB and so many other people have defended already as part of the initiative we extended our traditional October pro bono celebration to improve Veterans Day this year and lawyers across the country stepped up in Ohio the great greater volunteer lawyers project from date legal aid of western Ohio operation legal help Ohio all join 220 wills for heroes where veterans were able to get free wills and estate planning documents here in Washington DC the Veterans Club consortium pro bono program the Dwayne Mars law firm held three provo he'll pop up clinics for veterans and they assist the family law issues landlord tenant issues consumer law join them all veterans benefits military discharge upgrade and it just goes on not Nevada Nevada legal services corporation yeah young lawyers of Nevada they held project salute where they assisted veterans with issues regarding benefits and thanks to the work of the veterans legal services initiative we're going to build a comprehensive online resource it's going to perform veterans and their caregivers and their families about legal issues that could affect them it's also going to direct them to relevant local resources and legal providers for help the Commission is also mobilizing to expand legal services for veterans in any areas to include starting legal clinics or medical legal partnerships at every VA Medical Center country we know that when we add a lawyer to a team to the medical team that the utilization of VA Medical hospitals goes down considerably sometimes as much as forty percent why because a lawyer solves the underlying problem that brings the veteran to the to the medical facility like homelessness we're also going to be setting up a comprehensive database that will be the first national and central resource allocated to provide pro bono legal service referrals for veterans so a problem so a veteran comes to see me in Georgia often they were Floyd out of Virginia or Illinois and I'm not since to practice there's way need to find other lawyers to help it right now the best week it was using social media and that's just not good enough to help author whose will also be promoting legal checkups for veterans and families caregivers help them identify those problems I mentioned that they don't know that our legal problems that can help solve liquid systems our veterans initiative is also going to engage with law schools and our associations to quote legal services incubators I got to visit one in Atlanta on well I guess it was on Election Day and the young lawyers that are there are very very anxious to go homework help our veterans these are ways to offer legal services to veterans while providing valuable training to these and employers in addition we're promoting veteran treatment courts in a possible expansion from just the criminal side to the civil side so that we can solve all of the veterans problems right period at once we're also going to address the needs of female veterans and become homeless veterans and explore why that population is growing so fast we're looking into extending a successful pilot program that involved the ABA s veterans claims distance network you know it is weak and the Department of Veteran Affairs and this program provided pro bono helped veterans whose benefit claims were caught that massive backlog earth out and help reduce at that on consider we're raising money to try to keep that program going right now finally we're going to be participating in more veteran specific pro bono activities around 40 vague another opportunity for lawyers and legal experts and all students all over the country to participate hundreds more volunteer events for citizens and veterans up to still to its essence many veterans legal problems are fundamentally access to justice missions that shows are just a microcosm of the population that's too or to pay for legal services at eighty percent of poor and oddest income people lack access to services it half of boats who qualify turned away the APA's extensive effort to deliver justice stretches across our organization across our country and across the globe now here at home for example the APA Commission on integration directs our efforts to ensure fair treatment and due process rights for immigrants of asylum seekers with the west and our advocacy for the Legal Services Corporation helps ensure that nearly 1.9 million Americans the crew it provides services annually including any any veterans and active service personnel have access to justice that all of our kids deserve on the international front ABA programs advance human rights and justice our Center for Human Rights headed by Michael Page here washington-lee za VA's efforts to address critical human rights issues around the mall and I'm proud to note that rolling the rule of law initiative also headed here by Betsy Anderson as for 25 years stood tall international stage of a half a day of Justice Economic Opportunity and humid didn't through the work law so there is a reason why we are one of the largest voluntary professional membership organizations people look to us leadership in the law we are effective and we work hard to ensure the Google all eyes and everyone thank you all for your wonderful work may be so proud and I hope you're filled with pride knowing the APA strengthening the foundation of the rule of law today everything I really appreciate you taking the time to bike in this very special program and I know you're going to enjoy the rest of it thank you very much president car did you find fake bank even on behalf of all veterans we appreciate the initiatives that are under being undertaken on behalf of veterans all around this country thank you very much now we'd like to welcome Jason and Mary up to talk to us a little bit more about the programs that are currently available to veterans through the ABA all right well thank you very much and it's great to see such as such a great turnout I'm Jason Vale I'm counsel to the Standing Committee on legal assistance for military personnel and on behalf of Mary and I we want to thank the staff diversity Council for inviting us to do this you know Mary and I sort of toil away in our tiny little corner of the legal services division on a day-to-day basis and and it's so great to have an opportunity to get out and talk about the work that we do and the things that we get to see on a daily basis because thanks in part to president Klein's initiative the issues that we've really grown to care about access to justice for those who are serving for their families for the caregivers of our veterans is it is an issue we're very passionate about and to be able to to tell you a little bit about what we get to do is a great opportunity for us so I wanted to start before turning it over to Mary to talk about our signature initiative the military pro bono project just to tell you a bit about the Standing Committee the the lamp committee has been around since World War two in in some fashion or another and has historically been focused on supporting the delivery of legal services to those who are in active duty service so so we have worked with Jags and civilian lawyers who work for the Department of Defense to support them in their delivery of legal services over over the years and in the course of the past 15 years what we have seen is a dramatic increase in the demand for these kinds of services mobilizations extended deployments separations and all kinds of things that have gone on during this period of wartime have have led to our military families having an increased need for civil legal services and so the lamb committee has really seen its workload grow over that time period and now what we've seen in recent years having focused on services to active duty now what we are learning is and seeing is that that the legal problems don't end once the military services that there are legal issues that carry on past the transition out of active duty service and so things like returning to work and and having to have disabilities accommodated dealing with the VA all kinds of issues that are tied to the military service but that carry over into civilian life continue to be issues of concern of us and so so we have really expanded our work and expanded our focus and and having the the kind of raised awareness about these issues that President client has been able to provide through this initiative has been than just tremendous for us so one of our main projects which has been in response to the increased need for civil legal services for military families is the military pro bono project we started this project back in two thousand eight and in a nutshell what it is is a national network of pro bono lawyers that provide all manner of civil legal representation to generally junior enlisted military personnel and Mary is our director of this program and I will turn it over to her to tell you more about what we do okay great great okay again Mary mikester thanks for the good introduction and I'm so happy to see so many people here and while we talk about this to please consider how your sections or divisions your members could potentially get involved with us whether the Attorney involvement publicity within your section division or otherwise keep that in mind while we're talking about this stuff um so I'm just going to briefly talk about the military pro bono project i think as Jason mentioned we've been running this since 2008 and what's special about this program is that is a good coordination between all five branches of the military and civilian attorneys so it's an opportunity for military legal assistance attorneys jags to get help for themselves but also for their clients and with that it's a volunteer opportunity for civilian attorneys ABA members and other organizations so we are a website based program on military pro bono org and this is where both military legal assistance attorneys and volunteer attorneys can sign up to participate and help so this is how our program works on our website we accept case referrals directly from military legal assistance attorneys jags on behalf of active-duty service members junior enlisted pay grades e6 and below who are facing civil legal issues and we accept cases from all again all military branches Army Navy Air Force Marine course and a Coast Guard and they again they simply go to our website fill out a referral form after these cases are submitted screened and approved we place these cases with volunteer attorneys anywhere in the United States where it's needed so again we can accept these cases worldwide so a person in Afghanistan has an issue in Chicago go to our website and we'll work to get that that service member the help that they need in the United States we accept case referrals in a variety of different legal areas as you can see here family law issues creditor and consumer law issues landlord tenant issues etc we do have a very high demand for a family law cases so we do have some standards of what kind of family law cases that we take so we can help those who really need the help the most so let me just give you a quick example of a recent case that we closed out so you can get an idea of how we work and how we're helping keeping in mind that we are an active program here helping individuals so we recently had a young army service member and he was transferred to a station in Europe and when he did that he left his beloved car he was a young guy I love this car he left his beloved car with a mechanic friend us we could store it there while he was in new Europe however his mechanic friend was later evicted from the business property and all the cars on his lot were towed the soldier the soldier contacted the towing company after he found this out to tell him that he was active duty and he was stationed overseas however the towing company was not sympathetic about this and said that he needed to remove his vehicle and pay all the fees or also was going to be sold auction this service member informed the towing company of his rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act the scra that protects this type of action from happening but again this towing company didn't listen to him two days later they sold his car at an auction without a court order which is against the F survey so this individual visited a jagged military legal assistance attorney in Europe who referred his case on our website and and we found this individual a volunteer attorney this case was in Washington State we found the volunteer attorney in Washington State to to take care of this matter this attorney filed a complaint in federal court Domanick damages from the towing company the towing company obtain counsel and their attorneys soon wanted to make a settlement for this case as you can imagine and with this attorneys help as volunteer attorneys help this individual made animate a settlement that that made everything hold for the client and as an example this success happened with this volunteer attorney dedicating a total of about 35 hours over sometime of pro bono help with a value of about ten thousand dollars so this is an example of how how efficient this is and how great it can be from someone in europe's to get a pro bono attorney who can really solve their problem here in the united states and that said to get an idea of what we do we're a very small team here doing this here in chicago on the 19th floor but we're securing about 200 military members pro bono assistance for about 200 military members each year and based on the case closing information that we get from our volunteer attorneys just like described in that last case we're these 200 cases represent about a million dollars in donated billable hours each year for the cases that are referred to us since 2008 we've been placing about half of the cases that are referred to us some of these are screened out at the beginning or otherwise we simply can't find attorneys or otherwise but last year sixty-eight percent over two-thirds of the cases approved in the screening process were successfully connected with with volunteer attorneys so that is our program are our case referral and representation program we also have another arm to our program and this is called operation standby operations standby is an opportunity for volunteer attorneys to help with a small commitment because this provides attorney it gives the opportunity to provide attorney to attorney advice to military attorneys there are times military attorneys are often new attorneys or are dealing with cases with their with their clients that they might not be so familiar with with operations standby military attorneys can simply visit our website view our passwords secured list of volunteer attorneys signed up for this and they can call them up send them an email with a question substantive question Geographic a question with court or otherwise so in short our volunteer attorneys are on standby to receive these emails or calls that can help give advice to the military attorneys of course the objective of this is so they can then further help their their service member clients so this is another great opportunity we have about 700 or so attorneys scattered about throughout the United States who are registered with operations standby in the last fiscal year we found that these passwords secured documents with the contact information we're downloaded about a thousand times so this is a really great resource for for military attorneys for our Jags so that is the military pro bono program if you have any questions you can ask me now or just stop by the 19th floor give me a call or email and let me know if ya Mary is a wonderful programs and I know in addition to volunteer service is there any way to make a charitable contribution to support well of course there is and that's a great question because we are actually fully run on donations from which includes for example the section of litigation they have been critical to they were critical in our first two years they fully funded at us for our pilot program for the first two years and they have been donating a lesser amount but critical money each year along with the business law section public contract and others aside from that we need funding from outsiders we have received money from defense contractors other corporations and individuals but we are a year by year when it comes to finances so if you have ideas for this we are always running on a string with a with financing so if you have any ideas definitely let us know okay and before I turn this over to Jason he's going to talk about all of our ideas and initiatives moving forward to grow this for veterans and otherwise i do want to mention one website where hopefully we're going to were actually have plans to upgrade this and otherwise but it's a good source to know it's a BA home front org this has two resources it has educational materials for family law i'm sorry for military families but one thing that you might find helpful is it includes a directory of programs which is organized by state and provides contact information for local pro bono program lawyer referral programs and also depending on the state local military veteran program so also a good resource to know so you guys know Jason or switching I have no question I just want to make one observation for those of you don't know Jenna officers are admitted to practice in one state and then they're assigned all over the world as much as this helps the military personnel are getting direct pro bono assistance if you're a jet officer with your brand new or maybe you're good its practice in Maryland you're signed in Baghdad or Texas or whatever it is invaluable to have access to somebody in that state because you might know a lot about a state law you might know a lot about criminal law you don't know anything about that States law to be able to call another attorney that's there just to get some advice where you look what's the statute what do I need to know about this Court's practices this project is invaluable to those attorneys so I just wanted to come in and applaud it from a personal level that I saw when I was at Fort Hood and when I was in fact at my attorneys personally benefited and we can't thank you enough for it thank you well I never ever what do you go forward is a question here I'm sorry Mary ok the question Jason and married for the pro bono project does it cover criminal law I know for legal assistance within the military if somebody in the military is involved their criminal case that are really going to get a defense attorney within the military system and they'll be prosecuted or administrative actions within the military system but as far as cases that go out of the UCMJ how much does your services cover those areas of the local level Jason ordinary yet we are limited to civil legal issues so we do not bounce into the criminal area so right now civil legal issues thanks alright and I don't like to pass up an opportunity to really tout and emphasize the importance of the work that Mary does when she says we're a small team it's sort of an understatement it's really just marry she is the team and as I said she is she is funded solely from donations that we received both internally and externally from the ABA and has been that way ever since we started the project so to be able to turn around a million dollars plus a year in pro bono legal services based on this tiny little bit of money we received to do what we do is is really tremendous and and the story about the car is is kind of a funny story and it's a nice story but but the reality is a lot of the cases that we receive are you know quite a bit more serious the the fact is that over seventy percent of the case referrals we receive are for family law cases which can be as you can imagine fairly heavy to deal with and and the great paradox of this project is that because we are so limited in our staffing and our funding when it comes to family law which is the greatest need because we have such limited capacity we have to prioritize only the most significant in the most serious family law cases so so the the challenges we get these very difficult cases that we then have to find and convince lawyers all around the country to take at no at no cost to the client so so the 200-plus military families that get root referred every year I mean that's a considering seventy percent as per family law cases that can go on for years and involve I mean you've had cases that are thousands and thousands of hours of time that are donated by these lawyers I mean it's really so so when I say that you know we're always excited to talk about it it's very inspiring and heartwarming to us to see the kind of efforts that that our volunteers put out on behalf Terry families and they do it all around the country for sometimes for clients they never even meet in person and so it's really it's really a privilege for us to be able to do this work so I'll talk to us a bit more about a few other things that we do the lamp committee in addition to the military pro bono project the project because of the success that it's had has has really received a lot of very positive attention from all quarters from the National Military Family Association giving the ABA its supporting military families award in 2010 for this project two letters from the judge advocates general the head lawyers for each of the military services in fact president client just received a letter a couple weeks ago signed by all five of the judge advocates general two and three-star generals and admirals heads of all of the military service legal programs commending the a being for doing this work it's it's we are filling a gap that is not being filled by anyone else that's why we created the program there isn't any other service like ours and so because of that we and end up getting asked to do other things which is both great and challenging at the same time one of those projects is the veterans claims assistance Network as you have probably heard in the news there are a lot of challenges in the VA one of which has been in meeting the demand for delivery of veterans disability benefits and veterans getting their benefits in a timely fashion and so a few years ago the White House General Counsel's office approached our governmental affairs office with the question of what can be a VA and the nation's lawyers do to address this particular problem and they looked to the military pro bono project as an example of how we've been able to get civilian lawyers engaged in providing free legal services for active-duty families and the question was what can we do for for veterans for specifically for disability claims so as a part of that discussion with the White House and with the VA we developed a pilot project called the veterans claims assistance Network and it works very similar in fashion to the military pro bono project connecting veterans who need who are unrepresented and need help navigating the disability compensation system with the VA needing assistance to to get through that process and get their benefits and get them based on their application not after waiting three four or five years in appealing a denial of benefits so thanks to an Enterprise Fund grant that we received internally here at the ABA we were able to run a pilot in three regions around the country Chicago Roanoke Virginia in st. Petersburg Florida it ran for about nine months in terms of intake it was a little more than a year from start to finish about 3,300 unrepresented veterans were contacted about the availability of the program about ten percent responded and requested assistance through the project and we were ultimately able to connect about 150 with lawyers there were as a pilot there were a lot of challenges and the design of the system and the process it was very different working with the VA than working with the Department of Defense oddly enough the DoD is much easier to work with them the VA there were all kinds of interesting challenges to say the least but we were able to get over 150 veterans connected with lawyers who navigated them through the system and about two thirds ultimately receive their benefits upon application just a few statistics on on how the project worked in terms of the the process through the intake system and so on but this was a not just a great service to the veterans who needed the assistance but also to lawyers who maybe can't take a multi-year family law case for military or maybe they don't know anything about you know doing a child custody case or something like that we were able to train our volunteer lawyers on VA benefits matters we had a an online curriculum which they were able to take become certified by the VA to do v8 claims cases no matter what their practice background was and the average time commitment was only about 35 hours per case and the veterans received about ten thousand dollars in donated billable hours on average and ultimately of course then received their benefits which was the most important thing so since the closure of the pilot last year we have gone through the process with the VA of renegotiating the agreement that governs the program we now have a draft agreement ready to sign we're raising the money to to run the project and and we're very excited just this past Friday on Veterans Day bjones day law firm at all of its offices around the country held events concurrently to announce what will ultimately we believe as we are working through the process will be a partnership between the ABA and jones day to develop an online platform to connect veterans with pro bono legal services and we hope that a part of that is going to be the relaunch of the vkm project to continue the work that we're doing to get veterans their disability benefits so finally I'll just touch on the veterans legal services initiative president klein covered this in in pretty great detail so i'll just kind of run through this quickly because you heard about the things that the initiative is doing but as I say doing this work just puts us in the position of being asked to do more of this kind of work and so it has certainly been a privilege to be a part of the team that is executing this initiative during this presidential year but really with the hope and the intent that the initiative is going to continue well beyond the presidential year and institutional part of the ABA and its and its mission to serve those who have served so as president Klein explained this is going to mobilize lawyers to serve the critical need for enhanced legal services for our nation's veterans she talked about our co-chairs Dwight Smith and Vice Admiral to Renzi who we marry and I had worked with while she was the Judge Advocate General for the Navy on active duty there's a 20-member Commission that represents the full cross-section of all practice areas in assisting veterans from homelessness to legal aid to private firm pro bono I mean law school clinic you name it we've got we've got folks from every every aspect of this area president Klein talked a lot about some of these things so i won't i won't repeat them but a lot of the projects that we are working on is development of medical legal partnerships at VA clinics engaging law schools and clinical programs incubator programs the legal check-up project is actually an Enterprise Fund grant project this year that's being handled by the stand Committee on delivery of legal services so that is ongoing looking at a variety of issues policy matters programs it's it's pretty broad ranging and it is doing quite a bit of work in in all areas and not simply just civil legal services the the national pro bono celebration I'll just mention that briefly which just pro bono week ended a couple of weeks ago but this year what we have done is we have asked organizations around the country to commit to doing more than just the week but to do programs both through veterans day as well as committing to do another project delivering legal services on Memorial Day and so we have about 40 programs around the country so far that have signed up and made that commitment and you will see for those of you who may go to mid year or annual we are we have programming already on the schedule for mid year on the on the Saturday of mid year there will be a CLE program on medical legal partnerships as well as meetings by the Commission and so on and we are working on some programming for the annual meeting as well so that's the that's initiative so just to wrap up some helpful links and of course our contact information to learn more about the initiative as I say it's covering quite a bit you can take a look at ambar dork / veterans that's where you'll find all of the information about the initiative the lamp committee is Ambar dot org slash lamp but military pro bono work is really the the place to go it's kind of the hub for all of what we're doing in terms of outreach and program and services so feel free to check that out for sure so with that I will conclude my remarks but I'm happy to answer any questions or or ever whatever you might have have some sort of military branch right that's a great question so there are actually a lot of entities around the ABA that do military have some kind of military veteran focused project or program and GP solo has its military law committee we meet with them twice a year and annual and there are other family law has a military law committee I mean there there are a bunch of different entities and so I don't actually have the link up here but but if you go to an bar dot org slash veterans you can find information about the coordinating committee on veterans benefits and services which is staffed by Amy Horton Newell who is in DC and the Coordinating Committee actually pulls together all of those entities to coordinate them in the work that they're doing make sure we all know what everybody else is doing find ways of complementing each other's work and working together and collaborating and so on so the Coordinating Committee is our way of bringing that all together under one one roof yeah because I used to be a threat to American burn Association also save America better Association in the hallways or write my organization sure right so with respect to the veteran focus program the vkm program because it was a pilot we were pretty tightly controlled the intake process and the outreach that was done around it because we had a limited scope I guess on what we could do so it wasn't broadly publicized under the new draft MoU with the VA it will actually be veterans who are filing a notice of intent to seat benefits will receive information about the program so it's going to be a much more widely available project so you probably didn't see it because you know we were we actually just focused very strictly on unrepresented veterans currently on the system with pending claims in only three regions so that's the reason why and you know again in part due to resource limitations and funding limitations and other things we do have to try to control the numbers that folks coming into the system who are seeking help so so there are some limits in other words we don't have a phone number where close you just call up Mary and say hey I need a free lawyer and and wish we wish we could do that we did that and she'd spend all day on the phone about be able to do anything else so so that's one of the challenges we have right so in terms of programs that can access it for the active duty program we actually work with all of the military services and their heads of legal assistance or choose the legal assistance they actually are liaisons to our committee and they put out information to all incoming Jags who are coming on active duty plus all of the ones who are already providing legal services they regularly promote our program they teach about it at the Jag school when the when the military attorneys go through their legal assistance training so it's it has over the last eight years become institutionalized in the military services about the program everybody hopefully always find little gaps but for the most part everybody knows about it it's available people notas to ask about it so we've done a great job with the activity side what we hope is that with the launch of this new vet Lex initiative with Jones day and hopefully the relaunch of the V can project will be able to do the same and make it make our veteran program just as widely available but as I say we haven't gotten to that point quite yet so that's the issue yeah yeah he's not limited to attorneys or yeah I know this right right this is this is one of the big challenge and we've actually gotten this question a lot so the VA actually can be a general counsel's office controls that accreditation process you would have to be accredited in order to represent a veteran in front of the VA and their regulations have limited it only two attorneys now a paralegal can work under a licensed and accredited attorney to do whatever preparation of documents a system otherwise but they haven't expanded the eligibility I guess to include paralegals operating on their own and so that is that is something that we raised with a VA General Counsel's office in the past and I'm sure will continue to do so but it's controlled by their regulations right because we get your files right raised for sure ya know I and quite frankly I mean there are veteran service organizations do some of the same type of work they get accredited a different way but they're neither lawyers North paralegals they just simply get trained but because they're under a veteran service organization they're able to do that so it seems like there should be a way to do that and we'll keep keep trying to convince them anything else [Applause] thank you Jason and Mary as they indicated a lot of folks do fall through the cracks there are benefiting services organization that assists a lot of us as we transition from military to civilian life and we're able to take advantage of those services and even there are very reasonable officers that were ever used DFW's but I except for those folks that fall through the cracks we need additional resources and help so part of our goal as the staff diversity Council is to make sure we can educate those of you who know veterans may be related to veterans friends out there that you can kind of get the word out and that we can do more to help veterans so with that we certainly thank Mary and Jason and present client for the things that they're doing and things that are coming in the future you", "z_mIUp8vpMQ": "okay let's begin with general formation regarding the reformatted California bar examination I like to address four areas first the scope of the California Bar Examination second the new 2-day bar exam schedule third the grading of the California Bar Examination and fourth I'd like to address rumors as to why the July pass rates in California are much higher than the February pass rates in California let's begin with the scope of the California Bar Examination let's take a look at slide number one now you'll notice on the slide number one the scope of the California Bar Examination we have four categories covering 15 subjects category number one would be the Remy's category torts contracts property and of course remedies the category number two the Constitution law category criminal law criminal procedure evidence constitutional law the category number three the California subjects wills trust me property profession sponsibility and category number for residual including Civil Procedure business associations sometimes referred to as business organization which includes corporations and agency and partnership we also have detail by asterisk the multi-state subjects again multi-state means the same thing as MBE or multiple choice subjects and they are as follows torts contracts and property now remedies is tested on a multiple choice as part of those subjects it's not considered a separate subject but of course you can have remedy as a part of torts contracts and property MBE category number two criminal law and procedure evans con law now criminal law crimper oricon treated as one subject on the MBE so you'll find there are 25 questions in each topic in Krim la cr\u00e9me pro they're combined so criminal law might have 13 questions crimp Pro might have 12 questions for 1225 there are no MD subjects in the California category and Civil Procedure is the MB subject in the residual category one important note here is that for purpose of the multiple choice the evidence tests the Federals of evidence and cipro teaches the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure California does test the California rules of evidence and California so procedure on the essay but those are not tested on the MB Federal Rules only now the third section examination will be performance performance examinations we'll discuss in a few minutes is one 90-minute examination testing testing boring skills the subject can be either any of the scope you're looking at any of those 15 or fair game but the examiners are not limiting performance to these subjects it could they could test for example an Admiralty law administrative law bankruptcy law they'll give you a file and if they test you in a subject not included in this particular scope they'll give you all the information you need in the library to write the performance examination that is the scope of the California Bar Examination now what's also important to understand is the new schedule on the California Bar on that note then let's take a look at slide number two the examination has changed from a three-day test to a two-day test day number one am three essays in the morning one hour each keep in mind that is exactly the way the current bar exam has been tested for many many years the big change in the afternoon in the afternoon you'll have a three and a half hour section that is two one-hour essays followed by one 90 minute performance examination and you cannot take it out of order my concern is the examiners might give a racehorses in the afternoon on the essay and then that may affect your timing so you'll have to go for three and a half hours in the p.m. of day one that's six and a half hours of testing on day number one major change on the bar day number two has not changed it's the same topics we have currently and that is multiple choice three hours 100 in the morning followed by three hours one a m\u00f3vil choice in the afternoon thus a two day schedule as opposed the current three-day exams and carried on for many many years other format changes would be in the multiple choice there are now 200 questions on the examination however 175 of those questions will be scored 25 each in the seven subjects again keeping keeping mine creme la creme pro or one subject 25 unscored pretest questions the pretest questions are indistinguishable from those that are scored so as an examinee you would have to answer all the questions the mb scores will continue to be graded on a two hundred point scale because the mb scores are equated and scaled scores will be comparable to those earn when there are more scored questions there are some subject topic changes that take place as well beginning in February 17 forward in real property in real property they've added new topics to the multiple choice including conflicts of laws property owners associations and common interest ownership communities drafting review negotiation of closing documents persons authorized to execute real estate documents minor modifications include providing specific examples of rules affecting and future interests including security deposits information of tendencies providing more detailed zoning topics and including as separate topics transfers restrictive covenants transfers of easements profits and licenses an acceleration of loans before foreclosure a couple deletions from the MB beginning in February 2017 forward real property will no longer test UCC article 9 is applied to fixtures or a Bateman of devises in Wills minor change in the evidence multiple choice the allotment of questions will change there'll be less hearsay questions and more questions in the area of relevance and presentation of evidence as you can see there's been a major change going from a three-day test to a day to day bar examination third let's talk about the grading of the California Bar Examination let's take a look at slide number three as you can see the essays performance are now equal 50% that is five essays and one 90 minute performance exam day one 50% equates to seven hundred points and day two 200 multi-storey multi-state questions 50% seven points so it's 50% for the writing 50% for the multiple-choice it should be noted that the raw scores on the performance and essays will be a low of 42 a high of 165 grade is minimal passing that is five essays one or points apiece and one performance exam which again equates to 200 points because one performance equals two essays for seven points total 50% followed by the MBE 50% seven points total now one quick one quick review of the scaling and the phase Grady and the bar examination how does California scale their examination essentially to scale the scores the written section to the MB scores manners locate a student's score on the bell curve for the written section and then gives a student the score equivalent to the same position on the California and B curve thus of a student scores in the 60th percentile ie wrote better than 60 percent of her peers then the student are given a numerical score from the MD curve corresponding to the sixth percentile again on the new two thousand point scale measurement the applicant must achieve a final score of 1440 or 72% to pass the exam the magic number is 1440 the exam will still be continually graded on what they call a three phase procedure phase one phase two and phase three phase one all parts of the exam are read and tabulated that's the essays performance MBE a passing score is 1466 and above failing is 1389 in below phase two the essays and PT's of the applicants with scores of 1392 1465 are read a second time by different graders unaware of the greatest sign in phase number one and should be pointed out for example if greater number one gives you a 70 on essay number one greater number two in phase two gives you a sixty your optimum grade will be a sixty five after phase one in phase two then the grades from phase one and phase two are average scores of fourteen forty and above now past scores below fourteen twelve now fail phase three the answers of the applicants with Phase two scores of fourteen twelve to fourteen thirty nine because again fourteen forty is the cutoff are sent to a reappraisal where a number of the board of where a member of the Board of Representatives or reappraisal they call them reviews the entire exam including the MB scores and determines de novo whether that student merits a pass or fail on the examination as you can see the grade in California bar exchange dramatically going to 50% multiple choice 50 percent written portion the examination now the fourth thing like to address are the rumors I always am asked by many law students while the July bar pass rates are higher than the February pass rates and the reason is the applicant pool on the July bar close to 8,000 students take the examination 70% of those students are first time takers the bulk of those students come from ABA schools in February close to about 5,000 students take the examination that is 70% of people who take the February bar are repeaters those who fail the July bar or many students come from non ABA schools for the February bar because most ABA schools don't graduate many students in December for the February bar one another important rumor that is important to be addressed is the cut rate California has the highest cut rate on the MB in the United States along with Delaware the cut rate for the MB is 144 for example in comparison New York is 135 many of the ABA deans and the state accredited Dean's have written the State Bar as well as the California Supreme Court to challenge the arbitrary 144 cut rate on the MB in California if the examiners do the pressure of the ABA schools and state accredit schools decide to lower the cut rate that will clearly increase the passing on the California Bar Examination now you should have a much better understanding of the California Bar Exam slide number one discuss the scope of the California bar slide number two we broke out the bar exam scheduled the two days schedule and slide number three we talked about the grading of the examination now they have a better understanding of the California Bar Examination as a whole I'd like to proceed with part two of today's presentation that is how flemmings funnels of law can help you conquer and pass the new California bar examination", "5rXoUcJ94dA": "when you need a lawyer how do you find the right one contact the chicago bar association whether you've been injured or need a will prepared whether you're buying a home or starting a business having the right lawyer is essential the chicago bar association have lawyers who practice in most areas of law and speak a variety of languages don't leave it to chance get a referral to a screened experienced lawyer visit chicagobar.org or call zero 312-554-2001 the chicago bar association habla espanol the chicago bar association was created back in 1874 as just a general resource to help attorneys network with each other and be successful in their practices the cba chose to set up the insurance subsidiary because a lot of the members were asking questions about what types of insurance they should tap into who's the best resource for legal malpractice insurance life insurance health insurance etc etc and rather than sending those elsewhere we figured we'd be a better resource if we just kept it all in house and they had a a familiar face to work with on a regular basis and we think that it's very important to get the word out and let our members know that we're around to help as a resource on top of that we can work with any law firm or any attorney in in the united states when a law firm comes to us for a second opinion on their legal malpractice insurance policy we're usually able to find them a lower price for the same coverage or better coverage or in some instances actually both we can find a lower price for better coverage which is obviously the end goal insurance is something that not a lot of people know the ins and outs of it and maybe a smaller firm or a solo attorney needs that consultant to really keep them in line or to provide information to take it off of their plate they have enough going on dealing with clients collecting bills doing everything that makes them successful in their profession what i'm here to do is to to be a resource and and really just just provide assistance in something that they are not inherently an expert in [Music] welcome to una law a chicago bar association production that provides information on various legal and policy matters of public interest i'm mike alcarocci a partner at the plaintiff's personal injury firm leahy and hosti an adjunct professor of advocacy at loyola university chicago school of law here in the city where i went to school and i'm a member of the chicago bar association where i serve on the judicial evaluation committee and the trial practice committee as well as serving as the chair of the media production committee that produces this show we have a special episode today because rather than focusing on a substantive area of law we have leadership from the chicago bar association to discuss the cba's role as a community resource mariam ahmad is the newly installed president of the cba a former judge a trial lawyer and the chief of the juvenile justice bureau for the cook county state's attorney's office jeff moskowitz is the newly installed chair of the cba young lawyers section a solo practitioner and an entrepreneur who is heavily involved with the cva in many capacities mariam and jeff thanks thanks for being on the show and if you could just uh give us a little bit more background on each of you mariam why don't you start thanks mike and thank you very much uh for having me here today and um hello everyone my name is mariam ahmed i am the 147th president of the chicago bar association my day job as i like to call it is um as chief of the juvenile justice bureau for the cook county state's attorney's office where i oversee all of the child protection and juvenile justice or criminal juvenile prosecutions in cook county prior to that position i served as a circuit court judge for the circuit court of cook county before that i worked as a line prosecutor for the county state's attorney's office and prior to becoming a county state's attorney i served as a cook county public defender so i think presently right now i am the only prosecutor who has served as a cook county public defender cook county prosecutor and cook county judge um in terms of my philosophy and orientation a lot of that has to do with my earlier life my uh first career is actually higher education law is my second career and so i spent the first 14 years of my career working at academic institutions assisting young people in getting into college and then later in my later years working at universities to ensure that students graduated from from college and so i have a real commitment to not only working to succeed but working to help others succeed and that orientation will explain a lot about uh the initiatives i undertake as chicago bar association president thanks mike thank you very much jeff thank you very much mike so i am i'm from chicago i grew up in the northwest suburbs and went away for college to indiana and then came back to law school at depaul i'll be honest i wasn't the most involved at that point i kind of i went to school and i was clerking for the public defender's office fell in love with it and as soon as i got my 7-eleven i just went to all classes at night and i would go every day monday through friday and i would stay through the whole call and i they used to laugh because i didn't even care if it was an arraignment i wanted to do it if it was a continuance i was having the guy sign the 7-eleven sheet and saying judge 7-eleven jeff moscow it's under the supervision of uh you know public defender and and i just wanted to do it anything that i could do they'd say jeff we're getting a continuance it's a month date that what's the point of talking to this guy and getting a 7-eleven signed waiver i said i want as much experience as i can i want to learn how to handle the whole call so um as law school was wrapping up for me the year i graduated in 2009 or excuse me 2012 and it was not the best legal market uh as everybody i'm sure remembers so at the time the county had a hiring freeze and i figured you know what i've got a lot of experience i've handled quite a few felony cases i've done a lot of trials as a 7-eleven i'd even won i second chaired a murder that wrapped up and we got a not guilty on it a few days before i took the bar so i was coming off of that and i had all the the gusto of a young law student probably a little naive to think that i that i was totally ready for for starting my own practice but i went out and i started my own practice and fortunately for me i linked up with some great mentors fantastic people uh through the cba through other avenues that wanted to help me become a better lawyer because i i tell all the young lawyers when you get out of law school you're nowhere near ready to be a lawyer you got to go and practice and it takes a long time to get to the point where you need to be so i i started my own practice i was focusing mainly on litigation matters a lot of criminal uh primarily in the state courts mostly around cook county and then over time my career kind of advanced and developed so now a lot of my newer cases that i'm starting to work on are class action based cases and then i got into litigation finance a few years ago so that was when mike said the entrepreneurial side i've been running a company that does litigation financing and kind of that takes up a lot of my time these days more so than practicing law all right thanks very much jeff why don't we start with some background of course the purpose of this program specifically today is to provide the general public with information that may be useful about the cba as a public resource in all the various ways that it provides those resources so mariam if you would uh would you would you mind providing us for the viewers uh just some a little bit of background on the cba what its role has been historically where it's at now and then we'll jump into your leadership year okay great so historically the chicago bar association uh our membership represents every single practice area in the law from lawyers to judges and our members are individuals who are fully committed to the legal profession and committed to service and committed to our community which is chicago cook county and the state of illinois we have a number of public service programming that we offer as a bar association for example many of our members volunteer to be edward j lewis lawyers for our lawyers in the classroom program this is an initiative where our lawyers volunteer during their day to go into classrooms and talk about the law and civics education which is particularly important because many schools actually don't have a dedicated civics curriculum we also have a very robust lawyer referral service where individuals can call email go online and seek advice and guidance for free from a lawyer uh with eventually the possibility of being able to hire that lawyer to represent them on a particular issue we have an in-court lawyer referral service not everybody who comes into a courtroom has an attorney knows how to go about obtaining an attorney and we have lawyers that are available in the courthouses available for hire in matters ranging from traffic to criminal to civil we also have a law in the library series through harold washington library and woodson library where we have attorneys who go in and conduct public service and law related programs for individuals in various communities the cba also has an interfaith committee for restorative justice programming we're in four schools conducting restorative justice programming for youth to educate youth not only about the justice system but to impact students in such a way that they don't have contact with the justice system in a negative way i'll stop you right there for a moment yes because there's there's a lot there and i wanted to focus for a moment if we could on the concept of restorative justice and explore i realize it's complex but i want to at least touch on that and provide a little bit of foundation there is the juvenile justice mentoring initiative which i think started as a joint bar association program but i know the cba i believe is the cba still involved in that program because i was involved in a pilot one quite a while ago yes through jt dc which is the juvenile temporary detention center right and their circuit court sure and and there is um um even recently with the with the um uh uh political conventions going on there has been discussion quite a lot of discussion about restorative justice can you tell us and tell the viewers what is uh restorative justice with with the understanding this is coming from a former public defender a state's attorney a former judge and someone who's very involved in all these things presently and sounds like throughout really your entire legal career certainly the focus of restorative justice is to take a person who has been either a victim of crime or exposed to a crime and restoring them to where they were prior to that victimization restorative justice is predicated upon interventions that are more holistic and not punitive meaning public service community service um engaging in peace circles and mediations instead of just being punitive in nature and the focus is um was while the focus is restoring the victim to where they were um the focus is also transforming the alleged offender into a person better than he or she was before the harm occurred thank you i'd like to ask how how does that relate to at least what i perceive now i'm not i i'm a civil attorney handling personal injury and medical negligence but i did actually 7-11 at the uh state's attorney's office and made made some friends there and had had a pretty interesting experience um at that time and certainly even proceeding that this is about 2006 there was a development of specialty courts which i think have continued um over the last 15 years or so can you talk a little bit about that before we move on to some of our other more broad topics uh those are all the special courts as it relates to the concept of restorative justice that you just articulated so the special courts are more of uh a creation of the circuit court of cook county versus any particular office and the special courts are literally as they as they sound specialty courts dedicated to um issues and and populations such as seniors and senior issues veterans and veteran issues also there are specialty courts that handle individuals who are battling substance abuse there's also another category of um specialty court that's presently emerging with our literally our uh emerging adult population those specialty courts are on the south and west side and deal with individuals who are low-level offenders who are charged with lower level offenses and their court proceedings are held actually in the community be that on the south and west side with an eye toward more restorative intervention versus punitive intervention and judge evans has actually recently established two new uh emerging adult courtrooms in the city thank you very much in a moment i want to turn to jeff to to ask him about the the racial justice coalition but before we do that um there are just so many uh programs and and um initiatives that that the cba has been involved with for a long time uh one of them that i'm a little bit familiar with because i do work with them from time to time is the wills for heroes foundation which is an entity that is independent and outside the cva but uh with which the cba has worked uh very closely and and recruited attorneys chicago attorneys and surrounding those from surrounding suburbs to participate in this can you please tell us a little bit about the wills for heroes program i can tell you a little further for me oh i'm sorry that that's mario my apologies that's that's for that's for you okay actually it's one of my favorite programs i've volunteered for it several times which is actually not unusual for the leadership of both the chicago bar association and the young lawyers section to be active in pro bono initiatives in our own right and so the wills for heroes program um is attorneys who volunteer to draft testamentary documents meaning related to wills living wills and basic wills for our illinois first responders and veterans and their immediate family and usually there's one every few months that it's held at the chicago police headquarters at 35th and michigan and it's a it's extraordinary because these are folks who need next to testamentary services um who don't necessarily have the personal resources to go and do that on their own so it's phenomenal um my there's also one other program i'd like to briefly mention which is very impactful like rules for heroes and that's our driver's license reinstatement program the cba partners with the circuit court the public defender pilsen neighbors the clerk of the circuit court the state's attorney's office to assist our residents in taking the steps to clear suspended and revoked licenses and our next program is actually september 12th but these are just examples of major volunteer initiatives where we're actually bringing free legal services into the community thank you that's that's fantastic thank you very much um i'd like to switch gears a little bit because those those are uh you know a number of programs that i i think are fairly representative of the wide survey of programs initiatives that cba offers um a more recent development um jeff and i'd like you to tell us a little bit about this is the uh the creation and the work's already being done uh of the uh racial justice coalition which as i understand it arose out of the young lawyers section but has really already outgrown that in terms of having the support of the full bar absolutely thank you mike so uh in response to a lot of the events that we saw uh we didn't want to stand by anymore our our leadership decided that um we're uniquely positioned as attorneys the chicago bar association eighteen thousand attorneys strong in illinois wanted to see change and we thought that change needed to start with the young lawyers so what was a kind of small idea really started to snowball as now i believe we have about 30 organizations other bar organizations the ardc the illinois judges everybody who has jumped on board with this signed on and put together a huge effort to do multiple things we're we're not only out there informing the public but we are also trying to be out there to get some changes as well this isn't something that's playing lip service we actually have boots on the ground that are doing things too but we are also educating the public about what's going on for instance we did a program several weeks ago with senator dick durbin uh about a bill it was fantastic thank you i i thought it was i thought it went pretty well uh we were really proud of it and it is available for people to watch online um uh senator durbin has been a big force for change in the um criminal justice reform arena and he has a bill that he's been trying to get past and it was very interesting to hear about his his portion of it where the republicans stand on it where it is in terms of actually feasibility um but i i think there's a lot of topics that fall under the rjc sorry and if i say rjc i mean the the racial justice coalition but that fall under the rjc where uh we're very invested in trying to see criminal justice reform where you've seen extremely disparate effects on african-american and latino communities where they are suffering considerably differently under the present laws in the sentencing schemes at both a federal and a state level and it's ridiculous and i think a lot of people realize that it's ridiculous but nobody wanted to do anything about it but the war on drugs uh has caused untold damage to our communities and marginalized people and as the young lawyers which we we account for about half the population of the uh of the cba so we're about eight or nine thousand members strong we're putting that might plus all of these other organizations to try to actually enact some change so we started on a federal level speaking with senator durbin we have a great program coming up at the city level discussing the reform of the chicago police department the differences between the civilian police accountability council and the grassroots alliance for police accountability we're bringing in alderman matt martin and father michael flager to speak on this and that's going to be on september 8th between 2 and 3 30 also available via zoom i think our membership and i think the community at large is very interested in hearing what's going on in their city and how can we make it the city that we want to live in uh that that opportunity is in our hands to shape our city and to that end we are actually doing a um voter registration initiative we've partnered with the black women's lawyer association and we are working to get people registered to vote it's easier it's easier to get registered to vote i think than people realize but we also have to make that information public so they understand how they can do it and we want to make sure that as many people in all the communities of chicago have their voices heard um so that's just kind of an example of some of the things that we're doing uh there will be a lot more programming to come sure let me follow up on that very briefly so sort of recapping some of the things that we've discussed um clearly the chicago bar association we've discussed uh they provide cert we provide i should say services there's outreach there's education for attorneys and the public and it looks like i mean we're running out we're running out of time we're pretty close so we'll keep this short hopefully um but it looks like you know the the social advocacy um in this show this show that we're on right now is is usually it's about substantive topics rather than politics but how do you both very briefly and then we'll wrap up see the cba in its relationship like as a as a political or a political institution i mean that's a big question it's a tough one to end on but what is the role of the cba and uh socially in short you don't want to so um historically lawyers have been society's greatest change agents so i don't see what we're doing as being political but merely advocating for justice which is what attorneys do best i i am i don't consider myself a politician uh i have made my career on pursuing justice for others and i do that not only professionally but through my work with the bar um because that's just who i am and it's very difficult uh living in a community such as chicago i live in the city i'm a south sider and not be committed to issues of justice right thank you very much and jeff i i would echo what maryam said but i i think people like to politicize things nowadays i think that that everything tends to take this it needs to be political that's not what we're out here doing i think what we are striving to do is make the system better to make it fairer to have the same results people in similar situations should come out with the same results it shouldn't be that if you live on the north side that you get a better treatment than somebody who lives on the south side that's absolutely ridiculous and the fact of the matter of of how some things have been administered we can all admit are not right i don't think it matters democrat republican independent it doesn't matter what we're trying to do is we're trying to make the system better fairer get more representation to people who traditionally were not allowed or not not not allowed but didn't have access to representation it's incredible how many litigants these days are coming to court and they cannot either afford they don't know where to go to to get someone to represent them so they're coming in and they're unrepresented that puts you at a huge disadvantage it would be like trying to go into another country where you don't speak the language and so to the and on top of that we've worked on bills to add plain language to make to make it easier for people who are unrepresented to understand what they're doing to put things into their language so there's not an opportunity for someone who has more means or access to an attorney to have the ability to to you know pull a fast one or we're trying to get rid of the loopholes the idea of loopholes is ridiculous it's the job jeff i'm going to stop here right there because we're running uh out of time um but thank you both uh so much uh for appearing obviously uh you know um a lot is changing fast and making the bar association more relevant to attorneys and beyond that's the general public is something that that is very important right now and uh and i encourage the viewers to get to know the chicago bar association there's great leadership during difficult times and i look forward to all the work that goes on during this bar year so thank you both very much and thank you to our viewers viewers for turning tuning into this episode of you and the law thank you thank you very much for having us [Music]", "JiZIPI70opQ": "ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATIC LEADERS ARE CALLING

you have clicked on this video then you're likely on my e-commerce site and you are wondering as to whether or not you need these sa approaches yes you need them let me tell you why as a california bar exam tutor for the past eleven years I have been teaching how to write for every possible area that comes up on the California Bar Exam essay portion I also teach approach for the performance test California and examiner's are very against conceptual law writing applicants tend to write concepts of law but not strategy of law there is a very big difference between just giving the concept of negligence or knowing the strategy to a multiple negligence essay or a multiple vicarious liability crossover you also need to know how to deal with defenses and you need to know when certain issues will be major versus minor there are points for all of this certain issues you will want to get quickly in and out of and other issues you will always want to give a counter-argument for you also want to know how these areas of law cross over well my approaches will get you the points they will maximize your essay points and you will stop having surprises when you go into the exam on a lot of areas that you probably don't even know maybe you know how they come up but you're not really sure how to execute it is very very important to know how to write for every possible area that gets tested the inconsistency in scores that you may be seeing if you are a repeater and the fluctuations from some 50s or 55 to 65 needs to be more consistent you cannot risk not passing an essay or a performance test if you're going to be buying that approach as well so go into our database look at all the subjects that you need maybe you'll need the whole bundle maybe you'll just need a few of them but get

association i am gonna do most of the presentation today and we'll just uh tell you off the bed i'm not an expert i've tried to read everything that's out there about this program uh watch every video that i could find and kind of condense it down there will still be a lot of specific questions that you may have um and i intentionally am not sort of addressing um some of those in the presentation and that's because i want you to feel free to reach out afterwards to me um to nianza who i'm gonna introduce in a moment um you know i'm happy to answer more questions i'm also in contact direct contact with the state bar about the program and they've been very willing to answer questions that aren't answered in their faqs so um don't feel like today's the be-all end-all um feel free to ask questions today but then if you have specific questions about your practice about how you know your supervision might work we can definitely um address those uh separately and so that so that you get all the answers you need so first i want to introduce nyanzasha is the president of the john m langston bar association here in los angeles um she is in her second year in that role uh due to covid so she has uh really stepped up and uh is uh doing going above and beyond the call of duty um and nyanza and i uh spoke and so our bar associations are partnering um on this project and we're reaching out to a lot of other regional bar associations or bar associations in the region and our goal is singular which is to make sure that we're not duplicating efforts and get as many provisional attorneys placed as we can um i think we're both big believers in this program and the way it's going to work best is if all of us are cooperating so let me turn it over to nianza who has just a little bit to share about um kind of the background of some of the pieces that led to this to this program and then i can get into the nuts and bolts hey good morning everybody and thank you belinda um i am excited to be here again as belinda mentioned we spoke and we were trying to figure out the best way to begin to get this information out not only to potential applicants who are looking for supervising attorneys but supervising attorneys who can help these applicants in terms of being part of this program and also getting help through some of the information and details that belinda is going to share so i just think this is really really important and i am excited um on behalf of langston to be partnering with the beverly hills bar association on this and again i'm going to put on my email as well in the chat if you guys have any questions we're going to not only be working with other bar associations but want to be able to especially because there's a timeliness issue that belinda will mention um to get as many people again applicants and supervising attorneys um match together connected whatever we need to do and that starts with you guys and letting us you know you guys letting us know that you're interested um in either or if you need help as an applicant etc and you have specific questions like belinda said please feel free um to reach out to us we are just trying to be here as facilitators so again thank you belinda you can take it from here and i will um as i mentioned i will put my email in the chat anybody who wants to reach out to me uh me or belinda please feel free thank you great thank you ninza let me share my screen okay so um this is the list of what we're going to go through a brief background um who qualifies to be a licensee who qualifies to be a supervisor what can the licensees do how can you match um as an attorney with with a licensee and then we should have a few minutes for q a at the end so the first is the background um the larger long-term picture here as many of you may be aware is that there have long been equity concerns about the bar exam the bar exam's cut score the bar exam's cut score and the impact on representation within our profession and so there were there have been studies done um recommendations made that's been a long ongoing discussion then the shorter term is the covet hit and the bar was faced with um how do we deal with people who are graduating who graduated in december of 2019 all the way through 2020 there was no in-person setting sitting for the july bar it was more difficult for people to um study there were resource issues etc and so they had to come up with an alternative they looked at a number of things including diploma privilege and ultimately came up with this provisional license program the original program and that was that anybody who graduated december 2019 through december of 2020 could become provisionally licensed they could take the online bar exam if they wanted to they didn't have to they have through june of 2022 to pass a bar exam the thing with that group though is that they do need to pass a bar exam still it basically lengthens the amount of time they have because of all the covid closures interfering with their ability to sit for an exam so that was the initial program then the state bar went back to the court and said what we'd like to do and they studied um and debated this considerably as i understand it but what they wanted to do is as part of the covid um solution the supreme court of california actually reduced the cut score on the bar exam by 50 points so then the working group went back to the court and recommended and the supreme court of california ultimately just recently ruled that people who have taken the bar exam from july 2015 to 2020 and would have passed under the new cut score that with or so they came within 50 points of passing those people are now able to get licensed by performing 300 hours as a provisional licensee under the supervision of an attorney who meets certain qualifications so who are the licensees as i said you have that first group and those folks still are going to need to sit for a bar i think most of those people i'm not positive my understanding is that most of those people because that program has been around six plus months longer um those people may mostly be paired with supervising attorneys the huge new influx that we're seeing in my understanding from the state bar is that they have a thousand applicants so far under the new expanded program and expect many more is this second group which is the folks who would have passed under the new score from july 2015 to the present um in both cases they have to have submitted their application for moral character determination and not received um an unfavorable uh disposition so it's fine if they don't yet have their approval um if they in the time that they are provisional receive um basically a rejection on moral character um their ability to be a provisional licensee is suspended but they have to have submitted the application there are some other technical requirements that provisional licensees need to do in terms of the mpre versus an ethics training etc but i'm not going to get into those here because those mostly don't affect you as supervising lawyers there may be some folks on the call who are provisional licensees all of that information is on the state bar's website really encourage you to check it out um so the the nice thing that the barded um with the bar recommended to the quarter that the court did is our provisional licensees in california can do a lot more than those in other states can because a lot of states have done something similar in the wake of covid um but california's is much broader california basically said anything a licensed attorney can do a provisional licensee can do as long as they're under the supervision of a supervising attorney so these are the examples that the court the state bar gives in their faqs um but you can see they're very broad so um you know everything court appearances signing pleadings etc um the the ability the idea is to really start give people a start in their legal careers and so they wanted to keep the definition um of what they could do very broad so who qualifies to be a supervising attorney you have to have been practicing for at least four years overall you have to have had an active license in california for at least the last two years up until now um and you have to meet a definition of actively practicing that's a technical definition it's linked to from the faqs that i'll give you but essentially you probably know if you've been actively practicing um they also have extended it um which i'll mention in a minute to um people who might not otherwise um be sort of colloquially considered to be practicing like law professors but are under this definition that the bar has provided um you must be employed by a california employer and i got some um clarification from the state bar um last night on this it does not mean that you necessarily have to be in california if you're working remotely because of covid it does not mean that the provisional licensee has to be in california and it does not mean that it has to be in person all of it can be remote the issue is that the actual employer of the supervising attorney who's signing the declaration has to be a california employer and finally you have to be willing you have to be willing to supervise the lawyer the provisional lawyer and sign a declaration you sign a declaration up front um saying what you're that you are willing to supervise this person that's part of their application that goes into the state bar and then you sign a declaration once they've completed their 300 hours um these on the left are the the people who qualify um there are um state judicial officers there are judges that are not actually don't otherwise meet the criteria um so if you are a judge or you are asking judge friends or a judge you clerked for to take this on make sure they are still an active member of the bar they do still need to meet all of the other criteria um but sitting as a judge does qualify then under the actively practicing definition that the bar has provided and then again they added law professors um but the nice thing too is that it includes everybody in our profession otherwise so solos firms non-profit government um you know everybody who is actively practicing really can can can be a supervising attorney there are a couple of exceptions but these folks are actually not active members of the california bar but just to clarify if you're a registered in-house counsel or registered military spouse attorney you cannot be a supervising attorney so here is my pitch um which is probably it will sound familiar because it's uh nyan's as well i think this is an absolutely great way to help um you can have a very meaningful impact on somebody's career this is a way for somebody to earn their license this is direct help you will be working one-on-one or one-on-two or one on three you can supervise more than one lawyer if you want to um you can partner up with another lawyer and you can share a provisional licensee's time um but it's direct help that you're providing it's uh it's the type of training that i think many of us when we graduated uh from law school probably would have loved to have had um you know that that actual nuts and bolts of doing the work um i think many of us probably graduated from law school thinking do i am i ready to to actually practice right now you know um and this gives people those really practical skills to help get their license and i think you know it's a great way um based on the long-term studies that they've done to improve representation racial and ethnic representation within our profession and also to improve access to justice i know people make jokes about how many lawyers there are but there are tremendous gaps in terms of the provision of legal services in communities all across california so um you know adding uh people to our profession who are dedicated lawyers is is is a way that um hopefully over time we'll close close that justice gap so the timeline generally um and nyan's a flag that there there is a tight turn around here um we really encourage you to read the materials as soon as possible determine if you'd like to supervise within the next couple of weeks if you can complete the form that's on our webpage and i'll give it to you um to be a supervising attorney because we already have lots of provisional licensee applicants and as i said they need you in order to even apply officially with the state bar so those you know thousand applicants that the state bar has those are people who have already been paired up um or at least for their application to be approved they will have to be paired up and so there is a large volume of people still coming to apply um and you cannot apply and then you know hope to find hope to get paired up in order for your application to be approved you need to have your supervising attorney um so we're really trying to get a jump on it and that's because of this date here may 31st is the deadline for applications completed applications which means everybody who's going to be paired up needs to be paired up by then and i know two months sounds like a decent amount of time but i think when you're talking about the volume of applications that we are and um and needing the number of supervising lawyers that we need i think that two months is probably going to go by very very quickly fortunately your piece of the application is a single form it's a couple of check boxes and your signature and we're going to make that easier and have it in docusign for you your piece of the application is not arduous at all the provisional licensee applicants have to pull together a lot of other materials but your piece is very small okay so all of the forms um are available at on this page bhba.org provisional that has um the google form that you can complete if you want to become a supervising attorney it and please share that widely uh share either the whole page or the form with colleagues who you think might be interested um it also has the application for um the google form i shouldn't say application it's not the official state bar application but the google form that we've created to take in information about provisional licensee applicants so that we can try and make really good pairings um we ask people what their interest areas are what their background uh you know is in terms of work experience so that we can try and really pair up people um to the extent that we can that that makes sense so um all of that information's there there's also a link to the state bar faqs which are very good i have gotten some answers in a back and forth with the state bar that we're going to add to that page some of the specifics that i mentioned about remote work about location of employer etc so we're going to add those there there's also links to the long-term studies that have been done about the bar cut score if you're interested in that background material and then uh also directly to the supreme court decisions that laid out the initial program and then the expanded program so everything should be in one place and that um you should feel free to share broadly and if you are active in another bar association please ask if they'd like to share you'll see when you get to that page that it's um an la region uh partnership of bar associations it's not just bhba that's bhba langston uh latina lawyers bar association joined last night um you know we really are trying to grow this we'll collect all the information in one place but then distribute it out to the bar associations because we want to make the most efficient use of everybody's time that we can and make sure that provisional licensee applicants aren't having to run all around you know and apply through a couple dozen bar associations i think it's probably likely that the la area has more applicants than anywhere else in the uh state obviously it's where the population center largest population center anyway but um we uh we have a large number of law schools in the area and so i i would anticipate that we probably in this region are going to have more applicants than other areas so even more important i think that we collaborate here is my email address um and i know nayenza put hers in the chat always feel free to use this to reach me with any specific questions also if you've filled out the form you will hear back from us maybe not immediately because we're trying to um figure out the the most logical way to and uh the process to get back to everybody but if you felt it completed the form and you got the thanks for completing the form screen you're you're in the system um and but i will be reaching out um or nianza will or one of the other bar associations will if we have a potential match for you so with that um and court reporters used to hate me because i talk so quickly um but i'm trying to be respectful of your time um who has questions or um you know feedback about the the program um questions about how you might be able to to use a provisional licensee in your office etc well belinda i can say someone uh text me a question relative to making sure that the applicant is actually qualified for the program and my response was um absolutely we will make sure in the form and information that we're collecting um that they are qualified for the program before trying to connect any potential supervising attorneys um with applicants um and i also wanted to just add again that not only is this important for you know the future kind of the the bar association and how we want to help um again both the applicants and potential supervising attorneys but if this is you know if you're a solo or a small firm or et cetera but you're a california employer this is a great opportunity to get help this is a great opportunity to mentor a young lawyer as belinda mentioned this is a great opportunity for us to support these potential lawyers who again based on the program set up by the state bar are now qualified to practice law and so whatever way that we can support that and if you guys are interested in doing so as well again i also put the link to the provisional page in the chat as well yeah i think it's a great opportunity to to get help um you know and it's 300 hours they can be um one of the things we're asking people as they put in their application is is um what their availability is and also if they are able to volunteer if they need to get paid and um the 300 hours does not have to be you know 40 hours a week for for i'm not going to do that math in my head but it doesn't have to be 40 hours right in a row um it can be they have up until june of 2022 so even if you have a project where you think it'd be a really good fit for a provisional licensee and they have a full-time job that they're working um you could still have a match even if you don't think i can keep somebody busy you know i can't keep an associate busy full-time i can't keep um you know i'm not sure i can guarantee somebody even you know 50 hours a month or something like that they do have time um in the program as of now it's sun sets on june 1st of 2022 although the state bar has said if it looks like um you know that needs to be adjusted they're willing to go back and ask the court for a modification um but i think everybody applying now should assume that they they just have until june 1st of 2022 and oh to address your question i answer so um we are asking people if they're qualified for the provisional licensee program and it's pretty easy for them to verify my understanding um and i i took the bar and graduated uh before the internet so um but apparently now uh people who graduate and take the bar have a portal on the state bar website and they can log in and they get a notification if they're qualified for the program the state bar said they've also emailed um everybody but um you know certainly if you know people who might be qualified let them know um but so it's easy for them to verify we're asking them to bear to attest to us that they're qualified and then as soon as somebody is approved by the state bar the state bar has a lookup feature on its website public that's very similar to the attorney lookup um you know if you go to look up you know whether one of us is licensed in california it's not the same database it's separate it's on a provisional licensing page but you can very easily um verify and that's useful for your purposes as a supervisor it's also good um because one of the requirements um and in the detailed requirements which you should look at is if you have clients um if you're in a position where you have clients and you a provisional licensee is going to work on their matters you need to disclose that to the client um and this way there is a public way that they can verify that this person's in the program yeah hands up yes i can see and i'm trying to get to where i can see let me stop sharing my screen so i can see names but somebody go ahead and ask a question you want to go first i see your hand is up you cannot meet yourself and ask your question thank you um so i was taking a look at the uh declaration form for the supervising attorneys um and i'm looking at the three questions that are at the bottom of page one let's say you know let's say i attest at the firmware i work as an iota funded organization that uh the firm will be paying for the uh application fee there's a yes and a no um so i just wanna know you know i i'm an attorney at a non-profit um and we can you know try to find funds to uh hopefully pay uh for someone's time to help us but um and also maybe even cover the application fee but does that have any bearing on whether we would qualify as supervising attorneys to support no it's informational so um the iota piece is that the fee is lower if you are an iota funded nonprofit in california i think there's a hundred non-profits throughout california that are funded that way um if you work at one you probably know um if you are and so the fee is different so my understanding is that's why they're asking if you're at an iota organization um and then the fee is actually the applicants to pay um but i think they were just trying to gather information about whether the employer was paying it so you're um you should discuss if you're matched um with with a potential licensee whether um they can you know afford the fee um we sort of will leave that all to you but no my understanding is it has it's not it's not um substantive beyond the ielts question because because of the difference um of um of uh i think it's paid versus unpaid as well um so that's that's the reason they're asking it's not and there's no rank the state bar doesn't do any um they're not doing assessment of supervising lawyers other than you know do you meet the criteria um and you will already be pre-matched with your licensees so they're not sort of collecting the data and using it in any way in terms of the pairings or anything thank you absolutely margo you also had a question you want to unmute yourself and ask your question thank you i believe i'm a mute uh number one uh thank you for this program i think it's excellent idea i'd like to know what is the procedure if the match does not turn out to be a good match what's the procedure for terminating or maybe getting a replacement provisional attorney that's my first question yes that's a really good question so what we're gonna try and do is we're not gonna say here's your match um that's it um we'll let connect you to so that you can discuss um see if it seems to be a good fit and then apply um my understanding is that if a provisional licensee loses their supervising attorney during the process their participation would be suspended in the program so they would need to find another supervising attorney but i will clarify with the state bar um if there can be like a simultaneous you know sort of swap this i'm leaving this supervising attorney and finding another um for your part though on the supervising attorney side they're likely is i i'm not sure there would be a way to find somebody else after the initial pairing period um because um the program applications close on may 31st so after that there are not going to be new applicants to pair with so it would just be you know anybody repairing which is probably going to be a very small number um so all the more reason probably to connect with um you know our suggested match to make sure that you actually are a match and we'll follow up you know and have you tell us yes or no um and you know depending on how many applicants we have uh you know then we can we can try and rematch yeah it's important that you guys find somebody that fits you know we're asking them about their practice areas etc what interests they have all of those things so to the extent you can interview them make sure that it's good match before and make sure they have the information necessary to feel confident and you know submitting you as their supervising attorney for this program um that's why this time frame of between now and may 31st is so important because we want to be able to have you know not only get you potential applicants but also give you that time um to really sort out and make sure that it's a good match for for both parties okay thanks never the second question okay go ahead marco sure uh with respect to the provisional attorneys appearing in court now especially since we have coveted uh and the appearances are remote does the supervising attorney have to be present in the same room with okay does the supervising attorney have to be on the remote call also at that time that the provisional attorney is appearing in court no um the state bar described it in the um the the uh presentation that i sat in on as the same supervision that you would give for instance an associate um you know you have ethical obligations to to supervise your associate um who would be appearing on a case for you and it's the same for the provisional licensee okay thank you okay susan um you had a question you want to unmute yourself and ask your question thank you i have two questions my first question is i i read somewhere that it's a just it's a only a 10 week it's a 10-week program is that did i just make that up or that's not true it can go on from any time as long as it's finished right now by june 2022 i'd have to look it up 10 weeks might have been the time frame between when the court announced and when the applications are due um because that decision came out in february and applications are due may 31st but no the actual completion of hours the applicants have until june of 2022. okay perfect and my second question is does this bypass you know the employment law um rules that you can't have unpaid interns so this is not an intern it's a a volunteer or how is that categorized for employment law purposes i actually do not know the answer to your question on employment law technically um and it wasn't actually addressed in any of the um state bar things that i attended there were there were people who had um that was mentioned that the the um licensees can be paid or unpaid um but they didn't actually address i don't know if it creates a a separate uh new status or not i actually don't know i can ask the state bar yeah we'll definitely find that out that's a really good question susan because you're right you don't want to be thank you so much an employment law issue while we're just supervising attorneys so we'll clarify that and and just as a reminder before we run out of time we are also doing another session like this tomorrow right yes i pray if you have other people who are interested or want more information hopefully we can also get additional information from the questions you guys asked today um and have that information for the session tomorrow which i believe is at four o'clock 4 30. uh i think tomorrow is two wait let me go ahead close enough shows how on top of my own scheduling let's see yes that was not meant to be a trick question so tomorrow to clarify thursday at 2 p.m we're having another information session like this will be sharing the information so if you know other people who are interested um and they're not getting the beverly hills bar association blurs again please feel free to forward them for them the link etc we're trying to get as many potential supervising attorneys not only the information but for them to fill out the form so we can connect people yes and feel free to reach out to us directly if you have additional questions the questions that were asked today that i said i'm going to ask the state bar i will do that and then we're going to add those to the bottom of the bhba.org provisional page so that we have the question and the answer from the state bar um um thank you so much for putting this program together really appreciate it uh my question is with regard to malpractice insurance is it going to be on the company or organizations list responsibilities to provide malpractice insurance for the provisional licensee it is um and the state bar is recommending that all the supervising attorneys contact their their insurer um and they said it was somewhat analogous to you know attorneys that you supervise but they recommended that everybody check with their carrier okay thank you very much absolutely okay any other questions oh how much do we um how much we have a question in chat how much input do we have in pairing with the applicant my industry lacks diversity oh got it um we were trying to match up generally based on um practice areas and interest however i will say that most of the applicants have said um they're really willing to do um almost any type of work they're just very interested in getting the experience and earning their um license so um you know feel free in your form to let us know if you have um you know if you if you have particular requests and we'll see what we can do we're we one of the reasons we are we're reaching out um to so many bar associations is um we want to ensure we have a really diverse pool of both supervising attorneys and provisional licensed applicants um you know that reflects our community here in la and uh hopefully this this program will have um the effect of um adding some diversity to our profession so uh hopefully it'll be a win-win and i want to say there is a space on the form or um provisional i mean for the supervising attorneys that if that is something of concern and you want to be connected with someone who has a diverse background or et cetera and i was just thinking too i mean this is also a great opportunity while this is a paid or unpaid kind of volunteer supervising situation um you know that it might create down the road some sort of other type of relationship between this person in your firm or your business or et cetera so um i think that's you know taking that into account when we're sending you information you are going to have the input on who you choose we're not choosing anybody for you we're just selecting information and trying to pair people pair multiple people if you talk to someone and that's not a good fit and you want you know talk to someone else we're going to do whatever we can to try to just assist and facilitate but the final decision is for between you and the provisional applicant absolutely um and if we can be useful in setting up zoom interviews etc um i know on the um we're happy to do that so just reach out um to us if we can um facilitate that i know most folks have um their own accounts but um you know if you have the free account you have a 40 minute limit um so we're happy to facilitate that through the bar too if that's useful linda and anina this is uh beverly williams and i also want to echo a voice of gratitude that you both are putting this on and uh hopefully we do get to source those communities that lack the representation for justice but um in my many years uh practice i have done some volunteer mentorship and i hopefully this question isn't too negative but what happens if you feel uh that the attorney really isn't performing seriously in other words the attorney is pretty much tr uh satisfying the 300 hours but really isn't putting the time in um is there a place where they understand that they need to go back and speak with the higher powers to to determine whether or not they should remain in the program in other words are they just serving the 300 hours and you are giving up your time they don't come in they give excuses is there so the program is quantitative in terms of you know the hours are are what have to be satisfied i haven't seen the declaration for the conclusion of the program what you sign off on as a supervisor but i know that the hope is that the supervising attorneys will mentor um the licensees and um you know give them feedback because the the goal is to um really give people a shot to kind of hit the ground running in the profession um but the the if a supervising attorney decides to terminate supervision um my understanding is that then then that licensee would be suspended from the program so i can imagine that licensees are going to be very motivated to um you know to complete the program and do a really good job this is such a great opportunity you know for people to earn their license um that and everybody that's reached out i will say people started provisional licensee applicants started reaching out to me the day of the supreme court decision um when the bar associations mostly didn't even know about the decision yet um but their folks were on top of this saying you know i am willing to do any type of work this is my background um you know i i would just be really grateful if somebody would be willing to supervise me everybody that i've interacted with that's the um that are recent graduates um has just been incredibly motivated so i'm hopeful that would continue through the program all right thank you so am i okay thank you so much belinda and i'm nina nyanza yes okay so um feel free to reach out with any questions and if you want to join the session tomorrow you're more than welcome to and we will i'm sure be in touch one way or the other if you want to volunteer do

School in 2008 and in 2012 I was looking to take the bar exam in New York I was already licensed in California and I had done that taking another program I will say that bar max in terms of the content was comparable to that other program but what made it a better option for me this time around was that it was affordable they had a Public Interest scholarship which being a public interest attorney was particularly appealing to me and that process to apply and get approved was relatively simple I also liked the flexibility I was working full time and planning a wedding planning a cross-country move and it allowed me to study for the bar exam and feel prepared while still being able to balance the other aspects of my life I was able to study while I was driving by listening to the lectures on the iPad while I was driving while I was preparing dinner I was also able to do the multiple-choice while I was working out and so it really just fit nicely into my life in my schedule I was also really impressed with the multiple-choice questions I liked that that the multiple-choice questions were taken from previous bar exams and I felt when I took the bar exam I felt really prepared for multiple-choice which the last time I took the bar exam and passed I felt that I struggled a little bit more specifically with feeling confident about the multiple-choice section so I will say that that that was really for me a major highlight I liked the various aspects including the lectures that that bar Max had and the multiple choice components I felt really prepared for the bar and I would really recommend this product to to anyone out there who's looking to take the bar exam and is concerned about spending an exorbitant amount of money that some of the other programs charge I was a little concerned about bar Max because I hadn't heard about it before but that's why I'm doing this testimonial because they think it's important for people to know that it's out there to know that just because it's affordable doesn't mean that it's not a good product in fact quite the opposite is true I think it's a great product and for all those of you out there who are studying I wish you the best of luck and hope that whatever bar plan you do end up choosing that it works out well for you", "FqU6mRXAZh4": "- [Narrator] This is a\nFlorida Bar News TV update. - Are you

mentioned we have around 50 clients currently the majority of those are in Colorado but then through our self count or speed camp Pro one we also have a number of clients in five different states are split between full-service audits and self count audits is about 5050 in terms of client numbers let me briefly explain that so our full-service model I'm is like some existing full-service inventory systems that are out there well that means by full services when we perform inventory for a bar we actually physically go to the bar we perform all the tasks for them so we count the inventory we enter the invoices we run the point-of-sale report and double check out counts etc and we're physically at the barn and provide some support and consulting to the managers in contrast our self camp model while we do a full service setup by traveling to the bar and send them all up on an ongoing basis for those clients those clients actually do the counting themselves they're using our scales and software so it's much faster accurate more efficient and then they submit that raw data to us automatically through the cloud we do the data entry and crunch numbers for them remotely and then send them back their reports the same day so that sort of a 22 product model I guess is what we follow at the moment and in terms of client numbers we currently have about the same number of full service clients as self count clients but typically those full service clients are worth around two times as much some of states more expensive when we do the counting and so our revenue is pretty much split with two-thirds of our revenue being full service and one-third of our revenue being self count I'm just to say certainly in more recent years the full service was the original product and the self count has come after that we've definitely seen more growth in self count and we probably expect that trend to continue that has said the realities at the moment are that two-thirds of our revenue comes from full-service audits and we think that it's going to be easier for our franchises succeed when they're doing this blended model between full service and self count a lot of it for scheduling reasons and also because in general our thought is that the type of buyer that wants to do full service is a completely different bar than the type of bar that wants to do self count typically they're interested in one service or the other and so by having the two were able to service a wider of clients in terms of the geography as I said most of our clients are in Colorado probably about maybe fifty percent up in the mountains something like a third are down in Denver and then whatever is left in there is the out-of-state clients and they said that's been a good source of growth for us in recent years in terms of transactions or trying to think about how your business is going to be profitable there is quite strict rules miss franchising so it's important that you basically look at us and make your own calculations and estimations about how much money you can make because it's we're not legally allowed to try and make representations so what I can tell you is that we monitor our average transaction value and when we're doing this to combine them sort of factor in the fact that some our audits are full service and summer self can't we typically count a self can't audit as a half so whatever we earn from to self count audits we equal up to one and compare that with full service and when you do that calculation we always earn the range of sort of two hundred forty dollars as the average audit somewhere as as high as 260 but typically it's been in 240 to 250 dollar range and said we track that on a monthly basis so that's a assisting so really it depends on what your average transaction is depending if you're servicing big clients obviously can charge them more and then also how many audits you can fit into a week and that really is where that blend between full-service audits and self camp audits works very well often I don't typically are not involved in the operational side of things so it's got on our account manager Matt down in Denver who take care of that what we find with offering both full service and self count audiences often you'll do a full service audit in the morning don't do the counting but then there's somewhat of a time crunch because once bars are open it's difficult to their inventory for them so come back home and write your report and when around lunchtime when we write in a report the self count clients have completed their counter so that data starts coming in we spend the afternoon processing those reports so it's much easier said to fill up a schedule fully by having a blend between full service and self count and altering that's how we contribute and make our business profitable so that's up next up we're going to talk about what we have thoughts for the prospects for the future so again thanks for watching", "UcNamD-iCQs": "[Music] [Music] [Laughter] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's already christmas here in sarah [Music] that that is a pudding the round one the sausages this

bar bicep curls and to\nunderstand which is best first we have to know what the biceps actually do and\nthere's two main functions but a lot of us only seem to remember one of them\nwhich is flexing of the forearm that's why every bicep curl involves this\nmotion but what's the other thing that the biceps do well they actually help\nsupinate the forearm and so if we take this information and apply it to bolds\nexercises it's very easy to see that when utilizing an exercise like a\nbarbell bicep curl you're not only flexing the elbow joint to perform the\nmovement but your arms are stuck in the supinated position which means we're\ngetting maximum bicep engagement throughout the entire range of motion\nand now when you use an EZ curl bar because the EZ curl bar obviously has\nthe different grooves in it it allows us to grab the barbell in such a way that\nour hands can be slightly turned in like this so what happens well you're\nsacrificing one of the main movements that the bicep does which is the\nsupination of the forearms so why do people go for this exercise well the\nmain reason is because some people have too much tightness in their wrists that\nit starts to hurt keeping their hands supinated the entire time and the EZ\ncurl bar can help alleviate that pain so my suggestion to you if you don't\nhave wrist pain and you can handle doing straight by bicep curls there's no need\nto incorporate both into your routine stick with the one that gets the most\nbiceps engagement which is the straight bar\nhowever if you start to get pain in your wrist I recommend utilizing the EZ curl\nbar while working on your flexibility and then once your flexibility gets to a\npoint to where you can handle the straight bar switch over to that hope you\nguys enjoyed this

one a day which I have 50 storage for materials so - one day isn't [ __ ] it's gonna take like 50 days we're only on day like 29 so we're good there and fuel which I have a still to be able to convert my food to fuel but anyway so that is it about power the power outpost is the best way to go which I have a mind power outpost right here it's a wind farm actually which is pretty cool so now we're gonna talk about water same exact thing here guys so we can use it as a mod we can go to install water cooler and it supplies water to a facility that's the same thing though you have to turn it on I don't think it costs any fuel or power or anything but you do have to turn it on and it only lasts 45 minutes or something like that and so it's not good for things like the hydroponics that have to have water all the time so if you want hydroponics which is like the late-game build of the farm I would consider getting the water outpost so yeah we can install it as a mod or we can build the facility for a still which works the same way you still have to turn it on it only lasts for a certain amount of time and it's just not the best way to go so we've got our still right here you can see at a still you can convert your food to fuel so this is really good if you just like what I did was get a couple of hydroponic stations that way I can switch it to meds whenever I need it I'm growing really good food and I'm also able to turn that extra food into fuel so that's why I have outposts managing the other resources because I pretty much have food meds and fuel under control so anyway you can see collect water at last it takes five seconds to do and we'll see how long it lasts it provides the whole base with water for one hour and thirty one minutes so that's pretty good but with like I said with the stuff that you need all day there's no point in doing that the only reason I have this still is because I like to convert my few my food into fuel so the third and best way to do it just like the electricity outpost or the power outpost is to get a water outpost I have a water tower right over here now these outposts like this they give them a robinus on top of the supply of power and supply of water so the investment a bonus is gone I mean as you guys probably know it's pretty important whenever you know things go wrong in your community look too many infestations and it's minus 15 or out but I don't see that you can zoom all the way out and see an infestation right you have to be zoomed in a little bit okay there's an infestation I have to be zoomed in a little bit so I see one infestation and that's it there's like one infestation and they're saying there's too many infestations so I don't know what the deal is with like infestations and why I says I need to clear to improve my morale but for the most part I think my morale is doing pretty good you can see the power outpost provides +5 and the let's see the water outpost provides +1 so altogether that's plus 6 I think that's pretty good so anyway that is how to supply water and electricity to your base the long drawn out and boring way hopefully I helped you guys hopefully you got something out of this little video keep an eye out for more state of decay videos now I want to show you guys my cars I'll have the chance at the end of this video because I had no idea that up great vehicles like this I never played the first state of decay actually I did play the first paper just a little bit but not long enough to learn anything about the game at all I was actually thinking it was a multiplayer game and when it wasn't it was made me really sad so but I'm really glad they made the second one freakin multiplayer so anyways like I said I've been making videos to help other people out and one of those things I came across was souping up vehicles now you can see I've got like a Jurassic Park looking a truck over here I think it's called what the Big Boss Big Boss and I didn't name these this is like how it comes but if you guys want to know how to upgrade your vehicles to look like this I think this one is one of my favorite I've also got like a couple of these SUVs armored up I think I've got a police car armored up let's see oh we've got this classic like Daytona looking charger over here and we've got some utility trucks and some other stuff like that we've got a little armored up a little family sedan looking thing over here actually that reminds me of the car from The Simpsons of that comic book guy but anyway dudes that is all I want to show you guys check out my channel for more how to's and stuff like that Herald stated k2 and I will catch you guys on the", "2FpMve7iFso": "STEP ONE OF PHASE FOUR.

MASSACHUSETTS CONTINUES TO MAKE\nPROGRESS IN ITS COVID-19 VACCINATION PROGRAM. HERE IN STUDIO C, WE CONTINUE TO\nFOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCING PROTOCOLS, MAKING SURE TO PUT\nPLENTY OF SPACE BETWEEN ALL OF US. AT THE CENTER DESK THIS MORNING\nIS BEN DOWNING. FROM 2007 TO 2017 HE SERVED IN\nTHE STATE SENATE, REPRESENTING THE BERKSHIRES AND WESTERN MASS. JUST 24-YEARS-OLD WHEN HE BEGAN\nHIS FIRST TERM, BORN IN PITTSFIELD, HE HAS A B.A. FROM\nPROVIDENCE COLLEGE AND A MASTER\u2019S FROM TUFTS. THE GREEN TIE IS VERY SEASONALLY\nAPPROPRIATE. BEN: THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. JANET: GOVERNOR BAKER IS OPENING\nVACCINE APPOINTMENTS TO ANYONE OVER 16 YEARS OLD IN\nMASSACHUSETTS IN A MONTH. SHOULD HE HAVE DELAYED SPECIAL\nACCESS TO CERTAIN GROUPS TO MOVE EVERYONE UP A LITTLE SOONER? BEN: I DON\u2019T THINK SO. I THINK THE GOVERNOR WAS RIGHT\nIN THE ROLLOUT HERE. THE FRUSTRATING THING WITH THE\nVACCINE ROLLOUT IS WE SCRAPPED THE CRISIS RESPONSE PLAN THAT\nMASSACHUSETTS HAD BEEN PLANNING FOR TWO DECADES. WE HAVE HAD A FRAGMENTED\nRESPONSE TO THE PANDEMC LEAVING 351 CITIES AND TOWNS TO MUDDLE\nTHROUGH ON THEIR OWN. WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A SIMPLIFIED\nPREREGISTRATION FROM THE BEGINNING THAT WOULD HAVE\nALLOWED US TO PRIORITIZE EQUITY, PARTNER WITH LOCAL BOARDS OF\nHEALTH, PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS,\nTO GET TO THE COMMUNITIES HARDEST HIT WITH THE PANDEMIC,\nTHOSE WITH THE HIGHEST INFECTION RATES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND\nIN THE VACCINE ROLLOUT\u2019S AGAIN. WE HAVE A VACCINE ROLLOUT THAT\nHAS ADDED TO CONFUSION, ANXIETY, BUILT ON INEQUITIES WE\nALREADY SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IS WE\nHAVE THE TALENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. A COMPANY FROM BURLINGTON IS\nHELPING OTHER STATES WITH THEIR ROLLOUT. IT IS A MOTHER ON MATERNITY\nLEAVE DEVELOPING A BETTER WEBSITE THAN OUR STATE I.T. IS\nABLE TO DEVELOP. IT DIDN\u2019T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. WE HAVE THE SPACE AND TIME TO\nPLAN FOR IT. WE DIDN\u2019T HAVE THE LEADERSHIP\nTHAT TAPPED INTO THE COMMUNITY. JANET: BAKER WAS GETTING GOOD\nREVIEWS FROM MOST VOTERS BEFORE THE VACCINE ROLLOUT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT PART OF\nIT? BEN: NO. I DON\u2019T THINK SO. WHERE WE HAVE STRUGGLED THEN WE\nHAVE SEEN IT ON THE VACCINE ROLLOUT, BUT IN TESTING AS WELL,\nIS THAT HARD-HIT COMMUNITIES LIKE CHELSEA, LAWRENCE, AND THE\nGATEWAY CITIES, THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST INFECTION RATES HAD\nTROUBLE GETTING TESTING, HAD TROUBLE GETTING ACCESS TO THE\nRESOURCES THEY NEED TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC, AND MORE\nIMPORTANTLY THE COMMUNITIES WERE LEFT BEHIND BEFORE THE PANDEMIC\nCAME. THEY WERE LEFT EXPOSED TO ALL OF\nTHE TROUBLES THAT CAME FROM THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE WE HAVEN\u2019T\nACTED WITH URGENCY TO MEET THE MOMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN THOSE\nCOMMUNITIES THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THEM STRONGER. ED: WHEN YOU SAY WE, YOU MEAN\nTHE GOVERNOR? BEN: ALL LEADERSHIP ON BEACON\nHILL. IT STARTS WITH THE GOVERNOR, BUT\nALL LEADERSHIP ON BEACON HILL. ED: YOU TWEETED THIS WEEK STATE\nPOLICE OFFICERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WORK IF THEY REFUSE\nTO GET THE COVID VACCINE. NO VACCINE, NO JOB. THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU,\nWOULD YOU APPLY THIS POLICY TO ALL LAW-ENFORCEMENT? ALL FIREFIGHTERS? ALL FIRST RESPONDERS? WOULD YOU FIRE ANYONE WHO\nREFUSES TO BE VACCINATED BEN: THE DECISIONS WOULD HAVE TO\nBE MADE AT THE PROPER JURISDICTION. LOCAL LEADERS MAKE LOCAL\nDECISIONS. THERE\u2019S A REASON WE PUT FIRST\nRESPONDERS AND FRONT-LINE WORKERS FIRST. WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO\nPICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THOSE WHO SERVE THEM WHEN THEY NEED\nTHEM. THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD THINK\nABOUT WHEN YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN IS IF I CALL THE STATE POLICE\nWILL I BE THREATENING MY OWN HEALTH? THE FRUSTRATING THING IN A LOT\nOF THE DISCUSSION AROUND THIS IS WE DON\u2019T KNOW WHY UP TO 30% OF\nFTES AT THE STATE POLICE WERE NOT TAKING THEIR VACCINATIONS. IT SEEMS THERE WAS A SHOULDER\nSHRUG AROUND IF IT EVEN MATTERED IF WE YOUR DOUBT WHY. JANET: WOULD YOU FIRE A STATE\nTROOPER -- BEN: THAT SHOULDN\u2019T BE THE\nFIRST STEP. WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT WHY THEY\nHAVEN\u2019T GOTTEN IT. WE DON\u2019T KNOW HOW MANY DID NOT\nGET IT AT THE BARRACKS GOT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT\nINFORMATION. IT WAS RIGHT TO PRIORITIZE THEM,\nBUT IT IS RIGHT TO INSIST THEY GET THE VACCINE. ED:ED: IT SHOULD BE ON THE LIST\nOF REASONS FOR DISMISSAL. YOU WOULDN\u2019T PUT IT AS NUMBER\nONE, BUT YOU WOULD PUT IT THERE? BEN: YES. JANET: LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT YOUR\nPLANS POST PANDEMIC? DO YOU THINK EMPLOYERS,\nINCLUDING THE STATE, SHOULD KEEP MOST WORKERS WORKING VIRTUALLY\nAT LEAST PART TIME? BEN: WE NEED TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY\nTO EMPLOYERS TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE. IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF WORK,\nTHE STATUS OF THAT COMPANY\u2019S ECONOMIC HEALTH. THE STATE NEEDS TO CREATE THE\nFLEXIBLE CONDITIONS. THIS IS WHERE THE STATE CAN LEAD\nBY PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THOSE BUSINESSES AS THEY GROW SO THEY\nCAN MAKE DECISIONS WITH THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN\nMIND. I DON\u2019T THINK THERE IS A\nONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL FOR EVERY COMPANY OR EVERY COMMUNITY. JANET: IF YOU ARE THE GOVERNOR\nYOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT STATE WORKERS. WOULD YOU KEEP STATE WORKERS WHO\nCAN FUNCTION AT HOME AT HOME? BEN: YES. JANET: THIS WOULD MAKE A HUGE\nSHIFT IN THE REAL ESTATE BECAUSE THE STATE RENTS A LOT OF SPACE\nFOR WORKERS. YOU ARE WILLING TO SHUT THAT\nDOWN? BEN: YES. WE NEED TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT\nWE ARE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CAME. TECHNOLOGY HAS ALLOWED US TO\nOPERATE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WE SHOULDN\u2019T JUMP AND THINK IT\nIS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE SHIFT AT THIS POINT. I KNOW, AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR\nMYSELF, BUT BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS I\u2019VE HAD ACROSS\nTHE STATE, PEOPLE ARE EXCITED TO BE WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES, THEIR\nNEIGHBORS, AT WORK, A COOK, A NUMBER OF PLACES. THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO CONTINUE\nTO SOCIAL DISTANCE, THE WEAR MASKS, IMPROVE THE VACCINE\nROLLOUT SO WE HAVE OPTIONS TOGETHER. WE SHOULDN\u2019T MAKE DECISIONS\nAROUND IT BASED ON BEHAVIOR THAT WE DON\u2019T YET KNOW WHAT IT WILL\nLOOK LIKE. ED: THIS IS 2021. THE GOVERNOR\u2019S ELECTION DOES NOT\nPOP UP UNTIL 20 22. IT IS STILL EARLY, BUT SHOULD\nMORE DEMOCRATS INTO THE RACE ALREADY? BEN: I DON\u2019T KNOW. EVERYONE WILL MAKE THEIR OWN\nDECISION ON IF THEY WANT TO GET INTO THE RACE OR NOT. I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING BEING\nIN THE RACE, MEETING VOTERS WHERE THEY ARE AT IN COMMUNITIES\nFROM PITTSFIELD TO EAST BOSTON AND IN BETWEEN. I SUSPECT WE WILL HAVE A LOUD,\nMESSY PRIMARY, AND I THINK THAT\u2019S A HEALTHY THING. WE SHOULD PUT BEFORE VOTERS THE\nIDEAS OUT THERE AND LET THEM CHOOSE THE BEST CANDIDATE TO\nLEAD THE PARTY AND BUILD A STRONGER, FAIRER MASSACHUSETTS. I THINK THAT\u2019S ME, BUT IT\u2019S ON\nME TO MAKE THE CASE. ED: LOOK AT THE MAYOR FIELD FOR\nBOSTON AND HOW DIVERSE THAT IS. DO YOU ENCOURAGE WOMEN AND\nPEOPLE OF COLOR TO JOIN YOU AND RUN FOR THE STATE\u2019S TOP JOB? BEN: THERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OF\nTALENT THAT SHOULD GET INTO THE RACE, JUST LIKE BOSTON. THE MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE\nPROCESS BRINGS NEW VOICES, ENGAGES NEW VOTERS, MAKES US\nSTRONGER AS A COMMONWEALTH. JANET: FEDERAL DOLLARS HAVE\nHELPED MANY BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT FROM GOING UNDER\nDURING THE PANDEMIC AND PREVENTED MANY FROM GOING UNDER,\nBUT THE STATE STILL DIPPED INTO THE RAINY DAY ACCOUNT. DO YOU THINK IT\u2019S TIME FOR A\nSTATEWIDE TAX HIKE? WHICH ONE IS BEST? BEN: I THINK THAT THE STATE WAS\nRIGHT TO DIP INTO THE RAINY DAY ACCOUNT RATE. IT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR TO AVOID\nDEEPER CUTS TO THE BUDGET OVERALL. I THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE\nWEALTHY TO PAY MORE IN TAXES. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE TAX\nREFORMS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AND\nRACIAL JUSTICE. I THINK WE DO THAT BY MAKING\nSURE THE WEALTHY PAY MORE ON THEIR TAXES SO YOU CAN INVEST IN\nUNIVERSAL CHILDCARE, TRANSPORTATION, PUBLIC HIGHER\nEDUCATION, AND HOUSING. JANET: WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION\nOF WEALTHY? BEN: YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE\nPROPOSALS LIKE GOVERNOR PATRICK MADE IN 2014 WHERE WE WOULD ASK\nMORE OF THOSE AT THE VERY LEAST TO MAKE MORE THAN 500000 AND\nCERTAINLY THOSE WHO MAKE $250,000. ED: PRESIDENT BIDEN IS TALKING\nABOUT $450,000. YOU ARE IN THE SAME BALLPARK? BEN:BEN: IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE\nOVERALL PROPOSAL. ALL OF THOSE MERIT DISCUSSION. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO\nRECOGNIZE TAXES IN MASSACHUSETTS PUT AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THE POOR\nAND WORKING POOR IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO\nREDUCE POVERTY, ADDRESS RACIAL JUSTICE. WE CAN ASK MORE OF THE WEALTHY\nWHO BENEFITED FROM ECONOMIC GROWTH.", "X5luKBvnRdw": "hello everyone welcome to another episode of the 808 podcast podcast where i interview business owners ceos

We will give her father \nsome diarrhoea pills. We will give a strong dose.\nHe will not leave the washroom. Take a kiss! Tell her to put a burkha and run away. And speak in a strong voice. Disconnect the call. 'I will come on a horse.' Hey! Is this tea or coffee? \n- Coffee. Do you call it coffee?\nIt taste like some syrup. I will teach you to prepare coffee. \nCome on.

Okay sir. Order the coffee. I will be there before you finish it. Alright. Rajni! \n- Excuse me. Chaman! \n- Yes Chaman! I met you after separating from you \nat the fair. No matter what it is.\nDestiny allows us to meet in time. It's something like that.\n- What are you doing here? I got your sister-in-law here for a meal.\n- Hello brother! Is it a male in a female form? It was your idea. \n- Yes. Yes. Let's go. Hey! Did you find a place for her to stay? Dude, don't worry about it. Just worry about my marriage. Get a pen and paper. \n- Get a pen. Don't bring a black pen.\nThe emotions bloom out. Sir, here. Take her to the registrar's office. And get married there. Alright. \n- We will come as witness. Alright. \n- I will feed you. Give me a kiss. Did you understand the plan?\n- Do you have any courtesy? Stand up. I am waiting for you since 2 hours. You are teaching him love tricks. Come on speak up. Sir, sorry. Sorry my foot! You have no right to say sorry. I wasted my time\non a stupid person like you. I am ashamed of myself\nthinking about it. Why are you feeling ashamed? We are shameless since we are born. We sold whatever shame was left. We are alive because of that. By the way I was beaten up\nmany times for love sake. Because of that beating\nI found my princess. Whom am I arguing with? Rajni, was he your father? No. He is the father of a girl whose\nmatch he came for. - Your wife's father? Uncle! Uncle! Listen to me. I want to confess something. Rajni is a good boy.\nYou won't find a boy like him. So give him your daughter. What did you say?\n- I mean get them married. Hey! Get out. I am already out. Should I die now? \n- Chaman, go away. He was playing with you.\n- Yes, I know. What is this nonsense? Sir, please don't mind his words. Sir, I want to tell you something. Sometimes I don't remember things. If I am busy with something\nand I get some other work in between. I forget the first job completely. My office staff told me\nyou are waiting for me. But my friend called up\nso I forgot about it. I didn't want to hurt you. Please forgive me if possible. You have such an illness. Am I a fool to get my daughter \nmarried to you? Listen, you are a mean person. Don't think about my daughter. Don't try to meet me. Or else... Eat your food. I am not hungry. \n- Why? This is not the first time. Then why do you look sad? Gunna builds your image\nand you ruin it always. Once you get married. We will get to play\nwith our grandchildren's. We will have a daughter-in-law. She will take care of the house.\nYour mother will take some rest. Don't forget this. \n- Yes. As though I forget it purposely. If you don't forget it purposely\nthen remember it on purpose. You have ruined life.\nI feel like breaking my head. Ramnathan,\nwhy don't you take him to a doctor? I have taken him to a specialist. He said nothing can be done.\nHe's imperfect. He troubled us.\n- Again the same thing. - Shut up! I will give you a last idea. Find someone just like you. And run away with her. Don't forget her on the way. If you want you can forget us. I didn't ask you to find a wife for me. If you find one get married to her. I am ready for it.\nI will bless your marriage. Go away. - Ramnathan,\nshall I talk to him? - Eat your food. 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' How many calls will you make?\nI told you I am on the way. I am not Superman to fly \nand reach there. Rajni, where are you? Come quickly or the boss will die. I didn't ask him to dance\nin the bathroom with his maid. Look, I tell you if he dies. Our life will be ruined. So come soon.\nHis cuss words are hurting. Wait! Wait! \n- Hello! Hello Rajni. Excuse me.\nWhere are you going? The place where she is going.\n- Oh, you are a blood donor. Yes. \n- Show me your I.D card? 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' Hey, where are you? Come soon.\n- I already donated my blood. It will reach you in time. \n- You donated blood. Where did you do it? Nurse, which floor is this?\n- First floor. - I'm at the first floor. Hey! You went to the first floor.\nYou had to come to the third floor. He didn't tell me. Nurse.\n- Yes. - Can I get my blood back? Once you buy something\nyou can't return it. Sorry! I could remember\nthat I had to donate blood. I forgot where to donate it. The boss is asking me.\nWhat will I tell him? He can't have my blood. Hell! You forgot it again. Hey! The boss will surely die now. Alright I'm leaving.\nTell me which cemetery I must come. Where are you going? Rajni? Sir, is the blue car\nat the parking yours? My car is not in the parking area.\nIt's on the road... Oh! My car? How did you forget? Sorry ma'am. It's a mistake. Your mistake can kill someone. Is a child's life not important for you? Actually... \n- Don't give me excuses. If the child doesn't get blood in half\nan hour it will be difficult to save her. I'm sorry ma'am.\n- Your sorry will not help. Don't worry ma'am the man\nwho came with you donated blood. - Who? He forgot his I.D card here. And the patient? - You can check\nthe patient, the treatment is done. My car is damaged.\n- Pay for the damage. Or I will get you arrested. It's a small scratch. \nIt will get repaired. Do you call it a scratch? \nThe lights, bumper are damaged. Sorry sir. Don't get angry.\nTell us the expenses. Two five times is 10.\n- Let's go. - It will cost 20,000. Oh my God! 20,000.\n- I won't reduce it. Hello! Who is it? - Sir, you\ndonated blood at the hospital today. Is it? That is why I am feeling giddy. Yes. So what? \n- Nothing. I just wanted to thank you for it. Okay. You are welcome.\nShall I disconnect? - Sir, one moment. I have your I.D card.\n- I will take it from you tomorrow. Sir. Again. Thanks a lot. If you didn't come on time... You are calling at the wrong time. \nDisconnect the call. Stupid! \n- Talk to him. Why are we standing here?\nOkay tell me what to do. Cash? Is cash okay? How much? - The amount\nthat will do our work. Are you insane? Tell me the amount. Sir, 15,000. \n- 15,000? Are you mad? I won't pay more than 12,000. We are lucky. I think he's mad.\nLet's take the money and leave. Take it. Count it.\n- Remember us if you need a scratch again. Bye sir. Thank you.\n- Bye! They did the damage. I paid for it. Wait! My money! He is different from others. Very unique. Hey! What are you murmuring about? Is everything fine? Sister-in-law, do you know\nI met the best man in this world. Whom are you talking about? Is he better than me? Dad! I was trying to get\nA negative blood since 2 days. But the one who was ready\nto donate it didn't come. A miracle took place instead.\nAn angel came in suddenly. He saved that child's life \nby giving his blood. Is it? \n- Even I didn't believe it. But when I called up he reacted\nas though he didn't do anything. Dad, do you know\nwhen I said thanks to him. He was not ready to accept the favour. There are few people who help others. If they help\nit's for publicity and praise. It proves you have met\na great hearted person. I met a man too.\n- Is it? He has no right to live in this world. He irritated me. Anyway, forget it. It will be rude\nif you just thank on the phone. Give him some chocolate or sweets \nand say thanks. Alright. I had snack in the morning.\nIt's four hours. When will she come? Brother, is she my sister-in-law? She looks very pretty. Not like junior artist.\n- I feel everyone is a heroine. Here comes the bad luck. How are you uncle?\n- Why have you come here? Have you come to take\nthe body after the post-mortem? My boss is strong. Both of you... \n- Forget it. Who will come to meet him? I came to meet my girlfriend. \n- Girlfriend. Yes. Your sister-in-law.\n- And good fortune of my family. She took a litre of blood. And made him fall in love.\n- Oh, I get it now. You forgot the boss's favour for love.\nI will curse you. You won't find your girlfriend\neven in Google. Unlucky fellow.\n- Why are you interested? If he forgets things. I'll remind him. Brother, don't listen to him. 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' Hello! \n- Hello sir. I had called up.\nYou forgot your I.D card. I am calling again\nto remind you of that. Who is it Rajni? \n- It's a nurse. Nurse? - Yes. I am in the hospital.\nBring it to the ground floor. Sorry sir! I can't come today. But if you want\nyou can take it from my dance school. Alright.\nI will take it from your shop. Sir. Sir.\nAre you sure you will take it? What a question?\nI told you I will take it. Disconnect the call. \n- Block her. Why is the nurse interested in me? Looks like she is impressed \nwith your I.D card. When you take back the card.\nTell her I love you! No. No. Never. When I am in love with someone else.\nWhat do I got to do with a nurse? 'It's ruined.' \n- Hello! - Hello Sir! Hello! Where are you? I've reached. Sir! Turn to the left.\n- Yes. I turned. Now what? Hi! Hi! \n- Hi! Hi! \n- I. D. Card. Here it is. Do you dance? She teaches cooking.\n- Not cooking. But I take a dance class. It's the same thing.\nYou need to eat for both reasons. But I don't understand\nhow did you get my I.D card? Actually the patient you\nsaved yesterday is my student. God, you are great!\nIt's my luck that I donated blood. Whom are you talking to looking up? It's a petition. I asked for a boon if that child gets\nhealed I'll feed biscuits to the dogs. You are a great man. If you meet my dad once. I would like it. \n- I will meet him. I've to meet him.\nOr the match won't be fixed. Fix the match? What do you mean? As every relationship starts\nwith something or the other. We started with blood. Great people talk great things. You are really a great man. Who? \n- She is talking about you. Okay. Me. I wanted to ask you something.\nIf you don't mind can I meet you daily? Why? \n- Dance. To learn dancing. Oh! Dance? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Actually outsiders are not allowed her. But if you have\na younger brother or sister then you can come here daily. She wants to peep in on the\npretext of dance class. - Shut up! Alright. I will get my brother\ntomorrow and get him dancing. - Yes. What are you doing?\nWhere will you get a brother from? He's mischievous.\nSo I want to learn something in life. That's fine. But... Don't call me ma'am.\nJust call me Vandana. Your name is so sweet. I am getting late for class. Shall I leave now?\n- Yes. Please! Okay bye. \n- Bye. Free. The sister is free \nwith the brother. One free uncle with another.\nAnd a maid also free. If you want grandma is for free too. One lakh per day minus GST. Along with that\nvanity van is compulsory. Ma'am, if we give you salary.\nWe will have nothing left. Yes. \n- Your budget is high. Next. I said a younger brother not sister. Look at his skin colour. Where did you get him from? He must look similar to me not you. Rajni, don't be racist. Dark people are loving.\n- I will change his colour. Give me a white plate.\n- Yes. Here. You! Give me.\nMy bowl is empty. Drop some money. Rajni, don't think of\nmaking that beggar your brother. I have thought of it.\n- Sister, tell him to give me money. Rajni, he is right for you. His face looks similar to yours. If you had a brother\nhe would look like him. I found someone. Hi! \n- Hi! Hi! \n- Give a rupee. - Control. He is my brother Khatora Das.\n- Khatora Das? What kind of a name is this? I held a bowl when I was born.\nSo I got this name. Oh! How cute! Somiya, get an application form. Sister, I have seen him somewhere. Brother! Brother! Give money quickly. Khatora Das is coming here.\nHide your face quickly. Brother! Brother! Give me some money. I told you to get lost.\n- If I eat I will bless you. I haven't eaten anything because of her. If possible give me to eat. Don't marry this miser. He is a greater beggar than me. I wish not to meet you again. Hey you are a beggar right? Vandana, I know this boy well. Hello! He begs from lovers\nat the park and troubles them. They run away on seeing him. \n- What? These people dressed him up \nand got him here. There is something fishy here. Don't say anything, son.\nOr we'll be in trouble. Is this true? Yes it's true. He is a beggar. Where do you live?\n- At Anand Nagar. How are the people there?\nDo they give alms? He started his business. Stop him. \n- Stop. Stop. Why are you begging at the dance class? It's true. He is a beggar. But he is not a thief.\nHe's an unlucky child. Who is not a beggar here?\nI and you, all are beggars. He begs from the rich. While we beg from God. His mother made him to beg. \n- Is it? But his father said\njust like his brothers he will not be a beggar,\nbut he will have a good family. Brother! She called me beggar only once. You called me beggar\nso many times already. You are not a beggar. You are our child.\n- You called my family a beggar. That's why I adopted him. Adopted him. He was born as a beggar. But he won't leave this world \nas a beggar. I promised his father. I will make you the best dancer of\nthe world not just the city or nation. Even if I have to see\nthis dance teacher secretly. My brother! Wow! I feel like a peacock is dancing. Come on. Stupid. What we were talking about? Fourth day on the 3rd. \n- Yes. The fourth day on the 3rd. Sit down. Whose picture is this? Hello! Sit down Rajni. Why have you come here?\n- Just like that. Won't you ask what will I have? I told her are you mad? It's a good opportunity to overact. Listen brother, here. Have my shirt. No. I am fine. Okay. \n- But I want your watch. It's my time. \n- Hey, ice-cream. Sit down. I will get it.\n- Get the sweetest ice-cream. - Here. It's very nice. I thought you will get an ice-cream\nfor me. But you are having it alone. I heard it on news there\nare drugs in the ice-cream so I was checking \nbefore giving it to you. Give her an ice-cream too. \n- Okay sir. I got saved. What are you doing? Will you ruin\nthe family's name? Dance like this. Now clean the glass in this manner. Wait! I will show you. \n- Let's go. It's so amazing. I can't bear it anymore. Come here. \n- What are you doing? Rajni, keep me down. Please! Hi! What is this? Where are your shoes? An old man was walking bare foot. I gave him my shoes. We are meeting after so many years. Where is your son?\n- He said he will come to pick me up. Okay. Here he comes. Oh! Welcome Ajay! How are you? I am good. How are you? Good. \n- Dad, shall we go? - Okay. Wait! You just came in.\nHave some coffee. Sorry uncle. I have some urgent work. Doesn't matter.\nWe will have coffee some other day. Dad! Let's have coffee. Please have coffee. Satya! I feel Ajay likes your daughter. Don't be surprised. You are searching a groom for Vandana. I am searching a wife for my son. If they are ready to marry each other. We will convert our\nfriendship to relationship. Dad! What's this? They have come for the first time.\nAnd this is how they behave? It was so embarrassing.\n- Speak softly. The boy's family will hear us.\n- So what? Let them listen.\nI don't like him at all. I will stay single.\nBut won't marry a policeman. Cool down. Cool down.\nI'll talk to them. Sorry! We have seen many girls. But he didn't like anyone. He liked Vandana on first sight. That's why I told you\nwhat I felt without thinking. I am sorry, friend. Don't say that. Actually my daughter\ndoesn't like policemen. Son, don't... \n- It's okay, uncle. Thank you. Dad! Let's go. Alright. Eat on time.\n- Give the phone to Vandana. Yes. Wait. Your brother wants to speak to you. Vandana! \n- Hello! Vandana! \n- Hello Vandana! Listen, I feel she's in bad mood. Call her up later. Alright. I will call later. Bye. \n- Bye! What happened?\nDidn't he propose to you yet? I understand everything. Now tell me. No. It's nothing like that. We are just friends. But I like him a lot. But I don't know\nhow he feels about me. But under some pretext. He comes to meet me\nat the dance class daily. This is called love. Is it? \n- Yes. Listen to what I say. Don't show your love\nfor him for a few days. First find out if he loves you or not. Okay sister-in-law. Done. Brother, give some alms. \n- Hi! Hi! He dropped it. Wow! He gave me a bike for alms. Brother, you are not God.\nYou are greater than him. Sister, he is a good man. Take care of him. \n- Yes! Come on. Hi! \n- Hi! You are truly large hearted.\n- I am feeling shy. Come on. Don't you have classes today? So you are pulling my leg. No. You gave your bike to that beggar. That's why I am saying this. Bike? \n- Yes. Look. Bye! Bye! I will come back in a moment. Where are you going?\nI will go and find the waiter. Hey! Wait! That is my bike. If I go home without the bike my dad will \nthrow me out of the house. - Forget it. A hungry man doesn't return his\nfood or a naked man his clothes. But this food,\nI mean the bike is mine. I forget things. I gave it by mistake. If you have Alzheimer eat almonds. Have pity on me! Return my bike. Why are you kicking?\nIt's a bike not a horse. How do you go to the second gear? Press the clutch and pull up the gear. It's so great. \n- Hey, wait. 'It's ruined. It's ruined.'\n- There's less soil. Hello darling! Do you know I waited for you yesterday? At least you could\ncall up and inform me. I forgot her because of the bike. My sister Chanda had come for donations. I went to give her donation. You are lying right? You feel I am lying. No. I was kidding. I know you are not like normal people. You are right. I am not normal. I won't talk to you. Ma'am, teacher, nurse.\nI don't like these words. Call me by my name. Alright. I will call you by name. Oh! What was her name? Hey! What's your sister-in-law's name? She is called sister-in-law. I would have told you\nthe real name if I was with you. Hello! If you don't want to\ntalk to me then please tell me. No. Actually I am going\nto take your name for the first time. I was thinking why we don't meet instead\nof taking your name on the phone. You are really very different. Okay. I want to ask you a question. But don't lie to me. I never lie. And I never faced the truth. Do you... What? That do you..\n- Yes. Go on. I'm listening. I was asking if... Do you like me or not?\n- I am sorry for the interruption. Hi sir! \n- Thank you Rajni. Thank you? Why? To donate your blood. Your blood freed me from death.\nHappy Independence day! You forgot it after donating blood. You are welcome sir.\n- Give him sweets. Why did you get me sweets?\nInstead you could raise my salary. Come on the 32nd of next month. Actually he is going on leave.\nI will give you his salary. Let's do the funeral rite. \nI mean let's do the office work. You are acting smart \nand he has no values. The blood was tasty. \n- Bye. If I told boss the truth\nyou wouldn't get sweets. - Let it be. Have sweets and enjoy. Hello! Hello! The sweet seems to be stale. Disgusting! Sweets should be sweet.\nThis is tasteless. Surely it's not pure. Near the tea stall. - Yes.\n- There's a dance school behind it. Yes. - You get the best sweets there.\n- Dance school? - Is it? The queue is very long. \n- Queue? Yes. Sometimes months pass by. Even my girlfriend was on call.\n- You can stand in the queue. Hey! Hi! \n- Hi! I am still here. Tell me. Sorry! My boss had come.\nI was talking to him. Did you finish your classes? Yes. It's over. Good. You were saying something? Nothing much.\nI was just joking. Joke? I like people who joke. I don't remember jokes.\nOr I would tell you a few jokes. By the way I wanted to tell\nyou something since a few days. I don't know\nif this is the right time or not. But can I ask you a question. Do you... Yes? Do you take a monthly salary? Or you get fees per class? No. If it's less.\nYou need not tell me. - What? Bye! Vandana, your phone is ringing. Hey! Rajni is calling up. I feel he doesn't like me. Why is he calling up now?\nDisconnect the call. Hello! - Hello darling! Just a moment.\nI will give the phone to Vandana. Talk to him.\nHe is calling you darling. Hello! Wanted to go for a movie.\n- Who wants to go? If I am calling you up\nthen we two are going right? Come quickly.\n- No. I am not coming. Look, don't break\nmy heart by refusing my request. I have taken the tickets already.\nSo don't refuse me. In this movie\nthe hero flies like Superman. It was a stupid joke. I am not interested.\nI am not coming. Looks like you are still angry on me. Don't get angry. By the way I wanted\nto tell you something important. You told me the most\nimportant thing. What else is left? No. Don't do it.\nMy honey, sweetie, custard. Dumbo! Don't you understand? I am sure he loves you. The movie is an excuse.\nHe will surely propose today. Sister-in-law, really? Are you sure he loves me? Definitely! Talk to him. \n- Hello! Hello! Speak to him. \n- Hello! - Hello! What time is the show? She agrees.\nReach Movie Time theatre at 7 PM. Okay. \n- Okay. Bye! \n- Bye! Yes! Did you see that old man? Vandana, how are you? I thought it's you from far.\nI recognized you. Have you come to watch a movie? If I am at a theatre then\nI will surely watch a movie, right? I won't shop here right? It means you are still angry on me. Why do you wait\nfor the person who's not here? I am here.\nWe can enjoy together. I am talking about the movie. I am not on duty.\nWe can watch the movie. You can consider me your friend. No. Thanks! No matter how much you fly away.\nI will trap you one day. Don't take something given in alms.\n- No old man. I don't leave alms ever. Hit the coin. Wow! You'll die in any moment, but you still eye on the queen. The queen is loved by all. What is he talking about? The queen of the game. \n- Yes. You are already shivering. But I can still play.\n- You can't do it. Today the queen will be mine. It won't go. Hit it. I say it won't go in. \n- It will. I feel something is wrong. Oh my God! The movie. I didn't go there\nwhile I called her to watch it. Do you want to pee? Don't worry.\nThe queen will surely go in. You just said my hands are shivering. The real queen is here.\nConcentrate on your performance. Focus on the queen. It has to go inside the pocket. Aim at it. Don't worry at all. You can do it. You can do it. Will you have juice and hit it?\n- No. After I get the queen. Are you waiting for\nan auspicious time to hit the queen? Come on uncle. Hit it. He took the queen! Thank God for saving uncle. Dad, this is your second\nwonder after I was born. Uncle, drink some juice.\n- Not a glass. Give me the whole can. What are you watching? Give it here. Open your mouth. Taste life. Rajni, what you did today\nis a mathematical miracle! It's a medical miracle. I meant to say the same thing.\nA miracle is a miracle. Dad, you are great. Rajni! All the doctors had lost hope. That my dad's death is confirmed. But you didn't lose hope. You saved my dad through carom. Give me a hug. Our secret will be out \nwith his overacting. Let it go on. Sharma, switch off the radio.\n- Alright. Dad! Your life is saved. Let's go. Can we play another game? He is still excited. Take care.\n- I feel it's affected him. Where do I leave him?\n- Near the gutter. Actually uncle didn't have\nanything since a week. It was important\nto play carom to save his life. That is why I didn't come \nto the theatre. I thought I would\ncall and inform you. But... I could think of only one thing. Uncle's life slipping away from him. I sacrificed our meeting for him. I am sorry. \n- No. No. Don't embarrass me. Even though you didn't come.\nBut you saved a life. There can't be a better deed\nthan saving a life in this world. You are not a human being.\nBut an angel in the form of human. If everyone is like you in this world. Then no one will have any problem. When the secret will be out.\nYou will be in trouble. After seeing this do you know how I feel about you? How? \n- You are above all. If she finds out the truth.\nShe will kill you. As you didn't come for the movie I came here to break our friendship. But after seeing this\nmy respect for you has grown. We will meet tomorrow morning. Bye!\n- Bye! Hey! You come to this area \nfor prostitution. What? What are you saying?\n- We know everything about you. Come on. Come on. - Shut up!\n- Leave! Leave me. Hasn't Vandana come home yet? It's her call. \n- Okay. Hello! \n- Dad! What happened?\nWhy are you crying? I am at the police station.\n- What are you saying? Why? I don't know. - Look! Don't worry.\nGive the phone to the officer. My dad is calling up. Talk to him. Yes sir. Sir, why did you arrest her?\nWhat did she do? We arrested her for prostitution. Prostitution. It's not possible. Listen to me. Get a lawyer\nin half an hour and bail her out. Or you will get\nyour daughter through court. Sir! Sir! Sir! Dad, what happened? Vandana is arrested by the police. I will go and get her home. Did you do something again? Listen! I am outside Vandana's house. Did you forget what to do next? I didn't forget anything.\nA car just left from her home. Maybe it's my father-in-law's car. I planned to meet Vandana at midnight. But I am thinking of going in right now.\nIf I forget it will create problems. Look, this is the right time to tell\nher your feelings or you will forget. Do you think she will agree?\n- Yes. She has fallen in love with you. Go and talk to her to confirm it.\n- Alright. 'The number you are dialling \nis switched off.' Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Nothing will happen. Boss, is there any hospital close by? The hospital is at the main road. You are on the wrong road. I forgot it. Tell me where is it? Take a right from ahead. Then left. Then take a U-turn. Forget that.\nIsn't there any other way? Reverse your car and take a right turn. Sir! - Who arrested her?\n- Sir, I arrested her. It's a prostitution case.\n- Prostitution? - Yes. Do you know who she is?\nShe is my wife. I am going to marry her. Did you have a drink? Sir, it's my mistake. I am so sorry. Tell her sorry not me. Ma'am, it's my mistake. \n- Go now. Sorry uncle. You may leave. Who parked the bike on the road? What are you doing?\nWhy are you removing the bike? Can't you see I have marked it? Why? \n- An accident took place. The car won't move from here\ntill the senior officer is here. Who is responsible for the accident? \n- Look there. He is standing there. \n- Him? Couldn't you drive properly? Where do you live? \n- In town sir. I am here since 30 years. Even I live there.\nWhere do you stay? I stay in the by-lanes of the town. The tyre slipped due to rain. Don't worry. I am with you.\nThe car gets out of control in the rain. You have understood it.\nBut who will tell the policeman? You are from my locality. Save me from this trouble. Sorry!\nIt's taking time to find the hospital. We will reach soon. Uncle! Don't worry. I will handle the case. I am sorry for your inconvenience. Vandana, sorry. I called you wife \nin front of them as whenever a policeman sees you,\nhe won't trouble you. Please don't take me wrong. Doesn't matter. One more thing. Such a situation won't arise\nif there's a police man in the family. Do think about it?\n- Let's go dad. - Yes. Let's go. Sir! Do you still think\nthis girl will like you? I don't wait for others likes. I have just cut off her wings.\nI will soon trap her. Anyway, you tricked her well. She won't sleep the whole night.

I will come right away. There's a sign board. And nothing else. Chettinad Health City Hospital. Did you bring the patient?\n- Yes. I got her. Is there a problem? This is a miracle. The child was stuck. Then somehow\nhe came in the right position. It was a normal delivery. In fact her treatment\nwas done before reaching here. On the way? Thank you doctor.\n- You have done a great job. Rajni, is everything alright? Yes. Everything is fine now.\nBut I was very scared. Doesn't matter.\nThe situation is good now. - Yes. Rajni, did you inform Vandana?\n- Oh, I forgot about it. Hello! \n- Vandana! Your sister-in-law was in labour pain. I got her to Chetna Hospital. \nCome quickly.

Mom, tell your husband\nto get himself massaged. He has to dance at my wedding. What did he say? I'm imperfect.\nNo one will marry their daughter to me. \u00c8ven a maid won't like to marry me. Nature has replied back to you. A girl is interested in marrying me. Get married soon. I like the look on your face. This look won't cast a spell on me. My future father-in-law will be here.\nInvite him well. - Let's go in. Reduce the radio volume.\n- Sir, didn't you like the music. I will forget why I came here.\nReduce the volume.

She is leaving the bubbles on me.\nSit little away from me. I will concentrate. 'Don't think about my daughter.' 'And don't try to meet me.' He is the same rude guy. If he sees me he will create a chaos. Run. Run.\nMy father-in-law. I am doomed. Phulmati! \n- Wait. Wait! Wait! Are you going to swim? Where is your mom? \n- My child. Sister, is she your daughter? Yes. - You are very careless.\n- She is my daughter. Does someone leave their children alone? I told you to take care of her.\nWhy did you leave her? Are you human or a beast? Did you ask him to take care \nof the child? You do it with elders. That's fine. You left this innocent child alone. Uncle, do you know this man? I knew him in time. I was lucky. It is wiser\nto stay away from such a person. Or my daughter would be in your place and my grandchild in her place. He is a forgetful man. He is an icon for mind diversion. No. No. Youth icon. Am I right? Thank God you didn't\nmarry your daughter to him. I thank God you came in time. Doesn't matter. - What would\nhappen to my daughter? Thank you sir. Did her talk affect you? You have Alzheimer.\nYou must have forgotten it. Forget everything and be happy. Mummy! 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' 'It's ruined.' The person you have called is in shock. Stay on line for few years.\nOr wait for another life. Uncle, why are you\nsitting in this manner? Mom, tell him to stop acting. Yes. \n- Am I acting? What about the things you do daily? You have made our life a mess. You are repeating the same thing. People who scream and talk much, gets kicked out. You are talking too much uncle. Suggest something uncle. He won't say anything.\nHe feels I am a joker. Not only him.\nBut the whole city feels the same. Rascal! There's some comedy in everyone's life. But there's only tragedy in your life. Hey! Do one thing.\nNo one will know this. Marry the maid. Father-in-law, bless me. God bless! May you have children.\nGive me a grandson soon. Sister-in-law! \n- Leave her. Go and do your work. She is wooing my son? What is he asking the maid?\n- Look son. If you lose her\nyou won't marry your whole life. If she does\nsome makeup she will look good. She has to apply lot of makeup.\n- Shut up! She will look like a heroine. Look at her waist. Uncle, if you like her so much\nwhy don't you marry her? Then keep watching her waist daily. They are perverts.\n- Shut up! If you woo her \nshe will be yours someday. Your dejection won't help you. Mom, only you understand me. Give me a day. If I drink some alcohol.\nI will start seeing my future. Alright.\nBut drink within your limit. Okay. You may spoil your liver \nif you get drunk. Hey! Look down. No matter how much you plan. I promise I won't let my daughter\nmarry you. Come on. You can't do anything to me. Try. Come on. Come on. You can't do anything. How long will you run after me? You won't be able to catch me. Come on dear. I am disappearing now. If you hit me again then...\n- Then? - I will cry. Wow! Great! Stupid! He comes anytime. I don't know why dad \nis giving him importance. It's a trouble. 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' Hello darling! What's up? Baby, are you busy? No. But why are you so sad? Forget that. Listen to me carefully. I want you to meet dad\nand fix up our match. Dad? - If you had come that day \nwe would be engaged now. Leave it. Come today to meet him. If I come to meet him he will stop us from meeting. What? What did you say?\n- Nothing. Tell me how to meet him? Okay. Just a moment! Dad! - Yes. \n- Rajni is on line. Tell me when can he meet you? First confirm if he will come or not. The last time\nhe had switched off his phone. I will bash your face. He was busy in a social work that day. Give him a chance.\nHe will come before time. Alright. Ask him to come\nto the park. We will meet there. Okay. Come to the park in one hour. Please don't disappoint me now. My sweet honey. Bye! Bye! \n- I need to meet her father. Have this.\nIt will improve your mood. Why is it smelling? \n- Brother. I mixed dung of dinosaur, birds. And watchman...\n- Watchman? No. Watchman's goat.\nI mixed all of it here. I added 32 seeds of the sunflower. Bite it. \n- No. Who was it, uncle?\n- Rajni. He's a good boy. Oh! - It's difficult to find\nsuch a boy these days. Vandana loves him a lot. If it's Vandana's choice\nthen it surely must be good. Uncle, if you don't mind. Can I come with you to meet him?\n- Yes. Why not? Finish your food.\nWe will meet him after that. Brother,\nafter that call you look worried. Is everything alright? \n- Not at all. Her father is coming to meet me.\n- Then do meet him. I have met him. He knows about my Alzheimer. If I meet him.\nHe will surely cancel the wedding. Then don't go. If I don't meet him\nVandana will cancel the wedding. Come on. Let's go. What kind of a friend you are?\nGive me some idea. Why are you irritating us? Learn something from movies. Take someone to him.\nAnd tell him it's you. It's so very simple. I got the best deal of the year award. I don't like people \nwho are not punctual. We are waiting here since a long time. Brother, drive slowly.\n- He like punctuality. In this manner we will die. Uncle, you look upset.\nShall I drive? Yes. \n- That is my father-in-law. Where? Who is it?\n- Where are you going? You are Rajni. Why didn't you forget his face?\n- Go now and... Go my dear.\n- I haven't taken a bath today. Hey! Bless me father-in-law.\n- What are you doing? Why are you pulling my leg?\n- Sorry. The leg... I am Rajni. \n- Oh! Rajni. Why are you late?\n- I have some gas issues. My bike runs on gas.\nI don't know about the gas. So I couldn't find gas.\nAnd a tragedy took place. I don't believe this.\nIs Vandana's taste so bad? It's all about one's choice. You like Sunny Leone.\nI like Sunny Deol. Both are super hits.\nUncle, who is he? I mean who is he? \n- Oh, him? He is our family friend.\nMr. Ajay. Police inspector. - Hello! I didn't wash my hand. It's okay. Everything is going right till now. God, help me! Oh my God! Hey! What do you do?\nWhy are you licking the ground? Get up. Get up.\nYou must drive carefully. You are carrying grass\ninstead of sending it by tempo. Can't you take help?\n- Who will help a poor man? My heart is a gold mine.\n- Okay, sit. By the way\nwho else is there in your family? Only me. Stupid. I am asking about your family. What does your mom and dad do? What do you do? What's your address? What's your monthly income?\n- No need to ask about this. It's needed.\n- Are you'll giving me a loan? No. Not him. He looks like he\nworks in some government office. He is inquiring a lot. I have mom and dad.\nMy dad is a house husband. - What? Your dad is a house husband. Did you hear dad?\nMom is a housewife. You heard it wrong.\nMy dad is a business man. Uncle, he's so funny. He is answering nonsense. He doesn't suit Vandana. Uncle, forget this guy. This wedding shouldn't take place. He'll commit suicide.\n- Whom are you talking about? My father. He will get an attack.\n- He have a weak heart. Does your father has an iron heart?\n- Uncle, what is this? Uncle, I worship Vandana. Give her to me as an offering. I shouldn't say this. But you look like a rotten vegetable. Whose picture did you show to Vandana? Mine. I love him.\nYou can check my love. He calls me names. \n- Hello dad. Hello! \n- Did you meet him? Yes. I am sitting with Rajni.\n- I want to talk to him. Yes. I will give the phone to him. Uncle, I don't want\nto talk to strangers. What if he kidnaps me? It's my daughter Vandana. Talk to her. Uncle, she will get\ndisturbed if we talk to her now. She must be washing\nutensils, clothes, brooming. What if she doesn't dry clothes? Why will she do these jobs? Because I wash it in my house.\n- She wants to talk to you. Talk to her.\nOr she will feel hurt. Vandana! I will go to the corner \nto tell her I love you! Hello! \n- I met your father. He looks like a goon. And a villain is with him. Hey, who are you? Vandu, you are my friend.\n- Who? - Your voice is cracking. Bye. Hello! \n- I will switch off the phone. What is happening?\nWho was speaking on the phone? You have got so much vegetables.\nDoes your wife cook well? Come home. You can taste it.\n- 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' Hello darling! Hey! Are you calling me darling \nin front of dad? In front of dad? Who was speaking to me?\nHe was speaking strangely. Is everything fine?\n- Just a moment. I'll call back. Brother, please halt. - Come home.\n- My house will be ruined. He was really intelligent. A great scientist of the world. Do you know what discovery's he made? Vest for the bull.\n- Shut up test tube baby. I am so worried.\nKaran is not picking up the phone. Are you a friend or a murderer? If you are murdered\nthen how come you are alive? Shut up! \n- Chaman, what's wrong? Your sister-in-law got married.\n- Congratulations! - What are you saying? Sorry, we couldn't\ncome for your wedding. You got married. Then what are you doing here?\nGo to your wife. - Hey! Your sister-in-law didn't marry me. The milkman took her. Didn't you pay the bill?\n- It's because of you. I took her to the registrar's office. I thought you would come as a witness. But you'll didn't turn up. She was so eager to marry. That she absconded with the milkman. Sorry. Tell me where is she.\nWe will kidnap her. By now the lights must be off. You feel sleepy after drinking milk. You have an ugly face.\nDon't make it look uglier. Laugh. Laugh. My friend will laugh.\n- Enjoy. Have a party. Make a friend laugh.\nAnd the other cry. Karan, where were you? You didn't send any type of message. You forgot that\nI had gone in your place. Watch the flashback. Yes. \n- Go home. I will take the groom on a date. Brother, I am not your type.\nTake someone else. I will test first to find out your type. Uncle, go. I will investigate.\n- Carry on. Okay. Bye. Uncle. Hey! You don't know\nwhat kind of police man I am. I understand. If you want to benefit\nthen be within limits. If you act smart.\nI will feed you to the dogs. Don't say that. I am ready. Let's date. He took me about 50 kilometres away. I was tired sitting in his vehicle. He took me to a tea stall.\nI thought he would give me tea. Ginger tea. A goon was brought there. Sir, he broke the signal.\nAnd was running away. I didn't break any signal.\nI just crossed the signal. Hey! You didn't wear a helmet.\nAnd you break a signal. I was walking. Why will I wear a helmet?\n- Will you lie to me? You look frustrated.\nAnd want to look smart. This is my area.\nAnd my rule is followed here. Sir, I will buy a helmet. Forgive my mistake. Whether the mistake is big or small. Everything is same for me. And I don't forgive anyone. I break their bones. \n- I got it. What did you understand? You understood it now.\nYou will forget after an hour. He is ready to marry Vandana. And you don't know anything. Do one thing. Forget your girlfriend. In short I have noticed you can't do anything\nwhile Ajay is there. I will do anything. I will make my father-in-law repent. Then my name...\nI forgot it. I will tell it later. Let's come on the subject.\nI will be his daughter's groom. Look, no matter what happens.\nHe doesn't stop doing comedy. Did you feel this dialogue\nwas not enough? - Right. Then listen. The one who fears.\nI will tell the rest later. You will forget it. Tell me now. \nI won't play. He cheats. Vandana, Rajni is calling up. Yes dear. The number you called\nis busy with another call. Don't pick up other's phone \nwithout permission. This was Rajni's call. Strange! 'I feel I have to go in now.' Vandana! Where do I go? \n- Vandana. Where were you? My shoulder is paining. Apply the Ayurveda medicine. Please! Look, it's lying there. Check my shelf. Okay alright. Thank you for telling me. What are you doing here?\n- Rajni had called up. Did you call up? Why did you come secretly? Do you know dad likes you a lot? What did you do to impress him? No. He liked that fool. Your father doesn't understand quality. Thank God you are not like him. Or you would lose me.\n- Are you drunk? Dad really liked you. Is it? - Yes. \n- Did he like me? His praise is my praise.\nHe's accepted so I am accepted. I understand it. \n- Hello! No. I was thinking how lucky I am? That I found a pretty girl like you. By the way there's something in you. Tall and handsome. Also humorous. Healthy body. Strong voice. What else is needed? The exterior is right.\nBut the interior is bad. - What? My six pack is not good. Six pack. I don't want that. \n- Yes. What do you want? What do you want to give?\n- Whatever you ask for. By the way why did you come here? Why did I come here? I remember. My friend wants to work with your father. Take it as a request,\nfavour or donation. Do this work.\nHe needs a job. Please! Take care. Do it. Don't forget.\nBye. Love you. - Excuse me. I have approved him two days ago. And he started requesting already. I have so many assistants. Dad! He is an experienced candidate. Rajni has requested it. Please! Alright. Call him tomorrow. Thank you! \n- Oh my God! She forgot her father for her new love. Yes! Thank you darling!\n- You came for this right? Hey! \n- No. I am feeling shy. I took another one. \n- Rajni! What happened?\nDid you forget how to brake? If you lie again. I will fire you. \n- Sir. He will fire everyone.\n- What are you doing? Leave me. Once I step forward I don't stop no matter what happens. Did you watch a movie at night? How did you become a soldier suddenly?\n- I am just preparing myself. Come with me.\n- You will sacrifice me too. Good morning uncle. What is he doing here? He wants a job.\nI spoke to Vandana. I referred him. If you have referred him\nthen take him away. - Why? If he stays here\nI will spray pesticide in his mouth. He shouldn't be seen here. Go away! He is a fungus which destroys a plant. He is a fool. My servant is more intelligent than him. Get lost!\n- I am not here to be your son-in-law. I have come for an assistant's job. By marrying your daughter. I didn't come to settle down. I am here to take charge of my life. So, don't get angry.\nThe reason for your anger I haven't come here for that. Whom are you talking about? About his daughter's marriage. Okay. Continue.\n- You don't forget things. 'It's ruined. It's ruined.'\n- Chaman, call me later. No. No. No. He insulted me. - Sir you can\ntest me before you give me a job. Wait at the coffee sir.\nAnd see if I come or not. 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' Hey, pick up the call.\nTalk to the caller. Sir, I am picking it up\nas you are requesting me. Yes. Speak on the phone first.\n- Yes. I am standing\nin front of a precious person. Tell me what it is fast. Rajni, I found a girl\nshe is very sweet. Hey! You found a sweet girl. My brother is right. \n- Okay. There's a network problem.\nHe will talk at the corner. He will come back soon. Wait! Wait! Listen to me. Wait! Where are you going?\n- You are sitting with her. Rajni, you won't get your sweetheart. Look there. Your father-in-law has left. Father-in-law. Sir. Sir. Listen to me. You asked me to take the call.\nI was not ready to take it. Please give me another chance. \n- Let's go. Sir! Sir, listen to me. He selected Karan.\nAnd rejected me. The daughter likes me.\nThe father doesn't like me. What does he think of me? \n- Donkey. I was supporting you. He insulted me so much. Brother, she can't hear it from here. I will go to her and tell the story.\n- Alright. Let's go. What does your dad think of himself? Why are you angry? What's wrong? He forgets it everyday.\nToday he remembers it in anger. You don't divert. Carry on. Does anyone gets fired on the first day? Say it slowly. Does anyone gets fired on the first day? He is very angry. - The labour\nunion will speak against this. Does someone fire you from your job\nif you don't look good? Knowing he is my friend.\nHe was still insulted. He called him names. \n- Thief. He was in tears. No one will respect me after\nmarriage if this is the state now. My father-in-law lost respect \nafter today's incident. It's possible his ego is hurt. \n- Is it? You are thinking of his ego.\nWhat about my ego? - Wait! Don't pamper her more. If we don't get a job it's fine.\nWe don't want the girl too. No. We want both.\nIf father-in-law fired me. We will leave the city.\n- Listen to me. Either our child\nwill be your dad's grandchild. Or only my dad's grandchild. Think about it.\nUnderstand it. Decide it. That is the last dialogue. \n- Pack up. Hello! Hello! Walk slow. Dad, if you didn't like Rajni. You should have informed me. He got his best friend to you. And you insulted him in front\nof the workers. It's not good. But I didn't tell him anything. If you scold his friend in front of him. That's also an insult right? Don't insult Rajni\ncalling him Rajni's friend. You remember I went\nto meet a boy for your alliance. He was a forgetful guy. He is the same guy. He is an icon. Dad, will you give him a job or not? If you don't want to give it then\ntell me clearly. Don't give excuses. You are not ready to listen to me. You are also not understanding my love. Dear, he is an expert\nin forgetting things. If you keep that fellow around me.\nI will have a brain haemorrhage. That's good.\nYou worry only about your joy. It's okay if we break up. He said he doesn't want to see me. He didn't even turn\nto look at me while leaving. Sister-in-law,\ndo you remember he had saved you? Dad, you couldn't keep your promise. Dear, don't cry.\nTell him to come to work from tomorrow. If the earth can bear him. I am nothing in comparison. I will manage it. Keep this on one side.\n- Good morning sir. Here comes the trouble. This farm will be ruined. Hey! Don't use pesticide\non these plants. They will dry up anyway. \n- Okay. Do you pity me? Your cat understands you.\nWhat's her name? Dog. \n- The cat's name is dog. It's a nice name. \n- Doggy. You are my future son-in-law.\nAnd he is your friend. More importantly\nyour names are same too. That clears one things. God is angry on me. And he is venting\nhis anger on me. - Thank you sir. You are amazing. I am taunting and insulting you. Still you came to meet me. Your mind didn't develop.\nOnly your height grew. I feel this is your sin \nfrom previous birth. It will be with you until you die. Until you die. - 'It's ruined.'\n- And this ringtone. Don't take the call.\nOr we will be ruined. Sir, I was saying...\n- 'It's ruined. It's ruined.' Rajni, whenever I get calls I am ruined. Simple. Throw. Neither the phone will ring\nnor you will get ruined. I won't be able to take calls.\n- Not even one. Thank you. \n- Mention not. Go away. I don't understand one thing. Despite forgetting things.\nHow can you be happy all the time? Sir, it's very easy. Life is to live.\nA job to earn. And love to distribute. These three things\nare enough to be happy. You read it somewhere right? \n- True. Vandana come here. Vandana? \n- Where? - There. It's a surprise. I asked her to come here.\n- Is it a surprise or shock? What happened? Why are you shocked? He should be shocked. Be shocked. - I am shocked.\n- Did you see he's shocked? Both are mad. Come here. Hi! - Hi! - I kept this unfit candidate\nfor the job. Are you happy now? Not me. Ask him. Are you happy? \n- Yes a lot. Speak up. Happy! We both are very happy. You forgot our folly so quickly. Kept away your anger.\n- Made us very happy. What is going on?\nWhy are you speaking in duet? Yes. Right. We were scared.\n- We died out of fear. The mind was locked.\n- And the heart turned to ashes. Thank God you appeased us. We will buy wealth.\n- Fame, bungalow. Everything. On EMI. \n- We will take loan. Both is same. - We are one too.\n- Before I get the job we had planned things. I will go mad.\nBye son-in-law. Why are you nodding at the same time? As we both have heads. So we nod. He is also affecting you. \n- Yes. Sir, his buffalo is not well. He's in love. We need to take it to the cowshed. \n- Yes. So we are leaving. Okay.\n- Alright let's go. What happened? \n- Blessing. Just leave. \n- Right. I will write the dialogue\nnext time. No cheating. I should remember it right? Gayatri, your parents are here. Please come in. How are you? I am fine. \n- We are fine. Hello! \n- Hello uncle. Hello aunt. Mummy! \n- How are you?  Give her to me. She's so sweet. She's so sweet. It was his idea.\nHe didn't want to leave the Europe trip. We took everyone with us.\nSo we were not here for your delivery. Sorry dear. \n- Doesn't matter. Now we are here. Love your grandchild.\nDon't scold me. Doesn't matter dad. Vandana, I heard you are engaged. You can't meet him alone. We want to meet him.\n- She is feeling shy hearing his name. And look at my wife. She's shameless. Concentrate on your food. We are having\nthe naming ceremony tomorrow. Invite them. We will meet them too. Dad! Sister-in-law is right. We will call their family \nfor the function. We will talk about the engagement too. Yes sure. Mr. Ramnathan, there's someone \nat the door. Check who is it? Alright. Rajni, Satyamurthy is standing outside. Who is Satyamurthy? Your future father-in-law. Why has he come here? He hasn't told me about it. Go and take care of him.\n- Should I go? - Yes. Alright. What is it? He knows that I am your father. I had taken your proposal to him. Mummy! \n- Son. Send him away. What will I tell him?\n- You are a good actor. Come on. She does overacting.\n- She does it less than you. Wait! My towel. \n- Take care. Greetings! \n- Yes. Please come in. Consider it to be your house. \n- Right. Aunt, isn't Rajni home? My husband's diabetes has increased. That's why Rajni has\ntaken him to the hospital. - Oh! Doesn't matter.\nWe will wait for them. - Yes. Right? \n- Please be seated. I will get coffee. Please sit. \n- Right. What's happening? You love this girl. You work for her father. When he has come with the proposal. You are hiding in the bathroom. You will drive me crazy. What will you do\neven if you know things? I wouldn't be hiding here\nif I knew what to do. Sit quietly. There's a call.\n- Son. - Yes. Where are you going? The phone is ringing.\nMust be an important call. Important call.\nYour father-in-law is sitting outside. You want to say hello. \n- Oh my god! His phone is here. Some hot tea. Thank you. \n- Thank you aunt. - Here. Aunt! Rajni's phone is left back. What to do? He forgets things. He forget things easily. What did you say?\nIt means my son-in-law has Alzheimer. You are mistaken. His father has diabetes. Maybe he forgot it in a hurry. Else he remembers everything. My son is very intelligent. I am smelling this after many days. Looks like mom\nprepared something special. Hell with you! I feel it will take time\nfor your husband and son to return. Yes. Maybe. - Actually tomorrow\nit's my grandson naming ceremony. All my relatives want to meet \nmy son-in-law. If you come for the function\nI will be very happy. Yes. We will surely come. Alright. Bye. Shall we leave? \n- Yes. Be happy. Rajni has surely found a good girl. Will you promise me something? \n- Yes. No matter what happens\nyou will be my daughter-in-law. My daughter will marry your son \nwithout such formalities. Okay? - If it happens I will offer \nsome coconuts at the temple. Bye now. Let's go. \n- Bye! Have they left? Yes they left.\n- Is it confirmed they left? Let's go out of the bathroom. Laxmi! \n- Mummy, have they left? Laxmi. \n- Yes. You are very smart. You fooled them. Rajni, do anything. I want Vandana as my daughter-in-law. She is very loving. Hey! Maybe I forgot my phone inside. I will get it. \n- Alright. Dad! When did you\nbuy such an expensive phone? Stupid fellow. You have kept my phone\non charge in your bedroom. Whose phone is this?\n- Actually my phone... What are you doing? You are not ashamed.\nBut the onlooker feels ashamed. We live close by. We didn't have water there. I got daddy here for a bath. Aunt. - Yes.\n- You told us to take bath here. Yes I am his aunt. They live in the slum.\nThey came here for a bath. There's no water connection \nat their house. Why are you standing?\nStart overacting. Hello! Hi! Praise the Lord!\nA long time ago I had come for an alliance. Today you are here\nfor your daughter's alliance. What did you say? \n- No. Nothing. It's the same thing. He is also a son here.\nYou have come at the right place. By the way didn't you bring\nyour daughter with you? She's standing outside.\nIf she comes in it will create trouble. Sir, you just left.\nWhy did you come in again? How do you know I had come here? Aunt. Aunt told us. Give my phone. \n- Which phone? Are you getting late? \n- Bye. I don't understand what's happening? \n- Brother. Sir, she is calling you.\n- I am calling you brother. Me? \n- Yes. Your clothes are stitched.\nGo upstairs and wear it. What is the use of wearing clothes \nafter your dignity is lost? Right sir? Bring them to the function too. Yes. Sure. We'll be there. Aunt, message me uncle's address. Okay. \n- And email it to me. Actually I am a male. That's why I trust email not WhatsApp. Let's meet tomorrow at the function. Okay sir. \n- Bye. We got saved. Stupid! We will be divorced\nfor getting you married. I was in my underwear\nin front of my new relative. My wife called me brother. Am I your father or uncle? Hey! Will you call your husband brother  because of over acting.\n- What could I do? What if our secret was out?\n- Will you call your husband brother? So what if I called you brother? This is wrong.\n- You are my beloved after all. This is wrong. - Beloved.\n- Shut up. Go away! At first I used to get trapped, now even the junior artist is taken in. We don't need enemies\nwith a friend like you. If that policeman finds out, he will make a mess out of our life. He is right. \n- Yes. A lover's friends are beaten up \nbecause of love affairs. This time the whole family is involved. Why are you doing this? Why? Don't ask questions. Do what I tell you. Move aside. Junior artist. - Yes.\n- No matter what happens. If anyone questions you. Just smile. A little less than this. Yes. That's it.\nEveryone be alert. Please come in.\nHi Rajni. - Hi! - Greetings! Dad was asking for you'll. Uncle. \n- Yes uncle. Brother! You are at the wrong position. Why are you standing there?\nWhy are you away from me? He is my father. Greetings uncle. - Greetings.\n- Please come in. How is the arrangement? \n- It's nice. Dad! - Yes.\n- Rajni's dad is here. Friend. Greetings. - Greetings sir.\n- How are you? I heard your diabetes shot up. Dad, you'll speak. We will be right back. Rajni, my eyes is flickering. He is our family friend. I saw it. The girl pinched you. Lucky boy.\nBut the balance sheet didn't tally yet. Go and tally it. One more thing.\nDon't take your friend with you. Thank you. - Just a moment!\n- Where are you going? Mukesh! - Yes.\n- He is my future son-in-law. He's the son-in-law. \n- Right. Then why did the girl pinch him? What are you doing?\nSomeone may see us. Why did you tease me \nin front of everyone? Do you want to instigate me? Shall I touch you? Leave me. What are you doing? You will be punished for your mistake. He is going to kiss her. A sweet punishment. Hey! - Where is the plate? I'm hungry.\nI was searching for the plate. The son-in-law is there.\nBut why was this guy kissing her? I am so confused. Is it there? Let me check. If he is the fianc\u00e9e.\nWhy is she having fun with this guy? There is a huge confusion here. You look so lovely. We like the boy. Vandana and his pair will look good. Hey! - Yes sir. \n- Who is he? They are women. Sir. You want to marry Vandana. The one whom she is marrying \nis standing at one side. Then who is he? He is clicking pictures with the girls. Eat your food. Uncle, who is he? He? He is a friend of my son-in-law. He's right.\nHe's a friend. But he was pinched. I mean to say\neveryone feels he's the groom. By the way where is he? Eat this on Monday.\nI will eat this today. Eat this on Tuesday. Look there. The groom\nand his father are fighting for food. They both will wrestle now. I will eat what is left. \n- Eat food. He doesn't know.\nThis has cheese. Butter and snack. That's fine.\nWhat is your friend doing there? He is clicking pictures.\n- I know that. But people think he is the groom. Uncle, if he's the groom,\nhe'll look like one, right? I mean to say I, he and \nyour daughter are friends. And friendship is very sweet right? I will get some sweet. Sit down.\n- That is not required. Sit down. He will get the sweet.\n- If I don't bring the sweet it will melt. Son-in-law, listen to me. Hello dear. \n- Go away! Hello! People are doubting.\nThe secret will be out. Look, this picture is so nice. You both look so good together.\nPost it on Facebook. Thank you for reminding me. There's something fishy. Shall I remind you something? \n- Yes. Your father-in-law is watching keenly. He shouldn't know you are scared. Keep smiling.\nEven I am smiling in fear. Meet everyone with a smile downstairs. Sir, where is the counter \nfor fruit salad? Go outside the gate.\nYou will see a road. Stand in the middle of the road.\nSome vehicle will come there. And it will make a salad of you. Eat it. Hi Indu. - Hi! \n- Sorry Vandu. Hey! The dress looks pretty.\nWhere did you take it from? I had seen a similar dress\non sale at the railway station. I will hit you. - That is also from\nthe sale. Cheap things from the street. I need to clear this confusion. Brother, just a moment.\nDid you see my dad? Whose dad? - My dad.\nMy only dad. Where is he? Your dad? Is your name Rajni? \n- Yes. No. Yes. And no. Vandana is searching for you.\n- Not me. She is searching for my friend. Hey! Is Vandana getting married to you? She will marry me.\nBut she loves him. This is another confusion. Uncle, don't stress.\nYou will get acidity. I found my dad. \n- Eat it. Rajni, where were you?\n- I am searching for you. Sister, please sit down. Sit down. - I need to speak\nto you something important. I was talking to your husband. Let's decide about the engagement\nand wedding. What do you say? We need to fix other things \nbefore fixing the date. Let's decide that first. Look this is a personal issue.\nDon't interfere in this. Explain it to him.\n- Yes.  Brother, hold your tongue. I will go mad. I can't bear more than this. I can't do this role. I quit. Yes sir. Tell me your opinion. Which date should we fix? What's the hurry? We will do it. Let's eat food first. Shall we? Let him eat today. We will talk about this later. Right? Mummy eat something. What did you say? Mummy? Did I say mummy? \n- Yes you did. You say I called her mummy.\n- Yes you did. You have a problem.\nPlease check your ears. Aunt, come with me. I am hungry.\n- Excuse me. Hey! \n- Sir. We need to investigate this case well. I got it. Yes. Hello!\n- Vandana is having high fever. Please call for a doctor. Alright. I will call the doctor. Yes. Hello doctor.\nVandana has high fever. Will you please check her?\nI am at the market. - Don't worry. I am coming home. \n- Alright. Sir! - Yes.\n- My mother is unwell. Can I go home early today? You didn't tell me earlier?\n- I just got the message. Alright. Finish your work and leave. No sir. I'll work later.\nMother comes first. I am sorry. Where is Vandana? \n- She's upstairs. Will you send anyone to Vandana's room? She is getting married to him. That is the biggest confusion. Yesterday her father-in-law\nsaid someone else is his son-in-law. You are saying he is the son-in-law. Come on. He is the real one.\nThat one is fake. Rajni! What are you doing? How did you come here? Please go out.\nSomeone may come in. Look at his guts. See what he is doing. What are you doing? Wait here. I will teach him a lesson. Hey! Look from here. I came to bath you \nas germs spread during an illness. Will you sponge me? He is giving her a sponge bath. Give me your hand. What are you doing? Stop it. I will give you a good bath.\nThat you don't need to bath for a week. Hey, this is not a family show. Leave. No. I want to watch them. Is this a Tom and Jerry show? Leave. I must appreciate your courage. You came to my bedroom \nbefore our wedding. You are also hugging me. What will happen if someone sees us?\n- What courage do you need for this? If the owner's house is facing problem. He will surely come to save it right? Whether you do anything or not \npeople will gossip. It's better to help your loved ones. At least someone will benefit. Vandana! Vandana! The scrap dealer's voice\nsounds like your father. He is not a scrap dealer.\nIt's my father calling out. How is she feeling now? She is much better. Rajni is taking care of her. You know he worries about her a lot. Yes relative.\nVandana got well after he came. I am surprised. Is there only one door\nto enter and exit? Is there no other way to go out? You were speaking a lot just now. I won't let you go. Doctor, if you want you can leave. \n- What? How can I leave? I am a doctor. I won't go\nwithout checking the patient. - Yes. Right doctor. Go and check her once. Only then everything will be cleared. \n- Mukesh. Do you know what's the real\nmedicine for such fever? Love. Love heals lots of illness. Doctor, please come with me.\nI'll drop you. - Alright. Bye. Dad has gone out. Don't worry at all. Water the plants nicely. \n- Right. What is he doing here? Do you understand? \n- Yes sir. He is going to meet father-in-law. Why did you call up?\n- Why didn't you attend Vandana's call? Maybe his phone was on silent mode. I am talking to my son-in-law.\nWhy are you interfering in our talks? I wanted to say it. But he said it. Sir, do I get something for you?\n- No. Actually Vandana wants to go\nto Tirupati with some relatives. Okay. Go then.\n- I want you to join them. How can I go? Why are you hesitating? They are our relatives. Our family. He is connecting wrongly.\n- And you have to drive. No. I forgot driving yesterday.\nSo I don't know to drive. Would you drive if you knew it? Son-in-law. \n- Yes sir. Why are you interfering? Stand aside. I was saying that... Hey! Vandana is here. Speak to her. Son-in-law, now you are trapped. You have to drive.\n- The heart called out. There was a smoke. The fire is caught. Just a moment sir. \n- Yes. Get water for douse this fire.\n- Right away. What happened? I can't pretend anymore. Go and tell him.\nOr I will do it. Things are going out of limit. Listen, luck doesn't favour always. It fails sometimes.\nWhat if it fails now? Sister-in-law is coming here. She is coming with attitude slowly. She will change my outlook.\n- Do one thing. Sit in this pose. I will send a jar.\nDon't worry. - Listen. This friend is useless. Sir, take this. Wash yourself. I wanted to drink water.\n- I thought you needed it to wash. I will wash you.\n- Sir, look at his state. He has a stomach upset. He is doing the same now. \n- What? I don't want to say but with ladies around\nhe will search for a bush every minute how will he manage? I didn't know about this. It is your work to convince Vandana.\n- Imagine she is convinced. Mukesh, if you can drive\nwhy don't you drive? I driver in my town.\nI have driver outside my town. Lazy man. \n- Do you know the routes? You don't find roads.\nYou need to build them. I will drop them there in 2 hours. He will use the GPS.\nHe's acting smart. He went to the field with a jar. He did ding dong. Brother, take some medicine. Don't go to the field. It will stink. Take a cold water shower in the morning. Rub hard. You shouldn't be dirty. Hey! Did you see the board on the road? You will find boards on the road right? Something else is written on the board.\nAnd we are going elsewhere. Rajni, it's 8 hours we have left. You said it will take 2 hours.\n- I have forgotten where to go. How do I take you'll?\n- Rajni. Rajni. I am talking to you. There's lot of traffic at the main road.\nSo I'm taking a shortcut. What did you say? Shortcut? We are driving for 8 hours instead\nof 2 hours. What shortcut is this? Just a second. I will be back.\n- Where is he going? What to do? Where do I take them? Poor fellow. \nHe's thirsty driving the car. Brother, give me a good coconut.\n- Right away. Its good he drinking coconut water \nand not anything else. How far is Tirupati from here? \n- What? You want to go to Tirupati? - Yes.\n- That's 400 kilometre from here. You have taken a wrong road. 400 kilometre? \n- Yes. Even if you drive fast,\nit will still take 5 hours to reach. What were you telling him?\n- I was just asking about his health. Is there a problem? \n- No. My whole life is a problem. Rajni, what are you doing?\nDrive slowly. Take care.\n- We will be there in 15 minutes. Why 15 minutes? It will take 5 minutes. With this speed we will die. Idea! I don't know what he will drink here? Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! - Is this Tirupati?\nWe are not fools. Don't fool us. This is not Tirupati. This is not Tirupati,\nbut a greater temple than that. Hey! Hey! \n- Shut up. Let him speak. Is it necessary to interfere?\nTell us what were you saying? When God gets tired at Tirupati. He comes here\nto rest for 15 days in a year. Govinda! Govinda! \n- Whenever you pray. He hears it much faster. Govinda! - Tell me will you go to\nthat place where God is under stress? Or you will go to the place\nwhere he's in good mood? He will hear everyone's prayer soon. If you still want to go to Tirupati \nthen sit in the car. No. No. We will venerate here. It's fine.\n- That's why I got you'll here. Go and do your veneration. Go. Rajni, you are a superstar\njust like your name. - Yes. Let's go and venerate. Let's go. Brother, will you speak anything\njust because you have a tongue. God, why didn't I go deaf\nbefore hearing his nonsense. Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! We will go to Murgan Swamy's temple \nthe next time. Yes. We will be there in half an hour. Sir, please come here. You can forget us.\nBut we won't forget you. Hey! Your secret is out. Why are you looking at him?\nHe won't say anything today. Ask me. I will tell you. Is he your fianc\u00e9e?\nI am not saying this. Your boyfriend says it. He is the real screen writer. He fooled all of us. That we did what he wanted. What? \n- Yes. I had a doubt. I wanted to tell everyone.\nBut no one would believe me. Do you know why he did this? Short term memory loss.\nAbsent mind. He forget things. Just like a mobile network doesn't work. In the same way he forgets things. He doesn't even remember you. Whenever he forget something\nhe hides his mistake very cleverly. So that people don't doubt him. You got trapped by him easily. He knew very well you would\nleave him if you knew about his truth. So he fooled you\nin the name of social service. Only one person in your family \nknows his real identity. Your dad. Uncle, tell her. Dad? - He had come to donate blood\nto someone else when he first met you. Taking advantage of that\nhe befriended you. Won your heart. And made you agree to marry him. He knew very well uncle would\nreject him for his absent mindedness. So he made his friend the groom.\nAnd he became the groom's friend. So that no one doubts him. Do you want to know more\nthan remember his actions? 'My life is a problem.' I forgot. Did you'll go to Tirupati? \n- No. He is taking us around for 9 hours. He is also telling us false stories. He was vulnerable.\nMaybe he forgot again. When you go for a honeymoon \nafter marriage he will be enjoying with someone else. What to do uncle? Rajni, is this the truth?\n- Tell her the truth. Yes. No! I am disgusted by you. Dad, let's go. Hey! Arrest him. No. No Ajay. Let him go. Don't meet us again. Let's go. Sit in the car. You told them everything. Why? You can't keep a secret. Mummy, I am very hungry. Serve me food quickly. What have you cooked?\n'Paneer Tikka' my favourite. Wow Mummy! You prepared my\nfavourite food so that I forget Vandana. After losing self-esteem a lover shouldn't eat a morsel. I am a lucky guy. I will forget what happened \npraising your food. Maybe I'll forget her too. God has given me such a brain\nthat I don't remember things. I will forget this too. Wow! What a shot! Virat Kohli will do a century again.\nDad. We will go to the semi-final this time.\nAnd the world cup... Why can't I forget her? Why can't I forget this incident? When I tried to remember things \nI didn't remember them. And I want to forget now.\nI can't forget it. I never thought my Alzheimer \nwas my weakness. But for the first time\nI felt I am handicapped. Listen mother. \n- Yes. I agree I am absent minded. But I'm not a person\nto cheat a girl in love. I agree I lied. Just to make her fall in love with me. Today she said\nshe is disgusted by me. How can I tell her mummy? How do I tell her how much it hurts? If I even give my heart to her she will still say\nI don't want to live with a liar. My brain was weak.\nShe weaken my heart too. Won't absent minded people\nget love in return? Dad! You were right. Absolutely right. You'll were involved in this\nbecause of my love affair. Please forgive me for this mistake. Here after I won't fall in love. You didn't eat anything\nall through the day. Eat it. I am not hungry. How long will you stay hungry? Mummy, eat your food.\nDon't irritate me. Greetings sister.\nIsn't Ramnathan home today? Oh hello. Ramnathan. Please come here. You are looking at me\nas though I am an alien. Alright. I will tell you why I am here. I have fixed the alliance. You would know\neven if I didn't tell you'll. Your ex-lover is getting married. So you won't be quiet. Don't think of kidnapping\nmy daughter from the wedding porch. I am a gentleman.\nI am telling you nicely. Enough brother. Forgive my son. We can't see him dying slowly. After all we are his parents. I am trying to tell you this.\n- You don't need to tell us anything. What is there to tell now? You wanted to break this alliance.\nIt's broken. Aren't you happy? Please leave for God's sake. You are saying as though I am getting \nmy daughter married elsewhere. Vandana doesn't want\nto have anything to do with your son. She has confirmed to marry\nthe boy of my choice. Son, do you know\nwhat I thought about this? Satya, why prolong a good work? Accept this token dish.\nAnd fix the match. Vandana! What do you say? Don't blame me later. I won't blame you. Whatever you say. No. No. I am not doing anything. I am not interested\nin getting you married to him. I feel Rajni is my son-in-law. He loves you a lot. I like him. Uncle! \n- Just a moment! I am talking to her.\nThis is between a father and a daughter. I am her father. It is my duty to\nfind a good husband for my daughter. So please don't interfere. Listen. I don't know\nhow you fell in love with him. But he loves you a lot. I know that. You didn't see that craze in him. It's his bad luck\nthat he couldn't express it to you. When you proposed him at the hospital. I saw that scene. The person I rejected, you accepted him.\nI was shocked to know it. When he helped your sister-in-law. I thought I didn't understand him well\nwhen I first met him. So I went to meet him again. He was waiting at the boat house. Here a woman asked him\nto take care of her child. When he saw me walking in. He left the child there and ran away. After that he asked his friend\nto meet me as Rajni at the park. So that he could handle the situation. I wanted to see\nhow far he manages with his lie. His concept on life was very clear. 'A life to live. A job to earn.\nAnd love to distribute.' 'These three things\nare enough to be happy.' When I heard this.\nI saw myself in him. When he heard about your fever. Giving an excuse\nof his mother's illness. He came to meet you. Think hard. He loves you\njust like he loves his mother. 'His mind diverts \nwhen something else comes up.' 'But when it's about you.\nHis mind doesn't divert.' 'I understood the treatment\nof his illness. It's your love.' Everyone from the family likes Rajni. It means he's the right choice\nfor you. Accept my choice. 'Rajni worries about her.'\n- When you were sick and he was with you I was very happy.\nI say it as a father. You won't get a better groom than Rajni.\nAt least not in this life time. Maybe you fear that problems will\ncome up because of his nature. But he fears that he might forget you, so \nhe keeps thinking about you all the time. Sorry uncle. You speak well. You speak too much. You must be a great scientist. Why did you need to act\nto marry your daughter to a cheater? Why don't you get them married? Remember you will ruin \nyour daughter's happiness. The day your daughter dies\nbecause of his absent mindedness. You will cry on that day. Alright. Get married.\n- Dad? The auspicious time is at 12.30 PM. Mahilapur. Kamleshwaran temple. It's my favourite spot.\nI will call up my people. My daughter is getting married there. But remember Rajni will break your hand just before you put \nthe wedding chain on her. Wow! Well done uncle. Superb! I must appreciate your confidence. She will wear the wedding chain\nat the time you mentioned. I will enter this house \nas your son-in-law. Let me see how he stops me. \n- Dad? Don't fear my dear. Your doubt about Rajni \nwill get cleared today. Okay.\n- Dad? Dad? Sir, even my dad\ndidn't understand me so well. The way you know me. The people who taunt you go and shut their mouth.\nGo and get my daughter. Go son. He has come here. But he won't go back. \n- I know it. That is why I changed the place. Don't let him leave that place. As I am getting married. Kill him. \n- Okay boss. Hey! Pick up the weapons. \n- Okay. Prepare a lemon juice with spices. What did you say?\nYou want a lemon juice? You are not a juice vendor.\nThen why are you here? Move aside. Brother, squeeze two juicy lemons. Add equal amount of sugar and salt. This much. \nNo. Put a huge iceberg. Then stir it so well. That it feels like nectar\nnot lemon juice. - Brother! My mouth is watering.\n- Do you like it so much? - Yes. Then do one thing.\nTake two sips from my glass. - Yes. Brother! - Yes.\n- Say the same thing for me too. Prepare the same juice for everyone. \n- Yes sir. You were frighten of this man. He came in as though\nhe would kill us all. But he is drinking\nlemon juice just like a child. Short term memory loss.\nHe is an absent minded guy. Till he has the lemon juice.\nYou can also enjoy some juice. Okay sir. Happy married life. What a lover did you choose? He forgot about you.\nAnd is having lemon juice. After I marry you. I will surprise him. Your father was speaking great things.\nAs if Rajni will come and tear me apart. Do I look like a kid? Hey! Change your expression.\nI'm not a ghost but your future husband. Call the priest. Come with me. It's like a current.\n- Put this wedding chain on the bride. He hit me a lot. I lost my memory. Rajni! \"Rajni!\" \"Rajni!\" \"Rajni!\" Are you in a hurry to marry? You drank the lemon juice right? We have ordered for oranges.\nWe will have orange juice. Till then they will marry. I will squeeze you out. \n- Squeeze me? How?\n- How? Just like you squeeze lemons. Take out your weapons boys. Is this weapon okay? What happened Kallu?\nAre you fazed to see me? What did you think? Rajni is Gajni that he will forget his girlfriend. I can't forget her not only this\nlife time but the life time to come. Anyway, if the heart is clean. Then a zero turns into a hero. No matter how much the villain plots \nhe is always kicked out. Hey! You won't go out alive. How? How? How? Please tell me. Just like a dog doesn't get a car \nif he runs after it. In the same way a villain doesn't\nget a heroine if he pursues her. You need to fall in love to get her. Didn't you think before snatching Vandana\nhow will I breathe? How will I live? You forgot I am the hero of this movie. No matter how much\nthe villain loves the heroine. She doesn't shake hands. But she surely makes you fight. Don't leave him. Kill him. Catch him. Did you forget that\nyou have fought with us? - Yes. Oh no! I forgot. Doesn't matter. It happens.\n- Do one thing. The ones who are beaten up. Move aside. The rest can come here. I am saved.\nThe ones who didn't fight go ahead. Brother! What is it? - You must be tired \nafter doing the action scene. Take some vitamin C. It is prepared the way you want.\nFirst we squeezed two lemons. Added water. A bit of salt. And some sugar. Stirred it well.\nIt's made for you. Drink it. - Well done! \n- Thank you. Did you see I made him forget things? Boss, this is called\ngetting involved for no reasons. Look what I got for you. Will you marry me here? If he was marrying you here \nwhy can't I? Hey! \n- Rajni! Hey! Hey! Will you untie me or not? Mrs. Gajnikant, we are married. Shall we go for a honeymoon? Not so soon.\nWe aren't married yet. Two more knots are left.\nDid you forget it? Oh! I forgot it. We have to tie the knot thrice right? \n- Yes. Keep reminding me always. I tied one. This is the second. Third.\nCongratulations on your wedding. I was thinking of giving name \nto our kids. Stupid! Does Rajni know I am here? Did he forget it even today? Dad! \n- No father-in-law. How can I forget you? Storing my wife's taunt\nhas grown my brain storage. This is nothing. I remember my childhood memories too. Oh! \n- Like the one I told you about. Ajay and Malthi teacher's incident. That friend of mine.\n- Oh that reminds me. After that incident.\nWe have no news about Ajay. He's missing. Do you know where he is? Who Ajay? I am talking about Inspector Ajay. 'Did you forget me after tying here?\nThe rats are biting me.' Inspector Ajay. Him. I will wash my clothes. \n- Clothes? I have washed it. Hey! Do you know\nwhere the rats bite me? I told you to untie the rope.

yeah yeah that's why it didn't happen all right you guys let's let's get back on track i don't mean you know but let's get into keep music live and why we're here you know we got a group of music lovers that came together that wanted to say music venues right and mix rachel my twin here we all knew it was it was a no-brainer to join this cause fight for music venues to survive through coven and as you guys said like it's a staple it's the it's the backbone it's where places are i i guess i just say bands like the black tones you know we run our business out of these small venues to grow ourselves to to be a certain mix a lot one day gain some weight son you guys are board members you are active members of this cause all of you i mean thank you thank you for helping and being vocal about the one thing we can try and help do absolutely and and all the board members from our president to everybody else that was on there or that it is on there excuse me um you know hopefully we can shout them all out uh before the end of this uh event tonight because everybody put in their blood their sweat their tears and you know this nobody was paid for this uh and this is just something that we all loved uh oh speaking of there he is there he is manny we love you thank you for joining us i i was about i'm segueing that i said manny i'm loving i'm loving the pimp colors in the background okay i'm sharing the zooms at the screens with you so i had to really kind of have to throw down you know yeah i see i'll see um hi manny you're the board president of keep music live thanks for doing that among all your other jobs absolutely uh i am the board president of keep music live i'm here to represent a group of really passionate people that care about live music here in washington state so hello seattle hello washington hello the world um what have we been up to well we have been focused as we've been pulled this way and that in this pandemic we've been focused on what matters to every washington community and that's creativity that's artists uh that is music venues you know i've had the opportunity to be looking through the comments like all of you have and what has really impressed on me is how much music matters to you um so we're really thrilled that we've been able to continue to keep music on the dashboard for all of us we want to keep your place in line for the next concert we want to keep a drink at the bar waiting for you and we want to make sure there's room for you in front of the stage so you can enjoy all that our artists have to to share with you a couple things i just want to share about what we've been up to is because of so many fantastic donors uh we have been able to put out 77 grants to music venues across the state of washington 77 grand those are those are all across the state um 25 of those venues uh also uh were able to demonstrate a commitment to equity so they also were able to tap into additional funds because of course we are going to build back what the washington music seemed better but here's the thing we are not done even though we gave one round of grants out we want to give a second round this spring and that's why tonight is so important venues are still in a very fragile state yes we are turning a corner uh with this pandemic but we're not there yet we got to make sure that we keep all of these venues afloat i know that everyone's hearing about federal relief and that federal relief is really important and we are grateful for everyone thank you if you advocated for federal relief but here's the thing we don't have that relief yet and there are still bills that need to be paid and we're not even certain which venues are going to be able to qualify it so what you can do today is you can ensure that our venues are kept open um you know rachel talked earlier about there being no shortage of things that we need to really lean into and hold on to i want you to focus also on the abundance of creativity that we all need to work for to make sure that washing comes at whole washington comes out singing washington comes out dancing and our artists have a place to perform for all of you so please please donate manny washington to take care of you manny thank you so much for all you do and uh we really appreciate all of these amazing efforts for our venues dude he is um eva cedric don't go anywhere we'll be right here yeah don't please don't leave not go anywhere it's like we're going to a commercial or something yeah we are this is a true yeah so mix you know there's no shortage of amazing uh

getting all excited for this uh my boyfriend he's a man friend my man man friend jeff said to me because i'm a tacoma girl although i'm coming to you from unseated abenaki land in vermont i'm a tacoma girl he said he thought makes that perhaps you had moved to tacoma like we got you somehow well a bunch of my guys you know are from tacoma in my group but now i'm i'm kind of i was in seattle i made too much noise um and the neighbors got really pissed off so i came out here got some acreage and built a house in auburn and uh i'm out here making noise and uh nobody hears it but me that's that's that's how we feel like we have you like oh yes we still i used to ride through t-town every day i mean constantly tea time is where it goes down i know i miss it a lot but i feel i feel good to come and represent you are such a good rep of t-town my god um i miss it it misses you my little guy hi um nico i know that you are busy and we're all like you know gotta believe my big ruler you don't have a ruler that big unless you don't see i do have jokes for seven-year-olds uh i have a few other novels somebody actually wrote that book i really like slop i do um but nico uh you've played all over washington state lots of different venues indoor and out i've been lucky to play some with you and um one gig that comes up a few a few times more than not is when we played at sasquatch in 2005 or six and the skies opened up and it hailed the [ __ ] out of us yeah i've never felt so popular it was like god was um from a further distance to play a show like the second we got home and then it was just like it was like by the way you're out so can we we have like a little clip of this just to show people that weren't there what this kind of felt like for a second it was so sweetly biblical yeah go [Music] oh thanks a lot dude [Music] [Laughter] i got bounced out of the room i don't know what the hell happened it was pale max it wasn't you it was hail you guys i don't even know what act of god is affecting me more the fact that we just watched hail and an old video guys representing the south end hard right now like we've got olympia tacoma we have pierce county we got thurston county we got king county we got a lot of people tuning in too look at all these people steve severn what's up what's up daphne how you doing look do you have a chat on i cannot even look don't look done don't look they're saying some foul things about me we've all played some outdoor venues in our time correct we've all probably almost died several times yeah i mean you can hear me in that video i can't believe how loud say thanks a lot dude as somebody rushes past me to protect mikko as i'm like you know what that's the funniest that is the fun i was wearing a garbage bag a hefty with a hole cut in it like they and i you know upon forensic like looking at this that was work i remember looking down at my pedal board and it was covered in ice and our our front of house engineer phillies from booking goes man it looks like a fish store up there they definitely packed us up i mean uh carrie harrop dj cherry canoe holding it down on vashon right now she was djing and her records were flying off yeah the turntable the trusses were i was like so we're gonna probably die i mean it was really nice getting to work with you and i'm glad that this was our last show that was living so that was like you know that was living we went out we went out you know we went out doing what we liked not loved liked come on we'll be back i know we will be there you guys are sounding all morbid here no i'm getting all bummed we're never going to play live shows again kathleen nico did you guys ever like kathleen tell us about some of the venues in olympia that you liked to play um can i just say hi to nico oh my god take it away don't even get me straight you guys get the pocket have we ever met did we meet it i feel like i i went to your show you played in tacoma a long time ago when we met but you probably don't remember i was probably with one of the wolf sisters oh i remember pretty much everything in the world that's ever happened okay but i've it's like that's been a far away like you you you high high high like universe ever since we have a lot of music has gotten me through some hard times so i just wanted to thank you back out china in person yeah thank you gonna cry i'm not gonna lie you too you've brought me oh come on let me tell a story about a venue let's get to it would you because i'll talk about where'd sir makes a lot go come back come back i couldn't well he's been up for a long time he probably needs a break i was sitting here watching and i was like when's it gonna happen we need you um so i i kind of started playing music in olympia washington and which is the capital for people who are not from washington state it's the capital but if you've ever been there it doesn't feel like a capital i mean it feels like capital because there's a capital there but it's actually kind of got a small town feeling like it actually has a kind of main street which is fourth ave and like businesses and stuff and everything isn't based around the malls although city planners always try to make it that way um but yeah there was this club across the street when my band bikini girl started and we lived in this apartment building and across the street was a place called north shore surf club and l7 played there and like the melvins played there and nirana played there whatever and we lived across the street and we made a fanzine called bikini kill before we were actually a band and had any songs and i remember about the north shore surf club because we could like see it out the window of of my band mate toby's apartment and being like i want to play there like and and specifically at rehearsal being like we have to get like three or four songs together so we can at least kind of legitimately open for somebody just because like i saw people i knew on the stage and it made me want to do it and so one of the things that i was thinking about when like thinking about you know what this project means and how important it is is like for me that venue it wasn't just a place where i went to see music and got inspired that way and it wasn't just a place where like you know they put on shows and they they sponsored musicians and you know whatever it also like made me want to make music because it was there and i would see the stage from the audience and be like i want to be up there i want to be up there and i feel like if people only ever go to like huge corporate venues it's really hard to picture yourself all the way up there so of course you know isn't it so much like if you if you see it you can be it and that's so i mean me looking at the two of you is like a whole other thing you know if you see it you can do it and you know you two are leaders you know i feel like this whole thing before i start bawling on my new uh computer area in my kid's room um you know there was another woman uh from our neck of the woods here who was also that kind of person to me and um that was nancy wilson as a guitar player and i remember just staring at a poster on the wall and i never saw like she was just a complete badass and um she made it look easy she made it like nobody made a big deal out of it right yeah i'm wearing a kimono yeah i'm wearing a combo i know the neck up here i can pick out to the side and i don't give an f yeah um but i feel like you know women like nancy and ann and you two make this neighborhood so special and even though you know time has passed and people live in different places you guys are so goddamn loved and i love you and we're i would like to have this be a new show where mix-a-lot watches us three broads cry for like a weird amount of time but i do without small clubs without independent venues like um i don't think my band would exist town that didn't have a venue maybe we would have got it together to play a house party but they actually olympia fostered such an amazing scene because they had guests go they had like that was a teen club back in the 80s that you may have got niko and then kids organized like i had a um space a feminist photography space that we used as a music venue um in like 88.89 called recommends and we had like mechanormal people in our town saw mechanormal there for the first time or babes in toyland or the obituaries um amazing oh my god i was so berlin who's like one of the greatest singers of all time um you know and just to do that and get to see that and part of our idea was it shouldn't just be like los angeles in new york that creates culture you know what i mean like it has to be everywhere it has to be in tacoma and seattle and bremerton and olympia and i think that this project is so amazing because you're supporting you know independent venues we're tr i mean they're we're they're struggling and we're here and you guys are making it uh possible so thank you both so much for taking the time out to be here um speaking of our i'll do anything you want fine okay good um but uh our our friend nancy wilson uh stopped by and she wanted to i know i know kh i know um we have a little visit from nancy and a little bit of heart playing at the mother effin aquarius tavern 1976. all right ladies you can't handle it hi it's nancy from heart i'm washingtonian as well and i wanted to just pop in and tell you everybody about how to keep music alive washington keep it live we've been playing around washington forever and we love washington venues so do what you can to help the venues in the meanwhile until we can all go back and play the venues like the moore theater for instance um we had a band called the love mongers that did a christmas program there and the night before the show we decorated the entire theater ourselves so we have a lot of fondness for the venues the live music venues in washington state and seattle so do what you can i'm doing what i can let's do it [Music] [Music] so [Music] today smile like this [Music] good god yeah not bad right that's kind of cool um mix will you introduce i can't even talk introduce uh our friend here who is greatest also this is my guy mr totem star and if you don't know what totem star is you will soon um daniel park is the man i've been helping kids from the day i met him even before i met him and um cares about everything deeply therefore i am donating to totem star big time because i want to see totem star bring some more little mix-a-lots up and uh appreciate you being here my brother daniel park is the man you're gonna find out why now what's up mix what's up rachel how you doing what's happening yeah i got my kids bombing my little room here guys live on youtube oh hi to my little kids too yeah i love how you're underneath that bed rachel yeah i miss him no one's asking me for toast things are weird daniel oh my god i gotta give a big shout out to kathleen and nancy and nico that was that was awesome some some powerhouse females in the room amazing well um yeah you mentioned totem star well i'm here to represent totem star and also all ages music venues right i mean we gotta we gotta keep the stages open and we also gotta keep the stages open for the next generation of young people so a little bit about totem star um before i start i'm daniel park i'm a singer-songwriter and also co-founder of totemstar which is a record label and recording studio for young people right here in seattle back in 2010 um co-founder thaddeus turner who's the music director for diggable planets today he and i came into a partnership with the juvenile rehabilitation administration and we got a chance to work with 10 young men who just got out of juvie at rainier community center right down in south seattle and that was the beginning of it all we spent two months with them and when we finished up this program uh we realized that space for young people to come and be creative to make music to have mentors is so important and so we just uh thaddeus and i kind of looked at each other and said wow you know i guess this is the universe just dropping off a mission for us and so we continue to do this for the next three years literally putting a studio in a suitcase and driving it all around seattle downtown y royal esquire club the northwest african-american museum we set up pop-up studios and all these different venues for three years until we finally settled at yongsan cultural arts center where we had a recording studio we've been able to serve over 3 000 aspiring young recording artists from all over seattle and beyond over the last 10 years um of course kovitz shut us down in march we just hit our anniversary of shutting down but over the last year we've been able to engage young people through remote sessions doing songwriting workshops open mics showcases we've created virtual spaces for women and non-binary artists to really support each other and we are actually planning to build a new station a new recording studio at king street station where the amtrak is right in the heart of downtown seattle with eight times the amount of space to engage young artists um you know one thing i'll have i'm going to quote one of our artists gray violet she says totem star is my second family it's a place where i feel truly safe and valuable the amount of fun and the amount of learning i do is something i haven't gotten anywhere else so that just shows us that we got to keep music venues open for the next generation of artists so invest in the youth and donate right now at keepmusiclivewa.com yeah that's my guy right there somebody that cares about it all oh man oh man i you know and i think i think i got one more thing to say right before we yeah you do you're gonna intro our next guest who i'm so i have like the chills and willies i'm excited um before i do that i just want to say rachel i will never forget those years working with you and thad at rock at you know at rock school with wendy simmons back in the you know back to seattle center those are amazing years so you got to to teach some little kids how to play uh songs and feel like they could connect and be in bands and that's right you are a light my friend and we all got to be that light and mix man i can't i can't wait for building the future with you man it's going to be beautiful what it's going to be about man i'm a teacher more i can't teach them the how to play guitar like you can but i can teach him about the music business that's for damn sure can i come yeah yeah we'll make a band come on do it speaking of bands speaking of bands so it was the first foo fighter song that i really got my heart into thanks to the amazing music video by michelle gondry you all know michelle gandri right i mean i remember you probably all remember dave grohl and his big hand that got bigger and bigger you know snapping all the bad guys all over the place and one of my favorite parts in the video was when all the all the band peeled off their their costumes and started rocking out towards the end of the song and one of those characters is someone we're going to get a very special message from um nate mandel the bass player why the bass player always got to be the bad guy but with no further ado kid music live let's all tune in and hear from our very special guest nate mendel the bass player for the one and only foo fighters [Music] hey everybody this is nate mendel the foo fighters and i want to thank everyone for coming out tonight and supporting small music venues uh when i was growing up in seattle uh i spent countless hours at places like rock candy mo's off-ramp crocodile weathered wall okay hotel too many to name these places were hugely important to my little scene and they are very important to any city's cultural scene and it's important that they survive absolutely absolutely critical so i'm very happy that this is happening tonight and uh thank you all for participating now for the next bit of uh filmed entertainment this evening i want to introduce this group of young punk rockers covering the foo fighter song alone and easy target at seattle's very own velvet elvis i warned you ahead of time it's kind of rough around the edges a little scrappy but i think these

looking at some of the comments and some of the people noticed that the sound was off that's why we miss live venues because the sound man's probably not there that we we're not talking about this we're talking a lot about artists but it's not about us it's about that ecosystem and the bartender the the waiters the waitresses the sound guys the sound girls and and i want to make sure that we say that because i don't want people to think we're up here tooting our own [ __ ] horn you know i'm just tooting make sure we know that i just want to make sure we know who we're really doing this for that's correct this is not a substitute this is like what we're trying to do to raise awareness to how much this [ __ ] sucks sorry um you know but it is like super super grunge times in that room

you've been staying busy dude and you know what's funny i got i always tell a story about when you surfed all the way to the front of the show box got a drink and surfed back everybody thinks i'm exaggerating on that but i think the better story although it wasn't in washington state if you remember um well i don't want to put his name out there but the gentleman that was doing our sound on the road um met his girlfriend in portland and she got her leg broken that night on the side of the stage somebody jumped off the stage i don't know if it was one of us and broke her leg and they met and fell in love happily ever after that's beautiful right there that's right you know what nobody would have any of these stories if it weren't for live venues you're not going to have these stories sitting at home uh putting stuff up on spotify yeah i remember that time on spotify when i put up that song and you broke your leg that's never going to happen yeah you got to have live music i will say i want to make sure everybody knows that i actually got married at the show box in 2010 at a president's show so that rock club is not only a rock club it's my church it's where me and kate my

here and love here we have a couple more coming up that that delivered some messages so let's let's see what they've got to say hi my name is i want to talk about the importance and significance of live music venues to my band sound garden and the seattle community both as a performer it was a great opportunity to play live and try out new techniques and approaches a great way to showcase new songs or arrangements for old songs as a member of the audience is a great way to hook up with classmates co-workers friends family colleagues and collaborators present or future we had a we have a great time playing smaller live music venues coming up and we did a number of tours tour and in europe playing small playing small clubs at all ages places like speaking of ghana they're loving it they're beloved they're [Music] the off-ramp the show box just wonderful places a lot of fun to play so please enjoy and support live music stay safe and healthy hello this is matt cameron from soundgarden and pearl jam and i am here to support keep music live a very very important organization um so uh the organizers have uh re requested that we share a memory from a local music venue that that helped shape our uh our sensibilities as young musicians from that time and the music venue that comes to mind for me personally is uh a place that was around in in the early to mid 80s it was a venue in pioneer square in seattle called the metropolis it was an all-ages venue gathering space um workshop uh etc it was just it just felt like uh our little small counterculture scene at that time in seattle had a uh we had a clubhouse i got c bands like uh the blackouts the human um the melvins uh [ __ ] kicker five uh just various other local rock bands at that time that were sort of formulating this new rock uh local music scene that would eventually become part of a very popular um cultural movement so i felt like you know these early venues that we were able to gather at really sort of formulated our um our sensibilities as uh musicians and and artists and it was really important for us to do that together as opposed to um you know just like staying in our basements in our garages um so yeah the metropolis man that place was magic i have so many good memories of attending shows there i actually got to play there once or twice with uh bam bam a uh a group that was fronted by the incredible tina bell um and then i just also want to say uh i know that we'll get through this together um we'll get back to where we were at some point i you know i i hope that's

for tuning in thank you have a good one there it is bring on the agents hi my name is ali hedrick agent partner at arrival artists and i represent many pacific northwest acts including destroyer car seat headrest josiah johnson nico case and the new pornographers and my name is trey manny i'm an agent at paradigm i also represent a bunch of artists from the northwest like death cat for cutie and pedro the lion fleet foxes and perfect genius uh and ali and i have worked together uh as colleagues and friends in the music business for many many years um so ali what what would you say are some important things that have helped artists that you work with or helped your career uh things that happened at live venues small venues in washington state um i had a car seat headrest play early on at chop suey it was one of their first headline dates and i invited some music industry people including adam zacks who books the sasquatch music festival and because of that show they were able to get on the festival which was huge for their career um i also had the head and the heart open up for with for vampire weekend on two nights at the paramount which was also a huge boost and and gave a local band a lot of attention that that helped move them along yeah i remember you know early days seeing death cab for cutie play at the crocodile i remember booking perfume genius for their first show ever at the beer project they played the 10 people two of them started crying and it was such a pivotal moment there were like labels there to see them it's it's really impossible to overstate how important small venues are to artists as they're beginning their career um so it you know we're just so excited to be a part of a program that's helping keep these venues alive and bridge the gap uh during covet until they can come back and and we can all go see some great shows again in these places so thanks for listening oh man yeah you know uh real quick my my agency that i a couple of my deal with i had a show i had to cancel out obviously and i couldn't get anybody on the phone and they went from 49 agents to four during covet so these are real people losing real jobs wow um great performances and videos we saw during this whole this whole thing wow eva cedric how does it smell in there i just need to get a quick smell well our microphones are sanitized and it has like the citrusy smell so you know what it smells really good you know what that citrus smell is called citrus that is like i said missed merch opportunity we do a yankee candle that smells like gross bar because we all miss it holiday i'm the only one here that wants this candle okay yeah fine yeah i'm with mix on this one i'll probably you know i'll watch you do it fine new bar smell is coming up you

know i know huh um you guys you know there's going to be a rebirth here for all of us after this pandemic subsides and we figure out how to walk and talk and move again and do what we do um you guys had the opportunity to play inside the brand new crocodile which people talk about the old croc and then the new croc and now there's a new new croc can you tell us a little bit about it yeah when we were in there it was still kind of being worked on but uh the idea of it looks very amazing we were very excited i think we were the uh i don't know if we were the first or one of the first to play in there kind of grace bless it i guess but um yeah i'm looking forward to seeing what it looks like once it's actually all finished and this is in the old el gaucho space in bell town right right exactly yeah exactly yeah i think we have some footage of you no i do i pulled it right out of my sleeve my pant sleeve that's right there you go let's queue them up [Music] we're going down just stop just stop being so awesome why do you like my bad hair day hat yeah bad she'd be tricking everybody everybody's like oh that hat is great and she's like i'm wearing this because i didn't do my hair today i'm like oh okay well you could have fooled me you guys stop being so good it's really oh you guys stopped me no and this has to wait no don't interrupt me rachel this has to be said you two are doing an awesome job yes you are we're over here laughing cracking up uh a lot of this stuff is not the top it's off the top it's been great so it's great to watch and very entertaining so thank you you guys cause mix is the best no i hate the best you're the second best i'm just here i'm just here to bless the best [Laughter] um you know what's cool this kind of folds into when you play with your people that influence you or your heroes like getting to be on this like weird call is really good because i get to be and be with you heroes of mine and when we have you guys opened up for people that you're like oh my god how did i get here yeah green yes who who likes staples staples uh weezer and death a couple times actually yeah and um i mean and then also people honestly who are small in the artist that i've discovered was like oh my god i love them you know it doesn't matter how big the name is there's been smaller acts i've been like i can't believe i'm playing with this person uh thunder [ __ ] for sure they were awesome another [ __ ] was amazing say that name again yeah you guys just like saying again i mean hold on i'll say a little bit slow thunder [ __ ] oh that's what i'm talking about oh skye's split this is a family program max mix the band name you guys who did you play with that you were like oh my god i can't believe this this is easy this is easy um i opened this is embarrassing even saying i don't even belong on the same stage i opened george clinton parliament funkadelic that was like yeah embarrassing i was like i want to just get up under the bleachers somewhere and just hide because i don't even deserve to be on the stage with the father funk that's that's off the charts but aren't those moments so amazing when you're like how did i even how did this happen to me i mean clearly i guess i'm in the right place or i'm on the right path and sometimes you need those signs to keep going you know and so i remember getting getting advice from chuck d and public enemy when i first like got started and they brought us on a tour do that nwa tour to famous when it was in the movie and i remember doing these phony ass interviews like you know most rappers have a tendency to act ignorant when they're smart and chuck didn't like that and i never will forget he told me not to do it and i haven't done it since i'm gonna do an interview i'm not gonna act inarticulate just be who i am [ __ ] it and you're the underpussy and thunder [ __ ] we have we have a really beautiful piece uh from uh folks that got to play with some of the people that influenced them let's queue it up [Music] we're [Music] sincere [Music] oh [Music] me down [Music] downtown [Music] how you doing jeremy i'm all right how you doing yeah oh pretty good so i first got to play with you and um 2016 uh the emp they had a concert series called influencers where they paired up a younger artist with uh someone who influenced them and uh yeah you were um a huge influence uh on me growing up and so you were the first one i thought of and i was i was super thrilled when you said yes um and uh yeah we got to play play a few songs together yeah it was the beginning of many shows it gelled really well and replayed the show and made a million dollars so legend has it that uh you guys uh what sunny day got signed after what like your second show yeah you know i think we've maybe played a party or something i don't know but um nate uh managed to get a show at the crocodile cafe um um like on a monday and wow nobody really knew who we were the booking for that club at the time really loved the band and he's like look tomorrow night there's a band that canceled they're not going to be here and why don't you guys come back i love what you're doing why don't you guys come back tomorrow leave your gear here on stage and i will make absolutely sure that someone from subpop is there and the next day rolled around and there were like instead of five people in the audience there were ten and uh but i it was probably the the most intense i've played any show ever whoa and yeah and then after the show jonathan came up to us and was just like hey i'd love to make a record with you guys and then i think within two weeks we were signing a contract wow that's awesome it all started on a monday night at the crocodile yeah i guess thank you to eric

candle on we're going we're going to take a little tour to the caribbean now so i tell you the first time that i saw clinton furon was when i was here in seattle attending uw and i went to go see him at the rainbow you all remember the rainbow oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i played there once on a wednesday with three people in the audience yep there you go um i remember two uh i i we had a my college band got a chance to open up for clinton at the ballard firehouse one time which is i'll never forget that night yeah after the show i think he he told me the key is perseverance as to the music industry and i'll never forget that and so you know from that day on clinton became one of my musical mentors um anyway i've learned so much from him over the years and he's even come to totemstar to hang out with the with the artists and he even recorded a bunch of them on a chorus to the song his recent song history say so clint tehran was uh he was born near kingston jamaica he was a member of the gladiators he was their bass player uh he did a lot of session work for cox and dodd at studio one and lee scratch perry at black ark those are like the two biggest influential studios in kingston at the time and then he moved to seattle in 1987 i think can you believe that and then he founded the defenders he then found a boogie brown band and i'll tell you mix and rachel right here in seattle we have a gem a living legend from the original 1970s roots reagan movement he has a massive international audience let's all tune in in here from the original basie the one and only clinton fearon

words after that whole thing that just happened so let's just get into the clip this is a interview i got to do with the wonderful mike mccready of pearl jam hey everyone you are watching the keep music live's banned together washington live stream and this benefit is featuring legendary concert footage live performances and intimate conversations with some of washington's most celebrated faces and spaces in music proceeds from this event will provide much needed covid19 relief grants for small independently owned music venues across washington state and thanks for being a part of keep music live uh band together washington event mike how you doing i'm good hi eva um yeah of course you know i've spent a lot of times in many but many years in many clubs in seattle yeah and like you i miss live music and want to make sure that our live independent venues that we're the first to close will be able to reopen when it's safe of course and i support our independent venues because it's where community comes together and i'm curious why are independent music venues important to you well you know as i was saying we when we started back in the way back in the 90s you know uh we were playing clubs and i was going to clubs and it was all part of the culture of uh seattle washington in terms of the music that was for many many years prior to the uh like the the mid 80s up until the 90s you there wasn't a lot of clubs then there were then there started to be more clubs and there were crazy laws in seattle and i'm not going to get all into that when we were young that we you couldn't get into clubs and then when you could it was this kind of a cornucopia of of a cool experience to go see your friends play go to the rainbow go to the vogue and it was where you made connections it's where you played music it's where you started bands it was all the clubs that were out back then and up until you know recently uh have been incredibly important for bands to hone their uh their music and i'm sure you have done the same thing you know and yeah not with our band and we've done it and with i'm sure you have too yeah absolutely and that actually makes me curious where did you play your first show we played our first show at the off ramp which is called what is it called now the elkhorn zone is that the same one yeah same one so it has the pole on the thing and we you know we ed had come up here and we we had known him for about six days and then on or seven days and then on the eighth day we played the show our first show as mookie blade locker i don't even know if we had a name or whatever or form release mother live on or something but we we played there and we were so i've seen pictures are just very disjointed and it almost looks like look we're just trying to figure out who we know yeah but it was significant in that that was our first show together and i didn't want to play it because i felt like if we were trying to get out of another record deal at that time if you i'm going to get way too into this so i need to stop and uh for mercury that and that that label wasn't going to be great in terms of what jeff and stone were thinking so i felt we shouldn't play any shows because we're really i felt like we were really good even though we only played for a little bit it was okay stone's like you know forget it we're going to play anyways and so we did it and our first show was there 19. probably october 1990 october 1990. nice i'm glad you said off-ramp because it actually reminds me of the first time i played um el corzone when i was a teenager and i was like mom i have like this show and it was my second show like as a mute or oh maybe first second show as a musician playing with other people and my mom was like oh you're playing what was that what was it black towns or was that your no it was a little group i we my friends and i put together in high school called trash queen i think i didn't come up with the name but we were called trash queen and my mom was like oh you have a show at the off-ramp and i was like what is the off-ramp like i've never heard of that what is she talking about and then like so she was like well it's called el corazon now i was like oh yeah that's that's where it was so she remembers it being called the off ramp and i was just completely like i don't know what that is yeah yeah i was like i'm not playing a show on the entrance of the freeway if that's what you're talking about love it um so small stages i mean it's really where a lot of artists get their start of course my band as well and your band um and even artists like you know like you like pearl jam as i said so now the moment we've been waiting for can you tell us about the legendary concert footage we're about to see of pearl jam uh yeah so there's i think there's two things that we're going to see and one of them is uh 2002 that we played i'm looking for them one of the one of the some of the footage you're going to see is uh one of the shows we played at the show box in 2002 it's a version of better man um and we specifically wanted to play the show box uh i think it was four shows prior to it to that tour so we could warm up there um to get ready for our big us and maybe world tour after that so yeah 2002 uh show box version of better man and then the other thing that we're about to see is a version of the dead boys sonic producer from one of uh the first night of the home shows in seattle washington um and uh just loved playing that song so there's there's two kind of extreme examples of where we played in seattle i

there's a hydrologic pinch point in the Bay where the flows increase and there's a lot of depth right there so we decided to be important to characterize the flows in that particular location so we spent an entire I believe night out in a dinghy with a flow meter we wanted to measure an entire tidal cycle I'd minik so we were sitting in a small ragged little boat that I had with some borrowed

We've been preparing students for the California bar exam since 1995. At Personal Bar Prep we're different from all the other bar preps; let me explain how. First of all, our students are going to be engaged in a lecture series. Now I know you're thinking, \"Every bar prep has a lecture series.\" But ours is different. And it's different in two major ways- First of all, our lectures are concise. I'm not there to waste your time; I'm there to teach you about what the bar wants you to know and nothing else. Second, and more importantly, our lectures are interactive. I encourage questions. I firmly believe that the only stupid question is the one that isn't asked. So ask away. I don't want you leaving my lectures not understanding what I'm talking about. So I encourage your participation. The next way we're different is we have small group workshops every week, where our students meet with me on a regular basis with ten students or less, where we disect and discuss essays that I've assigned that are designed to cover every issue and every subject tested on the California bar exam. You should never walk into the bar not knowing what those essays are going to be about. By participating in our workshops, you can be assured that you won't be surprised when you walk into the bar exam. Finally, we have a very heavy emphasis on practice. You're going to write dozens of essays, and write a variety of performance exams, all with feedback You're also going to do thousands of multiple choice questions, so nothing you get on the test is going to be new to you. So welcome to our YouTube channel where I'm going to share tips and answer questions about the California bar exam. Feel free to leave a comment, and please check out our website.

The princess needs to be on the alert. Once you find something unusual, call immediately While waiting for the banquet in the Dragon Cheng, the three Na Mei have been surrounded by the Dragon Cheng guards It looks like a red door feast. Minister Nibuteso stands out from the guards and announces two charges against the Straw Hats to the three First of all, the kidnapping of Merpeople from Merpeople Bay and second of the destruction of the Island of Fools according to the following prophecy Both of these charges were groundless and groundless, and even Ki ng Neptune could not bear to see them But the Lord Left took a hard line and ordered the guards to arrest the men immediately to protect Fisherman Island In fact, the moment Princess Bai Xin meets Luffy, she can guess the rescuer who saved her pet shark He asked if Luffy was a bad guy and Luffy said, \"I'll leave that up to you. Cao Mao Tuan lost to save the white pet shark benefactor white heart do not know why the father will suddenly to them to catch them up he is sorry Lufei did not care to tell the white star with your stomach disease can not catch his partner White Star Princess is very kind. He believes Luffy is a good man Luffy didn't care what he thought about White Star about the axe It turns out that van der Dyken is the eight fruit power Anyone he touches will be his torch and whatever he throws will find its target at any time and anywhere White Star refused Van Der's proposal of marriage and was therefore held in a grudge by Van Der from time to time on an axe hole and aw hite star Because it was so dangerous outside, the white sex was confined to this iron wall and could not take a step outside Luffy's stomach is so hungry that he cries white, calls stomach trouble and sends food for diary pain. Because white is put under house arrest, he spends a lot of time alone He said the pet shark had no one to talk to him. He saw that Fey didn't seem like a bad guy, so he started talking to Fey White Star curiously touched Luffy's cheek and squeezed the food out of Luffy's mouth Luffy loudly eat the people people a leng was scared to cry Road fee mouth said so you obviously so big and love to cry and timid I hate you people feel like a lightning drapery into the head No one ever scolded him or hated him in his life White Star was hit by Luffy's words Crying to drive Luffy away, Luffy asked White Star as if nothing had happened after he easily swept up the food on the table After ten years in captivity, you're getting sick. Where do you want to go again? I'll tak e you White Star was afraid that although there were many places he wanted to go, it was too dangerous for him to go out If you want to go out, go for a walk. If something flies over, I'll knock it out. Right Luffy's very relaxed words gave White Star a great encouragement. Although he did not know how much ability this little human had, he felt the sense of security he had never felt before The three Usopbrooke in the Dragon Palace did nothing against hundreds of stupid guards and even knocked down a few Do not resist only to be caught and the Tang Trade Group here more no reason to seize without a hand as according to the mountain then can only be allocated in the end Don't look at a few people usually always by some of the wind and grass move scared to call this if move a hand to which one is not soft persimmon A woman for a soldier to see this group of people are too tough, although not the captain, but each more powerful than the next expensive soldiers dare not go forward The min ister of left took the opportunity to slap the hat on Cao Wang Tan. This is the blood seal of one of Xia Li's members. We will not attack the minister of left if you do not find fault first These stomach ailments in an easy life are far from the law compared with two years of endless training in great difficulty All out of their new weapons to steal the minister are scared silly asked Nipton light help You can't arrest people for thinking about it for a long time and you can't just arrest them for making an empty prediction but you can't trust them and you can't trust them or you can't trust them Neptune waved the giant trident in his hand like countless people not waiting to attack the past At the last moment Solon rushed out and blocked Neptune's attack. Then the minister, Seahorse, came with his guards. To his surprise, Solon, who was already drunk, was arrested Unexpectedly, the cage of the dragon palace is so vulnerable to a single attack by the locked dragon easily opened and ran out You don't get caught in the wind. Surrender as soon as possible. Keep fighting Solon is impossible foot blood surrender and heavy heavy death of the soldiers to Solon and other people bubble puncture so that in the sea battle opinion group will have an absolute advantage But they had no idea that someone had figured out how to deal with it before they did Before they can start damaging the bubbles they get a huge bubble coral and they cover the whole thing in the bubbles and there's nothing the fishermen can do You don't look at only dry a turtle hole three fork a few times in the past by the Longjing pull out a knife All dragons need only 1/3 of their strength against the island of fools The result of the battle is that Solonping alone has tied all the people in the room and King Neverton together a strong and unstoppable people are scared silly Originally just called frighten light them and then take the opportunity to escape did not expect Sulong really started It really looked like a gang of child bandits were posing a serious threat to the island of fools Why blame yourself for starting the fight Anyway, this is a complete offense to the royal family. Tang Bao Tuan must not be able to stay in faint The time had come to find the Sonny and escape from this troubled place. By the time the Thracin three princes had returned to the palace, they had rung the telephone worm at the door Zuo dragon what also regardless of this evening greeting sad to hear this strange voice behind also mixed with the use of the cry for help Feeling that things are a little wrong on the dragon immediately opened the elevator to let them enter the dragon city dragon directly refused to kill the prince of the star Habakkuk and kaimi are scared silly ask sauron and others to tie them up otherwise they will be regarded as a gang Solo ignored the fear of horse valley directly to Prince Hawkslayer repair conditions immediately ready to sail matters must first find the Sonny and degree a n ew waterproof membrane Then the partners of several parties are looking for Qi Namei immediately added a further 11 times in the redemption Prince Shaxing thought about it and promised to send them away as soon as he could on the terms of his pleasure, but he delivered them a message First, don't start a war with Hody and second, the Sage will be waiting for Luffy in the Sea Forest Killing star prince chaoyang the message after the author of the ship left However, he informed the other guards to catch Lufei and the other three members of the King of Cao The fact that Sauron and the others had taken over the project soon spread to the Fools and the Merpeople alike, who were shocked that the apparently friendly people of the group could have done such a thing It seems that the fox's tail shows his true nature as a thief Another stomach disease soon found the mountain and bridge bar however, Xiao Bao will soon give the guards to beat back Wei Yun said this group of people really severe ca n not afford to provoke Lufei advised white star to go out for a walk with him white star about a long time or dare not step out of the door Road fee very reliably tell White Star as a reward for inviting him to dinner no matter where White Star wants to go Luffy will accompany White Star battle red face for a long time hold a word sea forest But there is only their own dream they can not dare to go out, said the white star cried again Luffy shouted loudly why just say a want to go to the place will cry this mermaid is really baffling At this time the door again through a burst of loud sound I don't know Van Der that guy and throw what things come over the daylight quickly cover your ears This time the object was hurled so loudly against the door that even the Dragon Project heard it loud and clear. Neptune, worried about the comfort of the people, urgently begged the Dragon to leave. They took themselves to visit the White Star Solo has disdain for you A hostage Who can command me Bro oke to analyze Ibdon's white name Is it the mermaid princess of the legend At the mention of the mermaid princess Brooke immediately became excited and ran to the white star princess's bedroom And the minister can not rest assured that the white star brooke with his brooke will King Wu words and ministers carried a seahorse to sell a happy little rag ran out Luffy promised again and again that he would guarantee the safety of White Star Princess. White Star cried happily and Luffy told him that if he cried again, he would refuse to go out With Luffy's constant encouragement, the princess in the white dress finally summoned up the courage to prepare to go out In order to avoid being too conspicuous, Luffy hid Bai Jing in the mouth of the pet shark. Then he opened the door and escorted Bai Jing out Outside the door of the white heart room lay a man It turned out that the criminal's mission was not to give weapons but human pirates to deter Neptune By the way, the pirates were used as gun -warriors to attack Neptune's army, and the minister was acutely aware that this was Vander's surprise attack In the vegetation group collective in the dragon palace city big when special trouble when Frankie alone smoothly found the master Tom's brother Dan Fledge asks Fledge to help find the Sunny that Helen has washed away. Fledge tells Fledge that sunken ships on this island are affected by the tide And eventually they're all washed up in one place and that's the one way taxi from the sea to the forest and it's taking Fridge with it to the sea to the forest Brooke carried the minister and came to the door of the white star room just to see the pet shark rushed out of the room to swim out and to the room to see the white star princess is gone This is a very serious matter and it is coming to a conclusion that this is a kidnapping. If the white family is harmed in some way, the whole dragon palace kingdom will be in a mess The white princess is missing and the human pirates who are v ander China are going to invade with force The wheel works for a moment to endanger the death of Lord Vol Brooke with himself back to report to Neptune These things are serious enough to endanger national security Just a few hours earlier, Van der Dyken had arrived at Hody's new house, His street of fools, and Noah had made a deal with Hody to fight together The same goal was that Neptune, who was deeply hostile to peace, wanted to throw him out of office and make a fuss over the island of opinion This is also the plot in the book where Bullah comes out and tries to stop Gou. Gou starts to worship Gou and others when Gou is still hanging out with A Long Aron's ideas even made it his goal to be the first to put independent human beings above human beings as fools He did not think that once was for Arrow Hai his cadre minibus back to stop himself in order to prevent the minibus from further obstructing his plot to get the acquiescence of Vander to kill the minibus Vander put a juice curs e on xiao wang's body He took out a bunch of swords to attack the minibus and immediately fled to the sea. Unexpectedly, those swords were like catching up with the old one In the end, the vendor was not able to escape and the sea urchin was blown out alive Vander and Hawking then took the first step in their plan to use the human pirates as weapons in the Dragon Project Then have them open the entrance to the dragon works from the inside to help capture the enemy group invading the dragon works But the problem with such a plan is that very few people have a chance of surviving and most of them will just crash into the wall and die Huoji grins evil That's why it's necessary to use human presence to carry out this plan Even if the human pirate refuses to cooperate, you'll be killed by Huoji's people So it's all about death and the fact that the people who survive Lu Mengcheng have a chance to be captured and released to be free Hody welcomed Vander as soon as he could not wait to pick u p the human pirates and throw them out The currency has been officially announced. From today on, the Fools' new historical journey will begin with what kind of dragon control city All the guards on this side of Yamashiro Bridge Dam to capture them were brought down Suddenly the street through a burst of screams, the mountain bridge dam came to the shore, and it turned out to be a peddler covered with evil sea urchins small white normal tell two people quickly pick up a partner to leave the fisherman's island about the first child he will immediately attack the fisherman's island dragon project to be destroyed Luo Gong city brooke carrying Yue minister back to the Nipton royal palace has things to report to him The human thief Westbrook also came to the palace to see a bloody battle will start Luffy here also leisurely with the white line princess shopping According to Princess White Star, Sea Forest is a graveyard at the same time even waiting for the road to fly in Sea Forest He's si tting in front of a tombstone, mumbling to himself.

AMERICAN FAMILY FIELDS OF PHOENIX, A BIG FLY TO LEFT CENTER. MOVING AROUND. HE IS THROWING THEM IN OUT FROM RIGHT FIELD. LOOKING GOOD SO FAR. >> Jeff: TAKE SPRING TRAINING NUMBERS SOMETIMES WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, BUT FOR GUYS WHO WERE COMING OF TOUGH YEARS SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO SEE SOME SUCCESS. >> Bill: IF YOU ARE HITTING ALMOST .500, IT'S SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. IF YOU ARE HITTING .100, \"IT'S JUST A SPRING TRAINING.\" [LAUGHS] IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SUCCESS, EVEN IN SPRING TRAINING. >> Jeff: IT SHOWS YOU THAT THE WORK YOU PUT IN IN THE OFF-SEASON DOES THE TRICK. A PICKUP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT ONCE FOR GARCIA, A BASE. WHEN YOU ARE GOING GOOD, YOU ARE GOING GOOD. >> Bill: HE CAN SCOOT DOWN THAT LINE, NO DOUBT. POSSIBLE PLAY FROM ROCK. CODY IS 6'7\", A LONG WAY TO BEND DOWN AND GRAB SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NOT ABLE TO GRAB IT. A BASE FROM GARCIA. >> Jeff: AS SOON AS A COP BY THE MOUND, NO CHANCE TO THROW THAT OUT.

IT WILL BE THE CENTER FIELD COMING IN, MAKING THE CATCH. CODY, 8 APPEARANCES, 5 STARTS. BACK IN 2020, STRUCK OUT 18 OVER 22 2/3 INNINGS. HE'S GOT A CHANCE TO MAKE THIS ROSTER. THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION, THE RANGERS, THAT IS IN FLUX A LITTLE BIT, TRANSITIONING. >> Bill: THEY'VE GOT SOME THUMPING LINEUP IN THE RANGERS. JOEY GALLO, HE'S GOT 5 -- THIS SPRING. >> Jeff: RANGERS ADDED CHRIS DAVIS, THE FORMER BROWER. HE COMES BACK TO HIS HOME RUN HITTING WAYS THEY HOPE. DOWN IN ARLINGTON, HE'S GOT A REAL GOOD OPPORTUNITY. BRAND-NEW BALLPARK THAT OPENED UP LAST YEAR.

JACKIE BRADLEY JR., A COUPLE OF STEPS BACK, AND THEY ARE IN THE WARNING TRACK FOR OUT NUMBER 1. >> Bill: IT HAS BEEN ALL WEEK WHERE THE WIND IS BLOWING STRONG OUT OF CENTER FIELD. LEFT CENTER, RIGHT, BLOWING OUT. GOOD TO SEE WIND OF ANY KIND REALLY, BUT IT HAS BEEN A HITTER WIND THIS WEEK. YOU AND EVERY SPRING, THE WIND IS DOING SOMETHING. IT'S USUALLY BLOWING OUT. HERE IS ELI WHITE. RASMUSSEN MISSED, A BAND IN. ONE BALL AND NO STRIKES. THEY TALKED AFTER THE GIANT GAME, SOMEBODY SAID \"I'M DONE WITH THE WIND.\" >> Bill: IT'S TOUGH TO DEAL WITH. IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE RAIN, COLD YOU CAN DO WITH. THE WIND HAS A SPECIAL EFFECT ON YOUR GAME, JUST LIKE GOLF. >> Bill: YES, I'M GOOD WHEN IT'S BEHIND ME. I'M NOT VERY GOOD WHEN THE WIND, WHEN I'M HITTING INTO THE WIND. >> Bill: RA DOESN'T AFFECT MY BALL GAME, BECAUSE I RARELY HIT INTO THE AIR. [LAUGHTER] >> Jeff: HITTING THE ONE IRON. SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE WIND, IT'S HARD TO EVALUATE PITCHERS. POP-UPS THAT END UP GETTING OUT OF THE BALLPARK. HIT ONE, FOUL. OFF TO OUR RIGHT. >> Bill: NOT MANY POP UPS OUT OF THE PARK. WE HAVE SEEN SOME MONSTER SHOTS. >> Jeff: TALKING ABOUT THAT ONE WITH DYLAN COZENS YESTERDAY. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN  OUT OF ANY BALLPARK, INCLUDING YELLOWSTONE. >> Bill: RIGHT FIELD. WOW. >> Jeff: TWO TO WRITE GARCIA AND GOING BACK. OVER HIS HEAD, AND OFF THE WALL. HE IS HEADED FOR THIRD. HE'S GOING TO BE UNDERSTANDING FOR VENTRICLE. >> Jeff: NEPAL JUST TOOK, DIDN'T IT >> >> Bill: THAT BALL JUST TOOK OFF PLAY OR JUST NOT ABLE TO CATCH UP TO IT. IT WILL BE A ONE OUT TRIPLE. >> Jeff: GARCIA, AS SOON AS HE THREW THAT BALL IN, SMACKED HIS RIGHT HAND INTO HIS GLOVE. FELT LIKE HE HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT PLAY. HERE IS THE THIRD BASEMAN TODAY FOR TEXAS. A STRIKE FROM RASMUSSEN. >> Bill: THOSE PITCHERS I DON'T HAVE ANY SLICE TO THEM, AND A HOOK. THAT'S ALL FOR THE BALL TO GET OVER HIS HEAD. >> >> Jeff: RIGHT SIDE OF THE INFIELD, ANOTHER SWING AND A MISS. AT WIND, SINCE WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT, HAS SHIFTED, NOW BLOWING STRAIGHT OUT TOWARDS RIGHTS. 0-2. THAT'S A BASE HIT, RANGERS ARE GOING TO BE ON THE BOARD. GOT A HANGING, BREAKING BALL. DRIVES IN THE FIRST RUN OF THE GAME. >> Bill: MAYBE YOU GET A SWING AND PITCH OUT OF THE ZONE, BUT A NICE RUN. >> Jeff: THE LOOK ON DREW'S FACE, ESSENCE CONTACT WAS MADE, YOU KNOW HE MADE A MISTAKE. TRIPLE, SUBSEQUENT SINGLE. IT IS JASON MARTIN WHO HAS HAD HIMSELF A NICE. COUPLE OF HOME RUNS. THE THIRD PERIOD THE ONLY MAN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE INFIELD. >> Bill: ARCIA SCOOTED OVER TO THIRD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RUNNER STAYED AT SECOND. TEAMWORK ON DEFENSE. IN ALL OVER THE PLACE. ACTING AS A THIRD BASEMAN, BUSTED IT BACK TO RIGHT THERE. >> Jeff: OUR OFFICIAL SCORE WERE CREDITING MERTON WITH A SACRIFICE BUNT. ARCIA, HIM PLAYING THIRD BASE, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION HE COULD DO IT DEFENSIVELY. HOW GOOD IS HE FROM THIRD BASE? SOMETIMES, HE GETS OUT QUICKER. >> Bill: YOU HAVE A LOT MORE TIME GETTING TO FIRST BASE. GUYS HAVE A TOUGH TIME WITH T THAT. >> Jeff: AND 0-2 AFTER THAT SLIDER. THINK ABOUT THE WAY THAT ARCIA THROWS. THAT SIDE ARM A LITTLE BIT. THAT THROW FROM THIRD. I THINK ABOUT MATT WILLIAMS, SEEMS TO DO THAT. >> Bill: HE COULD PLAY ANYWHERE, I THINK. I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO PLAY ALL POSITIONS IN ONE GAME. >> Jeff: SAW THAT PITCH HIGH AND TIGHT. ANY BALL THAT'S UP IN THE AIR, SEEMS LIKE HE'S GOING FOR IT. >> Jeff: RASMUSSEN TRYING TO FINISH UP THE RANGERS IN THE SECOND. AND HE DOES.

WHERE ERIN ASHBY THE CATCH FORMER FOURTH ROUND PICK. 6TH STRIKE OUTS HIS TWO INNINGS. THAT TIME BY RASMUSSEN, 2 AND 2. >> Bill: THE BIG NEWS WAS THAT ASHBY IS STILL WITH THE TEAM. SENT OUT TO THE MINOR LEAGUE AREA, BUT HE'S LIKE \"I KIND OF LIKE IT WHEN I BRING A GUY IN, AND HE STRIKES EVERY GUY OUT. >> Jeff: MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A GOOD MANAGER. A BREAKING BALL THAT TIME BY RASMUSSEN. >> Bill: NICE BREAKING PITCH TO GET THEM RIGHT ON THE EDGE. GOOD PITCH, GOOD SLIDER, STRAIGHT DOWN. YOU LIKE. SPIEL AND WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO. THAT PLAYER HAD THE SINGLE TO LEFT TO DRIVE IN THE ONLY RUN OF THE GAME. THREE STRIKEOUTS NOW FOR DREW RASMUSSEN. THE HITTER BOUNCES A SHORT FIRST TIME UP, SQUARES THE BUNT, AND IT'S A STRIKE. RASMUSSEN BEING STRETCHED OUT THIS SPRING. THEY THINK OF HIM AS A BRENT SUTER TYPE, WHERE HE COULD START GAMES FOR YOU, CLOSE THEM IF NECESSARY. FOR RASMUSSEN, HE'S GOING TO DO IT ALL. AS LONG AS HE CONTINUES TO THROW HARD AND GET OUTS, THE BREWERS ARE GOING TO FIND OUT'S FOR HIM TO GET. DOWN THE LEFT FIELD. EXTRA BASES FOR TAVERAS. MITCHELL RUNS IT DOWN, TAVERAS WITH A ONE OUT DOUBLE. >> Bill: THAT'S GOOD RIGHT THERE. GOOD VELOCITY. SLAPS IT RIGHT ON THAT LEFT FIELD LINE FOR A ONE OUT DOUBLE. CHECK IT OUT. GOES RIGHT WITH IT.

NOW, THE TALK OF SPRING TRAINING COMING IN. LEFT-HANDER, ALAN ASHBY. WHAT >> Jeff: HE SPENT HIS TIME ATTH, NEVER PITCHED ABOVE THE A A BALL LEVEL. HE HAS COME IN, AND ALL HE HAS DONE IS STRIKE GUYS OUT. >> Bill: HE'S GOT A GOOD ARSENAL OF PITCHES. WHAT HE DOES WELL IS KEEP HITTERS OFF BALANCE. HE MIXES UP HIS DELIVERY PRETTY WELL. REALLY NOT ONE LOOK. SEE WHAT HE DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN THE MINOR LEAGUE, GOOD NUMBERS. 346. 13 GAMES. THIS SPRING, TWO INNINGS, 6 PUNCH OUTS. NOT TOO SHABBY. >> Jeff: BREWERS HAVE A COUPLE GUYS THAT WILL DO THAT. THIS IS ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHERE CRAIG COUNSELL, INSTEAD OF STARTING THE INNING, MAYBE THEY ARE TRYING TO TRAIN HIM. HE'S KIND OF GUYS THEY NEED TO GET OUT -- TOUGH LEFT-HANDERS. THIS IS WHAT YOU DID LAST THIS IS WHAT HE DID LAST TIME AGAINST THE CLEVELAND INDIANS. >> Bill: STILL A LITTLE BIT OF A PAUSE EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, COMING RIGHT AT YOU. IT'S TOP WHEN YOU ARE UP THERE HITTING, AND HE'S GIVING THESE DIFFERENT LOOKS. A HIGH LEG KICK, THEN HE WILL PAUSE A LITTLE BIT AT TIMES, THEN YOU SEE PAUSE AS THE DIFFERENT SPOTS. YOU CAN'T TIMEOUT THAT DELIVERY. ONE OF THE THINGS HE DOES THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT ON HITTERS. >> Jeff: IT'S NOT JOHNNY, WHERE HE'S THROWING ALL HIS SHOULDERS AT YOU IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT LEG KICKS. IT MAKES THE HITTER STAY ON HIS TOES. BROCK HOLT TAKES HIGH ON THE FASTBALL, 97. >> Bill: WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DISRUPT TIMING. VELOCITIES, MOVEMENT, OR THE DELIVERY. >> Jeff: A RUNNER ON THIRD, TWO AWAY FOR TEXAS. YOU CAN SEE BROCK HOLT FREEZE AT THE PLATE. DOESN'T JUST DISRUPT HITTERS. A RUNNER AT FIRST BASE, TOO. DISRUPT HIS POTENTIAL, TRY AND STEAL SECOND BASE. HERE'S THE SHORT LEG KICK, AND HOLD MISMISSES THE SLIDER. >> Bill: STILL LEARNING. OPENING UP A LOT IN SPRING TRAINING. >> Jeff: SEEN A COUPLE DIFFERENT ANGLES FROM ASHBY. HOLT ON THE DEFENSE. FOULED AWAY, GOT AWAY WITH A HANGER. >> Bill: DIFFERENT DELIVERY THAN HE HAD BEFORE. >> Jeff: ASHBY IS 1-2. A GREAT STOP. >> Bill: THAT HIS TEXTBOOK, TAKE THE ARMS IN THE GLOVE OUT OF THE WAY, AND HAVE IT HIT YOUR CHEST PROTECTOR WITH A SOFT CHEST THAT STAYS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS RIGHT THERE, SQUARING IT UP, DROPPED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. >> Jeff: 2-2. NOW 3 AND 2. CURTIS TERRY AND ON DECK CURTIS TERRY IS ON DECK, THE RIGHT HAND HITTER.

YOU SEE THE HESITATION HERE. >> Bill: WILL HESITATE IN DIFFERENT POINTS OF HIS DEL DELIVERY. >> Jeff: THIS WILL BE THE 9TH PITCH OF HIS AT-BAT. HOLT WORKS THE WALK. DIDN'T GO. ADRIAN JOHNSON DOWN THE THIRD BASE LINE. NOW, ASHBY HAS GOT RUNNERS ON THE CORNERS FOR TERRY. FLIES THE CENTER, FIRST TIME UP. BROCK HOLT CHATTING IT UP WITH DANIEL VOGELBACH OVER AT FIRST. >> Bill: SAYING \"I'M GLAD HE WALKED ME, BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET A GOOD FEEL FOR THE AT-BAT.\" >> Jeff: THAT IS WHAT HE IS SAYING. [LAUGHS] I DON'T KNOW W WHAT THE GUYS DOG OUT THERE. SEE WHAT HE IS LIKE WITH A RUNNER AT FIRST BASE. BLOCKED THAT ONE. >> Bill: NOT SEEING MANY YOUNG PITCHERS, PARTICULARLY -- BIG LEAGUE HISTORY, SPRING TRAINING. ALTHOUGH HE DID WALK HOLT, MANY DIFFERENT DELIVERIES. IT'S BEEN SOMETHING A GUY LATER ON IN HIS CAREER WILL START MESSING AROUND WITH. >> Jeff: A DIFFERENT LEG KICK THAT TIME. FIRST STRIKE. >> Bill: THAT IS MAKE >> THAT IS WHATMAKES YOU VERY IH THROWING STRIKES. >> Jeff: TAKES OFF FOR A SECOND, NOBODY IS THERE. HOLT STEELED SECOND BASE. IF YOU ARE ERIN ASHBY, DON'T YOU THINK ABOUT \"OKAY, THIS IS THE LEG KICK, DON MIKE THAT I DON'T WANT TO USE,\" NOT NECESSARILY WITH A PITCH -- >> Bill: HE DOES KNOW THAT I WOULD IMAGINE, BUT YOU CAN'T START AND DECIDE TO STOP RANDOMLY. >> Jeff: THAT'S WHAT I WOULD THINK. 1 AND 2 AHEAD OF TERRY, AND FOULED IT BACK. >> Bill: OUR SIDELINE REPORTER, SOPHIA ON THAT. >> Jeff: SURE! INSIDE HIM WHEN HE USES LEG KICKS. 1 AND 2 ON CURTIS TERRY. DOWN THE RIGHT FIELD LINE, TOWARDS THE CORNER. DOWN FOR EXTRA BASES. TERRY IN THE SECOND, WITH THE TWO RUNS DOUBLE. THAT ONE ISSUED BY ASHBY, AND THE OTHER ONE GOING AWAY FOR CURTIS TERRY. >> Bill: RANGERS HAD THEIR FIRST RUN ON THE 0-2 PITCH. THIS ONE ON 1-2. THEY TUCKED IT INSIDE THAT RIGHT-FIELD CORNER. DRIVING ANOTHER RUN. >> Jeff: THE PITCH THAT WANDERED FURTHER IN, LEAKED OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE PLATE. ELI WHITE, TRIPLED AND SCORED BACK IN THE SECOND. THE THIRD. FOUL. ASHBY MIGHT BE HAVING A TOUCH OF ADVERSITY IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE. HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN HIS FIRST TWO GAMES. A KID THAT HASN'T PITCHED ABOVE A-BALL. >> Bill: BREWERS KEEPING AN EYE ON ASHBY. IS HE ABLE TO GET OUT OF IT? DID YOU THINK HE WAS GOING TO STRIKE EVERYBODY OUT ALL SPRING? >> Jeff: WOULD'VE BEEN NICE. >> Bill: PROBABLY NOT. >> Jeff: GOOD CHANGEUP THAT TIME. 1 AND 2. GOT GOOD STUFF. >> Bill: THAT CHANGEUP EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTED, ON THE OUTSIDE >> Jeff: WHITE HANGING IN THERE. A GOOD BREAKING BALL BY ASHBY. >> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ASHBY'S TIMING. WHEN WE SPOKE TO HIM AFTER HIS LAST APPEARANCE, HE SHARED THAT THE TIMING AND LEG KICKS IS SOMETHING HE STARTED TO DEVELOP WHEN HE WAS PITCHING IN COLLEGE IN MISSOURI, PRIOR TO WHEN THE BREWERS DRAFTED HIM IN 2018. HE SAID \"I KEPT HEARING THE COACHES PREACH TO HITTERS THAT IT'S ABOUT TIMING,\" SO HIS VELPHILOSOPHY WAS \"HOW CAN I AFT THEIR TIMING ON THE PLATE?\" HE REALIZED HE COULD MESS WITH THE TIMING OF THE HITTERS, AND THE RESULT IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW. >> Jeff: THANK YOU SO MUCH. AARON ASHBY GETS OUT OF IT. A COUPLE RUNS COME IN. RANGERS >> Jeff: BREWERS BASEBALL. SPONSORED BY MENARDS, AND BY -- WE ARE ALL IN. THAT IS NOT A CURRENT VIEW OF AMERICAN FAMILY FIELDS THIS EVENING, BUT THEY DID HAVE TO ROLL THE TARPS OUT. A RARITY HERE IN ARIZONA. IT'S CHILLY. VERY NICE TO BE OUTSIDE AND WATCH A BALL GAME. ONE BALL, NO STRIKE. >> Bill: AT LEAST THEY ARE NOT A NORTHERNERS ON, WITH A BUNCH OF SNOW -- LIKE STUFF, GRAND CANYON. >> Jeff: WE WOULD NOT BE PLAYING BALL UP THERE. >> Bill: IT'S AN AMAZING STATE. YOU HAVE DESERT, AND THEN THE SNOW, THEY HAVE SKI HILLS UP THERE. SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY HERE. >> Jeff: ALL WITHIN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS. TO THIRD, BACKHANDED. A WIDE THROW. TAGGED DOWN. >> Bill: GOOD WORK AT FIRST BASE. HE IS BUSY OVER A THIRD. THE PLAYER HAS BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE GROUND BALLS, THROWS IT FOR A DIFFERENT. LOOK AT THIS. NICE PLAY BY TERRY. MAKES A TAG. >> Jeff: A LITTLE CRIB SHEET RIGHT THERE ABOUT HIS POSITION, NOT HIS ARM ANGLE WITH WHICH TO THROW. >> Bill: PROBABLY SANG \"PUT SOMETHING ON THROW.\" .\" [LAUGHTER] >> Jeff: GARRETT MITCHELL. FIRST PAGE CURVEBALL TO MIT MITCHELL. SPEECH WITH THIS GUY'S GOT A GOOD APPROACH. >> Jeff: HE'S BEEN EXCELLENT SO FAR THIS SPRING. 5 HITS AND 11 AT-BATS. TAKES INSIDE. FEELS LIKE WHENEVER HE HITS THE BALL, HE'S HITTING IT HARD SOMEWHERE. TODAY, MAKING AN APPEARANCE IN LEFT FIELD, AFTER PLAYING CENTER FIELD EXCLUSIVELY. THAT'S A GOOD CHANGEUP. MITCHELL OUT IN FRONT. 1 AND 2. SOMETHING EARLIER TODAY AND THERE'S SOME CALL THAT IF YOU CAN BE EXCITED ABOUT A FIRST-ROUND PICK AND ALREADY HIGH EXPECTATIONS, GARRETT MITCHELL HAS EXCEEDED THOSE HIS FIRST SPRING. >> Bill: EVERY BIT OF HIS GAME, HE IS SOLID. >> Jeff: THAT'S SOLID CONTACT, TOWARDS DEEP CENTER, AND GARRETT MITCHELL HAS GONE DEEP! RIGHT ON CUE. >> Bill: DON'T YOU LOVE IT WHEN THESE GUYS MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD? GOOD APPROACH, OPENED UP SOME EYES, HAVING A NICE SPRING. HE'S A GOOD ONE. HE'S NOT GOING TO BE IN THE MINOR LEAGUES LONG, I DON'T THINK. DON'T THINK. >> Jeff: CHECK THIS OUT. A FASTBALL UP. A LOT OF LEFTIES LIKE IT DOWN IN THE ZONE, BUT HE GETS ON TOP OF IT, RISING OUT HERE. THE LOOKING PLAYER >> Bill: GOOD LOOKING PLAYER. >> Jeff: GARRETT MITCHELL, WHEN HE WAS DRAFTED, THEY SAID THE POWER WAS GOING TO COME. I THINK THE POWER IS ALREADY THERE. JACKIE BRADLEY JR. TAKING AWAY, 1-0. HE FELL ON THE DRAFT TO NUMBER 20 FOR THE BREWERS, THEY WERE THRILLED. >> JBRADLEY JR. HIT THAT. HE TRIES TO GET THE SECOND, AND HE WILL. NEVER SLOWED DOWN. >> Bill: ALWAYS LOOKING TO TAKE THAT EXTRA BASE. THE DOUBLE, YOU HIT IT HERE, AS SOON AS YOU GET OUT OF THE BOX, YOU ARE THINKING TWO RIGHT AWAY. HE GETS A GOOD TURN AT FIRST, GOOD EXTENSION ON THE SWING. A DOUBLE FOR J.B. JAY. >> Jeff: A HOME RUN, EXTRA BASE HIT. GARCIA COMING UP WITH ONLY ONE OUT. SMOOTH SWING FROM JACKIE BRADLEY JR. THE OFFICIAL SCORE WERE UP TO HIS USUAL TRICKS, AS OPPOSED TO GIVING HIM A DOUBLE, GIVES HIM A SINGLE. I'M PUTTING IT DOWN AS A DOUBLE. >> Bill: DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE SAYS. THAT'S A DOUBLE. REGULAR SEASON, YOU MIGHT WANT TO COMPLAIN AND GET THAT CHANGED, BUT THAT'S A DOUBLE. >> Jeff: NEVER SLOWED DOWN! JUST KEEPS RUNNING. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES HE'S DONE IN A WHILE. ANDREW HAS BEEN KEEPING SCORE OVER THERE, DONE A HECK OF A J JOB. ONLY THE THIRD INNING, AND A COUPLE OF DISCREPANCIES ALREADY. OKAY. IT'S A DOUBLE. FOR US, AT LEAST. GARCIA HITS ONE, FOULED, AND OUT OF PLAY. JACKIE BRADLEY JR. OUT-OF-THE-BOX, TAKING THAT CHANGEUP. DOWN THE RIGHT FIELD LINE, HAS HE SLOWED DOWN?

DRIVING NOT RUN. >> Jeff: LAST YEAR, WHEN VOGELBACH WAS HAVING A GREAT -- AND MANY HOME RUNS AGAINST THE KANSAS CITY ROYALS LATE IN THE GAME. WE TALKED ABOUT HIS POWER. HIS TWO STRIKES HITTING APPROACH IS IMPRESSIVE. >> Bill: MAKES YOU SCRATCH YOUR HEAD AS TO WHY HE HAD SUCH PROBLEMS WITH SEATTLE. ON APPROACH LIKE HIS, TO HIT ON THE 100 COMPANY HAD LIKE 3:30 FOR THE BREWERS. >> Jeff: GARCIA TAKES THAT ALL NO, NO STRIKES. LEFT-HANDED POWER HITTER, GETS INTO THOSE AMERICAN BALLPARKS.

IT'S HARD AS A PITCHING COACH, BECAUSE HE HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT KICKS, WORKING ON BALANCE POINT. HOW DO YOU WORK ON THAT IN BETWEEN APPEARANCES? >> Bill: CHRIS HOOK HASN'T SEEN A LOT OF ASHBY. A LOT OF TIMES, THESE COACHES, EVEN WITH HAND MIKE ANDY HAINES AND HITTERS HE HASN'T SEEN A WHOLE LOT OF, YOU WATCH WHAT THEY DO, DON'T JUMP ON THEM RIGHT AWAY WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE CHANGES.

GREAT WHEN THERE PEOPLE WATCHING YOU DO WHAT YOU DO. >> Bill: IS IT SAFE TO SAY THAT PLAYERS ARE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS? THINGS SEEM TO BE A LITTLE MORE NORMAL QUESTION WORK >> David: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. LAST YEAR, THERE WAS SO MUCH UNKNOWN ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT, HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THE WORK, WHAT TRAVEL WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE GUYS HAVE GONE THROUGH IT. YES, 60 GAMES, TWO MONTHS LAST YEAR. 162 COMING UP. THERE'S FAMILIARITY WITH ITS COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WHY WE ARE DOING IT. I THINK GUYS ARE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE NOW THAN AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR. >> Jeff: TWO BIG ADDITIONS TO THIS ROSTER THAT CAME TO FRUITION, KIND OF LATE IN SPRING TRAINING HERE. >> David: IT WAS AN ODDLY PACED OFF-SEASON FOR MANY OF US. THAT DIDN'T SURPRISE MANY OF US COMING INTO THIS. THERE WERE A LOT OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THAT, THE PANDEMIC FIRST AND FOREMOST. SOME UNKNOWNS ABOUT WHAT THIS SEASON WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THE OFF-SEASON. UNKNOWNS ABOUT FANS IN THE STAND, I WOULD TELL MIKE OTHER REVENUE STREAMS. ALL OF THAT PLAYS A PART IN TO HOW CLUBS OPERATE AS YOU GO THROUGH AN OFF-SEASON. THIS ONE FOR THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE, AND US SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE DELAYED THAN NORMAL. MOST OF THEM ARE TRANSACTIONAL, TAKE PLACE LATER IN THE WINTER. AS YOU MENTIONED, WERE ABLE TO SIGN THIS PLAYER AND JACKIE BRADLEY JR. EXCITED TO BRING BOTH OF THOSE GUYS ON BOARD AS OUR TOPLINE ACQUISITIONS FOR THE OFF-SEASON. BOTH GUYS AT A FAIR AMOUNT TO OUR TEAM GOING FORWARD. >> Bill: IS IT SAFE TO SAY IT'S BEEN UNEVENTFUL? YOU HAD MANY PLAYERS -- GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THOSE GUYS. >> David: IN GENERAL, IT HAS BEEN AN UNEVENTFUL SPRING. PROGRESSING WELL. WE ARE HOPEFUL TO GET THAT PLAYER INTO GAME ACTION THROUGH THE END OF THIS COMING WEEK. WE WILL SEE HOW HE GOES, HOW HE PROGRESSES. THE TIMELINE TO GET THE SPRING TRAINING 100% IS COMPRESSED A LITTLE BIT, BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. WE ARE EXCITED TO GET A BLOWBACK HERE. SPOON DANIEL ROBERTSON THERE IS DANIEL ROBERTSON. HE IS STILL A VERY YOUNG PLAYER IN A FORMER FIRST-ROUND PICK, WAS STARTING TO HIT HIS STRIDE OFFENSIVELY. A GUY THAT CAN PLAY A BIG ROLE. >> David: DANIEL ROBERTSON CAME UP AS A SHORTSTOP, HE HAS PLAYED SOME OUTFIELD. ANOTHER ONE OF THESE VERSATILE GUYS THAT WE LIKE A LOT. SOMEONE WHO WE THINK IS GOING TO PLAY A PART ON OUR TEAM. >> Jeff: ONE THINKS OF IT ABOUT THE BREWERS SEASON LAST YEAR WAS THE PITCHING. BOTH OF THOSE GUYS THROUGH GAMES YESTERDAY. BRANDON PITCHED AGAINST THE CUBS. YOU HAVE TO REALLY LIKE WHERE YOU YOUR YOU HAVE TO REALLY LIKE WHERE YOUR PITCHING STANDS RIGHT NOW. >> David: THAT'S THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEAM. IT STARTS WITH BRANDON, WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED. CORBIN PUT TOGETHER AN IMPRESSIVE 60 GAME STRETCH LAST YEAR. BEING RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE BETTER PITCHERS OF THE NATIONAL LEAGUE. WE ARE LOOKING FOR BOTH THOSE GUYS TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRESSION. YOU LOOK AT THE BULLPEN, JOSH HADER, WILLIAMS, A ONE-TWO PUNCH IN THE BACK END OF THE BULLPEN. THOSE FOUR GUYS AS MUCH AS ANYONE HELP ANCHOR, SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR TEAM. >> Bill: TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE TEAMS IN BASEBALL ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE SIX-MAN ROTATION AT SOME POINT, BASED ON ENDINGS AND APPEARANCES LAST YEAR. TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE YEAR. >> David: WE ARE COMING OFF OF A 60-GAME SEASON, WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF STOPS AND STARTS FOR OUR PITCHERS. WE ARE BACK INTO A SEASON WITH A FULL 162 OVER 6 MONTHS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW PITCHERS ARE GOING TO REACT. THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO KEEP GUYS HEALTHY, PROACTIVELY REST GUYS. YOU MAY SEE A SIX-MAN ROTATION, MAY SEE THINGS LIKE SPLITTING GAMES BETWEEN TWO OPTIONS, JUST TO HELP GUYS GET TO THE FINISH LINE. THE POINT OF THIS IS TO GET EVERYONE HEALTHY INTO SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, AND EFFECTIVE. IF IT MEANS DOING SOME THINGS PRIMITIVELY EARLY IN THE SEASON, WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS, SMART, IMPLEMENT THOSE CHANGES. >> Jeff: DATE DEVIN WILLIAMS OR HADER , >> Jeff: EVEN A GUY LIKE DEVIN WILLIAMS OR HATER, YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO GO TO 70 THIS YEAR. >> David: THERE IS PACING THAT'S INVOLVED. WE WANT THEM TO PEEK AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE DON'T WANT TO EXTEND THEM TOO MUCH IN APRIL /MAY, SO WHEN WE GET INTO AUGUST-OCTOBER, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GAS LEFT IN THE TAN IT'S SOMETHING CRAIG HAS DONE WELL IN HIS TIME HERE. IT IS SOMETHING IN OUR MIND. >> Jeff: THAT'S GOING TO END MY ARE ENDING. THAT WILL END OUR TIME WITH DAVID STEARNS, PRESIDENT OF BREWERS OPERATIONS. THANKS FOR TAKING TIME WITH US. >> David: THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> Jeff: 3-3 GAME AT THE END >> Jeff: BREWERS BASEBALL IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY -- THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN. 3-THREE GAME IN ARIZONA. BREWERS AND TEXAS RANGERS. WE HAVE MADE IT TO THE 5TH INNING. THE BREWERS WILL SEE LEFT-HANDER JOSH HADER ON THE MOUND, MAKES HIS SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SPRING. DOWN IN MESA WAS HIS LAST APPEARANCE. EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW GOOD JOSH HADER IS, HOW GOOD HE HAS BEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS. >> Bill: 1-2 RECORD OF COURSE, BUT .379, THE EARNED RUN AVERAGE. HIT UP A LITTLE BIT A YEAR AGO, BUT NO ONE IS PERFECT. HE SET THE BAR SO HIGH IS FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS. >> Jeff: FIRST PITCH TO DESHIELDS. HE THREW A LOT OF SLIDERS A FEW DAYS AGO IN MESA. FOR A GUY LIKE JOSH, YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT FASTBALL IS. TO GET A SLIDER HERE IN SPRING IS HUGE. >> Bill: HE USED IT A LOT LAST YEAR IN THAT 60-GAME SEASON. THERE WERE A LOT OF STRIKEOUTS, SURPRISED A LOT OF HITTERS. 31 PUNCH OUTS FOR JOSH IN 19 ENDINGS. HAD 13 SAVES, LED THE LEAGUE. BACK IN 2019,  37 SAVES SEVEN SAVES. >> Jeff: ALL-STARS IN THE YEARS '18 AND '19, LEADER FOR TO GO STRAIGHT YEARS UNTIL DEVIN WILLIAMS TOOK THAT CROWN ROOKIE OF THE YEAR LAST SEASON. 95, THAT FASTBALL FROM JOSH HADER. STILL JUST 26 YEARS OLD. BACK IN THE AT BATS, 3 AND 2. >> Bill: ONE OF THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE AT BATS IN THE BIG LEAKS, FACING JOSH HADER. HE CAN MAKE YOU LOOK REALLY BAD. >> Jeff: HE MISSED HIGH THIS TIME ON DESHIELDS. THE LEADOFF MAN IS A BOARD FOR TEXAS. SECOND ENDING IN A ROW THAT THE LEADOFF MAN HAS WALKED. BROCK HOLT IS GOING TO COME UP, ANOTHER UNCOMFORTABLE -- FOR BROCK HOLT. JOSH HADER, HE HAS BEEN USED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ROLES OVER HIS TIME WITH THE BREWERS. WHEN HE FIRST MADE HIS DEBUT IN 2017, HE'S GONE MULTIPLE INKS, AND NOT NECESSARILY CLOSING GAMES, BUT HIGH LEVERAGE SITUATIONS. 2018, HE WAS THUS WAS ARMY KNIFE, COMING IN AND THE 4TH INNING, SOMETIMES IN THE 9TH. LAST YEAR, THE BREWERS DID A SMART THING BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF THIS SEASON. DIDN'T HAVE THOSE MULTIPLE INNING APPEARANCES LAST YEAR. >> Bill: HAD DAVID WILLIAMS. THAT'S A GUY THAT CAN GET YOU FROM THE 6TH AND INTO THE 9TH REALLY QUICKLY. >> Jeff: STRIKE ON THE BROCK HOLT. >> Bill: WHAT A ONE-TWO PUNCH THAT WAS LAST HERE. >> Jeff: ARE OPEN FOR THE SAME I>> Jeff: BREWERS ARE HOPING FOR THE SAME IN 2021. BREWERS EXPECTING A LOT FROM THAT PLAYER. A SWING AND A MISS. HOLT HAS GONE ON STRIKE. >> Bill: BIG PHIL OF VELOCITY, RIGHT IN THE CORNER. LOOK WHERE THAT BALL COMES OUT OF JOSH'S HAND, BASED ON WHERE HOLT IS. ENDS UP ON THE OUTSIDE PART OF THE PLATE. >> Jeff: SWING AND A MISS BY TERRY. LOOK AT WHERE THIS PITCH IS WHEN IT COMES OUT OF THE HAND IN RELATION TO WHERE BROCK HOLT IS. >> Bill: IF JOSH BELIEVES THAT ON THE INNER HALF, IT GIVES HOLT A CHANCE, BUT AWAY? GOOD LUCK. >> Jeff: FROM THE HIP, FRONT SHOULDER. HUNTER GOES, THROW DOWN TO SECOND, RIGHT ON THE BACK. INSIDE. >> Bill: RIGHT ON THE MONEY. HOW ABOUT THAT RELEASE? BEAUTIFUL THROAT CAN'T GET IT IN AND OUT BEAUTIFUL THROW. STRAIGHT OVER THE TOP, NO SALE ON IT. BINGO. NICE THROW. >> Jeff: ALL ROBERTSON HAD TO DO WAS CATCH IT. HE RACES THAT LEADOFF. TERRY DOWN IN THE COUNT. SLIDER DOWN AND IN. AFTER THE RECALIBRATION, FOLLOWING THE WALK TO DESHIELDS, HADER HAS BEEN IN COMMAND. THERE IS A GO TO SLIDER, 2-2. 83 MILES AN HOUR. IT TAKES A LOT OUT OF HIM. COMES OUT OF THAT SAME ARM SLOT AS THE FASTBALL. LET'S BACK UP THE MIDDLE, HIT BY TERRY. HE'S GOT HIMSELF ANOTHER HIT. HE HAS A TWO-RUN DOUBLE BACK IN THE THIRD, AND NOW TWO OUT SINGLE TO EXTEND THE INNING INTO ELI WHITE. >> Bill: LOOKS LIKE A GOOD HITTER. AFTER THE SLIDER MADE HIM LOOK BACK, HATER HADER COMES BACK WIA FASTBALL. HE'S ABLE TO STAY ON IT. BACK ON THE SANDS A BIT, HARD INTO CENTER. BACK IN THE STANDS A BIT, HOWARD AND INTO CENTER. >> Jeff: SWING AND A MISS BY ELI WHITE, 90-MILE-AN-HOUR FASTBALL. CURTIS TERRY, A GUY WHO NEVER PLAYED ABOVE A-BALL. THERE HE IS OVER AT FIRST BASE. BIG GUY. 6'2\", 260. JUST MISSED. ONE ON WHITE, WHO'S TRIPLED. A FUNNY MOMENT YESTERDAY DOWN IN FLORIDA. MARLINS WERE PLAYING THE METS. MARCUS STROMAN WAS PITCHING FOR THE METS, AND THREW THEM A GOOD BREAKING BALL. LOOK DOWN AT HIM, WINKED AT HIM, NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID \"GOOD PITCH.\" DOING THINGS. HOPE HE NEVER CHANGES. >> Bill: HE WON'T. >> Jeff: THIS IS WHAT'S COMING UP ON YOUR TELEVISION SETS, TV SCHEDULE. MONDAY, PADRES GAME HERE AT HOME. THEN, THE DODGERS AND WHITE SOX AT HOME. FOLLOW, THAT WAS A FOUL, THAT WAS A HARD BREAKING BALL BY JOSH HADER. THE GAME ON THE 18. BREWERS AND ANGELS. FOLKS IN WISCONSIN WILL BE LISTENING TO THE ANGEL BROADCAST DAY. SEND DOWN THE AIRWAVES. 1-2. A PIPE. 2-2. >> Bill: FOLKS IN WISCONSIN, DON'T FORGET -- IT'S DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME. GO TO BED TONIGHT, TURN THOSE CLOCKS -- >> Jeff: TURN THOSE CLOCKS FORWARD. >> Bill: WE DON'T HAVE TO. WE DON'T HAVE THAT HERE. I REMEMBER THAT SPRING FORWARD, FALL BEHIND, FALL BACK? >> Jeff: 2-2, SWING AND A MISS. >> Bill: THAT'S HOW WE REMEMBERED. >> Jeff: MAY TOO. [LAUGHTER] I REMEMBER BECAUSE MY KID'S SLEEPING PATTERN GETS ALL MESSED UP. 3-3 GAME. >> Jeff: MARCHES WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. GO TO OUR WEBSITE TO SEE SOME OF -- FAMOUS FEMALE ATHLETES. ANOTHER POINT IN PARTICULAR. >> Bill: THAT'S THE MAIN  -- >> Bill: IN THAT AREA, THAT'S THE MAIN ONE, MATHERS POINT. >> Jeff: STRIKE NEWS. >> Bill: 71 GAMES. HOW ABOUT THAT? 11-10 RECORD. A LOT OF BASERUNNERS FOR YANG. >> Jeff: A YANG COMING OVER TO PLAY FOR THE TEXAS RANGERS. TODAY'S STARTING PITCHER FOR THE BREWERS IS DREW RASMUSSEN. ANOTHER GOOD OUTING. HE IS STANDING BY WITH SOPHIA MINNAERT. >> Sophia: OVERALL, WHAT FEEDBACK ARE YOU LOOKING TO GET UP WITH YOUR APPEARANCES HERE IN SPRING TRAINING? >> Drew: WE WANTED TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH. ONLY COW. HOLY COW WHAT. [LAUGHTER] WE WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF LENGTH, AND ONE AND 1-2 PLUS TO GET TO THE THIRD INNING, COULD GO EITHER DIRECTION. TODAY, I WANTED TO THROW EVERYTHING FOR A STRIKE. PITCHES WERE IN THE ZONE, BUT COMMAND WAS THE MOST SHARP. BRING TO A COUPLE STRIKE ACCOUNTS. YOU WOULD LIKE TO AVOID THAT, UNFORTUNATELY. >> Sophia: YOU MADE YOUR MAJOR-LEAGUE DEBUT LAST YEAR, A CRAZY SEASON FOR EVERYONE. YOU WERE ABLE TO MAKE 12 RELEASES. WHAT DID THAT DO FOR CONFIDENCE, HELPING YOU PREPARE TO COMPETE FOR A SPOT IN THAT BULLPEN? >> Drew: I'VE NEVER PITCHED OUT OF THE BULLPEN. DOING IT IN THE BIG LEAGUES IS QUITE THE EXPERIENCE. GETTING THE CONFIDENCE, GETTING BIG LEAGUE HITTERS OUT INTO CRUCIAL PARTS OF THE GAME WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE, IT DOES NOTHING BUT BOOST CONFIDENCE. NOW YOU KNOW, JUST LOOKING BACK ON SOME OF MY OUTINGS LAST YEAR, I GOT SOME GOOD BIG LEAGUE HITTERS OUT. IT EXCITES ME, LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER ME TO WORK IN THE OFF-SEASON. GOOD TO SEE FANS. THAT WILL ADD EXCITEMENT. >> Sophia: 21 STRIKEOUTS FOR YOU IN THOSE APPEARANCES. HOW DID YOU -- >> Drew: PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM AMATEUR, WHERE YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO THROW UP IN THE ZONE. THAT'S SOMETHING I NEED TO WORK ON IN 2019. LAST YEAR'S SUCCESS THROWING STRIKES AT THE TOP OF THE ZONE AND BEING ABLE TO EXPAND OFF IT. THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY WORKING POINTS, AND THE FEEDBACK LAST YEAR THAT IT DOES WORK IS ALL I NEEDED TO SEE. >> Sophia: HOW WORDING WAS IT, THE EXPERIENCE >> Sophia: HOW REWARDING WAS IT, THE EXPERIENCE TO GET THAT CALL? THOSE TO TOMMY JOHN'S YOU HAD TO OVERCOME, HOW REWARDING WAS THAT MOMENT, AND WILL THIS YEAR FEEL LIKE ANOTHER DEBUT GETTING TO PITCH IN FRONT OF FANS? >> Drew: 100%. THE CHILDHOOD DREAM COMING TRUE WAS QUITE THE EXPERIENCE, AND IT WAS FUN LAST YEAR GETTING TO PITCH IN THE BIG LEAGUES. THIS YEAR WITH FANS, THERE WILL BE A NEW ENERGY IN THE BALLPARK. NOW HAVING TO TAME THE EMOTIONS, DO SO WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WATCHING WILL BE ANOTHER LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE. >> Sophia: WE JUST HAD DAVID'S TURNS ON, AND HE SAID THIS PITCHING STAFF IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THIS TEAM. HOW EXCITED ARE YOU TO BE A PART OF THIS BULLPEN, AND THE DIFFERENT LOOKS, THE ARM ANGLES, FUNKINESS OF THIS GROUP? >> Drew: IT'S AN HONOR GETTING TO WORK WITH ALL THE GUYS DOWN THERE DAY IN AND DAY OUT. WE GOT A GOOD GROUP OF GUYS. , NOT JUST BASEBALL PLAYERS, BUT GOOD GUYS, WHICH ALWAYS MAKES IT MORE ENJOYABLE. LIKE I SAID, IT'S AN HONOR TO BE DOWN THERE WITH THEM. CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED IN HIS GAME. GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PITCH WITH THEM IS A BLESSING. >> Sophia: THANKS FOR THE TI TIME. >> Jeff: AND THANKS TO DREW RASMUSSEN AND SOPHIA MINNAERT CHATTING IN THE BREWERS DUG OUT. HE'S LOCKED IN. >> Bill: CLASSIC I. SAYS ALL THE RIGHT >> Bill: CLASSY GUY, SAYS ALL THE RIGHT THINGS. LAST YEAR, HE DESERVES TO BE IN THE SPOT HE IS IN. HE PITCHED WELL. IT IS A GOOD GROUP OF HUMAN BEINGS ON THIS BREWERS ROSTER. , GOOD GUYS THROUGH AND THROUGH. >> Jeff: OVERCOMING TWO TOMMY JOHN'S SURGERIES. USUALLY THAT WAS -- YOUR SECOND ONE, YOU HAVE NO CHANCE TO COME BACK, BUT NOW HE'S DOING IT. HE'S LIVING PROOF. 2-2 TO GARCIA. FRAMING IT UP AS A STRIKE. WELL STRUCK BY ARCIA. 1-2 IN INNING. 3-3 GAME >> Bill: 3-3 HERE AT AMERICAN FAMILY FIELDS IN PHOENIX. TOP 6 HEREIN PHOENIX. SUITING UP FOR A BRAND-NEW SEASON AT MLBShop.com.  CHECK OUT THE NEW YEAR, AND SHARP FROM THE LARGEST SELECTION OF T-SHIRTS, HOODIES, COLLECTIBLES AND MORE. GEAR UP WITH THE BREWERS AT  MLBShop.com.  THAT'S A BIG DEAL TODAY. BUT THEY ARE SELLING A LOT OF THEM. >> Jeff: BLANKETS, PONCHOS, NOT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF RAIN, BUT JUST IN CASE. ALL THAT GREAT BREWERS GEAR HERE, AND AT AMERICAN FAMILY FIELD. BACK IN MILWAUKEE, FIRST PITCH FROM THE LEFT-HANDER. BLAINE HARDY, STRIKE OVER THE OUTSIDE CORNER. LAST TIME HE WORKED IN THE BIG LEAGUES WAS IN 19 WITH DETROIT. >> Bill: HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE TIGERS, FIRST TIME WAS WAY BACK IN 2014. >> Jeff: THAT ONE TAKES OVER FOR JACKIE BRADLEY >> Jeff: BAT PLAYER TAKES OVER FOR JACKIE BRADLEY JR., DEFENSIVELY. ORIGINALLY WITH THE ROYALS, BUT HE PUT IN GOOD WORK IN THAT TIGERS BULLPEN FOR SIX YEARS. 233 BIG-LEAGUE APPEARANCES. GROUND BALL, BACK TO HIM. 1, 2. >> Bill: BEST FRIEND. LIKES THAT CHANGEUP, MARTY.

HE'S OUTSIDE, 3-2. >> Bill: THAT BALL OVER THE HILL, UPON THE ROCK QUITE. THAT WAS A BOMB. >> Jeff: THERE IS A DYLAN COZENS HOME RUN FROM YESTERDAY. SEE WHERE THIS THING LANDS. >> Bill: LOOK AT THAT, RIGHT OFF THE CONCESSION STAND. GARRETT MITCHELL, SOPHIA WAS -- HOW ABOUT THAT LINE DRIVE UP THE MIDDLE? GOT SOME LEFTIES. HE HAS OPENED IT UP. >> Jeff: HOME OR IN THE THIRD INNING, THEN BACK UP THE MIDDLE. DREW RASMUSSEN SAID IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SENTENCE. SWING AND A MISS. HARDY, THE UNCONVENTIONAL 1-2-3 INNING. >> Jeff: BREWERS COMMUNITY FOUNDATION SERVES FOR THE CHAIR OF THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS. FANS, PLAYERS, AND THE FRONT OFFICE. THEY ALL ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND OUR COMMUNITY. WE EXTEND FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP TO PROVIDE QUALITY PROGRAMMING IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, RECREATION, BASIC NEEDS.

NUMBER ONE, STANDING BY WITH SOPHIA MINNAERT IS DANIELLE ROBINSON DELLE MIKE ROBERTS IN ! FOR >> Dnaiel: IT FELT GOOD. >> Sophia: COACH CONSIDERS YOU A PLAYER THAT CAN PLAY ALL OVER. YOU'VE SHOWN THAT IN YOUR TIME WITH THE BIG LEAGUES. WE'VE SEEN MUCH TRUCK HOW ARE YOU TAKING ON THAT ROLE AND PREPARING YOURSELF DAY-TO-DAY FOR WHATEVER POSITION YOU ARE SET TO PLAY? >> Dnaiel: TAKE PRIDE IN IT. IT'S MY CAREER, SO IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING YOUR REPS.  -- >> Daniel: THIS GUY'S GOING TO HIT ONE OUT OF THE YARD, KEEPING MY HEAD ON A SWIVEL, BUT MAKING SURE YOU ARE SEEING IT ON DIFFERENT ANGLES. THAT'S THE MAIN THING. THE BALL COMES OFF A LITTLE DIFFERENT. JUST TRYING TO FIND TUNE IT. >> Sophia: FEEL FREE TO DROP IN SOME PLAY-BY-PLAY. WE WILL DEFER TO YOU ON THAT. WHAT HAS YOUR TIME BEEN LIKE, JUST SHARING THE INFIELD WITH SOME OF THESE GUYS AS YOU ARE GETTING TO KNOW THESE NEW TEAMMATES, ORLANDO ARCIA, OTHERS, GETTING TO KNOW YOUR TEAM INTEGRATING YOURSELF IN THE INFIELD? >> Daniel: JUST GETTING FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER, BEING RENTS AND PLAYERS LIKE COLTON, AND ESTABLISHED BIG LEAGUERS LIKE ARCIA. IT'S A GREAT GROUP, HAVING FUN, JUST TRYING TO GET THE REPS IN AND LET IT PLAY OUT ON THE FI FIELD. >> Sophia: WHEN YOU JOINED THIS TEAM, YOU SAID YOU LIKED THE OPPORTUNITY HERE, CONSIDERED IT TO BE A DEBUT. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE A POINT WHERE YOU CAN MAKE AN IMPACT. CAN YOU SHARE YOUR MIND-SET COMING INTO THIS TEAM? >> Daniel: HAPPY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY, A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON. I'M HERE TO HELP THE TEAM WON, HOWEVER THAT IS. GET OUT ON THE FIELD, LEAVE IT OUT THERE, HAVE FUN. LIKE I SAID, IT'S A GREAT GROUP OF GUYS. THAT'S ALL I HEARD WHEN I WAS TALKING TO SOME THE TEAMS IN THE OFF-SEASON. TO BE OUT HERE ALL FIELD, IT'S AMAZING. LOOKING FORWARD TO KEEPING THIS GOING, AND GETTING UNDERWAY HERE SOON. 20 DAYS OR SO HERE LEFT. JUST TRYING TO HAVE FUN, KEEP IT SIMPLE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A MULTITUDE OF GUYS TO CONTRIBUTE. >> Sophia: WAS CHALLENGING FOR EVERYONE LAST YEAR. WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE HAVING EVEN 25% CAPACITY OF FANS FOR THIS SPRING TRAINING? >> Daniel: IT'S A GAME CHANGER. SEEING PEOPLE IN SEATS, GETTING ADRENALINE GOING, I KNOW IT'S CLICHE, BUT WE PLAY FOR THE FANS. HE GIVES US THAT BOOST, SO WE COME OUT HERE AND DO WHAT WE DO. IT WAS WEIRD LAST YEAR WITH NO ONE IN THE SEATS. 25% CAPACITY, FULL CAPACITY IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUT THERE. >> Sophia: THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. >> Daniel: THANK YOU. >> Jeff: A REMINDER, THIS TELECAST IS PRESENTED BY THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS AND MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED OR RETRANSMITTED. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS GAME MAY NOT BE DISSEMINATED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS. IT'S A 3-3 GAME AS WE REACH T THIS. WE ARE ONLY PLAYING SEVEN INNINGS. SMALL, NUMBER ONE OF THOSE GREAT, TALENTED LEFT-HANDERS TAKES OVER. >> Bill: A FIRST-ROUND PICK FOR THE BREWERS IN 2019. 6'3\", 215. YOU SEE WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO. 7 APPEARANCES, GOOD RUN AVERAGE AT .86. A SUB 1 E.R.A. I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU ARE PITCHING, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. >> Jeff: A FIRST PITCH ON THE OUTSIDE CORNER. SMALL AGAINST CLEVELAND ON THE FOURTH. BEEN A WHILE SINCE THEY'VE PITCHED IN A BIG LEAGUE GAME. BUT A HANDFUL OF TIMES IN THOSE SIDE CONTESTS. GIVING UP A RUN, TWO INNINGS OF WORK. ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE GUYS LIKE AARON ASHBY, WHERE HE VARIES LIKE KICKS. A LITTLE MORE CONVENTIONAL >> Bill: A LITTLE MORE CONVENTIONAL THAN ASHBY. WILL CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, BUT HE'S GOT THE FAST ONE.  >> Jeff: 1-2 TO CULBERSON. DIVES ALONG WITH HIS GLOVE. CULBERSON WILL END UP AT LEAST AT THIRD. THERE HE STANDS WITH THE LEADOFF TRIPLE. >> Bill: IT WAS PRETTY DEEP OUT THERE, .364 DOWN THE STRAIGHTAWAYS, RIGHT DOWN THE LINE. FULLY STRETCHED OUT, HE WAS ON HIS STOMACH. CULBERSON ABLE TO GET THAT. TIED GAME HERE IN PHOENIX ON THE SEVENTH INNING. DIDN'T MISS BY MUCH. >> Jeff: GREAT EFFORTS BY COUSINS. THE INFIELD WILL COME IN FOR THAT PLAYER, WHO HAS PLAYED THE WHOLE WAY. BOTH THE PRIZED LEFT-HANDERS AND THE BREWERS FARM SYSTEM ON THE HILL. PITCHING WITH SOME ADVERSITY BEHIND THEM. JUST MISSED. 2-0. BACK IN THE AT-BATS, ETHAN SM SMALL, 2 BALLS, 1 A STRIKE ON. >> Bill: A PRETTY AVERAGE FASTBALL. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE BIG VELOCITY OF THE 94 FASTBALL. TAVERAS, A LITTLE BEHIND IT. >> Jeff: THERE IS THE OFF-SPEED FOR A STRIKE. HIGH STRIKE. RANGERS FANS DIDN'T LIKE IT, NEITHER DID THE DOG AT THE HITTER. FULL COUNT, 3-2. THEY ARE INSIDE THE AT THIRD. CULBERSON SCORES, TAVERAS WITH HIS SECOND DOUBLE OF THE GAME. PLAYED >> Bill: PLAY THAT ONE WELL, SLICED FAT INSIDE THE BASELINE. GOOD HITTING BY TAVERAS THAT ONE WAS INSIDE, LEFT OUT OVER THE PLATE. MISSED HIS SPONSOR. IT LOOKS LIKE TAVERAS WAS THINKING OPPOSITE FIELD THE WHOLE WAY. NOW, DOES THAT FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PLATE. GIVES THE RANGERS TO LEAD AT 4 4-3. DOWN TO SHIELDS, 0-2 FOR THE WALK. LAYS DOWN THE BUMP, AND THE RUNNER LOCKS IN BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD. THEY GOT THE OUT AT FIRST BASE. >> Bill: IF HE THROWS TO SECOND BASE, THEY MIGHT HAVE HIM IN A PICKLE. NOT A VERY GOOD FUND. TRY TO GET THE GUY OVER TO THIRD BASE, BUT NOT ABLE TO. >> Jeff: NOW, IT IS BROCK HOLT, 0-2. HENRY, NOT IN TIME. >> Bill: SO MUCH FOR THAT. >> Jeff: EXACTLY RIGHT. HUGE JUMP ON ETHAN SMALL. >> Bill: FORGOT ABOUT HIM, NOBODY HOLD HIM ON. LOOK HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THE UMPIRE TO CALL IT. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO RING HIM UP! >> Jeff: TAVERAS SHAKEN UP A LITTLE BIT, DOWN THE THIRD BASE LINE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THEY WERE WAITING FOR THERE. >> Bill: NORMALLY, WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT MUCH TIME, THEY ARE WAITING TO SEE IF THE BALL IS STILL IN THE GLOVE. SAW THE BALL WAS NOT DROPPED, BUT STILL CALLED HIM SAFE. >> Jeff: THERE IS THAT PLAYER. >> Bill: NOT MUCH ACTIVITY DOMINANT ONE TODAY. >> Jeff: THE ROCKING CHAIR, THIRD BASE. HOLT TAKES A STRIKE. >> Bill: YOU KNOW THE ROTATION. SECOND BASE, THIRD BASE. FOR THE UMPIRES. SPEW AND BUILD UP YOUR ACTIVITY LEVEL AS THE DAYS PROGRESS. >> Bill: WORKED AT FIRST BASE, THEN YOU HAVE THE PLAY. GUYS LOVE THAT, HAVING TO PLAY. >> Jeff: IT'S DISH DAY. >> Bill: STRIP AT ALL, AND IT'S YOUR GAME. >> Bill: STRAP IT'S ALL, AND IT'S YOUR GAME. >> Jeff: 2-2 ON BROCK HOLT. SELLOUT CROWD TODAY AT AMERICAN FAMILY FIELDS. 2,275. UP THE THIRD BASE LINE. IS IT GOING TO STAY THERE? IT WILL NOT. GET THE ASSIST. MATT RAMIREZ AND THAT CREW WHATSIT ROLL FOUL. >> Bill: [LAUGHS] GOOD JOB TO LET THAT ONE GO. THE ONLY CHANCE IS LETTING IT FOLLOW. OUR LITTLE CUE SHOT OFF THE END OF THE BAT. NO IT'S GOING TO BE A FOLLOWER. >> Jeff: HEADS-UP PLAY BY ZACH GREENE, WHO WAS FIRST BASE LAST INNING. 2-2 AGAIN. CHECK SWING. NO APPEAL. THREE BALLS, TWO STRIKES. ANOTHER GOOD STOP BY PEYTON HENRY. THE BREWERS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE WITH THEIR CATCHING DEPARTMENT, DEFENSIVELY. >> Bill: GOOD BLOCK. ANOTHER GOOD BLOCK. >> Jeff: 3-2. INSIDE. BROCK HOLT DRAWS A WALK. RUNNERS ON THE CORNERS. CURTIS TERRY, WHO'S HAD A GOOD DAY AT THE PLATE, 2 FOR 3. CHRIS HOOK IS GOING TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT TO THE MOUND AND CHAT WITH ETHAN SMALL. LAST TIME, SMALL RAN INTO SOME COMMAND ISSUES AGAINST CLEVELAND, WALKED A COUPLE OF BATTERS. GROWERS GET THEIR BULLPEN GOING BREWERS GET THEIR PEOPLE AND GOING, THE BREWERS. CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS INNING. 18 PITCHES FOR ETHAN. THE BREWERS, BEFORE YESTERDAY'S GAME, MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THEY HAD OPTIONED A COUPLE PLAYERS TO MINOR LEAGUES AND REASSIGNED A HANDFUL OF OTHERS.  TO MINOR LEAGUE CAMP. ALL THAT MEANS IS THEY HAVE TO VACATE THE MAJOR LEAGUE CLUBHOUSE, BASICALLY, BUT THEY CAN STILL PLAY IN THESE BIG LEAGUE GAMES. YOU WILL SEE A TON OF THEM STILL IN THESE BIG LEAGUE GAMES. >> Bill: THEY NEED THEM. GUYS THAT ARE GONNA PLAY TOO MANY FULL GAMES. >> Jeff: HUNTER STRIKES, STOCKS, SWING AND A MISS BY TERRY. MINOR LEAGUE CAMP NOT OPENING UNTIL THE BREWERS LEAVE TO GO TO TEXAS FOR THESE EXHIBITION GAMES IN THE REGULAR SEASON. GUYS THAT WERE REASSIGNED TO MINOR LEAGUE CAMP BASICALLY JUST HAVE THE CLUBHOUSE TO THEM THEMSELVES. >> Bill: INTERESTING ARTICLE IN THE ATHLETIC ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES AND SOME OF THE MINOR ATHLETIC LEAGUES, MAKING THE BASES BIGGER, RESTRICTING THE SHIFTING, THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S INTERESTING. >> Jeff: NOT UNIFORM CHANGES, EITHER. IT'S NOT EVERY MINOR LEAGUE THAT'S DOING THOSE CHANGES, EITHER. BASES GOING FROM 15 INCHES TO 1. A CHANGE UPON SMALL. THE TO THAT'S A TRIPLE-A, AND ALL THE DOUBLE-A MOVES WILL BE ON THE DASH ALL OF YOUR INFIELDERS CAN COPY ON THE GRASS ANYMORE. IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS SEASON, HE WILL HAVE TO HAVE TWO INFIELDERS ON BOTH SIDES OF SECOND BASE. YOU CAN'T EXTEND YOUR SHIFT EVEN FURTHER. >> Bill: WHAT DO YOU GOT ON THAT? >> Jeff: I DON'T MIND THE SHIFT BRO, IT'S JUST, WHY DON'T YOU DO IT IN ALL THE LEAGUES? >> Bill: BUT THE BIGGER BASES? CONTACT FOR FIRST BASEMAN, I DON'T KNOW. >> Jeff: I'M SURE. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO GET MORE ACTIVITY, FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO BEAT OUT MORE INFIELD HITS, STEAL HOLT IS GOING TO TAKE SECOND, AS TERRY STRIKES OUT. SECOND AND THIRD, TWO OUTS FOR ELI WHITE. THIS IS THE CHANGE UP ETHAN SMALL. >> Bill: HE WAS ON ONE KNEE, SO JUST DECIDED TO HOLD ONTO IT. >> Jeff: CRAIG COUNSELL IS GOING TO TAKE THE BALL FROM ETHAN SMALL. 23 PITCHES ON HIS LEDGER TODAY. WE WILL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT.  JUST 7TH INNING. WE ARE ONLY PLAYING SEVEN INNINGS. A NEW PITCHER TAKING OVER FOR ETHAN SMALL. >> Bill: YOU SEE THE NUMBERS FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO, GOOD NUMBERS. 21 GAMES. 35 PUNCH OUTS, 9 WALKS. BIG DUDE, BIG RIGHT-HANDER. >> Jeff: 6'6\", 220. HOLT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MOUNT OF OLIVES IN NORTH CAROLINA. OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MOUNT OF OLIVES IN NORTH CAROLINA.  1 BALL, NO STRIKES. TALKING ABOUT THE RULE CHANGES THAT WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE MINOR LEAKS THIS YEAR. THEY ARE GOING TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IN BETWEEN THE PITCHES. THEY HAVE THE PITCH CLOCK ON FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, GOES FROM 20 SECONDS TO 15. THE OTHER ONE, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING IS THEY ARE LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF THROWS THAT A PITCHER CAN MAKE TO FIRST BASE. PICKOFF THROWS TO FIRST BASE, TO COPE HER AT THE PET. RUNNER AT FIRST BASE PICKOFF THROWS TO FIRST BASE, TWO AT-BATS. >> Bill: SENT THAT ONE TO FIRST. >> Jeff: GET OUT OF HERE! >> Bill: WHAT DO YOU GOT ON THAT? [LAUGHTER] >> Jeff: WHY DID THEY SEND THEM BACK TO FIRST? HE STOLE THE BAG. >> Bill: I MISSED. >> Jeff: IF IT WAS AN INTERFERENCE THING, TERRY WOULD'VE STRUCK OUT, AND THEY WOULD'VE BROUGHT DASHED BACK. >> Bill: I DON'T KNOW. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CHANGES TO THE MINOR LEAGUES, I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. >> Jeff: YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO BROCK HOLT. >> Bill: HE WAS IN SECOND FOR A WHILE THERE, WASN'T HE? >> Jeff: HERE IS THE STRIKE OFF.

KAREN: KIM, AS YOU TAKE THE OATH\nOF OFFICE TO BECOME JUST THE 55TH MAYOR OF BOSTON, YOU WILL\nBE THRUST INTO A LOCAL SPOTLIGHT AND A NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT AS\nWELL. WHAT DOES THIS HISTORIC MOMENT\nFEEL LIKE FOR YOU? KIM: IT\u2019S SURREAL. IT\u2019S A WONDERFUL DAY IN OUR\nCITY, IN OUR COUNTRY.

IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING\nAND REALLY POWERFUL TO HAVE THE COUNCIL PRESIDENCY ROOTED IN\nROXBURY, BECAUSE ROXBURY HAS BEEN, I THINK, IN MANY WAYS A\nNEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS CERTAINLY A PROUD HISTORY AND DEEP, DEEP\nCONNECTIONS TO THE CITY OVERALL, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME\nCHALLENGES IN TERMS OF WHO HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE PROSPERITY\nOF THE CITY OF BOSTON.

KAREN: THE CITY COUNCIL IS MORE\nDIVERSE THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH WOMEN, PEOPLE OF COLOR -- WHAT\nDOES THE DIVERSE MAKEUP OF THE CITY COUNCIL SAY ABOUT A\nCHANGING BOSTON? KIM: IT HAS BEEN THRILLING TO\nSEE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN PARTICULAR, WOMEN OF COLOR THAT\nHAVE RUN FOR OFFICE AND WON THEIR SEATS. I AM THINKING OF AYANNA\nPRESSLEY, RACHAEL ROLLINS, AND IT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT OUR CITY\nHAS COME ALONG WAY AND OUR CITY IS READY FOR LEADERSHIP THAT HAS\nUNIQUE PERSPECTIVES. MY LIVED EXPERIENCE WAS VERY\nDIFFERENT FROM THE 54 MAYORS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE ME, FOR\nSURE, AND I BRING THAT UNIQUE LENS AS A WOMAN, AS A WOMAN OF\nCOLOR, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS GROWN UP IN POVERTY IN OUR CITY. MY MOM WAS ON WELFARE AND FOOD\nSTAMPS WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP. MY FIRST APARTMENT AS A YOUNG\nSINGLE MOM MYSELF WAS A SECTION EIGHT APARTMENT. TO NOW BE IN A POSITION TO BRING\nTHAT LENS TO THE CITY, AS WE THINK ABOUT POLICY AND ALL THE\nWAYS THAT WE NEED TO SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF BOSTON,\nI THINK IT\u2019S PRETTY POWERFUL. KAREN: SINCE MAYOR WALSH\u2019S\nNOMINATION, MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED INTO THE RACE FOR\nCITY HALL. AND 3 WOMEN THAT YOU SERVE WITH\nON CITY COUNCIL HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED. I HAVE TO ASK, WILL YOU BECOME\nONE OF THE CANDIDATES VYING FOR A PERMANENT ROLE AS MAYOR? KIM: I HAVE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED\nON THE TRANSITION, LASERLIKE FOCUSED ON THE TRANSITION. I WILL GIVE THIS SOME SERIOUS\nTHOUGHT AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RUNNING, BUT MY\nIMMEDIATE FOCUS IS TO RUN THE CITY. I WILL MAKE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS\nABOUT FUTURE PLANS IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND WILL CERTAINLY LET\nYOU KNOW WHAT I AM THINKING, KAREN. KAREN: ALL RIGHT. SO AS MAYOR, LET\u2019S TALK\nABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO IN\nOFFICE. AS MAYOR, HOW DO YOU PLAN TO\nCONTINUE SERVE BOSTON CITIZENS AS WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE PUBLIC\nHEALTH ISSUE #1, THE CORONAVIRUS? KIM: YEAH, I THINK THAT IS THE\nIMMEDIATE FOCUS. I THINK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF\nRECOVERY, REOPENING AND RENEWAL. WITH RECOVERY, WE HAVE TO\nCONTINUE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE LISTENING TO THE SCIENCE,\nLISTENING TO THE DATA THAT WE ARE ROLLING OUT THE VACCINE IN A\nWAY THAT IS EQUITABLE. WE KNOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR,\nPARTICULARLY POOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN HARD-HIT AND\nDISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN TERMS OF THE CASES AND DEATHS WE\nHAVE SEEN IN OUR CITY, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF\nSENIORS, PEOPLE WITH HEALTH CONCERNS, AND WE KNOW A LOT OF\nTHESE DISPARITIES LIVE IN POOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, SO WE HAVE\nTO GET THE VACCINE INTO PEOPLE\u2019S ARMS, MAKE SURE THERE IS\nEQUITABLE ACCESS AND CONFIDENCE IN THE VACCINE, SO THAT IS\nINCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF ANYTHING WE ARE ABLE TO DO IN\nTHE CITY. KAREN: AND WE HAVE SOME DATA\nHERE. ACCORDING TO THE MASSACHUSETTS\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, IN SUFFOLK COUNTY ALMOST 600,000\nPEOPLE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. STATEWIDE, ALMOST 1 MILLION. BUT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN\nUNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES STILL REMAINS UNEQUAL AND BEHIND\nTHE REST OF THE STATES. HOW CAN WE GET MORE PEOPLE\nVACCINATED? KIM: ONE ISSUE IS SUPPLY. AS WE MAKE MORE AND MORE\nINDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS ELIGIBLE FOR THE VACCINE, WE NEED TO MAKE\nSURE THAT THE SUPPLY MEETS THAT DEMAND. THAT\u2019S COMING FROM OUR FEDERAL\nGOVERNMENT, THROUGH OUR STATE GOVERNMENT AND INTIMACY\n -- AND INTO MUNICIPALITIES. WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO\nMAKE SURE WE ARE LIFTING UP ACCESS AT THE CITY FRONT, DOING\nALL WE CAN. A FEW WEEKS AGO I HAD THE\nOPPORTUNITY TO VISIT A MOBILE VACCINATION CLINIC, AND IT\u2019S\nIMPORTANT TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THESE MASS\nVACCINATION SITES SET UP, THERE IS ONE AT REGGIE LEWIS, FENWAY\nPARK WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO THE HYNES CONVENTION CENTER, AND\nTHOSE ARE GREAT AND CAN SERVE LOTS OF PEOPLE, BUT WE ALSO HAVE\nTO GO WHERE PEOPLE ARE AND WHERE THERE ARE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS. I AM DEFINITELY THINKING BAHA\nHOUSING, I HAD A WONDERFUL CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE\nSENIORS THERE WHO HAD SOME QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE\nVACCINE. AFTER SPEAKING WITH HER AND\nMAKING SURE SHE CONNECTED WITH THE DOCTORS ON SITE TO GET HER\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED, SHE THEN WENT AND GOT THE VACCINE, SO IT\nWAS INCREDIBLE TO SEE THAT PEOPLE WHO EVEN HAD QUESTIONS\nAND CONCERNS WERE WILLING TO GET THE VACCINE. SO IMPORTANT, PARTICULARLY FOR\nOUR SENIORS. WE HAVE TO GO INTO MORE SENIOR\nHOUSING, MAKE SURE WE ARE GOING TO COMMUNITY CENTERS. LIFTING UP PLACES WHERE PEOPLE\nHAVE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS, LIKE THE FAITH-BASED COMMUNITY AND\nMAKING SURE THE VACCINE IS AVAILABLE THERE, AND MAKING SURE\nWE CONTINUE TO PROMOTE WAYS PEOPLE CAN GET THE VACCINE IF\nTHEY HAVE QUESTIONS, MAKING SURE THOSE ARE ANSWERED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THERE IS\nGOOD INFORMATION SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND MAKE\nTHE RIGHT CHOICES FOR THEM. WHEN WE RETURN, MY CONVERSATION\nCONTINUES WITH BOSTON COUN", "Mqz97iX9E2I": "play-by-play. Jarom Jordan alongside Tyler haws. Our next guest knows how to beat the Bruins. Led that game not only for BYU game high 20 in that one in maui. BYU took down UCLA. Match up in T NCAA tournament. Jake Toolson deseret first credit union hotline. Welcome back to BYU sports nation. Great to see you. >>Guest: Thanks for having me. Feels giftofalohad to be here giftofaloha feel good to be with you guys today. >>Jarom: A lot has happened. Not open in the world, not only with BYU and you and UCLA, but here we are. BYU and UCLA again tomorrow night. >>Guest: Yeah. March Madness. That time. Year. I'm excited to see what happens. >>Jarom: What did you think of UCLA last night? >>Guest: I thought they played really hard. Obviously, got down to that big lead in the first half. But I knew they were going to make it a game inhe second half. It was a high scoring game. They could score. Guys who just played hard and I think BYU matches up well against this team and having played them last year. We're familiar with them. But you know, it is March. Not a bad team in this tournament. Going to have to be playing our best and I think that is something we'll do. >>Tyler: Jake, you guys obviously had unbelievable run last year. Got cut short. Due to covid. What is the success of this year's team mean to you and what you guys accomplished last year? >>Guest: It's been so fun to just watch this team grow throughout the course of the season. I think they are completely different team than we were last year. But for me, just to be a fan, you need to be proud of this program, something that I cherish and something that different than being out there playingment different feeling for me. Something that I am -- it's new to me. So this team has made me proud, all season. And I'm excited that they have this opportunity in the tournament. And you know, I think they feel -- I within the say pressure but think they feel urgency and they know what they're playing for and who they're playing for. I think they're going to have that chip on their shoulder. >>Jarom: Whether they like it or not, I feel like, and mark pope agreed to this, even brought you guys on via zoom I think Sunday, right? For selection Sunday, to have you guys part of that. >>Guest: Yes. >>Jarom: Whether they like it or not, kind of playing for last year's team too. Ka thargt I can for you. Mccarthy art I can for you. Are you living through experience they for last year's team? I think so. Yeah. Cathartic for you? >>Guest: Being so close to those guys knowing them. Coach propose has done a great job, -- coach pope has done great job, making us feel like we're a part of it. Laid the foundation, we did what we did last year. And a lot of people would look at that and say, we set the bar pretty high. People were saying before this, that would be a hard bar to reach. But I think that that kind of set the stage for this year's team to be able to do what they did. And it does -- doesn't stop. I'm happy for those guys. Seeing March Madness, CBS, selection Sunday, hearing you guys' voice, man, were he right there but I know this team will come through for everyone that feels some type of way about last yeara. Year. >>Jarom: Talking to Jake Toolson on BYU sports nation is it hard to see this? Are you over it? For me, it's hard. Last year knowing you guys could have made a run supermemorable like anything was possible, BYU is playing like a top 10 team end of the year. Difficult for you to watch this or have you, is that crystalized into something positive? >>Guest: I think little bit of both. When I'm watching BYU, I have nothing but like good feelings and I love seeing this team win and I want them to, you know, make a run. But when I'm watching othergames or team, man, who knows if we in this spot a year from the tournament last year. Everything could have changed for everyone on that team. But that's not a place that I want to live in. It's a fun place to visit, what I'm talking with teammates or friends, but I think we did everything we could to put ourselves in the position to make a run. I think that I can live with that. >>Tyler: So Jake, let's visit it. So this team better than your team? How do you guys match up if you're comparing both groups? >>Guest: You know, that's a good question. And it's a good debate to have. Great argument to have because two really good teams. Teams are different. So you know, I don't know if I want to get into that right now. Because it's just all about this year's team. But if I was choosing -- whoops. Camera fell. >>Jarom: What a graphic. Perfectly timed camera fall. >>Guest: There we go. If I was choosing, you know, I'm going going to have to bet on last year's team. Good thing that that will never happen. And we can just enjoy this team right now. >>Jarom: Maybe it will happen. Maybe we line it up. Maybe a pickup game. >>Guest: Maybe this summer we can run it back. >>Jarom: I do have last year's team by a little bit. Here's why. You guys beat Gonzaga. And that ends up being top five win. Top 10 in net. Those things are the arguments I've been making for this group. I feel like Gonzaga not better this year. They went up a notch. I didn't know they could go up another notch. Maybe there's another notch for them. How would you compare Gonzaga last year to this year? This year felt like Terrell Suggs took them up a little bit. Jalen Suggs took them you a little bit. >>Guest: He completely changed them. I could argue Gonzaga was better last year. They lost Gilbert, grad transfer, one year guy. Lost Killian player of the year. Things are different this year's team from last years' year's team. At the start Watson, play drew. Last year,f a team wanted to just keep a big guy like matthaarms paint. They could. Wasn't shooting T they could put kili at the line, completely different game. You could argue here, there, I think both teams are really good. We obviously beat Gonzaga. Which was in my opinion, the best win in the last few years. But I think BYU, they match up well against any team. And I think the difference is people want to say like this year's team is called like the 10 deep team. Last year's team was like, senior three headed dragon team. But I don't think BYU this year is even playing 10 guys chts I would say the difference is they had two 7-footers. Reserve they have Matt haarms in the paint. And they have size and reboundand play different way. Down the stretch in the season, they play their five starters, trev, Spencer, and Richard. That's 8 guy. Th 10 guys. >>Tyler: For sure. Really interesting contrasting both groups. But obviously, both accomplished so much. Jake, 2020 was such a crazy year for everybody. But especially for you. And for all pro guys trying to figure out what's next. Can you talk about your journey in the pros and just the emotional roller coaster up and down of trying to figure out what's next. >>Guest: Yeah. I mean, you said it best. For everybody. Pretty much across the board. It's been a challenge. And I think I've learned a lot about myself. I've had opportunities to reflect and to see the progress that I've made and kind wanting to. Sometimes you got to take a step back and try and live inthe moment. Make the best of every day. I think that with my injury, and the way it all went down, it's a little bit bummer and I definitely catch myself sometimes feeling sorry for myself. Why did it have to happen like this. I had to wait a whole year to play and then the first game you know, this happens. But I think that you could always have it worse and I'm grateful for challenges because it allows me O grow and that's of what I've made a career on. And at some point, you just want it to stop and be able to have to set all the time I don't think that's how it's going to work. Always trying to challenge you, test you, mold you into a better player as a person and that's what I'm going through right now. >>Jarom: G league double, Orlando, eerie bay hawkses. What were the emotions like that seeing yoeli on the other side, professional debut, 2, was it an injury that happened in the game and remind us what it was. Foot, right? >>Guest: Yeah. Well, it was just really cool to experience that. Down there in the bubble together. It's far from normal down there. Everything is just -- nothing feels normal. Like it's just so strained and different and uncomfortable for everyone. So having yoeli there and be being able to go through that with him was something that I'll remember forever and just sharing that moment on the court. Our first professional game. Always remember that. In the game, second half, went up for a rebound. I landed on a guy's foot and fractured my foot. That's what happened. >>Jarom: We wish you the best in your recovery. And what helps in recovery is great teammates around you. BYU this year has continued best locker room in America thing. Jesse wade stuck in the elevator. They bre him out. Covid testing video went viral. What can you say about mark pope in the locker room, you know this from four-year, UNLV university valley and see this continue this year. Utah valley. >>Guest: Amazing what the staff was able to do. Recruit the right guys cultivate that joy and love for the game in the locker room. Guys just run with it. Got all the right leaders in place. And it's just cool to see. There's a lot of other teams out there that coachessen that coaches thatcan recruit, motivate, do all of that, but I think to me, college is all about having guys buy in, know their roles, and just the more of just managing that locker room. That's what they do. I have to, Aguayo to call out to coach right now, we all saw the viral video of everyone dancing going to get their covid test. And I was waiting for coach to pop up and do something. Maybe like the Aaron J roars Rogers discount double check thing. He didn't do anything. Everybody he's not going to be on video because he's too shy for that. I'll give him a hard time. >>Tyler: Come on Colby. >>Guest: Yeah. >>Jarom: He's fun in his own way. Best of luck.

that's why it's so important for SD AR to take you stand to be united to make sure that we have policies at the state level and at the local level if you are not engaged somebody else is going to be engaged and impact your industry more than you can think possible but the reality is you're speaking on behalf of the 70 million homeowners in the country and they don't have an association that has

Marshall Law School I took log preview on demand last summer going into my first year and I have to say it really blew all my Barbara definitely helps me get prepared from law school I wouldn't have done as well as I did first semester and I've not done far Brie it just gives you such an insight into what law school is like with real professors from really great schools and it just gives you a leg up compared to all of your classmates because no one really knows what law school is about it gave me the semester and I pretty much a lot of preview really gave me the tools and the resources that I needed to succeed they give you great study tools study tips on the introduce you to the material which definitely gives you an edge on all your other classmates in the long wait class really really really helps you get in tune into what is really taste what is property but is Krim law what are all of the doctrinal classes that you need to know and you will not regret doing it I was able to practice case briefing readings for my doctrinal classes and taking notes from amazing professors from all around the country you go into left school and you feel a lot more comfortable and it definitely flattens the steep learning curve that is law school I finished in the top eight percent of my class and I obtained a 3.8 GPA and I really have to say that that's because of the resources and the tools that law gave me they really helped you succeed and I would highly recommend this course to anyone going into their first year it's definitely invaluable and it gives you a great edge on your classmates [Music]", "FAqf0sDkcz0": "tonight come with us to Rikers Island the biggest jail complex in America a place haunted by its violent history eight thousand inmates living in a kind of suspension a shadow world if you could survive right darling you can survive anything there was only one Road in across a bridge inmates have nicknamed this the bridge of pain on one side of the car we can see the New York skyline celebrating possibility and hope and straight ahead a world apart we've been granted unprecedented access hi I'm sorry baby see our cameras will have seven days inside 70 hours once we enter the first lesson of Rikers be ready for the unexpected during our time there are nine different alarms lockdown indicate something pretty big doesn't it on the other side of this maze of doors the question we came here to answer is it really possible to change this notorious explosive place we start with the treatment of the most violent inmates a door opens listen the sound of solitary confinement across Rikers while we're there 165 people locked up to 23 hours a day in concrete cells we were given a restriction no interviews through the cell doors create heightened turbulence this is the punishment for inmates who attack officers or each other fighting slashing with hidden weapons as we said their entire world is concrete walls a toilet a sink no TV caught off from most human interaction it's not even possible to see through the opening on this door and the one hour spent outside for recreation locked separately into an outdoor cage in decades past Rikers used unlimited isolation as punishment two officers are the only regular human contact for up to 50 men any sounds I hear do it cell doors open to anything you just want to make sure that you're gonna be okay and as the officers serve lunch through a cell opening a milk carton the carton becomes a projectile a giant spray of urine and feces come back move I was supposed to feed a guy that's throwing stuff out of yourself at me I'm supposed to feed him you know but got to still remain professional and do a job at Rikers it's called splashing and officer Graham tells me every space around the cell door puts him at risk for the weaponized body fluids beep I felt half way wedged into the door we won't pass smash he says he knows people across America have seen those videos from Rikers in the past officers using brute force but he has a challenge everybody has an opinion you know about what goes on and stuff in here but nine times out of ten anybody has anything to say about a correction officer you never even been in a facility but again a fundamental question do long stretches in solitary make inmates less dangerous or more I have a lot of yesus thoughts like a fireman Rafael Figueroa says in the past he was locked a year and a half straight in solitary which prisoners call the box he says he's now a time bomb how many fights Oh buddy is I can't even count over I would say maybe 3040 I've been beating down almost killed exactly in this Jail I've been more in prison than your streets when like recent moments the streets I feel like I was in jail you know I'm I'm so you know institutionalized brainwash Chloe what you want to call it he says he's changed forever in here I feel confidence on myself because I'm safe for myself I'm saving others I can't function in society the vast majority of inmates are here in a kind of purgatory convicted of nothing yet awaiting trials and 57% of these inmates were charged for nonviolent crimes first time incarcerated yeah first the last time I get to experience at all on this Aaron Perry sent to Rikers for stealing computers and phones ended up in the hell of solitary because of an angry outburst he talks about the despair in this place I see a lot of frustration that's I see frustration Commissioner Joseph Potts says there is simply no evidence this kind of treatment reduces violence and says remember 80% of the inmates at Rikers will eventually be back out in your town he says he wants the officers to start striving for something better we can change people's lives and if you don't believe that then then you got to say that these are throwaway people right so they're always they're violent when they came in they're gonna be violent when they go out and they're gonna be the next criminal that does 50 years the next assault because these guys again now they're gonna be your neighbor so pot has already reduced the number of inmates in solitary by 70% and put time limits on the stay instead he's created a unit where even highly dangerous inmates are out of their cells for seven hours a day and programs a treatment with extra security around he's also moved the seriously mentally ill into special units with intensive therapy but his most controversial and even radical idea may be this one to be the first jail in the country to get rid of solitary altogether for the younger inmates 18 to 21 years old a small percentage of the population the most difficult to control isn't it brother of the violence give you pause getting rid it's not easy he's a difficult dangerous people that we're dealing with so I'm not saying this is an easy task for us but it's a much better hopeful outcome than what we were doing you've never been shaken in that belief I haven't we are walking in the part of solitary housing the younger inmates the sound here wild and deafening Pat says study after study shows the adolescent brain is still forming until the age of 25 isolation could change the wiring 21 year old Richard Delgado chained to the wall Ricardo Delgado are you dangerous no I can go a lot when I first got locked up I was depressed on my damned I felt like killing myself then and even next to me heard a like yo you buggin like how do you and I'm 20 you're gonna go home like don't kill yourself you buggin you got to be strong Delgado is in Rikers for murder in solitary for an alleged attack on another inmate a lot of officers ask what happens to them when solitary is over they can't threaten the use of the box I didn't sign up to be a punching bag I didn't sign up to be a crash-test dummy you go back to that housing area that that it made assaulted you in and you're looking at him I - I and he's looking at you going I'll do it again the officers call it punitive segregation punitive segregation should not be dismantled for the 18 to 21 year olds not at all we told the Commissioner what some officers are saying we're not here to be babysitters the officers roles changed its really faith by asking people to kind of look and faith that can we change people's lives who ever thought getting rid of solitary confinement was a good idea you need to pack your stuff up and you need to go and consider what happened to officer ray Calderon who has gone public his face slashed by to 19 year olds last November got 22 stitches okay this could have easily been a funeral arrangement today and I think what happened to Officer Calvin was tragic oh I don't want to in any way diminish what happened but in one sense what happened to Calderon makes the case against solitaire the 19 year olds who slashed him had been in the box it didn't stop them from attacking when they got out if we believe we can change them and we stopped you being harmed or me being harmed our family being harmed by the fact that we did some good with these individuals we won't save them all but out to guarantee you what we were doing was saving nobody and you come back what about the history of officers using brute force Seb a boy book and we meet the inmate who operates as a kind of rock star here at Rikers his life about to change in ways he did not expect Wow unprecedented access to Rikers Island I know I'm struck by one of your opening lines haunted by a violent history did you see anything to indicate that's changing can change I want you to see some of these officers coming up who really believe in this mission statement and some of the programs are already in place and you'll be able to see how they're working if they're working and I really think you're gonna meet some people you won't easily forget more dinosaur is powerful reporting from Rikers Island when we come back"}
