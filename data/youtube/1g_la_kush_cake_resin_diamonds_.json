{"jEMcaUwVskk": "what the [ __ ] is up y'all it's your boy never not medicated you can call me mr clean if y'all are watching this on instagram sub to the youtube if y'all are watching this on youtube follow the instagram now today we have la cushcake live resin stizzy review it is an indica and i'm excited because i have only tried i believe two live resins from stizzy i've tried ice cream cake hybrid and og kush live resin indica so i'm excited to add on to that so we got the la cushcake super hype coming in at 78.96 thc and you know the box is so beautiful it's just nice black and purple just looks beautiful so let's pop it open i've already opened it i've scanned it of course because i don't get my stuff from stizzy and i'm just a weirdo like i've never had one fake pod from this place that i go but i still scan every single one just because i'm weird anyway so look how [ __ ] dark this is right off the bat i know this doesn't help for [ __ ] but so we're gonna take it out right and it's so dark look at this i have a passion fruit live resin on deck and this is way darker than the passion fruit the passion fruit is pretty light so we got the la kush cake right we're gonna take off this cap so beautiful look at that it's just the darkest live resin i've probably had um so we got the black battery today we put on the la kush cake and can i just say i've been sniffing this a bit it smells like bud 100 the passion fruit smells a bit fruitier and like um not i don't get a lot of bud out of the passion fruit but with this i definitely smell the bud i haven't hit either of them so let's just get a thumbnail this is the la cushcake y'all all right i like cushcake let's get it first rip cheers well right off the bat i didn't even know if i was ripping it it was so smooth the inhale was so smooth right there that when i was inhaling it i literally could not tell if i was inhaling anything so that's how you know this [ __ ] is clean as [ __ ] first of all second of all i will give it i will give it what am i talking about i will say that this definitely tastes like the other live resins i i don't think there's that much of a difference with the la cushcake taste and maybe the og kush taste i'd say the la kush cake may be a bit less um earthy and and more more sweeter but just by a bit you know it's not it's not a lot but it's still very buddy buddy still very herby and like here let's get another it tastes really good like just amazing bud like the most quality top shelf bud you could buy it's producing fat clouds and it it tastes really good like i said i said that multiple times it tastes like some quality ass bud i don't really get the the cake part obviously that's just the strain but the la kush i definitely taste the the kush um type of like a type of leica like a og type of taste kind of um a bit sweeter though and it it it is it's a very good taste we're going to get the high in a little bit because as you all know live resins kind of they settle in a little slower than distillates or cannabis derived terpenes um but yeah so far really liking this la kush cake just based off the taste of it and how smooth it is on the throat and the inhale so let's get another if y'all are new here make sure to [ __ ] like and subscribe and if you're wondering why i take the pot off and suck it every single time if you were to put the cap on right after you ripped it there would be smoke coming out of these air holes i want that smoke so i say [ __ ] it i'm gonna inhale after i rip it to get that excess smoke basically that's why i do it i'm a [ __ ] i'm a little cheapo you know i uh i just i just want as much smoke as i possibly can so that's what i do you don't have to do that of course um right now i'm not really feeling the high too much it's definitely gonna settle in like i'm i'm definitely feeling a bit of a head change but it's not too uh severe yet so i'm kind of just waiting for that we have our fur oh it's so dark you can't even see our first bubble coming out very hard to see you can't really see at all but it is a bubble any whom let's get another i'm really just trying to get [ __ ] off this and and tell y'all how it is not a very good ghost but i am starting to feel the head the head change a bit more and more i'm definitely feeling like an eye high it just takes a bit longer with the live resin i'm not quite sure what it is with the difference between live resin and distillate where uh it takes a different amount of time by the way i have this water bottle here because i thought i'd be [ __ ] coughing like a a bunch because of the live resin but i'm not but i am gonna drink it not because it's [ __ ] my throat is sore because i'm i'm thirsty okay y'all ever just over fill your mouth and then you're like can't even swallow it because you have no room to swallow any whom so yeah i'm definitely feeling that the eye high a little bit of a a head high too kind of like it's more just definitely my body for sure but it's it's i focus on the eyes if i'm if i'm being honest like it's it's my body for sure i feel a bit like loose and wobbly but i do think that it it really does hit the eyes like in the back back here um pretty harsh so not harsh like oh god i can't but like harsh like hard um so yeah i'm really enjoying this la kush cake it tastes very clean very just pure weed just straight up a little bit of sweetener but some fire ass weed and it it takes a bit to sink in but it definitely sinks in in the eyes and and the body and it it's it's nice it's definitely a cop uh i the problem is i can't like i haven't had um og cushion a minute the live resin so i can't compare it to another live resin really because i don't remember however i will say that i will be able to compare the passion fruit and the la cushcake indica live resins together because that'll be either my next review or my next next review because i have the incredible hulk as well so who knows i don't know because i don't i don't plan that far ahead you know um but yeah la cushcake i definitely recommend if y'all are looking for uh new indicas in the live resin and you weren't sure if la kush cake was good because i i did um i heard like things about skittles you know where it's like uh i i didn't like the taste of the skittles i was like what are you talking about bro that [ __ ] was good um so it you know there's things that that rumors start up and then people just [ __ ] are done with that pod forever and it's like bro you haven't tried it so i'm here to tell you if there are rumors about the la cushcake being garbage i really like it it tastes good i'm not worried to be like uh with a with a wave or whatever following a trend i i can just be like yo it's good i don't care if there are people saying it's bad i like it it tastes good it hits good eyes body it's nice my battery obviously i gotta inhale harder because either the battery or the pod uh connection isn't too uh sturdy so it was going in and out as you could see but here let's get another and then i think i'm gonna end it yeah much better but yeah this is super clean tastes really good just amazing bud milks the [ __ ] up hit you in the back of the eyes and the body that one was nice and it just [ __ ] it hits you it takes a little bit so you can chief it a few times put in your pocket and don't think that it won't hit you you know don't like go back to it and then be like oh why isn't it hitting like you got to wait a bit it's like edibles but obviously way shorter like edibles you obviously aren't taking like 500 milligrams like why isn't it hitting yet you're like waiting that hour so wait the the five minutes that it takes instead of the however many seconds it takes with distillate and you know just wait it out don't don't smoke the whole pod because you think it's not hitting anyway hope you all enjoyed hope you all are staying educated and medicated hope y'all were chiefing along with me i appreciate y'all and i hope you all like and subscribe check out the youtube like i said more [ __ ] on the way cheers y'all", "7Rle8RUW7Cs": "hey guys trevor here with threaded leaf and today we are a day late getting this one hit a reed review out for you guys but we're still gonna get it out for you guys we've got the la cush cake from panelist labs i have tried this from natural history they blew it out of the park with it so tennis labs i think you guys are uh are gonna have some work cut out for you today but you've put out some really good strains and really interesting stuff so let's get into it and see how tantalus labs l a kush cake does when uh we smoke it and we can have it to compare against the natural history la cushcake that we smoked earlier this month you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys and like i said in the intro we're going to be diving into some l.a kush cake from tanalis labs and it was actually an october review not a november review but it don't matter it was absolutely delicious from natural history we've got that's the melon cookies let's pull out that la kush cakes we've got the thc comparison of the two because i think they both did quite well so on our la cushcake from the tanalis labs it came in with a 23.96 so just shy of that 24 thc total a cbd total of 0.19 and a package date of the 11th of september 2020 so on the natural history one that we reviewed earlier in the year thc total of 23.9 cbd total of zero and a package date of the 24th of august 2020. so i think honestly i think the age everything is right around the same thing so this you guys is going to be a pretty comparable review biggest difference is we've got the new urban scale system that we are running this one against where that natural history went up against a little bit of the lighter urban scale before we toughened it up and made it a little bit more realistic you guys now that we have a little bit more experience a little bit more review knowledge in here we can give them a lot better and a lot more accurate scores but with the price coming in at 46 bucks before gst you guys or provincial sales tax if you guys do have that depending on the province you're in will be what this eighth wraps you up with for cost i have the tantalus labs website pulled up we're gonna quickly rattle off the information that i have on there before we go into our full review you guys so the la cush cake from tana's labs comes with a thc range of 21 to 28 percent a cbd range of zero to one percent the flavors they're going to give off are cream gas and earthy it is a hybrid but it leans more on that indica dominant side and it's a cushion sorry guys it's a cushman's crossed with a wedding crate wedding cake wedding crake so la kush cake is a caked out hybrid strain bread from combining cushman's and wedding cake the tannelous curation oh okay let's try that let's try that one again you guys the tantalus curation of l.a kush cake was selected from a cake leaning phenotype during a larger than average seed hunt it carries a classic og taste of earthy gas and diesel along with subtle sour notes the flower is dense green with hints of purple and true to its name large nugs are caked up with frost so the dominant terpenes are going to be carefully lemony neraldolol and merisneen and it's available in a three and a half gram flour and three half gram pre-rolls you guys so we're gonna leave that website up here so that when the audio listeners get to dive in uh and catch up we'll have it ready for them but for now we're gonna get our urban scale intro in here you guys so we can get into our full review of this strain so first things first we crack the container we take a look and smell of this bud to give us an out of 10 score for the look enrollment after that our boundless cfc vaporizer gets run with three different temperatures 175 205 and 220 we will go into the detail on that when we're diving into the vaporizer yes after that we've got three bong rips to go through and the way we go through those are three different lights same way with our vaporizer we will go through that in more detail when we're on that part of the review after that we light up we're using this crave straight pipe tonight i love smoking out of that that pipe especially for really cushy and gassy tones i don't know why but that pipe definitely seems to be the better balance for it the steam roll in there i don't know what it is i like it and then after that we finish it up smoking with an elements pre-roll or not pre-roll well pre-rolled by me and rotl pre-roll for the review and then once we're about halfway through we give you a score we wrap it up with a score out of 10 for the high everything is out of 10 you guys for a total out of 60. so that is the base of our review we've got a lot of smoking and a lot of scores to get out there for you so why wait any longer let's get into it you guys starting out with looking aroma before we go into our taste from a vape taste from bong pipe joint high and then the overall we got 20 minutes worth of smoking let's get going y'all cheers and i'll see you on the other side of this urban scale intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we're going to go ahead crack this tantalus labs container and see how they did with their la cushcake come on let's get that lift and pale sail out of here no you don't want to go won't use the lift and holy [ __ ] we've got a big nug so right here here let's just do this yeah we'll leave that a little bit of shake and loose stuff in there so we've got this really really big green frosted nug here and it is lighter very very light for aroma in comparison to that la kush cake i'm gonna from natural history i took a whiff of that last night you guys might this from panelist labs honestly the aroma i'm going to say right off the bat is disappointing you guys um when i have that really strong and like extremely cushy aroma coming from the la cushcake that i got from um natural history you guys it kind of it kind of set the bar a little high for the overall look and aroma now the aroma of these buds aren't there the look however is they're relatively fresh they're a little bit on the dryer side for my personal preference but it's not anything to the point where i would be not wanting to smoke it still got a decent hold to it it does give a little bit of a crush under your fingers but the majority like the bigger nugs the smaller nugs will crush under your fingers the bigger nugs will not i won't say bound back but they won't crumble like you can't finger grind it but you could definitely smash the nug in between your fingers that's actually the best way i think i could describe of it right now but all in all for the look and aroma i'm i am gonna give it a seven because there's enough of a light aroma pushing through there and again having tried the strain before having tried the strain before knowing the potential for the flavor and stuff with the light hint of aroma that the strain gives off because i feel that once we have it busted up it could it could definitely have a really strong aroma and that's one of the bigger reasons why i wanted to do that because as soon as i busted it up i'm getting that natural history aroma so thought and a big thing that i've had come across with any tantalus labs eights that i've had is they've always no matter the package date they've always been a little bit on the dryer side you guys so honestly any of the buds that are busted up the in like the inner of the buds are just absolutely dank and full with aroma so i really wanted to give them that opportunity and there's certain strains that i'll do that i'll crack it up and i'll smell it once once it's busted up and i will bump up the score a little bit that aroma there is what's giving it at seven i would give it a six if it didn't have that and i was hopeful and i was positive and we were thinking that way so that's why we gave it a 70 guys because once it's busted you get that raw potential that i was getting hints of when it's in there that really gassy cushy aroma with kind of a sweet tone to follow in i don't know if that's a creamy sweet but it's it's not sugared sweet it's just sweet light sweet with that good kind of gassy cushy mix you guys but i'm gonna quickly roll up this joint we're already almost 10 minutes into this one i've got to catch up our audio listeners before we go ahead and dive into the vaporizer and then we take our bong rips our pipe rips and all the other smoking we get to do in this review you guys so i will be right back after i catch up our audio listeners and i have the uh the joint ready to go for after we smoke up that pipe you guys cheers and i'll see on the other side when we are sparking up well not sparking up but warming up the vaporizer for the review cheers i'll see you over there hey guys welcome back so we have the boundless clc vaporizer set to 175 degrees it is ready to go at this 175 these first couple of rips we are looking for the lemonade and maricine terpenes primarily the lemon and mango flavors that raw citrus acidic type of experience you guys let's go ahead dive in here and see if we can find it while after i'll let you know why we bump up to 205 and 220. very light but very true flavor like it is it's got a little bit different to it than the natural history i'm enjoying it a lot but first before we go into that 205 205 is where we're looking for 205 degrees celsius i should specify that 205 degrees celsius specifically is what we go to next after the 175 that is where we're going to get the rest of the terpenes playing factors you're going to start getting the rich cushy um cakey um chocolaty cheesy all the really other terpenes with the exception of the meristening lemonade and beta-carotene balance out of that 205 and start to play a factor oh this is tasty with 175 cushy it's got that hint of mint and it's got that that kind of battery like pancake batter experience that's that actually at the 175 that's good good rack good call because it's got that kind of sweet sweetness that pancake batter has i find before it's cooked where or an undercooked pancake that's that's even a better an undercooked pancake right in the center where you have that soft that's kind of the doughy that kind of sweet doughy flavor that's what i'm having but as i was saying after 205 where you get that cheesy chocolate cushy the really rich tasting we bump up to 205 200 not 205 220. 220 degrees is where we get the beta caroline primarily and you start to really get the pepper and the woody base flavors you guys but enough talking let's really get into this review this is going to be a long one so 175 really that that minty cushy kind of cakey flavor i was enjoying quite a bit you guys and it definitely has a lot more flavor than i remember coming from natural history now at the 205 let's see how it does light it does kind of push a little bit of that creamy minty side but it's losing some of its punch right now you guys 205 isn't bad it's got a little bit of kind of um uh that herbal that leafy touch to it as well which isn't turning me away it's got kind of that special k taste at the end that corn flakes flavored near the end at the 220 you do get that kind of cushy peppery blend but it's not raw pepper it's it's very enjoyable all in all you guys nice presentation at the 220 it didn't have any really overwhelming or strong flavors or aromas it was just enjoyable that's really the best way i could explain it it's just light kind of hints you with hits you with a little bit of flavor and then moves on hits you with a little bit of flavor and moves on and every step you go you just get a little bit of a different experience with that flavor a little bit more so the first one was really sweet really minty and then once you bumped up to 205 i got a little bit more of the rich creamy blend and then at the 220 i got a little bit more of that woody peppery blend but it still had that overall kind of leafy undertone at the end and that would lean into that leafy special cake combo on my tongue while i'm sitting here letting it sit which personally i enjoy that kind of aftertaste but i wish there was more in the beginning and the 175 it did better than the natural history from what i remember but after that it kind of dropped off so i think a 6 out of a 10 because it's right on that verge of being enjoyable if it had just a little bit more push a little bit more i could give it that seven but right now it's just kind of that plus because there's not enough paul to really get me excited for it you guys but now now that we've gone ahead and butchered that vape review honestly you guys are probably one of the worst um vape review sections that i've done in a long time i stumbled my way through that so i'm gonna make it up to you guys with the rest of the video by uh starting it out by smoking some three rigs with you and the way we're going to do this is by picking off a little bit extra salt that we have left on the top of this rig jesus you don't need salt when you're smoking dope just when you're cleaning the dough that you smoked through your rigs but before we go any further you guys we're going to light up our hemp work we're going to smoke it through our envy straight pipe we do that for our first bowl our second bowl we run straight clipper lighter third bowl we run our mk jet lighter the reason we do all three different forms is purely to experience all the possible presentations that this bud has to put out and we can give you the most accurate and most enjoyable review possible so for the time being we have stumbled my sorry ass through the vaporizer we are now going to go ahead and push some bong rips and get a little confidence back in this review guys this is a long one and i'm stumbling through it but we're gonna smoke it we're gonna have fun with it and you guys seem to be enjoying the ones that are a little bit more ridiculous so let's make this one a little bit more ridiculous cheers and i'll see you on the other side of these three bomb rips [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] taste from bong is gonna end up getting a six out of ten so really it's it's tough because i am comparing it to the natural history la cush cake and it's gonna be a hard strain to beat because through the rigs the flavor that i was getting in the one that i just smoked was overall very comparable just on the lighter side the natural history was just so potent and so extreme with the flavors that i were experiencing when i smoked it that i was experiencing when i was smoking it just kind of ruined a little bit of this la kush cake from town on this lab for me and i'll be honest with you guys on that um the overall flavor that sits and just lingers on your tongue is probably my favorite part of the strain because it is that very cushy flavor with just a hint of mint sitting on that back ring in your tongue that just you get washes of it but not very much and it's i like i really am a fan of that cushy flavor that gassy creamy i don't know why i'm really starting to love that flavor but for some reason i just can't get enough of it now going into the actual smoking with the envy straight pipe the smallest rig and the lowest temperature i got the best flavor which doesn't surprise me typically the hemp wick does give me the best flavor for these cushy and creamy kind of tones anything more citrusy diesely for some reason it likes the lighter but it's i don't know i don't know you guys it could be the bar each bong too but that that envy straight pipe definitely had the best flavor in it is very predominant and similar to what i'm experiencing right now but all in all six out of ten is a taste from a bog is quite a good score but we are gonna go ahead and spark up the bowl of uh the crave straight pipe you guys that you can hear how she does while i'm smoking it and then after that we're gonna go ahead and take our dry hauls through the joint while we welcome our audio listeners back in and then we'll spark that sucker up smoke half of it through catching them on up through all this stuff that you guys have gotten to see and enjoy and then then we'll be able to bring you guys back in after the time lapse get uh the joint scored the high scored and get the overall in and out of here but for tommy and you guys let's go ahead spark up this crave straight pipe and see how it does compared to uh it just this is just turning into that that natural history la cushcake comparison to botanist labs and honestly they're both they're both incredibly enjoyable still it's just natural history for some reason has just a touch better for my personal enjoyment but haven't done the pipe having done the joint things could change you guys let's find out if they do okay guys i'm going to give it a six out of a ten for the taste from a pipe it was just raw gas honestly it it was that was the experience i was getting through it was just a raw gas flavor which personally isn't a bad thing but when you get kind of that leafy minty undertone and at the end where it's almost woody it it's not my kind of a blend i would definitely have preferred that cushy flavor that was there and it just it didn't didn't seem to have it and and i'm quite disappointed with that um however i did like that gassy tone so it's kind of that plus right like like the taste from a bong is a week like it would be such an extremely weak seven because it it wasn't i would pick quite a few strains over it for enjoyment of smoking like the early glue rb1 cross from ogen for the gassy effects i would go for that one or the coal creek kush from retican i really really like that eighth that i smoked um just the the la cushcake from from natural history like there's there's quite a few strains that do the certain flavors for that bong better and that's why it wasn't it was enjoyable but it wasn't enjoyable scoring and the pipe it was there's one enjoyable element and it was strong and powerful but it wasn't the most potent but let's get our dry hauls in here you guys before the video cuts out and uh we go into the second clip and at this point i want to say welcome back to our audio listeners thank you for sticking around and uh we're gonna take a couple dry holes on this element paper here helmet paper roll joint and uh get into that part of the review cheers you guys tiger ice cream like but have it be an 80 30 split of the black licorice like that's it it's weird it's very weird like it is such a predominant licorice style flavor but there's just a hint of that kind of sweet not necessarily orange but just kind of that that sweet orange style flavor that you get with that tiger ice cream let's loosen it up a little bit take one more dry haul and then spark it up now close to a 60 40 split god damn it that that's tasty you guys i'm i'm curious to see how this one's gonna burn um but video all you get is the time lapse audio you get the video not the video if you want the video you gotta go and check out my youtube channel audio you just get the uh the catch up on the scores but for the time being cheez y'all we're gonna spark this uh sucker up and we're gonna rattle off quickly for these guys and then we'll wrap this video up for everyone cheers and i'll see you on the other side going into the joint we're gonna welcome our video reviewers back on hey guys thank you welcome back and uh we're about halfway through this joint we caught everyone up with the sixes all the way down from the look and aroma which started out with a seven the taste from a joint this has been a very light burning light tasting but enjoyable joint now saying that we're getting to this end and this like when we still got another good inch on this joint so it's still a third of it left and the flavor's starting to turn into something i don't like it's not good you guys that's that's disappointing because i really had that a nice cushy flavor on the last joint i rolled from the one from natural history and it i hate to do this comparison because i have a feeling that if i smoked this one first it would have done decent and then followed up that one would have blown it out of the water but i don't know you guys this one's not bad it's just i don't i don't want to give it a 5. i but a 6 is it's it's right in between there because this last part you guys is just it's taken away [ __ ] it i will give it a 6 because i enjoyed the beginning quite a bit and this is just this is turning into kind of like a raw peppery flavor and it's just not what i like like when i end my joint i would rather be creamy cushy or just just kind of a raw fla raw smoke the pepper just especially when you go from a really nice gassy creamy almost kind of fruity experience to the pepper not the other way around it it kind of bums the uh the sesh out for me like after this i'll have to smoke another bowl just to get a good flavor in my mouth again and it's really a personal preference thing like it's not a oh i won't smoke this in a joint because no that's not how i am it's just i'll grab something else and roll that up in a joint over this because this for me the enjoyment factor overall enjoyment would be better through the ball so i'll just save this as a bong weed and these reviews really help me determine how i'm gonna smoke the rest of the eighth and i and i like to do that because there's a the majority of the strains end up just going through the bong because once we get into the bigger nugs the flavor's so great that through the bongs they're not they're not bad and then there's other ones where it's just not not quite there and we just work our way through the eighth you guys and half it's just a personal enjoyment thing i don't like the high when i'm doing this so it's just it sits and it needs to be a very unique smoke and experience for me to do that but while uh well we had that good little transition we're gonna go ahead and start talking about the high because i was talking about it just there um this one i am going to give a uh 8 out of a 10 for the high so overall head high it has a very relieving very relaxing overall just mellowing kind of um effect and feeling and then with the body it's got very much that nice muscle relaxant but it's not so much a couch lock like if i i feel like if i were to get up and do something it would help support just okay we're good just nice and easy let's get things warmed up and then once things are just more aware body body aware that's a better description for it no mental drift but we're body wear that's we're we're going to start using that body wear because that's really what it is where it's just the the sensitivity to certain spots like specifically for me my back straps like my right along the strips right along my spine that portion of my back always has been really really sore and tender so i have to be careful of that area and i'm building to strengthen it up since the accident and the injury i have to build it up and i have been and it's getting better quite a bit it's a lot better than it ever was now when i smoke that's usually one of the first places i feel because that's usually where i have some chronic sore pain sometimes it's up to legitimate pain most of the time it's just kind of sore and uneasy experience it's just it's it's unenjoyable it's the best way to put it this can't comes in and just settles right in there nice and relaxed and then it just kind of wraps around into my stomach and my because i have ibs and some some gut issues just kind of a nice warming wrapping feeling like this la cush cake for me is almost more of a medicinal smoking experience for the high when it comes to the body which is huge for me and it's honestly one of the biggest reasons why i think i like the cush strains because they give you that kind of body and um stomach ease at least for me personally i'm finding that that it kind of gives me that that straps down my back and then wraps around my stomach from about here to about my waistband it it's a very unique experience when i have a really nice and interesting cush straight and then the clear head well the the stress and like just the negative [ __ ] relief that the strain gives you just the leaving effects but it's still very clear-headed i'm not having any recalling issues anything like that it's it's an enjoyable overall experience you guys and an 8 out of 10 is what i'm going to give it if it had a stronger body effect nine or ten would be there if it had a mental drift effect to give you that really bumping bumping um mental drift and kind of body ease without a doubt 9 or 10. just a couple of things that i personally would like it to just rock me when i have it but this one did quite well and i enjoyed it it's just there's little tweaks for preference personal personal preference you guys but if you give me just a second i'm going to quickly add up our overall and uh we'll be back to wrap this long review up i've done a lot of talking on this one choose you guys 39 out of 60 you guys is how it did it did actually quite well overall for for being six is consistently and the high the high really brought it up quite a bit but honestly i'm i'm not disappointed with this strain at all i wish it had more of the flavor like the natural history like that it's really i wish i wish i wish however i still do i saved the three best and biggest nugs of this container so i'm hoping that very much like the la cushcake and most of the other strains that i smoke i get to experience the better tasting nugs at the end because i don't i i don't want to review the best biggest nug in there in the container because that's not what you guys necessarily going to get where if i get the shake and the the little not the shake but the little bit of the loose [ __ ] on the bottom of the containers and then the smaller nugs the ones that dry out a little bit quicker that maybe didn't have the best flavor or they busted off or the bigger piece like any of those ones and that's what i used to base my review of you're seeing the lowest quality in that container and if it scores well with that or if all i have is the big nug to go off of i'm either got lucky with the container that i got or that's what the company puts out and that's what i want to display you guys i want to display the company at its rawest point which is going to be the smaller buds and then the benefit is i do get to smoke the bigger ones a little bit later but nine times out of ten you get to enjoy those bowls with me on my instagram or sometimes on here when we're doing podcasts or garage sesh or anywhere else you guys that's and that's really kind of the approach to doing this and i didn't intend on this video turning into like a long form podcast but you know what we're gonna do it to celebrate 300 subscribers i'm gonna put up the long form of this you guys i'm gonna let you guys enjoy all of the extra talking that i would sometimes clip out of this we're at 45 minutes plus of recording right now the vape i fumbled my way through it but i hope you guys still enjoyed we uh we got the seven out of ten for looking aroma six out of ten for the vape six out of ten six out of ten six out of ten for the pipe and the joint and the bong the how i got it 8 out of 10 for an overall of 39 out of 60 to help celebrate that 300 subscribers as well i have a 7 gram of de la haze that i

today we're really excited about this one i've never tried anything from these guys before so this one is uh natural history is the brand this one is called la cushcake it was packaged august 24th so not super super fresh and i've never seen a two-way humidity pack in these uh these bags so probably have to do that myself but anyways it's a really interesting strain lakosh cake is an indica dominant hybrid bread bread crossing cush mints and wedding cake it was actually created by jbz aka c junkie so he's basically the guy that creates all the different crosses for cookies brand in uh in california by the way this one is sitting at 23.9 thc uh and the total terpene profile on it is uh 1.27 so it's not super high but i've had some pretty flavorful strains that were sitting at that same kind of percentage the buds look to be green and purple dense and covered in a thick layer of trichomes ellie kush cake is said to be very terpy and potent it was actually named uh best personal uh flower at the 2019 emerald cup awards and the dominant terpenes on this guy are trans b karyophiline trans nerolital b myerscene limonene and a humilin natural history is located in edmonton alberta and so basically natural history is the um the adults recreational brand for uh like retail stores but they're actually under the parent company um atlas biotechnologies inc which is atlas growers which is also located in edmonton uh this is actually the reason that intrigued me about this company because i'm a big fan of like ignite as you can see and ignite basically outsources their cultivators so um a couple strains i've tried from ignite in the past like crescendo because i've done my research on them i knew that atlas growers actually grew crescendo so um and they did a really really good job so i wanted to try these guys as well um so i think what's going on now is natural history is basically now that they have that brand under atlas growers i don't think they're going to really be outsourcing any of their uh cultivations anymore they're just going to be selling them under the natural history brand um and they've got a lot of really really cool strains so definitely check out their website um it's definitely i'd say it's probably the best website that i've seen so far just very well laid out it's got kind of like a wheel that has all the different strains and you can click on it and see what it looks like it'll tell you all about it huge breakdown it gives you like a big breakdown of the lineage so you can click on both of the crosses and it'll show you what what made up those and and then so forth so really well done on their website it says they're dedicated to the creation of inspired interesting cultivators you can definitely tell by their uh their lineup atlas grower the parent company is also located in edmonton like i said they cultivate all the different strains for natural history they hand trim hang dry and cure their buds for a minimum of 10 days which is really really good process and if you're looking to invest in natural history uh they're under the name atlas biotechnologies inc which we'll have on the screen okay so let's get a look at it here okay guys so this is obviously not a big deal but uh as you can see i've ripped off both tabs from the top here from both sides and it still doesn't want to open for me so whatever it's an easy fix really good smell right off the bat looks really nice too definitely get you guys a good look at that uh so now that we've learned a little bit about uh la kushcake uh by natural history last thing i got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys uh after testing out the l.a kush cake by natural history uh really really impressed with this one excited to try out more strains from these guys so it looked really really nice super nice bag appeal some of the buds were super purple the taste on it was very very good in my opinion uh definitely had like a the wedding cake definitely came out a lot uh and the cushman's as well the effects on it were nice nice and strong the ash on it was uh was good it wasn't super super white or light but it was nice ash pretty clean for sure super smooth and it burned really well so overall really impressed by this one natural history well done and i'm going to rate it a 9.2 out of 10. until next time guys", "EpgQHmeVqx0": "this content is for mature audiences only i do not promote the sales or use of any substance strictly for educational purposes so 21 and older only hey youtube so today i'll be reviewing the la cush cake pod live resin from stizzy so i'm going to take a first hit and tell you my experience from here [Music] so the flavor i give about a seven out of ten the flavor is really mild to me it doesn't have any flavors that are super overpowering it kind of has this burnt gassy flavor waxy sort of taste to it also if you're expecting some sort of fruity flavor don't expect it from from this because it's a lot more natural because it's live resin so the high quality the high quality it's very smooth although it felt subtle to me at first uh it mellowed me out and relaxed me within about two puffs it's a very smooth calm feeling high which is great so do i recommend this pod i highly recommend it if you find it at the store and you have a stizzy i recommend getting this because it's a higher quality live resin than most pens out there um some of the live resins i've tried make me feel a little paranoid afterwards this one i don't get that from it's just very smooth very calm feeling so if you try it you'll notice your day feels a little brighter after hitting it so with that being said i'm gonna hit it wait for this airplane to go by [Music] i'm gonna continue vibing check out suzy light resin pods this one's lash cake [Music] cheers", "iftvo18Saig": "what is going on welcome back to the i smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at a strain we've previously covered in its flower form as part of our 2020 strain review series this week i've got the extract the diamonds of the strain la cushcake read by sea junkie genetics extracted by gas leak extracts and we're going to take a look at it right here on the icemoke channel first of all you can see the gas leak extracts pot wiki branding i see this a lot i've got very familiar with this cartoon lady right here that sounds weird um but they generally come in these little glass pots opening up this pot what have we got inside this is a form of extract known as diamonds and sauce i've covered it a few times recently on the channel most recently with our nugbusters 24k gold diamonds this is the same form of cannabis extract but it has more source in rather than being a dry diamond of a particular weight so the diamonds have been mined out of the source and then the preparation of extract has been left together to give us this lovely form that we see in front of us the strain itself combines the cush mints which i've not had the pleasure of trying or with the wedding cake which i'm very familiar with it is an indica dominant powerhouse of a strain and that is likely to give sedative body lead relaxing effects there is plenty of sauce amongst these diamonds and it is going to be a really nice turpy tasting dab which is going to give me a great flavor profile of the la cush cake cannabis strain also a deep yellow golden colour and a really nice texture which you can see in this close-up when using a dab tool you can start to feel the silky sticky texture of this cannabis extract and that is the turpiness of the sauce the volatile side of the extracts that also tasty terps i'm looking forward to dabbing it the smell of the la cushcake it has got a classic og sort of aroma that is changed somewhat by the addition of the sweet creamy cakiness that is coming out from the other side wedding cake is a sickly sweet straight you really can smell the sweetness of wedding cake adding that in to the kush mints which is animal mince crust with something kush something classically cushy and it is giving a lovely gassy undertoned with sweet sort of flavor with hints of pine hints of gas and i could just live in here i could just sit here and smell this this smells absolutely fantastic if you were smelling this in someone else's pocket you would be a very jealous person oh and it's lovely and complex you get a full sort of wave of aroma that sort of wafts into the nostrils and evolves somewhat as you as you breathe in so if you just give it a little sniff like that it's got one smell whereas if you do that you start to get these additional complex notes coming in which is making this la cush cake smell absolutely fantastic but how does it taste i have got my dab rig ready here we are using the spectrum glass banger by glob glass and we are going to take some of this extract and put it into here and dab it first of all we need to heat up the quartz banger here we go oh this is fire extract this is absolutely delicious smelling looking gonna do a nice dab of it as well it kind of looks like golden caviar i'm getting that kind of vibe to it it's also slightly cloudy looking rather than just being clear diamonds in yellow you can sort of see an almost translucentness which is quite cool we are ready to do our dab of the la cushcake and join me for this and i'll see you all on the other side [Music] cheers [Music] so [Music] oh that has got a really nice flavor [Music] it's got a really light almost floral sweetness that comes through smack bang in the middle of the exhale you're in the middle of breathing out and suddenly it's like oh that tastes sweet really really nice flavor to it also present it's that classic kind of dankness that i expect from the og side of the lineage that kind of moorishness reminds me ever so slightly of gelato but most prevalent is the sweet creamy notes of the wedding cake which come through into the la kush cake nicely giving it a lovely unique flavor profile which is very enjoyable it's got some substance to it this vapor like you can you can taste it in your mouth like it's kind of thicker than it is really interesting the vapor is still sitting in the air in a cloud in front of me and i can smell how nice this one is in the air even though i've just dabbed it which normally makes you a little bit noseblind as well as the flavor i have got a treat in store for me when it comes to the effects and they're already kicking in it's body leads it's got me feeling good it's actually very relieving on the sinuses there's some sort of terp profile or cannabinoid profile that seems to make my sinuses clear leading to a bit of a runny nose and and the la cushcake has done that quite quickly when i smoked the flour of this this is what i said this has been a lovely smoke one of the strongest strains i've had in a while appearance wise i like the look of it taste wise i enjoyed it through the bong the flavor notes came through nicely effects wise you can see how fast it kicked in and how chilled i am yeah it hit me like a sledgehammer and those effects were also powerful definitely on the body lead side it has got me feeling nice and spicy already mere minutes after consumption the main thing i want to talk about when it comes to this extract is that flavor which is still present in my mouth as i speak it's a really bloody nice flavor guys i cannot state that enough one of the things i did think was a slightly musky aroma as well i didn't pick that out before but i've just quickly read some info about it and they mentioned sort of a cushy musky aroma and it is present along with that sweetness it's a really interesting one you get that kind of old-school classic kush contrasted with the sweetness of the wedding cake so you've got like this earthiness this sweetness rolled into one super strong it has lifted me right up comparing it with the last review that i did on the diamond side which was the 24k i will say that this high feels completely different this is definitely on the body side whereas that was on the hybrid side and i remember the the strong tangy influence of the 24k strength wise is similar i mean they're both diamonds this has got more source therefore less thca but they're both it's diamonds and sauce or just diamonds that form of extract so comparatively this tastes nicer hits differently obviously not as impressive diamond size because the whole thing being one diamond i've not seen anything like that and that was wicked but flavor-wise the la cushcake wins out and that goes for most of the extract that i've dabbed this year actually this is some fire we are about to do dab number two of the la kush cake join me oh that would have been a hot one lucky i've i've realised to wait that's the level of buzz that it's given me join me for this and i'll see you all on the other side cheers [Music] uh [Music] wow super super turpy it does get me a little bit like makes my [Music] my senses just kind of sparkle it's a really really nice flavor and sort of dabbing experience so yeah chem dank and gas leak extracts have done a great job overall this is some of the best extract that

here in the garden starting to have some nice development in flowers here we're starting to have some sugar build up some tripod production very cool good to see the plants look really happy really healthy got some nice praying going on getting pretty uh pretty thick in the trunk area here on both these two la cushcake plants they're pretty dense canopy here that one weird twin bud that's forming i'm really curious to see how this develops it's starting to look like it's it's gonna look like two buds just kind of right next to each other i'm not sure how quite how that happens so i'm about to do a nice defoliation on these two and i wanted to get in here and take a little video beforehand maybe in the future i will uh figure out what i need to do to time lapse the defoliation process and show you guys that but for now i'm just going to shut the camera off and do my defoliation and then i'll uh bring you guys back when i'm all done and we're back you can see through it through the canopy now a little bit better quite a bit better than before this one on the right is a little bit denser a little bit bushier plant a lot heavier leaf production on it i might take a little bit more off um in a little bit but i think that's probably pretty good overall i like to take off a good bit of the foliage around the end of the third week for a couple of reasons i like to help help get the light penetrating down into the lower canopy as well as helping airflow penetrate through the canopy which will help prevent mold and mildew from building up in the garden one of the things the things i've noticed is if you have a really dense canopy leaves tend to rest on top of each other kind of like like one sitting on top of another and they'll transpire and each into each other and i've noticed water will build up on the leaves from that and that can be a vector for mold or mildew to enter into your garden so defoliating helps to prevent that from happening helps keep the humidity levels down and keep the airflow moving nicely through the canopy i don't know if i'm going to do any more lollipopping on these from the top to about where the the bottom nodes are starting to form there's about 18 inches so it's not not a terrible amount of uh depth here so i don't think i really need to remove too much more if i'm going to remove any anymore but um if you look down in here some of those nodes coming off that branch and stuff and some of these little undeveloped nodes might not produce too much even that nug will probably end up being a popcorn nug so these these lowers might not amount to too much but i'm gonna wait think about it for a day or so and then i'll i'll make my decision on whether i'm gonna popcorn anything else off these two plants [Applause] but i think overall we're looking pretty good the one on the right has been the healthier happier plant flower one on the left i think having a denser canopy is affecting it i probably should have defoliated a bit heavier going into flour and then maintained its canopy a little bit better in flour i think it will benefit heavily from this defoliation here so i think i'm going to throw the two hydrofuels you guys might remember from a few videos back into the flower room here and start those on day one for tomorrow so i might move them in tonight before lights out so that they can get their first 12 hours tonight and then they want to flower for them can be tomorrow they're a little bit shorter than these two but i imagine that once they start falling they're going to take off and pass them in height i think they're going to be pretty tall plants in comparison to the la cushcake which have been pretty short and stout i don't know how much the paint fumes that they were exposed to influenced their height or if this is just the way that um la cushcake grows i'm not sure i haven't grown wedding cake before i haven't grown animal events so i haven't grown anything in this lineage so it's it's completely new to me so we'll see i'll check back in with you guys probably around the end of week four hope everyone has a nice holiday this week take care see you next

is the Wii game and business is business and like I said no disrespect to them boys do your thing mate flex on them as much as you can but I ain't [ __ ] with it now with that being said Gary Payton serial mo yeah chopped liver the floor London cello cheetah piss a whole nother right about to hit the market a whole new flavor profile everything from mints which is you know by sea junkie shot to see junkie from the runts crew yeah from grandiflora some powers up from cookies big menus coming new flavor profiles coming all work is all worked a new work that's the new work so the same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "K1VtZ1vqo8s": "Crete [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back I'm glad you're all here today if you happen to hear some birds chirping around the background perfect because it is springtime here in the northern hemisphere which means it's a perfect time to start to germinate seeds whether you're going to be going outdoors for the 2019 outdoor season or you're staying indoors and want new genetics or just new seedling plants for your indoor crop today I'm going to be showing you the few little things that I use and how I germinate seeds just like everything I do it's a very simple method it's something I've been doing for a really long time I think you know I think I'm on like 14 years now I'm sure there's plenty of other ways to do this and possibly better and you know just slightly easier ways to do this but this is how I do this like I said it's been successful for a long time now so today we're gonna be showing you how I germinate seeds so stay tuned alright so let's show you the little bit of equipment that we're gonna need to get these seeds up and going so obviously first things first we're gonna need some seeds so whatever a variety company strain even species you may be going with get those ready now what we're gonna be using here is banana split from the homie loci grow he started his own little breeding company here a breeding genetic company under grow genetics and they're just getting up and going he's got about six or seven crosses that are in testing right now and I was lucky enough to grab them so I could take some dope pictures and also get them kind of up and going and do some testing anyway we have the banana split which is banana punch by symbiotic genetics super hot they're crossed with ice cream man was his mail from compound genetics another super hot breeder out there so should be some serious fire in there and if you guys have been following me on instagram at green jeans garden you have seen the fire pictures before these things have even germinated as well as some other strains that got some dope pictures up so follow me at green jeans garden anyway so we have our seeds next we're gonna need a shot glass or anything really that holds some water because the first step is soaking the seeds and to go along with that we're gonna need some water simply now this is where everyone's gonna ask so what kind of water tap are oh this or that doesn't matter guys use tap use are out use what you got but whatever you use use the best you got if have RO water use it if you have clean spring water use it the idea is that it's clean water and it's neutral water and what I mean by neutral is it's somewhere in the range of upper fives at the lowest pH to around seven at the highest pH so just say Gerry generally neutral pH and you should be good to go and then once we soak the seeds we're kind of moving in the second process and that's going to be germinating them in the basic paper towel method that everyone knows and loves so that's going to consist of a paper towel and a ziplock baggie now the Ziploc baggie could also be a clone dome it could be anything that's just going to keep the paper towel from drying out too fast could even be two bowls but we'll get into that once we get going I picked pick eight of the beans that I want to germinate here save a few just in case for a rainy day you never know it so it's just kind of a we save one or two anyway got them as well as the two twin beans that I have in there photo goes up now so all we're gonna do here is we are going to put a little bit of water in there and we are going to simply drop these seeds into the water now you'll notice most of the seeds will float any that sink immediately are usually duds but they could be okay anyway just give a little little swirl and we are going to let the seeds soak for 12 hours okay so we've dropped our seeds in water we're going to let them soak for 12 hours and we let them soak for 12 hours in darkness now by dropping them in water and having generally good temperatures those are the two criteria to start the germination process light can be harmful essentially it's just really not necessary some species and strains and things do need light but overall 95% of seeds germinate the best and most successfully in darkness so as long as you have good moderate temperatures over 65 degrees under you know 80 80 82 and some moisture for the seeds to start their process they're going to germinate so what we're gonna do is we're actually just going to put these in one of these cabinets I have behind me here and come back in 12 hours [Music] ok so it's been about 16 hours now and the timeframe anywhere from you know 6 hours to 24 hours is plenty of time to get these seeds soaking and as you can see here these seeds have already sprouted tails in the shot glass now these things these are new fresh seeds very vigorous ready to go if you have some older seeds they might they probably won't sprout tails a lot of times my older seeds won't sprout tails in here which is why we actually go to this the second step of the method here the paper towel method some people will just germinate in the shot glass and honestly these seeds right here these could go straight from here to whatever your final or starter media is and probably be fine they're vigorous and ready to go but for the sake of how I always do seeds we're going to continue to take these from the sprouted tails in the shot glass here and get them into a paper towel so let's do that now okay so let's get these seeds transferred into the paper towel and it is just as easy as it may seem we are just literally just going to pour them in try not to spill them everywhere and keep them in our palm and we got one being left in there we'll just wash it on out use gravity and water and bam just don't tell my wife I'm doing it here on the counter all right once we have the seeds on the damp or moist paper towel we're just gonna fold it up maybe two three folds tops you don't need much as you can see here you can see the seeds through it we don't want it to be completely thick that we can't see through it but we want to be covered enough that it acts like you know some form of medium or soil all right so we have our seeds damp paper towel just let it drip dry give it a little ring on the edges we just want it we want it moist damp not dripping wet but obviously need some moisture for seeds act like you know pretend it's some moist cocoa or some moist soil once we have that we're gonna open up our ziploc bag or simply just gonna put it inside now this thing is like I said just acting as if it's a clone a cloned oh this is just they've always done it in ziplock baggies cuz you know they're more accessible and pretty much everyone has a sandwich bag I'm using a gallon ziplock here because to me the bigger the Ziploc the better which is why I think I cloned a clone dome works great for this situation the small Ziploc sometimes if your seeds take a while to germinate maybe they take 3 4 days to get going and they can get kind of just a funky little smell going you might want to change paper towel something like that and I've noticed a bigger a bigger Ziploc or cloned um or something like that that kind of mitigates that just a just a touch but these things are so vigorous they're only going to be in here another 12 hours or so maybe 20 for tops you'll see them and they're gonna be frickin explosive so all we're going to do is put it in here and kind of give it a little little puff give it a little air poof in there so it's got you know so the bags not laying right on on the seeds and we're going to put it right back into that dark space where we had success getting these tails out of the four so wherever that was for you go ahead and put it right back there [Music] okay so let's look at these guys all of them have have sprouted and one of the twins has sprouted one of them has not guys are looking at just some singles here look at that beautiful beautiful growth here we go and this one see that's a twin that only one has sprouted this twin both of them have sprouted guys this is a little weird [ __ ] Wiggins I'm so stoked but all the seeds looking good look at that tail fantastic so whoo okay alright guys so 24 hours after we put them into the paper towel we've now taken them out roughly 24 hours might be like 18 you know but give or take these seeds are extremely vigorous so don't expect results exactly like this I just want to clarify that right now tails popping out after 12 hours beautiful busted tails out this is just a very you know these are fresh seeds it's a vigorous strain obviously all good signs but if yours take a few days to get to get some tails sprouted this or that don't worry that's that's totally normal but once they do once you've opened them up we can transfer them from the paper towel to whatever starter medium you have so if you're gonna try to drop them into a rock wool cube that's your thing if you're putting them in soil that's your thing Pro mix whatever it may be that that's your choice at this point but we're using coco here but the you know the technique here is the same we're gonna lightly we've already buried our unburied them holes give them some nice nice spots to sprout and we're just going to lightly place each seedling in there I have eight little four-inch pots here and we have eight seedlings we're actually not going to do all of them because that twin sprouted so I got to actually go take some some great photographs and that should pop up right here and if not give me a few days and get all these potted up and nicely watered in I have one little watering technique that I'll show you once we get these in here but that's that so we are actually we're two days past once we first transplant these seedlings into their Coco medium and you can see there up there sprouted all of them even the twins that are in this bag you're going I just want to get that shell off there so I can get each one of these twins into their own own media but but yeah they're ready to go now I told you there was one little trick I have two watering and guys its watering so it's nothing revolutionary it's crazy the point of it is just when you first transplant your seeds you want to get them watered you want to get that basically that bond from the seed to that medium it kind of wants their wet it just creates that bond and to do that we want to do it gently we don't want to just flood the top here with water and let it do its thing most likely the plants to be fine honestly but you know most people are paying pretty good dollars for seeds these days ten plus dollars a seed so you want to take care of it let's just be gentle so simply what I was gonna show you is just be gentle with the water bottle that you were watering with nothing crazy um we don't want to flood or this is the kicker everyone forgets most of you guys have a pump sprayer whether it be a little hand like hairspray or thing or you actually have like a pump sprayer and this guys is the most gentle way to water in the top of your seedlings because it's a very light mist you can be very direct with it right where it needs to go and the perfect amount where it's not too not too agitating or not too too harmful for these seedlings now my only tip is that if you use your sprayer for your IPM be kind of you know pesticide or preventative anything it could be gnarly on a baby seedling just make sure you clean out your sprayer or have a dedicated clean sprayer something like that I know it might be an extra step but that is my suggestion other than that you guys should be off to the races that at this point and should be able to start feeding these plants now that they're to this point they're just starting to get their first true set of leaves you have those they're called cotyledons the leaves that don't really look like real leaves once they get past that they need some nutrients so at this point we need to give them light and we need to give them nutrients and we need to start treating them just like real plants which at this point they are if they're above the ground so whatever you're gonna do with your seedlings this year whether again if you're going outdoors for 2019 or you're staying indoors with new genetics that's how I pop and germinate I've always had fairly good success rate overall obviously these seeds are extremely vigorous new so they're kind of you know stars of the show here so don't expect identical results of the EC's work again vigorous freakin nature's but yeah you guys should be often going have some beautiful seedlings up and started and some great new genetics in your rooms or in your gardens so guys I appreciate it like this video if you liked it go ahead and just like it if you don't is what it is subscribe if you're not and I will see you guys next time whether it's a back to the basics little tutorial here or we're back in the garden guys so I

popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so

too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "2R29WD9oaMU": "hey everyone welcome back to the garden today is uh day 20 on the hyper fuel back here so i wanted to get in and take a video before i did a defoliation i'll probably stop the video in a bit and then do some defoliation and then bring it back in and show you guys the difference i actually already started uh cutting some of the lowers off and thought i should stop and take a video take a look at these ladies before i take anything more off it's a pretty difference between this side and this side of the white here it looks a lot denser on the right because we're further along than it does over here but it's also uh the lake cushcakes are a little bit shorter and bushier and the hybrid fuels have a much bigger stretch if you guys remember when i first put these in here the la cushcakes were on the floor with the hyper fuels and they were actually taller than them so that's like a little over two feet right there that i've raised the hyper fuels so they've grown more than two feet because they were like probably down here so that's like two and a half feet that they've stretched in the first 20 days of flower and they're they don't have the strength in their branches that the la cushcakes do because of all that stretchy stretchiness and you can see these branches starting to already weigh themselves down and pull themselves over and i think i'm going to prematurely start tying those branches up so that they i can get them up under the the light here because they're really starting to fall out over to the side at this point so i think two things i'm going to do is do that defoliation clean up the canopy a bit clean up the lowers because i've got like two and a half three feet of of bud formation here and that's that's way more than i need the lights not going to penetrate and hit those lower bud sites quite like you'd want them to so we'll take some of that off allow the plant to redirect some energy into the upper canopy so i'm going to go ahead and get to that and i'll uh check check back after we're done all right we're back to the bunch off both those two plants here cleaned up the under canopy which looks pretty nice a lot of shoots going everywhere i i actually removed a bunch of um removed a bunch of branches from the lower part of the plant that were coming off and doing stuff like this and not really making it up to the upper part of the canopy so i removed all that cleaned out the uh cleaned out the upper canopy and i went ahead and wired up some of these branches that were pretty much just flopping over on their side so when i re if i regrow this strain again i think i'm gonna have to trellis it to give it some more support it it can't support itself by the time this thing gets into the later weeks and has some weight i'm probably gonna have all these branches tied up here so yeah there's there's that this this phenotype was definitely the more vigorous um threw a lot more branching out and it's an overall bigger plant then uh then it's sister on the other side over here you can see that one it towers over it a little bit it's a couple inches taller maybe a half foot but you can see the big difference in the under canopy here between these two phenols there's a lot less branches coming up off here but the branches are a little bit stronger and sturdier on this one nothing's really flopping over too much yet i i'm sure will eventually but less branches more strength per branch that's kind of my thinking on that we're getting nice bud site formation here on day twenty this looks good i'm happy with the progress so far looks lovely it reminds me a lot of the platinum cush brat that i ran last round it's very stretchy just like it very similar in a lot of ways taking a look at the la cushcake there we go buds are really developing nicely at this point picking up a lot of frost uh nug and even on the the fan leaves are sugaring up quite nicely at this point slight difference in the blood structure between this phenotype here that i'm showing you right now and then this phenotype over here it looks a little bit different they smell pretty much identical though but those are on day 41 at this point and they're coming along quite nicely here is that uh that twin bud that i had growing in it's really cool looking i can't wait to see that one harvested i hold on to it for a long time i did that with uh i don't know if anybody remembers the platinum cush breath girl where i super cropped a branch and i had a bud that started bending and curling up towards the light i still have that nug and i'm just starting to crack into it as i'm almost finished up with uh smoking that harvest need to get to this one so looking forward to cutting these down

live resin hybrid looks like we got a seventy eight percent total THC and total terpenes of 7.8% [Applause] well you have much of the smell the smell kind of minty though I've never smelled a concentrate that smelled like mint it was like a minty kind of minty pine looks looks kind of like more like a cake icing consistency you said it was a lie bread oh yeah it's really hard see it's very hard this is more like like a sugar wax consistency yeah just smells like kind of like minty pine weird very nice consistency very easy to work with plus a very light in color which I usually ride very minty got a little bit of like a sweet vanilla taste to it on the exhale although very tasty very nice well I think I killed that one a lot sweeter than I thought it was gonna be I'm very nice like that a that vanilla cookie flavor tasted a lot better than the smell that will said that pretty smooth - I was pretty large dad let me make me cough a lot got me a little sweat going oh that's

doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff

hope you've been having a little date today I got this la cruz cake you know me yesterday I was supposed to smoke up that backward with it I forgot my bad so I got these pre-roll cones I was gonna check out some rob papers but I don't these are some roar cones pure smoke culture the art is backwards and culture is spelled with a k interesting I really want to know how these smoke these are the ones when I opened up in that daily high club box the other day with that brand new rink that I got for 420 I like these kinds of like already because I just like the aesthetics of it it has this cool thing it's like a like I think this is supposed to be a packet it's really cool I've never seen one that looks like that 600 I'm gonna stuff one of these up with the LA cush cake can you see it's so hard at this freaking Sun dude yeah I think that's better you can see it way clear twenty-nine percent THC THC thirty four point eight percent total cannabinoids it says the batch number the harvest date the package date the cultivation license the distributor license tested by earth labs never heard of them but I'm about to try them it's this is crafted canopy company and I never heard of them either but we're about to see the bud and like try it for the first time ever let's get it I'll turn the camera around it's close tightly push down and turn to open we did that open there's a whole bunch of warnings on it yes sir this was like a 45.8 bullying no flash that she is a $45 8th right here other least went to the dispensary I paid $45 for this it looks good well better put some flash on this actually right when that flash goes on honestly let's go whole different good flash plus the sunlight dang I don't even know how much but this little pre-roll : takes I'm just gonna break up like what I ball up on grand worth this isn't even a full 3.5 to be real I smoked like one little ball so if you guys like there's no ways 3.5 because it's not it's probably honestly only like a 2.8 or some [ __ ] like right when I got it and I've had this but for honestly a couple of days I was gonna do this strain of you the other day but I kept forgetting to smoke I kept forgetting I had this but I'd never go to dispensary so I had this little thing in a jar I forgot about it yeah that's not enough that did not break out to nearly as much as I thought of me I probably cried up this whole thing that's the rest it's just sticky as [ __ ] this is a type of we that'll [ __ ] up you're grinding there should be more than enough for that little thing okay halfway there halfway done a wheat so that's actually like a really good amount to break up for this cone it fits way more than I thought this is a sick little packing thing I only got two hands or I would record myself like packing it I could record myself like this but like you can't really see at all you could see me pack it down though it's like any regular one but it's just like Roche my car this little town I was like [ __ ] perfect put some wax around this and [ __ ] make that wax joint alright so so far what I like about this weed is the smells it's frosty kind of looks a little PG re I'm not gonna it has like it looks like PG r dropped it but it has a really nice smell whatever looks nice it was a nice feel to it when I was breaking it up and then when I was grinding it up - it was pretty nice it's like fluffy and dense at the same time which isn't like bad it's that's pretty nice so far I like it like what it looks like and feels like know about to see what it tastes like smokes like I would see what clear the ashes turned out to be so we see how good it was flushed so first all the could have their head oh wait grass it's not like wait I've got [ __ ] off the street that burns wait so I don't know I would expect a little bit better from this especially I pay $45 for eight people pay more but with this ball I like how it tastes so far though it's just a little bit harsh which again I'm a blame on the flushing of this specific strain how many hits have I taken I don't really feel that high yeah I'm gonna take like a couple hits or some [ __ ] I've got smacked but it's getting really resonated blame the flushing I like blaming the color of the ashes on the flushing job of the bat of the bud because this badge man and it could be like this badge or it could just be this paper this isn't a rock and I know that Roz always burns super clean I never smoked one of these I did say this is not a Rogers or or its unbleached which is good but I don't know made in Indonesia that's sick I'm smoking Indonesian it's really smooth I like the paper I think it's not the paper I don't know anything else - these papers I'll do it on camera and I'll see if it's the papers fault I wish I bought like a quarter of this [ __ ] I could smoke it in a different paper like I could smoke it in a rock home and see the difference of the burn this looks really good on camera looks different on camera than it does in person it looks more dark in person but then again I'm like filming in front of the window you could see my blinds so I feel like it's just a damag I mean son don't drop the ass I was gonna ask you I think about it actually to get rid of me boom I'll give you two myself my last was a laser that last one was like almost borderline a bagel and a bagel is what I call it when it's like you blow up oh but it it's not a full okay it's all but it's still part of a ghost and you pull it back so it's like a donut they I don't know it's called a bagel it's not a ghost and it's not a oh but it's up oh and it goes that words it's a [ __ ] bagel I can only comfortably respectively to take about three four more heads before I just gotta stop because it's just Freddie like the broke and I'm high but I'm not like too high I'm actually about to go to Walmart I'm just like I don't know man I don't like how dark it's burning I'm just really picky with my food I really like it I like to smell a bit and shade like I would buy it again but by the quality I'd spent another forty-five dollars and then maybe never buy it again it's not towards the light too much no flash no sunlight well this sunlight but you know but look at that it's kind of dark yeah I'm glad about these I'm glad just but only forty five dollars is what it is no take-backs still smoking it you know I enjoyed it I'm high but this ain't medicine bro this is what you sell tea a puppet joke because he's never had a good week before you say hey puppet Joe look at this crazy [ __ ] he's like oh [ __ ] my dad you just like yeah [ __ ] today look at this crazy [ __ ] and he just loves it because you don't know the difference between [ __ ] the PGR and real [ __ ] see that's how you know because good how it's burning all crazy PGR is like oh and I'll do like if I find some crazy PGR hopefully I could do a whole video on it but I'm not gonna do make any promises but review over you guys if you guys enjoy this video leave a like a comment I shared all that good [ __ ] you already know that stay with [Music]", "nxlld7RYbgk": "hi welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing the buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge strain on this one is sherbert or sherbet i don't i don't know not really sure if they spelled that wrong or what but buddies liquid diamonds live resins are pretty much my go-to card as of right now they're very good quality i would say like gold standard of quality for their price um you can get slightly better stuff but you're gonna end up paying part uh prices that i i wouldn't consider worth it anymore so these are a very good cartridge itself very good oil inside it's very consistent it's very terpy and has a good effect every single time so you know what you're getting so let's get into the packaging and then i will open it up try it out and we'll see what i think all right so here's the packaging up close as you can see i buy a lot of these they even give me a bulk buff for them um let's grab one of these out here i've taken the sticker off so you can see they put the price sticker over these so not too much being missed on these sides luckily so i'll toss that aside here so we got what are we looking at here it's 72.27 percent thc one point zero seven percent cannabidiol um seventy eight point five percent total cannabinoids in indica but um if you ask me straight names or indica steve doesn't need anything anymore with cross breeding we'll get the side information let you pause that and read it if you want to and then you have nothing on that side nothing on the bottom buddies logo on the top and then i love about these is you got the terp profile well at least top three so you can kind of know what you're going to be getting into some more info there the verification that rc number um i got this one because it has humulene in it i've been really looking for that but you'll find a lot of these that's not a good example but a lot of these are much more terpy let's see if i can find i've had these come up to 16 turks and it was just like ridiculous okay it's funny now i can't even find them so maybe they are average i would say six to nine percent terpenes for the distillates closer to uh like one to four percent there we go there's those are two so yeah this stuff's pretty terpy it's good stuff though i'll get to open it now all right let's get into it my vessel rolling around here pop it open here i don't remember what that says when i focus then you got that which just fell out but that's all right um you got the tube that it always comes in pretty sure it's upside down which will list a thc enabled cbd instead of cbg then card itself it's a very nice looking liquid live resin i found this stuff which i think is usual for live resin can occasionally be even like a little bit liquid at room temp flowing somewhat freely and stuff but i believe that just um was with the two that were extremely derpy like 12 to 14 percent so i always take the stickers off here i'll finish up later now let's pop it in excited to see what sherbet sherbet is like and right away that's just such a smooth hit the pool has like some nice resistance you get amazing vapor from it so i love that draw tip it's really pretty slick all right so i mean taste wise the last couple i had were about almost like double the terpene yeah terpene content so this one's kind of weak for me but really hard to pin down actually it's very neutral but um i would just say it's like it's it's vaguely vaguely sweet vaguely herbal that humiliating adds something i'm trying to describe it because humulin is what is in hops and beer so if you know that flavor that's what i'm getting from this you'll see a lot of this stuff you'll probably um if you want to look into terpenes ever you'll know that a lot of other foods and stuff have these terpenes so you can get an idea of what you're going to taste which is what i love about these carts they show you so yeah we're getting um cardio filling which is like kind of peppery it's almost the same amount with limonene so those are matching up with a kind of citrusy taste and then it's kind of complemented by like a a hoppy taste which i'm not a beer drinker and especially whenever i was it was nothing hoppy at all i do not like ips or anything so i'm not familiar with that i can't really like explain it well but that's what it would taste like if you know that so really really a good cart for thirty dollars i paid um thirty six dollars for recreational users i have my med card definitely recommend that i recommend at least trying it if you usually go for a distillate card or any other ones this is like my go-to so hope you enjoyed the video i'm going to be trying to get another one here because i picked up some distillate syringes and i'll be getting those once my ceramic cartridges come in so hope to see you then thanks for watching", "oZVF2vsOWJU": "[Music] what's that wavy [ __ ] trippy we got a special guest with us Jason a shout-out my boy Jason for coming through for today's video but today's video we're gonna be

fancy smoke first show and we're about to give you guys a review and let you guys know is it really worth 180 make sure you guys like this video subscribe and gonna let you guys know let me know what you guys think down below before we start would you buy this for 185 before we even light it look at it it's a grenade YUM you can pull the little thing and boo sure let me know down below what you guys like this baby of them so ready we are in the tent as you guys can see I don't bring it back and it's about to get night time for you guys cuz I know a lot of you I wanted to see the night time so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just sitting here no you're not going we get in one hundred and eighty dollars worth of Highness dog like who do you know is smokin a pumps let me know down in the comments if you guys have tried this grenade like cookies

rice ones they taste hell it feel like I've been smoking all the flour rice ones it's like almost like there's no paper I don't know I don't know what the everyone making papers so I you're right there like it's not healthy yeah it's just kind of like a competition with one another now I don't know I'm not gonna get into politics let me know if you guys could still see cats crying in the back

see on the next one [Music]", "YvpSiTIk1A4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weeds the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand uh one that we've actually taken a look at in the past but now they have a new line that i thought i would take a look at and so who is that we are taking a look at moxie a brand as i said we've looked at before but now they have their new mx line from moxie uh this is the mx they're live resin full spectrum cartridges so this is a standard 510 thread uh filled with as i said full spectrum live resin sour jack um concentrate is what we've got here today this is a one gram cartridge that cost me 45 bucks at my dispensary in long beach which puts it at the about average cost for a one gram cart at my dispensary um uh the most exciting part about this is is again that live resin full spectrum nature uh that uh makes it so that theoretically everything in this cartridge uh is the same or pretty close to the uh plant terpene profile cannabinoid profile uh should be pretty similar to what is in this concentrate as well should be as their uh motto says it should be it's just cannabis it's just weed in this full spectrum live resin cartridge theoretically at least um one thing to note that this is actually pretty low on the thc uh percentage scale this only comes in at 66 percent thc which is quite low for a cartridge um you normally see them in the mid to upper 70s or higher um but it does have uh some different cannabinoids in it for a cannabinoid profile of 75 but the most important one thc uh a low 66 so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up and give it a try um as i said standard 510 cart here nothing special nothing fancy um hopefully don't demolish it too much there we go got it opened got our little additional security feature push down open there we go one more defeated and here we are okay well here is our cartridge uh powered by c cell technology um which are usually fine uh vape cartridge designs the cheap acrylic tip the oil uh darker than normal uh maybe it's just because this the full spectrum live resin is a little bit darker than normal uh but it is a richer oil color than than usual so uh let's go ahead and give this mx by moxie sour jack a hit oh tasty yep definitely has that um sort of more live resin full spectrum uh what would you call it authentic sort of strain taste quite tasty sour jack isn't a straight on too familiar with plant material wise but um this one here um nice taste uh light um mild kind of earthy um kind of um vaguely like basilly kind of taste to it i like it though um in terms of taste pretty good uh it does feel about that 66 as listed this is not the strongest cart i have ever done by any stretch but it is still weed and it is still gonna get me high i am already uh experiencing it it's just uh a as i said lower thc percentage than i normally do but the oil itself in here is quite good um quite tasty uh nice consistency no problems with it um if you are a big fan of having your concentrates taste theoretically what the strange should taste like this is probably something that you might be interested in this is on the sort of uh lower end of price for live resin not lower end price for one gram concentrate carts but if you are really into the whole live resin hype this is a more affordable way of doing it and this one's not bad yeah okay well i have a whole gram of this sour jack to do my guess is going to take me about five days to get through this but i will like all our wheats reviews this is gonna be a top to bottom affair i'm gonna finish this bad boy off uh and once i do i will come right back here to you guys give you our wrap-up thoughts let you know make sure that this sour jack from mx is as good as we hope right now until then we'll see you in just a bit later guys [Music] hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been five days with mx live resin by moxie with their sour jack and five days later feel pretty much the same about it as i did back then perfectly fine cart just not my favorite cart in the world um it's uh more for your fans of your live resins your full spectrums your strange specific kind of things and then it's a pretty good value if you're really into that uh it's like that 45 46 dollar price point for live resin is good it's a good deal um but this does come in at a lower thc percent which is very noticeable at just 66 and the sour jack flavor where the taste is good but not my favorite strain by any stretch so this is one that i would say if you're really really into live resin if you're really really into you know strain specific things maybe give it a look um but otherwise they're probably going to be better values out there than the mx line by moxie again nothing wrong nothing bad about it and if you're really into the whole live resin thing you're probably going to like it a lot more than i did which again liked it just fine just not going to be the cartridge i go to pick up on my own so with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats i appreciate you watching until we see for you for our next review stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you there goodbye", "79XEbEDw-0Y": "[Music] alright guys back here for another [ __ ] video today I just woke up and my [ __ ] pen [ __ ] a purse a cart on a moon rock it's pretty much done though so I said [ __ ] it up let's finally [ __ ] open up this [ __ ] stingy live rising car I have never tried these [ __ ] before I'm not a very bakes dizzy fan like I love Stevie it was good it's just uh I'm just very untrustworthy of the stuff that goes into it because it's not just it's not live resin it's not just real [ __ ] so when they came out with the live resin I was like but I got a cop dish here real quick cuz just to see what it tastes like compared to the extracts Diamond likkle cart but yeah I just woke up Bucky and I was watching Doctor Who and I've never did a video here at the desk so I was like [ __ ] I'm not even gonna go outside I wanted to go outside and look at you know beautiful honest nature and I actually did I got like halfway to another city but then I like turned around because I had to make sure I do a video for you guys today cuz I don't want to go all mine over my weak mark

I'm just trying to stay away from the waxed up a little bit not that I don't trust it I'll probably only stick with Ursa extracts like if you don't [ __ ] with any cars unless his thirst extracts Hawk garden or anytime we're alive greater this Ryan president I trusted there's just not all these other cars they got different things in it like you know I mean it's not completely just wax from tree or anything from the tree they put different [ __ ] in it like vitamins and stuff from different fruits and she'll know look up they like when you get one you can see the ingredients on the package and it'll show you like your [ __ ] that's in it but you got a liquid I got the liquid [ __ ] live resin so there's no additives as far as I know there's no air there's nothing in this [ __ ] but it's [ __ ] pop this [ __ ] open this you gotta poke it on the side BAM got the camo but yeah like it's the weekend guys and today it's just gonna be a chilly day on my drink a little bit definitely smoking um I've been wanting to see that Harley Quinn movie if you have seen the hard equipment ly comment below tell me how good it is I've been wanting to see it I don't know if I want to see her today today just might be relaxed today is chill at home maybe go see my girl and that's pretty much it today oh no I just been super tired because lately I've been working out like 5:00 in the morning so I'm just super tired still I don't know I'm just not used to that still even though I do wake up early Peter you know usually go work at like 7:30 6:00 but lately five because I just been wanting to get off earlier so I can do other things make vlogs go out to eat with people I don't know I feel like when I get off the late I'd be hella tired and I just go straight to sleep and just go to work the next day and like I can't be doing that guys I got a [ __ ] kind of [ __ ] grime if you're out there grinding I [ __ ] respect you guys like everyone is [ __ ] grinding right now I'm smacks butt on that [ __ ] note I'm not gonna ramble about that [ __ ] let's get some of [ __ ] carts [ __ ] looks beautiful it's just a little half grand but that's a pretty big problem I didn't even hit it whatever so let's see what this [ __ ] tastes like like honestly it looks pretty damn similar to the Ursa for some reason the Ursa I got darker than it and I'm not sure why I started getting darker so it looks pretty much like there's Oh [Music] Oh Oh so you got your work cut out for you bro I ain't even gonna [ __ ] lie I'm not even gonna [ __ ] cap on you guys see I'm gonna keep it [ __ ] real in this channel I'm not even gonna cap on you but at the same sign I don't know I like this one it has more it has that a daintiness like Ursula takes like a straight dab but it has this like I don't know hint of like sweet sweet taste to it that erster doesn't really have not just a nursery I'm still gonna be copying her so a lot but I like this new source dizzy this is actually [ __ ] better than I thought it's better than I honestly think it's better than their regular stuff like I'll probably only cop live Rasmus disease just because I don't [ __ ] with all that dish Elizabeth should that be in people whose [ __ ] car session not good for you guys like it could be organic it could not be could not be bad I mean get it from a reputable reputable dispensary guys don't just buy it off the streets there's too many fake ass carts coming still on the streets don't ever buy anything off the streets period it ain't real this goes to spin and just plan on spending $65 this [ __ ] pin [Music] if you guys know any other live resin type pens or type wax or anything anything new that you guys want me to review let me know in the comments so I'm definitely gonna be looking for more live resonant stuff so if you guys can tell me what's new out there life resin what's good man tell me man I want to know oh yeah it's so weird usually I'm like going out usually it go out a lot for my blog so feels weird like this is probably like all just gonna be in my room like just chillin just in here on the computer cuz I like showing you guys different I don't know I want to switch it up and like go to different places so it's like a new view every time so I'm actually kind of glad I never just did in here all the time like make a little thing and just stay find a camera I don't know like I don't like it when people do like a green screen in the back and [ __ ] and just have a freakin big desk or table or whatever and then they just sit behind it and like there's really nothing but like some weed and then and then it just looks too clean to me like I just want to say you guys my real life got my computer's freaking I got best of both worlds guys we got a Mac and we got a PC you probably see the keyboard I'll buckle both but I like I edit more on the Mac because I know the stuff more like I know I movie more than I know Adobe Premiere or something like that I know that one more that I know I need to watch way more tutorials so that's probably one but probably gonna end it around your guys help everyone smoking right now guys even though I mean but it's just so it's just something about smoking here when you have nothing to do you can just chill sometimes I mean I don't smoke before I go anywhere I leave it I usually smoke when I get home so it's like it's just cool just waking from this but um make sure you like comment subscribe a minute a years like 12 minutes already long and I hope not try to keep my blog short for you guys tell me if you want anything and then you want to see anything you know anything within my means I'll do or I will plan on doing it we don't execute and get it so I'm just gonna chill probably watch something maybe hit up some people maybe drink up beer beers Bud Light plan boom peace out I [ __ ] what you've used made to this [ __ ] end guys [Music]", "HthmYTFVBtM": "hello youtubers well this is the final week of my first cannabis grow and I cut them all down for harvest Dileep them a little bit left some on there so that they'll slowly dehydrate he see that they had really nice colors like all the branches ended up

that Cola all the way up some nice call us every branch long it's pretty much the whole plant was just nothing but bud besides these colas I wish I could get better shots but I can't really pull him out of the tent coz I've had them in here since Sunday drying out so this is already two days into into drying and they've shrunk up quite a bit just in a couple of days when I first pulled them out they were super fatties and now look at them they're already drying up but I'm not complaining cuz they look lovely get a good underneath shot but there it is and I did not take a wet [Music] reading them how much they it weighed in I will do a dry a final just to let you know what these six plants actually produced but they look like they're gonna produce quite a bit though there's the buds are

out so this one is Larry Odie they came in this very nice little box and a nice container so check it out we'll open it up and give it a snow man it smells very strong with very nice crystally smell and very very strong smell check it out nice and it's like very like sticky and what I did I packed a chopped up a ball impact a bull a mango og and I put a nice glob on top of this nice pipe if I want to smoke this and do something a little different instead of just smoking a bong but whatever so I put a nice glob on top of here so let's light it up and see how good it tastes cuz it smells very nice so let's hope that it tastes as good as it smells very nice taste wonderful there's a very sweet strong legs strong sweet crystally phase - it makes my mouth water say I wanted to smoke this

what I'm saying y'all have a good day [Music] you", "Wd5pKceE4zQ": "welcome back to the garden everybody checking in uh three weeks from germination now you can see quite a big difference here between the four seedlings two in the front really taking off and two in the back kind of been dwarfed this front right one has definitely been the most vigorous it's got the biggest leaves let's do a nice job with the nodal spacing everything looks really healthy to me i'm not seeing any problems [Applause] so yeah that growth looks really healthy plant looks really happy in the environment so i think i'm doing everything right here this one over here pretty similar story nodes all look really good looks really healthy when we go to the back here i don't know what's up with this one the old growth is struggling the new growth looks funny it's starting to branch out and shoot nodes but they're weird i'm curious to see what happens with this guy and then the other dwarf looks like it's sorting out a bit that new growth looks a lot healthier it definitely is showing some issues but maybe it'll grow out of it [Applause] they are almost to the point where they could use a little water but i'm gonna give it a little more time i'm gonna wait till tomorrow where the lights are on so that's like almost another full day from now everything looks really good here right now so i'm just going to leave it be we'll give them water tomorrow pretty happy with the progress so far i think these front two are really gonna start to take off from here and i imagine the back two will will be a lot slower and more stagnant in their growth so i may not end up flowering them together i'm probably gonna pop a hyper fuel shortly and figure out what i'm going to do for uh flowering hopefully i can get something flowing within the next month would be nice we'll see i'll check in again with you guys in about a week", "NenG6ktqr3I": "hello youtubers so this is going to be the third week of flower where my first grow with La Push cake and as you can tell I've really opened up the canopy by just depot leading all the heavy leaves that were in there getting a little bunched up and wasn't breathing well so I cleaned it all up so all the light can really get on to the branches with the buds you can tell I don't know if you can see it getting the little buds everywhere little stars where so they're starting to flower up real nice get a lot of little hares up and down the brain [Music] so I know it looks really really skinny and nasty right now because I eat foliated a lot of leaves I wanted to do it into the second week so you know going on from here I'm probably not going to defoliate much anymore went underneath and clean them up real nice size of that stock nicely looking real good lollipop energy too much light coming through but and they're stretching real nice I had to pull the light up a little bit off of them because of the default eating I didn't want to stress about too much there you go there's the garden you are all looking wonderful I know it's kind of hard to see with the yellow yellow lighting too close to the branches in there left all the good branches with buds on them not gonna do any more defoliating because I've done plenty opened it up real nice I might even got a little carried away but they didn't seem to beat you stressed about it give it a couple days ago yep that's it alright guys until next week see again hopefully next time you get on you'll see some big fat buds coming up these branches and that is La Push king and the odor already is smelling so good and they haven't even really started budding so I can imagine that this is going to be a very potent plant alright have a good one", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be doing limited drops of those starting soon is that right yeah yeah that's a plan you know it's been a really popular option and so you know we definitely know that the consumers that are most interested in that are looking for those super premium you know product drops and that's what we're planning on doing um this isn't going to be like a widely available product for us unless it goes absolutely amazing which i think it will so we'll eventually start working work up to it yeah but um it's definitely some limited drop so please stay tuned for that in the near future so you guys are

little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in colorado so i believe perhaps the least expensive true 100 solvent-less vape on the market right now as of this filming in colorado so check them out if you're in colorado pyramid go on their website

"hello everybody this is going into week four flower for the La Push cake and I know that it's gonna be a little bit difficult to see with that yellow light and the little lines that are going through but they're really stretching I was getting up to the light there you get any closer you see nice little bud sites everywhere and this is the start of week four and I'm hoping that because we went through so much drama with this root problem early and in the grow that that doesn't cause too much problem with the size of the buds coming out at the end final yield there it is and as you can see it's got rice little nice stretch to it good light coming through there it is so there it is La Push came going he's a week four everything looks good leave colors a real nice rich look really nice no tip burn no bugs well there's a little problem with the root mats can't seem to get rid of them suckers I keep fighting with them anybody has any suggestions on that for route Nats and they're getting the bottom of the bucket and make it a mess please leave some advice below if you have any advice on how to get rid of those I've tried to diffuse organic spray for getting in I don't have any of them in my foliage they're all down in the buckets they don't get on the plants I don't have any mold or any you know [Music] mildew or or bugs on the plant itself just they just like to get down into my buckets and get down into the roots and I've flushed them and use different stuff I'm gonna try something else again this weekend but see how it goes that's going into week four looking good lots of bud sites on there hopefully we get a nice little yield out of it alright everybody have a good weekend", "nIgtSgQIFSU": "hello everybody so this is going to be week seven of my first cannabis row with hydroponics and the Strand that I'm growing is La Push cake so coming into week seven well actually we've already started week seven I decided to go and get a new light and it's a fills on two thousand and this is replacing my 1000 watt high-pressure sodium and so far I'm pretty impressed with this I had a friend come over with a light spectrum meter and look at the difference between the high-pressure sodium that I was using and then using the Bulls on one with the cobs in it 2001 and pretty much when we did the reading it was double of what my high-pressure sodium was putting out is what I think if I was reading that right which I was kind of shocked because it really didn't seem like it should but apparently it really does produce and the buds really loving it and they're starting to fatten up real nice so I believe this is a nine-week strain because I looked under a hundred and twenty times scope at the try cons and they're all still clear and none of them are starting to get any milkier and the hairs on the buds are still staying pretty clear white not a little bit of red hairs here and there they're not really that much but they really seemed to be bulking up now and I think if they still got a couple more weeks left then I think they're gonna bulk up a whole lot more and I've been using big bud and bud candy and the connoisseur line a and B and it seems to be working pretty well I think I got a little too over zealous with the nutrients and I've really been you know cleaning up the canopy I try not to get too much into it but as you can tell a lot of the growth in the center was starting to get a little heavy light wasn't getting down to the middle to lower buds so I kind of cleaned it up a little bit more you see maybe I can show you the difference with the light on and off the cob lights which are the little round lights here okay really make a difference it's it's insane when we did the test and we turn those off like this now you can really get to see the spread that that light produces over the over the whole canopy it stretches out the oil the whole old tent so it's pretty wild so it's getting all that plus when you turn on the cob boom how much that goes for a little light to light that up and you wouldn't believe what the output on this on this light is I'm not even gonna try to explain it because I'm just not educated enough on the light spectrum scales and how they're supposed to be but what we compared this light here to the high pressure sodium it was like night and day this thing was just kicking the high pressure sodium zas I was actually impressed because when I got that in the mail from Amazon I I seen that little tiny light and I was like oh my god there's no way this thing is going to produce what that that thousand watt high-pressure sodium was but it it really does it it really kicks ass so good job and no I have no affiliation with bills on hell I don't even know if I'm pronouncing their name right but you know hats off to you guys get a good light there and that's Amazon probably one of the Amazon's best deals it's $2.99 under 300 bucks shipped and delivered for free with prime so and for the output that this thing is putting out I mean it's kind of comparing to some of the ones that are up you know eight hundred thousand dollars and more I'm pretty impressed with that light and pretty impressed with the with the results also so here is week seven of my first cannabis grow with La Push cake loving this I wish you guys could see how frosty it is I know that red light kind of throws it off but it's it is just sugary beautiful so stay in stay in touch with the next couple of videos coming up I know it's really weird right there's my you know 50 to 55 percent humidity 70 to 80 degrees and here's where I like to keep it I have no bugs I have no mold I did have a problem with some of the root mites for a while there and they no longer bother me anymore I got the little sticky down there caught all the ones that were flying and then treated the water with its called mosquito book bites are bits excellent as soon as I use that a few days later started noticing a reduction in the amount of little flying pesky little shits that are eating my roots to almost zero I haven't seen any in the last few days and I did that to the end of last week so apparently mosquito bits is pretty awesome because I was using all kinds of other stuff to try to you know all-natural organic stuff to spray before I went into flour to try to get rid of the gnats and you know you've reduced them but it didn't really get completely rid of them but mosquito bits put in a little tea bag drop it in your reservoir let it soak for a little bit I let it soak for probably about six hours and then pulled it out really didn't think that was gonna be enough but apparently was no problem they're gone so there it is week seven of the LA cush cake and the buds are looking beautiful hope you liked the video and I'm gonna be getting wheat gate and week nine and the harvest and I'll give you my final yield when I'm done and I get it all all cut down I'm sure I probably could have produced a little fatter yield not being the amateur that I am with my first grow but I don't know you tell me what do you think for the first row is that pretty normal or is it looking good or is it behind put your put your answers below and in the description and let me know what you think subscribe so you can see the next couple of weeks before I end up harvesting and you get to watch the stages of the La Push cake grow for an amateur first grower that's right what's up loving the new light my temperatures are way down I'm not fighting temperatures anymore I don't have to run all the extra equipment in here I run the humidifier during its sleeping time you know the twelve off just to keep the humidity down at forty five in the tent while there while they're resting but other than that what a reduction in electricity it's awesome all right guys thank you for watching till next week sayonara", "82TTr5s40k0": "hey everybody so we're into week five now I'm a little bit

one here [Music] [Music] um that's nice smooth tape [Music] really clueless how much flavor it is it's gonna be a pure gas on this one we'll go with biscotti [Music] yeah that was the green top all right second down from guild it's not spread out both sides [Music] [Music] [Music] dude that one a little hotter so it's kind of hard to taste let me guess skywalker [Music] all right so that last two they took brett to show you what color it was that is the white sticker there's the next one up at number three [Music] hopefully it's not a hot hit like last one [Music] all right let's go for it [Music] i'm gonna go with venomogee on that one [Music] so i think the birdshit was the best but the one before it was a little hot so i couldn't tell this is better than one before all right here we go the next one this is the blue on the phone [Music] so uh they're all very similar i don't know why i'm getting a little cherry taste from that one i kind of got a little cherry taste from the first one though too so but i didn't pick that for the first one so i'll pick this one cherry jubilee for now [Music] one more to go [Music] final hint fifth one this one's like a little bit more on that saucy type of sugar [Music] [Music] oh last one i have is try fight cookies so i can see it being that i'm gonna put it at fourth for now i might take a hit of the one that's in fifth right now because i took a hot hit of it just to see how it does in the ranking but for now this one's going for it try fly cookies that was the pink sticker sometimes you can't see it with that light that was all guild extracts let's stay tuned for the results all right time for the results for the guild extracts blind taste turf challenge first we have skywalker og i said skywalker was white [Music] that is why i got that one correct one for one tri-fi cookies it's a trifle with the pink that is green so that one is wrong next we have venom og i said venom was yellow that was blue so that one is wrong cherry jubilee i said was blue i know that one's wrong because blue is right there that was pink which give us the last one which was the scottie butter which was the yellow i said it was the green one out to five correct it's really tough 20 the one that i got right was the one that i kind of took the hot hit on [Music] all right here's the rankings so first place tri-fi cookies place was venomogene third place was biscotti we have skywalker og and i was the only one that i guessed [Music] someone was the one that i took a little hot originally i said it was last but i re-hit it again and i liked it a little better than this one which was the cherry jubilee which came in last but not least these were all half [Music] and grams you have it thanks for tuning in i was skilled extracts

"CZr93zU17Xk": "things are looking really good right now so i wanted to get in here and do a quick video about four weeks from germination right now and i've done uh the first defoliation on these two ladies up front taking off you can see here at the nodes i've cut off the big fan leafs i'm not the ones at the top and they just look really really happy right now they're they're praying they're perky colors are all looking really good [Applause] but you see the dwarfs in the back they're still they're i don't know what's going on here they just they're growing weird [Applause] that top growth looks healthy but the lower stuff is all showing a lot of problems the actual stem itself is still really really small for four weeks in the nodes are tiny compared to its sisters it's it's not really doing anything and this one over here is pretty much the same story except more weird growth just very bizarre weird growth on this one i don't know what to make of it we'll keep them going but i think we're going to pop some new seeds and those will probably get get scrapped we at least got two nice la cushcake phenotypes here that will grow out and see what happens with those i think we're going to get some good stuff here the growth on these really reminds me a lot of the uh platinum push breaths early on big happy perky leaves vigorous growth nice color [Applause] so i'm kind of expecting some similar stuff that's nice branching going on in the back here [Applause] a little bit over on this one too so i think in a week we should see some nice branching going on and i expect them to start exploding from here so we'll see in about a week [Applause]", "Mo-0RNiK4Fw": "what's good everybody Sacramento Deborah your for exclusive care and today I'm reviewing the blueberry cheesecake by Ola I just walked into a Marie Callender's smells like vanilla berries and wine to me hmm Wow even sweeter on the flavor than it is in the smell definitely taste blueberries it definitely tastes a little bit of cheese it's got some floral hints a little bit of just a tiny bit of citrus I'm gonna take another hit of that stuff it's even better the second time around I can just go back and forward in time to relive that hit over and over again I would", "NT64bvsacG4": "got a midweek update for you here i've started to run into some issues all of a sudden in the past few days with uh one of the l.a kush cakes you can see the decoloration started as what looked like burn tips and that generally signifies too much nutrients but these have been in fox farm ocean forest and haven't gotten anything extra but water so taking that into consideration and then looking at the tops the light coloration seems to be more like a deficiency so i went ahead and upped it into five gallons i put them in the super soil i ran last round with the platinum cush press which did fantastic it's been sitting around for a long time not doing anything um i don't know if that's made it better or worse but we're gonna find out this other plant still looks pretty good it's it does have the burnt tips going on so the top looks a lot healthier though on this plant overall they look fairly happy i'm going to continue to monitor that situation and see what's going on here i'm probably going to take some clones off of these today or tomorrow just to preserve them in case they don't like this soil after it's been sitting for a while i'm going to go ahead and end the two uh l.a kush case that didn't really take they didn't really go anywhere the root system does not look all that developed either so as above so blow these things weren't doing much above or below the soil i went ahead and started three hyper fuel seeds to take their place this one has popped out in the soil a couple days ago but it's still got its uh shell on top and it seems to be having trouble popping that off hopefully by tomorrow it kicks it i still also have this weird one in the corner the growth on that it was very strange looks like its roots actually did a little bit better than the other one i don't know what the deal with these was maybe they didn't like the fox fire motion forest or maybe the seeds simply just weren't that great i'll check in again with you guys probably again over the weekend to see how these progress after the transplant i'm not sure what the deal is with these but this is how i've been starting plants and i haven't really had any that have given me any trouble just in the fox farms ocean forest so this is a new experience you definitely see the issues hopefully it's just a deficiency and the transplant does the trick but uh we'll check back in in a couple days and see how they progress", "yGMYWLX0spI": "hey what's going on guys and welcome back to hi bagel today we're talking about dab carts specifically dispensary grade carts so what's all the hype about this anyway what makes this car better than my TKO or dang baby not to burst your bubble those are fake carts and I'll do a video on fake carts soon this is a cart that I bought at a licensed dispensary here in Massachusetts this half grams co2 extract cart will run you roughly fifty dollars now you might be thinking why the hell would I pay fifty dollars for a half gram when I can go get a full gram for maybe $30 on the street let me tell you these carts are lab tested they only contain cannabis oil and natural terpenes this is a peer of Wax cart without any additives or cutting agents they have been tested for vitamin E acetate which if you don't know what that is already that's the main ingredient that's making people sick off the street carts it's a cutting agent so that dealers can sell less cannabis for greater profit but enough about that let's talk about this car is it really worth the $50 and in my opinion hell yes it is I know that when I'm smoking this car I'm only inhaling pure cannabis and natural terpenes nothing else that's gonna make me sick put holes in my lungs or affect my future health this strain is taste of rainbows it's got roughly about 82% THC and 0% CBD in it I hope you guys learned a little bit more from this video I know I was very short and it was to the point I hope you learned a little bit about fake cards real cards what the difference is between the two and I hope that you guys can appreciate what's put into making these cards real and making these cards clean and safe for you to consume I'll see you guys on the next video peace out you [Music]", "et_gEz6jqXM": "[Music] that people we meant to up to no respect for or g4g yonder

be careful if you are saying some of these some of this medicine for the first time and some of this stuff that's going from seungyun or further afield and is it a bit more refined if you will know that's a long word because a lot of stuff are really Wonderland is just as good in it really it's just a strength really in it coming out very high end a very strong big Bloody Mary people I think will kick your ass there is a reason for it right we are further ado let's crack on with fat blouse with you yes it's a good initial this family's a while and fat clouds absolutely cracking people coming out from California a la barba [ __ ] coming in your ears fat clouds distillate we've got to nap now this is absolutely beautiful stuff the fewer these come over on Griffin's back been there now this particular one again is Skywalker orgy now were Skywalker orgy is a cross between Skywalker now I did know this Apple skywalk orgy and Skywalker that's who smoked Skywalker orgy and Skywalker I thought they were same thing but they're not even real as so this is it gah gah gah walk orgy is a cross between Skywalker and OG Kush now Skywalker on its own which again new to meet it that's just like Skywalker on its own it's blueberry amazi Sharif saw or mazar-e-sharif out some people say so scout walk or Jade people now we've had a quite a few delta-t somewhere and it's absolutely spank your bottom each one of the strongest armor and one of the most terrific now I'm saying 97 percent fat clouds if you do if you do watch this there's no percentage of it but it's not few percent because it is very chirpy I'm not gonna allow the are very - you can see a bit of Kowloon this or it can't be hundred percent your honor me so that is not percentages fat level if you watch this and again fat clouds this is just a bit of a shout out awfully I'm coming over to California yeah we're nicolae ceausescu in November I'm off to all cook we're have a good session William you're not good smoke we I saw please get a shower on into us all that and that is know if you into it if you look for a good sesh that's if you do watch this your honor me I'll be absolutely honored if you do and there's no what you think about the review if you do watch it yeah that people here we go Satan to walk of it no look at me as you can see is absolutely crystal or the clear okay that's looking to bother mommy straight out of there look at that that's what we're talking people don't want me I'm behind that won't do we have to see not stunning so if you can see the clarity of it you can see the texture of it now this is distillate people don't be fooled by you know this isn't a wax of art this is a distillate I'm not sure I'm not going to into processes about they make distillate but I'm sure it's a fancy process I do not have a clue how we do it again this company is one of the few to morph on Instagram and stuff like that they also make the cartridges and things like that so there are a lot of lot of Nash Nash products coming out of this so look of it now this will be an interesting one for this because it says so now as I'm doing this I'm absolutely locked up I am that's why I've been a bit quiet and that's again 3,000 competition that's why I'm being a bit slacked in a bit lapse and a circle of leg it's just made with that but we'll get any on part with it yeah quiet there Nick what'd you do my favorites one after him some days you let me have this joke yeah and I've got a banging Elliot Turner so this is from oh yeah hey I've got a banging banging seen a modern visit one of the make all sides of it off erectus depression spasms or not wrong it don't say any ex actually I'm wrong if you offer a self and PTSD as well thought really good for them wow so walk early again I forgot the Debbie's out we got divergent Davis you know zooming there I'll try and saw your baton end it I mean you can see there look at it oh absolutely lovely lovely is so the look of it for distillate again I'm not the most little person on distillate it looks clear it looks nice to me yes well it's what well I think it looks fantastic it does I think it's fantastic how can you get any better than a clear looking pure smoothness to distill it it's NASA now this dance and everything in it really good color and the smell 10 what else do you think I'm not asking you give you yeah I mean what would you still ate a lot about someone got something listen discipline what is this is exactly what you want it so you've got some more there and you can see that slightly darker again very clear very nice look slightly darker and not stirred it up on that were not sure yeah I'm giving okay now would you that's good enough to spit on you to Austin it I'm giving it down now it is definitely good enough to spread on door start so look a bit yeah yeah consistency never consistent to you this is basically think Seward don't yeah it's only I'll end it there I mean can't even you don't ruin it don't do oh it just stops in its place really see food sheets like it is a real thick consistency in a real fix or penis to it well yeah so consistency so I can't imagine how you can have it any other way and maybe thinner maybe thick you although I do not know so my experience that's a slightly thinner consistency than the than that one in there you're not amazing nobody's alright Saddam in it Oh million turned out what I'm saying it's a better consistency than the other one I've got in there that already still yeah I think this is a better consistent it's easier - um I'm gonna mark it I'm not gonna give it a 10 no no because I've done enough distillate to Tamaki the tent I'll give it a 9 just in case and I'll keep all overs Danann until we found a better one yeah well you're not I mean yeah we do need a lord again we send anybody out there I want us to do any tests for them any reviews for them that's not good enough - good enough - so we're gonna give

"se-RVI7iZmo": "hey everybody welcome back to the garden we're on uh day 49 here with the la cush cake and day 28 with the hyper fuels and you might notice that the hyper fuel at least this one is looking a little bit naked compared to the last video here compared to its sister which still has all of its lower bud sites so what happened here was the hyper fuel number one uh phenotype permeate on me i was watering and i noticed uh down in the soil there was a spent male flower that had pushed out its pollen and fallen off the plant into the dirt so i started looking around and sure enough pretty much every lower blood site had male flowers growing between the the female flower and the stem so i just started pulling all of them off both the female and the male part and i removed the whole lower third and then i started looking at the middle of the plant and i noticed that a lot of the middle plant hit her meat as well not not as much as the lower which should pretty much all hurt me so i decided to remove the middle roughly third so i removed the lower and middle third so about about two-thirds of the plant almost i'd say and i just left the upper blood sites just the top by sides to the top of the nug and uh hopefully we can finish her and not have any more male flowers pop up i would prefer not to have to call this plant i'd like to get a harvest out of it um i have not been able to clone the phenotype number two so if i lose this plant i might and then the clones of it end up harming i might just uh end up losing that strain altogether at least until i pop new seeds of it because i do have some more beans um it's still looking good so looking happy the buds are really developing quite nicely for day 28 here i'm really happy with the progress that's super frosty the bud development looks really nice the calyx formation looks really nice on them so i think that when these things get mature they're gonna be some really beautiful flowers and the smell that got all over my hands and arms when i was pulling off the uh male flowers was really excellent it smelled super skunky and i just love that taking a look at these la cushcakes this one on the left here the number one phenotype is really putting on quite a nice fade i'm not sure how well that'll get picked up in the video but these leaves are starting to black out on here and that looks really awesome i'm really happy with the way these are turning out they smell absolutely fantastic it's a very very s very wedding cake like smell to them and then there is nothing wrong with that so this number one phenotype is the one that's really fading hard the leaves are blacking out not as deep of a fade on the number two phenotype but they are they are starting to fade the calyx formation on these buds is very very different between the number one phenotype but the smell is almost identical very very subtle differences between those two smells let's try to take a nice overhead see if we can see that fade a little bit and some of the inner flowers i hope the focus is going good for this i really should get a stool so i can hop up and get an overhead shot and actually see it so the the the number one phenotype the buds on it look like they're starting to get close to finishing up maybe they'll be done in a week on day 56 but we'll see i'm gonna start looking at them at about that point and thinking about when it's time to chop might push them somewhere between day 63 and 70. we'll see how we're we're looking and i may end up harvesting them at several times since i got the space to do it i might chop the number one phenotype first since both the buds and the leaves seem to be finishing a little bit faster that may have something to do with the fact that i accidentally put the number one in uh three gallon and the number two and a five gallon when i transplant them and since i'm growing in a living organic soil all my nutrients are in the soil so this plant might be starting to get a little bit spent earlier potentially just being in three gallons which is a little it's a little bit of a small pot size for doing living organic soil personally i i think it's okay i think uh the bigger pot size really benefits you more when you're in a no-till system than it does in living organic i till my soil between grows and re-amend it so it's pretty packed and pretty strong when i transplant into it so anyways thanks for checking in hit me up with a like and a subscribe if you guys haven't done that yet i appreciate it and we will check back in next week for a day 56 update on the la cushcakes and see where we're at see if i'm cutting them down or if we're going to push it a little bit farther see you guys", "kJxlW4DlifU": "hey everyone welcome back to the garden we're here on uh day eight of flower and we're just starting to get some signs of pistol formation here see if i can show you a little bit yeah you can kind of see it in there starting to shoot out we're seeing a big difference between the two phenotypes here the left is reaching quite a bit more than the one on the right which is really not not reaching a whole lot at all um i took a look at some vpd charts and realize that i'm keeping my room probably a little bit too humid for the fact that it's so cold in here uh typical temperature in here i think is ranging between 69 and 71 degrees under the lights and humidity's been around 50 percent according to the bpd chart i just looked at it should be closer to 40 percent and flower i think it's probably fine being at the uh the early stages of flower but i'm going to try and uh bring the temperatures up a little bit while bringing the humidities down a little bit and meet in the middle um i think they look pretty good overall this one on the right is some of its heavier leaves that are looking a little bit droopy i think things are drying out really fast down here they've been drinking a whole lot of water so i think i might just need to water more i've uh watered them pretty good today i got a little bit of water sitting down in the drainage trays so hopefully they start to it starts to absorb that water up and look a little bit perkier than it currently is looking i think it looks fine right now but i like it when the leaves are are more like that than that so we'll see what i can do the canopy looks pretty full from the top i did a little bit of defoliation earlier today and pulled off a lot of the uh the leaves on the underside i don't really know how much um holly popping i'm going to do in here because they're not very tall they uh the whole plant is probably about 18 inches so they're not very tall but i i think i should maybe clean them up a little bit more around uh the three-week mark especially the phenotype on the right here you can you can see the difference in the density of the canopy this this one we can kind of see through a little bit you can see the light penetrating a little bit better through this one but this one's a lot denser and you can see how little light penetrates down through this canopy so i should probably get in here and clean this one up a little bit more then it currently is i think that might help it get a little bit happier perkier overall so that's where we're at right now i i was liking the phenotype on the right a little bit better throughout veg but now that we're getting into flour i'm leaning a little bit more towards the phenotype on the left i'm liking the stretch a little bit better on that one there's a little bit more canopy penetration so i think this one on the right is just going to produce a lot of leafs and uh be a little bit more of a pain to trim up so that's where we're at right now thanks for checking in we'll probably be back in another week to give you an update on the progress going into week two i'm thinking that from this point forward the blood development should start to take off and that'll be exciting to see how these uh l.a kush cakes develop going into the middle stages of flowers so thanks again for watching see you guys next time", "hGoGCO5igko": "hey everybody welcome back to the garden today is uh day 63 for the la cushcake and i am going to be doing the first harvest on them tomorrow i'm letting the letting the soil really dry out before i do that i didn't water them today so it's starting to look dry by the time they wake up tomorrow they're going to be really dried out and i'm going to cut them somewhere depending depending on how ripe the colas look down the branch i'm gonna i'm gonna cut the ones that look ripe off and give the the lower buds another week maybe two weeks to go i've never done that before but i figure since we've got at least three weeks probably left on the hyper fuel that i don't want to really do the whole plant harvest and end up leaving this half of the light just unused so i figured i could go ahead and take the tops off and i can probably come down maybe to make a cut right about there maybe a little lower maybe i go down there because there's there's still quite a bit of bud down here that could start to develop a little bit more and get get a little bit bigger if it starts to get more light there's some really really tiny popcorn in there scraggly stuff that i really should have cleaned up earlier but didn't so maybe we can get a little bit more out of it but it's like this here looks all right but a lot of leaf would be nice if the the calyx is fattened up on it so we'll see how this works out the buds ended up pretty small on this i like kush cake but they look really nice they smell really nice so i'm expecting good things so this is the phenotype number one that i've been showing for the first few minutes here and then this over here is the number two phenom we both got a lot of really nice color to them i i kind of like the the look of the number one final a little bit more but these buds are definitely fatter on the number two they both smell really great this started to differentiate a little bit between the two of them i'd say this this number one pheno or number two phenom over here reminds me a lot of animal mints and then the number one fino you know reminds me it's it's kind of kind of like a funky wedding cake aside from the fact that the leaves really died off on that number one feather we got a pretty nice fade in here and now these hyper fuels they really come along they're looking quite nice i'm loving what i'm seeing i like what i smell too the buds have really picked up in size even the lower buds are looking pretty good um there's a lot less color to this number two phenom um the number one phenos has got got a lot more colors to it but they've got plenty of time i think they're on day 42 right now so you see the leaves are all looking funky and wavy i've seen this before i've done some research trying to figure out what is causing this and i've read a couple different things some people say that it's certain strange just do this i don't think that's the case some people say it could potentially be like a ph issue or an over watering issue i don't i i don't really think that either of those is the case my thought is this plant is the closest to [Music] the fan so i'm thinking that it's just a little bit agitated i've got the fan on full blast so it's blowing as hard as can be and if you look at the buds that are a little bit further away from the fan they don't seem to be quite as bothered so it doesn't seem to be a big deal bloods are looking really good so i don't know how much you can see here with all the light there seems to be quite a bit more color to this phenotype blood formation is really looking great this phenotype smells a little bit more like dosey doe and the other phenotype probably is a little bit more rocky fuel smelling to me if you guys know what those strains are like so this this was the one that was harming on me we removed all the lower bud sites so the smallest coal is on here are pretty big for day 42. i mean that's that's going to get quite a bit bigger before we finish out so here's some nice sizeable nuts for the lowers um so i'm thinking that it's it's probably a good idea in the future to just remove all that stuff from all these plants ahead of time just let the plant concentrate on building those nice upper bud sites just let it go down maybe a foot or so there's probably about two feet of growth on on that and most of this lower stuff is really just going to be a pain in the ass to trim so i'm going to try to avoid that moving forward so i'm i'm going to do that chop on the kush cake uh first thing when lights come on tomorrow and i will take a video to show you guys what the uh what they look like afterwards and i might just upload a short little video or i might just put that on the uh the next update before i take the whole plant down thanks for watching we'll see you guys next time", "u-illtMjqGI": "hey everyone welcome back to the garden i took a quick little video after i chopped the top off the la cushcakes last monday so i'm gonna uh clip that in here right now and let you guys see what they look like then hey everyone just checking back in with quick update i went ahead and chopped the tops off with the la cush cakes you can see there's still quite a bit of bud on these two plants but you can see some of the spots where there it wasn't really getting any light not a lot of color or development so it'd be interesting to see what these uh two plants do over the next week or so see how much more size we're able to get out of these remaining little popcorn buds that are on here some of these ones are still okay size that i didn't take off they were lower on the canopy but a lot of them most of them look kind of like this scraggly leafy and not a lot of color as you can see we got a big height discrepancy here i've already got these things stacked up but i'm gonna have to figure out something else i want to get the uh the canopy up a little bit higher it doesn't have to go quite up as high as the hybrid fuels are i think their tops are maybe the highest tops or maybe six inches from the light there so i probably want to get them up to here would be nice so we'll probably i have one more video maybe two with the la cushcakes in here before they finish up um and we probably got about three four weeks left with the hyper fuel so check back in again with you guys in about a week and see where we're at thanks for checking in have a good one so that was the l.a kush cakes right after i had chopped them last monday as you can see they're a little bit higher up now i stacked them higher they're taller than me at this point i haven't actually measured the final height on those hyper fuels yet but i i think they're probably up close to six feet tall in the back there i am trying to make the determination the decision of whether i'm gonna harvest the rest of these ellie kush cake tomorrow or give it another half week or whole week they're definitely putting on a little bit more size since since last week not a whole lot but a little bit the color is real nice i think last week there's those real bleach tops and that was these two here and you can see they're developing quite a bit of nice color in them they're definitely bigger than they were a week ago so they're putting out a little bit of size they're starting to have a little bit of ambers on them not a ton so i could probably push them a little bit longer and it's not going to hurt me because i'm i'm already drying up the tops so i'll have those ready to smoke in probably about a month the hyper fuels over here are looking really nice we're on day 49 with these yeah all the buds on here have some pretty nice size to them especially when you compare it with these la kush cakes which are very very leafy and the remaining tops are probably smaller than a lot of these popcorn nugs on the hyper fuels this is this is probably the lowest and most underdeveloped top on the planet here very frosty very nice looking and uh we haven't had any more issues with the harming on this plant since about uh two or three weeks ago i think at this point maybe it's just been about two that's probably the fattest top and then here's the the other phenotype a bit of a difference in the blood structure this one over here i was not able to root i tried to take some cuttings of it and read some clones but for whatever reason it just will not produce roots i tried a couple different methods i tried uh just putting in a cup of water i tried uh rooting it in a corner and i didn't have any success with either that started to pimple up but did not produce i still have a couple more seeds of the hyper fuel so i might i might regrow it out so anyways that's the end of week seven for the hyper fuels end of week 10 for the la cushcake appreciate you guys checking in and watching the video we'll probably give the hyper fuels two more weeks maybe i don't think they'll quite be ready at the end of week eight so i'll probably give them another week after that the la kush cakes will probably i'd be out of here the next time i take a video if um if if i do push them the next week i will take another video before i chop them but if i chop them at some point during this week i'm probably going to take take them down without recording another video because i don't think there's going to be too much change and let's think i let them go a whole nother week so next run i think i'm gonna be doing a rainbow chip and funky charms from exotic genetics so if you like what you saw here we'll do it again start to finish with those strains um thanks thanks for watching see you guys next week one more quick thing i wanted to show you guys was the tops that i cut off pretty small buds i've got uh like four bundled up bundles of uh cuttings from each of the plants hanging in here i like to dry trim i normally take off the fan leaves before i dry but this time i just left them on seeing if it makes a difference all right see you guys next week next time", "rTxy-ErpRvY": "hey everybody all right so we just past week 8 of the LA cush bro so we're going into the second wheat flour just put in the light last week I went with a mix of metal half pilot with high pressure sodium so it's actually a combination light with both middle high light and high pressure sodium and I'm gonna flip that probably at the end of the week to a thousand watt high pressure sodium just picked up all my nutrients for this and we've got big bud bud candy Cinci bloom with a and B and we'll get that in there and getting it started we've already got a little bit of pears coming in they're white hairs already already coming and that's throughout the garden we can get a look underneath here we've kind of been just going through and kind of cleaning it up a little bad here and they're taking away the underneath growth is slowly kind of just cleaning all that up that way that light can come you can see there's good light penetration and we did have a little bit of a mistake I was putting stuff through the straw and accidentally broke my main branch here coming in kind of sucked it was a nice nice full branch but everything is really starting to picked up just really starting to stretch got a nice nice little sea-green going on here so there it is going into the second week of flower or bloom on my first row everything is still looking fantastic colors on the leaves are good they look a little shiny because I've been I've had to spray them with a organic pesticide because I keep getting these damn rip root mites which I can't really seem to get rid of because I live right next to the river I mean my backyard is actually the the river so bugs around here or by the millions so we try to keep the tank closed as much as possible but I still need to get some equipment like the inline chiller so I can't really leave my tent closed all the way because my temperatures get too high 77 at a 59 percent humidity if I close it up in here it just gets cooking and then the water gets to I you're brought so unfortunately I can't do that but yeah there's the La Push cake can't wait to see the kind of buds this is going to produce and I'll give you a little shot of what I'm talking about here so you can't really see it right now it's too dark out but this is my backyard and I don't know if you could see it but that is the river and the highway across the way so that's why I get so many bugs because I'm literally like 100 feet or so from the river all right well and this is my little tent set up set up here in the corner about everything sitting back behind it for the reservoir and all that we've got to get a few more things got to hook up the vent so it runs through the hood now right now I kind of just use it to blow the plants around and keep the temperature down in here that's it all right guys there she is merci merci and the roots are just phenomenon in the buckets are just filled all the way to the bottom so I'm happy with that I'm happy with the appearance just kind of getting impatient I want to see some buds all right everybody thanks for watching and add your comments below if you have anything that you'd like to give me as far as hints on what I can do to increase yield you know if I been doing something incorrect but you guys see I don't mind if you guys make comments below please subscribe and keep on checking out the first cannabis bro of mine of La Push cake alright guys we'll see you later peace out", "n0KTbO60PYE": "well hello YouTube we are coming in to week six we'll actually started week six running a little late on the video but doing a quick update on La Push cake first cannabis bro so here we go and week six you tell everything lovely buzzer just fattening up so nice keeping my room temperature around 79 80 between forty-five to fifty percent humidity I had to raise my life because I don't know if you can see if at the top of the leaves started getting some curling signs of heat stress I guess I got a little jealous one of those bugs to fatten up real nice which they are they're looking lovely [Music] I need to get those glasses or those yellow light so you guys can get a nice clear shot of these I'm guessing you can see them so this is the beginning of week six and they're filling out real nice yes indeed I'm just I can't wait to see the end of this just to see how fat these stocks are gonna end up getting me because I could just tell just five five five five but all the way up all the way up and just very so hairy whole entire branch is just all hair very leave and see the vibe with all the hair that's surrounding it now I'm guessing that's a pretty good day more trichomes right all right well short but sweet this is week six I'll try to walk around the other side hold on a little bit of an adventure this way all right one second sorry about the wobbling all over the place trying to get my glasses back on oh boy hold it now love it okay there we go back in control here alright so from the other side little close-ups of the full garden looking nice La Push cake can't wait to taste yet so pretty okay everybody feel free to leave comments below let me know what you think about like how much hair is on these things crystals which they should change this name to Harry crazy-ass Harry I'll make a new string krazee-eyez Harry okay all right I'm done being silly there it is have a good evening week six la cush cake looking forward to the next two weeks a good one", "5igSGoDBrpg": "hi it's getting baked we die boy we have a lot to talk about today i have um good news liberty health sciences has new strains last week they had stash plant and today oh so excited that la cush cake this is brand new anyway i've never seen it at the liberty health sciences before so this was very exciting and um one thing they do whenever liberty has a brand new string is they go ahead and print out the lab analysis for you and they they give it to you in fact the the bud tender today we got to you know talking and everything and laughing and she actually forgot to stick this in my bag so alex ran out in the parking lot and handed it grabbed it you know handed it to me real quick so here take this so um i am really impressed with this it is a beautiful beautiful bud there's gorgeous red hairs in it it's a dark green and um this has um a huge bud in it it's mostly one bud and i've smoked um a bowl out of it but look at that baby it's so pretty isn't that gorgeous yes i i am super super happy with it and it reminds me the high reminds me and the taste of the o.g since amelia days back in the 70s when you're um i don't know it was just a really intense high and that's what this is i really love it and the flavor is very skunky and i don't know any other way to describe it so i i love it it's fabulous it really is now um as far as analysis the total cannabinoids are six 25.969 percent i'm gonna post this on my instagram getting baked with dye and on my facebook um so you can look at that uh i also it has the total thc which is 22.442 percent and they highlight that for you and then the um the cbd cbd is .049 percent so this is not a super strong cbd strain it's way more thc now what's interesting on the and of course it passed all of the water and pesticide and soil and all of that um tests past everything beautifully and i i read that very thoroughly and you should too and and one thing you should know is you can get a barcode reader and scan these little barcodes with it and then it'll take you to the website and then you just type in the product and you can see all of this information and you can screenshot it or or print it out so that's awesome but um this as far as the terpenes go what is really interesting to me is it has every a little bit of every single terpene that that was tested every single one it's got a little bit it's mostly stronger in the um borinol the b-o-r-n-e-o-l i think i pronounced it right borino and the camphor um terpenes i'm not i don't know much about bore and all but i know that camphor is very very healing for me especially for me and while i'm on that subject i've seen a lot of comments uh in these cannabis support groups and i had one comment where somebody was bold type typing angry in a comment going don't tell people with anxiety to use sativas well okay i would never do that i personally love even though i have anxiety and ptsd and situational depression and i have it really bad i've generalized anxiety disorder which means everything i'm anxious about everything all the time um but i'm also i guess you could say kind of high strung like i have a lot of energy and i like to do and think and create and things so um i love a good sativa for the daytime i do i also love a good hybrid because i have anxiety so that's nice nighttime i need to wind down or if i'm feeling particularly depressed or anxious a good indica is really the best thing most patients report better results with indicas they they're more calming they're more euphoric um sativas are more energetic and get you going and that can give people with anxiety a lot more anxiety so in fact it's my opinion that people that get paranoid on uh cannabis might be smoking a sativa and they might have anxiety and might not even know it but the sativa might be causing them anxiety so i don't know that's just my opinion but what i'd like to say is i am not a cannabis doctor and i'm not advising anybody to use anything what i am trying to do is i'm trying to let you know about the different strains that are out there that i've tried and what i'd like to try and um different ways to cook with it make edibles and to smoke it and enjoy it and concentrates and things of that nature vapes review them let you know how i like them so you can make an educated choice and decision i watch youtube videos and i read all the reviews online and um at the dispensaries from the customers and at the support groups because i want to know before i buy it i i don't want to buy something and be super disappointed you know when i could have just read a whole bunch of comments and found out so um for that reason that that's what i'm doing and if it helps me with something with my fibromyalgia or something like that it might help you you can try it if not as um i saw a doctor say on uh doc mj recently on an interview if something doesn't work for you then that's your cannabinoid system it that doesn't work for your system try something else simple as that simple as that and let's just don't go around calling people's opinions trash or arguing or saying that the herb is trash or you know what or don't do that it's all lab third party tested that what is third party tested mean it means that they test it in their labs and a whole another lab is going to test it that's what that means a lab that has zero uh opinion about whether it's good or not they're just gonna tell you straight up scientists this is scientists doing their job so anyway love this this is amazing and i showed you the la kush cake and you really need to try it let me hit this right now i'm smoking a little bit of super glue haze which i have reviewed before um they've had it before they don't have it all the time and it sells out so fast so fast so if you see it online at night reserve it and go get it the next day now um let's talk about the stash plant i got this last week now this is a little bit lower uh thc this batch it's um just under 14. it's like 13.9 but it is super healing and it has a very euphoric type high it's indica dominant so it really helped me personally with my um depression and i i was really having some serious depression this last week like like bad like really really bad and my depression is not like i guess every type of depression it's situational so if a certain trigger or a situation happens it can get me really down i'll get in my head and start thinking about everything and just everything from my whole past and it gets really dark and so when i got this stash plant i was actually in a pretty dark place and it snapped me right out of it i i don't know what to tell you it's a hybrid but it seems to be very much more indica dominant now the sativas are lighter green and indicas are darker so and this is a darker green it's it's pretty it's got some white hairs in it red a lot of red hairs in my opinion for me red orange and purple hairs are very very very healing and if you ever get a bud that's very frosty like it looks like it's been out in the snow oh so healing love those um sunshine cannabis has a strain i have not tried it yet but i've seen the pictures i it might be white white sunshine or white anyway it's very frosty looking very frosty um check out uh the sunshine cannabis instagram and facebook pages and um eli sunshine and all of them at chris sunshine bob sunshine they've got some really great pictures um this is super a5 now you all know super a5 is my super power um it is very energizing and but it does keep you calm and focused i call this my um steady as she goes herb it just you you just want to get things done and you feel better and you're happy and upbeat so it's energetic and it is it's a hybrid but it's it's a little bit lighter um in color and i don't know but i think it's more sativa dominant i need to go back and i need to scan this batch right here and and look at it and see it dispatch actually i don't know some of these buds are pretty dark that might be more indica might be a little more in i'm gonna have to um i'll barcode you have to download a barcode scan app and i'll do that and scan that and see and i'll get back to you guys on that that's that's pretty interesting it might be more indica in that batch um this is the super glue haze i love it i really do now you all know that i love the forbidden lemon haze i didn't get it this time because it was really low thc it was like eight or nine percent and that's like not gonna do anything for me in the popcorn so that no i took a big big old pass on that but the um this is oh the super 85 is almost 17 it's 16.9 this is 16.895 or something like that um excuse me and it is um also a hybrid and but it it does look lighter oh yeah definitely much lighter you can tell and it's fluffier it's lighter uh in in weight actually there's a whole lot looks like there's a lot more in here it's the exact same weight and yes i do weigh mine yes i do i weigh the container i take the herb out i weigh the container put the herb back in weigh it do the math and that's how i know if i and i always come out a little bit over every time every time so anyway this is the um super glue haze and it's really good it has a it has a very nice very nice flavor i i really enjoy it so um you should definitely try it but like i said it goes fast and i'm gonna give you a little secret uh not every friday is a flower friday not every friday are they gonna have flower at every dispensary i've noticed lately during this pandemic in the last few months that a lot of dispensaries um are getting their shipments in not just on thursday nights but they're getting them in instead of thursday nights they're getting them in on wednesday nights and they get this after hours after the stores close and so you have to go on the websites kind of stalk their websites all of them every dispensary and if you're not signed up for notifications and all of that you for every dispensary for their sales and discounts you need to do that um but you just stalk their websites and um for a lot of websites you can look at iheartjane columbiacare is on there liberty health sciences muv um there's another one i think fluent might be on i heard jane anyway there's a there's a several um but check them all out and then on wednesday night you'll notice they'll get in like one or two strains and it will be a very limited supply so you need to snatch that up right then reserve it and go pick it up the next day on thursday not friday and yes it usually is discounted just like they do on friday so that's a little secret the other secret is if they don't have flour on friday and sometimes when they do they will almost always get a shipment in sunday night after they close and you can go and reserve that sunday at around 7 p.m or 8 p.m and then pick that up on monday and it's usually discounted which is what i did last night and i i was i they didn't even have the la kush cake on there at all they had super uh glue haze they had the um super a5 and they had forbidden lemon glue and i just reserved you know a couple of each and then when i got there i saw the forbidden lemon glue was too low of a thc for me so i switched it and they have no problem doing that yes this was more expensive because it's brand new and they just came out with it the price will drop and they will have popcorn and i suspect they'll come up with some shake too at some point if you're watching this liberty health sciences um yeah i'd like to see the la cushcake in shake and in popcorn soon i'd also like to see it in concentrate please anyway it's fabulous it really is so this has been getting baked with dye and i just wanted to get high with you guys and let you know about this beautiful beautiful weed run quick hurry and go get you some la cushcake if they have any left um it's pretty and it's beautiful and it tastes so good and you will be high and i mean come on it's like 20 22 23 22 and a half percent thc it's fabulous it's fabulous this getting vape would die stay tuned in high let's get back together namaste", "rnFqAYgO2YI": "[Music] what up youtube it's your boy 3.0 and i'm back with another one so god i feel so the camera feels different anyways so last week i introduced you to a new company called honeyleaf for thanksgiving but i still haven't uploaded the video probably by the time you i don't know we'll see maybe you'll you'll see the video by the time i uploaded this but i tried it i wasn't satisfied it was okay love the high but the taste wasn't there so i went back and i got another one the first one i got was northern lights and i forgot to mention that but that was northern lights but it was by this this company bam honey leaf this company supposedly is made by steezy who knows anyways let's try this out we're gonna get a couple shots and we're gonna see what it's all about [Music] all right so i took different shots of different lighting settings with my light from my camera and without it i think without it looks better if you didn't notice i changed my bulbs these are led now there's not the yellow nasty ugly one so it looks better and i also have my little light facing me so it's the quality or at least the lighting should be a little better i hope you guys like that then actually try to do something about the lighting anyways let's crack it wow oh get out of here boom let's get into it baby i can't wait till i buy stizzy pods until then let me try these okay well smells similar oof i don't know about this if you see that look at the top it's like golding on the bottom and like brown and the top it's usually not a good sign let's see if this is the last time i buy this car i mean let's talk a little bit about it before i go all up into it so this is honey leaf right it's in hybrid and this is original glue it's a hybrid it's original glue um it's 461.89 milligrams as mentioned makes it 92.38 percent total thc 100 1.66 milligrams total cbd kind of high uh manufacturing date five twenty eight twenty uh packaging date five twenty eight twenty um i mean looks semi legit i mean i don't know what else you could want but let's let's stop talking about it and let's get it so this one well the first one i got i had the same problem it was like brown on top but it kind of went away as i used it but that's because i filter it through here because i didn't like the taste but hopefully the taste is better on this one i'm a little i'm a little worried dude i'm a little worried am i gonna lie i kind of wanted to get a sativa to make sure that i got something good but i got i got this because it was higher thc i'm always going to go with the higher thc even if it does if you know even if whatever but we'll see it's in there let me warm it up a little one two it's warming up warm it up for a couple cycles so you can see it's warming up how you don't think i'm lying to you oh interesting okay that was just the warm-up and it didn't taste bad tasted better than the other one right off the back the other one tasted like dirty socks that's all i can really compare it to some nasty ass socks anyways this one tastes a little bit more like chirping i can actually taste the like a great taste which is weird it's supposed to be a glue original glue interesting so i'm going to go ahead and give it an actual hit this time and not it's not a warm up head and then we'll we'll see how it hits me and i'll read it from there oh my i might have it a little high all right so it doesn't have a bad taste it tastes like terp like they put in terpenes into it i'm trying to take a think of the name of the terpene but i'm drawing a blank but it does taste almost like a forbidden fruit like a purp herb like a like a grape like a burp grape type of taste so i do dig that which is weird i might hit it let's see what that's like but hold on let me take a low temp one because i took some high ones it was on high green is 2.7 volts yellow is 3.2 volts and i believe red is 4.2 volts so i got everything every couple a little bump up on every setting um i like the 2.7 it's always it's amazing it gives you the best taste the best everything on every cart and it doesn't burn your carts if you if you if you you know if you have started on the highest you might have a chance of burning out your cart because it just i don't know carts are crap sometimes all right let's get to it i'm gonna rate it i'm not high because i i already smoked today i'm not lit like super lit but i can feel it in the back of my head it's probably going to creep up on me after i i finished the video um taste it's there like i said it's got a purple taste it tastes purpley so imagine some granddaddy perv some or some some concentrates on some perps you know that some perks you get that that grapey taste that uh those nodes of grape um it's smooth i i can't i can't hate on it the darkness scared me the darkness on top scared me to be honest with you i was like oh no no that's usually that's a bad sign of like a burnt wick or a burnt um ceramic thing wake or whatever whatever it usually means it's birds charred and charring goes into and it turns it darker um well that being said it's not tastes great i'm gonna have no problems with it i have a feeling it's gonna taste even better as it blends itself in because it doesn't look fully blended in once it mixes itself well in with the warmth of it or moving around i think it'll get a little bit better who knows now let's get to the rating the taste is there it doesn't taste nasty so i'm gonna i'm gonna get it's not the best taste though but it is it is it is it is tasty so i am getting uh a taste of certain flavors it's not a hundred percent a full profile so maybe three four maybe five types of terpenes in there that i could taste and not too many you know like a full spectrum where you could taste a full profile of them um the high i'm feeling it now now that i've taken several ribs and everything it's i feel it now um i'm a little lit i'm a little lit so price always bro cheap these were 12 13 bucks i believe for the for the half gram i don't remember i paid yeah 12 bucks [Music] cool i played 12 bucks so i'm not bad at all man um definitely going to try another one next one is is a sativa that's the one that's was gonna get but i decided against it because this one had a higher thc content and i need to stay lit so i went for that the other one was 88 and i forgot what it was sour something i don't i don't remember some cool sardis or something i don't remember or super silver hey there's two different ones but i'll try that one next time and i hope you guys like them anyways let me rate this compared to the first one compared to other words i mean compared to papa's herbs and all that stuff i was i was thinking they were on the papa's herb level because of this one i was like maybe they're on that level maybe they're not trying to get too high but this one kind of kind of like i'm like okay they are on that level maybe a little bit more let's try some more let's see what we can do i'll do one of each so the first one was uh indica this is gonna be a hybrid and the next one i'll do will be a sativa just like the papa serves one of each um and i usually do like six videos of each so even if you see me doing good or too bad there's probably good reviews that i haven't posted if they're of that brand so don't always take it at a hundred percent face value always go do your own research try sometimes it's hit and miss god i hate that little thing on my hair i feel like those girls back in the 90s i used to do that with the hair all right anyways let me give this one a 8 because it's there it's what i was looking for it's what i thought the first one was going to be especially since she mentioned it was daisy quality so i'm gonna give it an eight i hope you guys check it out like comment subscribe watch my videos tell me what you think tell me if you like the quality of the lights does it make a difference i think it does it looks way better it doesn't look so yellowy in the back and i like that get some better quality videos out um go check it out man honey leaf cannabis oil and if you read in the back in the back it says cannabis oil distillate terpenes so it's something worth trying for 15 bucks um i don't know if you get it everywhere i don't know if this company's available but they're available in my local dispensary here in the valley the tulane valley um so if you live around here go check them out tell me what you think comment subscribe like guys you know what it is until next time it's your boy dirty 3.0 that's an eight face [Music] [Applause] you", "mvIU1b8V-qI": "hey everyone it's been about a week i think since we've done an update as you can see things are looking quite a bit better than they were the last time i checked in with you guys some of these uh branches are looking pretty good here the green the color is coming back the way it's supposed to be plants are praying they're pretty happy overall um some of the older growth that's grown out is still showing uh some yellowing near the edges but i think as that gets older and i start plucking those leaves off and the new ones grow out it'll look better and better and better over time so i think these are going to be just fine i guess the we won't know for sure until we flower them and see how they finish up but i'm feeling pretty good about them the growth is getting somewhat back to its normal bigger some of the top nodes are the the ones that don't look the best they have some some smaller growth so whatever the toxins from the fumes may be more heavily concentrated in the upper part of the plant and taking a little bit longer to work out of there like you see this this one that's growing from higher on the plant than this this branch looks a little bit worse than some of the lower growth [Applause] two of the uh three hydrofuels look like they're doing all right this one here however hasn't grown in several weeks the stem is still green but with no nodes i don't think she's gonna do anything so i think we're gonna lose that one and just be down to the four here i'm gonna end up having to paint in here again so i'm gonna have to find a temporary home somewhere else for the plants hopefully that doesn't lead to any additional stress but i definitely don't want to leave him in here while i paint again i decided that i'm going to end up painting the ceiling i've got dust falling down from the rafters and i was thinking about a couple different options to seal that up as you can see the i've got exposed sub floorboards and as i walk around the house in the house shakes i've got dust falling down from there so if i decide to go outside the tent which i'm going to do for the flower that would be devastating for the crop so i've got to deal with that before i can flower anything down here and the solution is going to be to uh cover all of the spaces all the gaps with wood and then paint everything which is going to be pretty labor intensive but when it's all done the room will be pretty sealed up and i won't have dust falling down from the ceiling anymore and i shouldn't have any long-term problems with that solution i was originally thinking about putting plastic up but i had some people say that i could have moisture get trapped between the plastic and the wood and end up rotting and molding out my wood so don't want that to happen so we're going to do the the other solution to cover all the gaps and then paint everything up seal it up that's probably going to take me a couple weeks before i can get that ready and then hopefully by then these ladies will be pretty healthy and happy and ready to go in the flour it'll just be the fewest number of plants that i've ever flowered before just these two so it'll be fun i get to focus on the two plants here hopefully they can get a little bit bigger for me i want to get something flowering sooner rather than later i'm starting to uh run low on my stash not low low but low to the point that i think i'm going to be pretty low by the time i finish up with these so i want to get them going soon so that's about it for now everything else seems to be going pretty well they seem to be pretty happy in the soil i've tested my soil and it seems to be a little bit on the acidic side [Applause] but it doesn't seem to be causing any issues because they're bouncing right out of the uh damage that they had from the paint fumes and returning to normal slowly but surely thanks for watching everybody if you haven't uh subscribed consider doing that i'll continue bringing you guys updates on the progress these plants here and after we finish that hopefully uh lots of future grows to come take care everybody", "oeICv3RkhIc": "hello everybody I'm just catching everybody up on week seven of my first hydroponic cannabis grow with the strain push cake and so this is week seven I've been doing a lot of training with the plants then bending them down and getting them you know and throughout the straw to you know kind of get all nicely pushed out and keep them all even as you can tell by the color and the look of the plants are doing really good they're healthy got a little tiny bit of tip burn this plant over here but I mean if that's my only problem then fantastic so yeah that's that's it kind of just a quick little ketchup on my first bra oh I can show you you know I I had to get back with the root system I've been fighting these little pesky root mites that want to just keep rubbing on my roots as much as I hate them but I use a natural pesticide just like Somerset oils let me see if I can get this open with one hand but yeah I just got done spraying so it's a little bubbly but yeah that's that's the roots they're doing good and the stocks picking up now that's week seven of my first grow with the sorry about my hand with the strand push cake la push gate that's it there you go alright guys until next week hopefully we'll have a little more growth this week and after this week I'm going to go ahead and flip it over into flour and change the light start going 12 on 12 off and flour in these babies okay everybody make any comments below if you've noticed anything in my grow that could use improvement or if you'd like to give me any advice on hydroponic grow and growing please do so below thanks", "BM9ZiyoWM0s": "[Music] I'll start the [ __ ] bag alright guys so I'm not actually gonna make the video right now because I have some [ __ ] to do but I just wanted to cut it open for you guys you guys cuz you like the unsealing part of it since I haven't done that in a minute I've been opening up all packages before I get to film and I got some uh I'm gonna show you guys everything you just have to wait but I got some uh some wax and I already ripped it up in this video you know so like this quick bubble test for you guys alright so that's basically it I want to cut that [ __ ] over figure Hydra quit I'm not going to go into detail but anything you want to cut that open real quick and next to either this will be the first clip I'll put this in between but either way back to the original video and just the case I lose it or see you later how are you have it right here with me right now so I might as well film this real quick the a leakage cartridge actually ended up coming out to 34 dollars not 37 and that wax how\u00eds is $55 the accident accidentally charged me 55 instead of 24 I don't know how I'll probably cuz the name mixed up but yeah so I show you guys that all right man today we're going to continue the LA cush cartridge review video unboxing thoughts with stone know there's literally couple hits list this is a Tuesday now what is Bradley Tuesday it's like poker him right now that video that he has just saw right now when I was shouldn't you guys cut open the baggage ship that was [ __ ] Friday so three days later in this it's almost gone and this honestly is not even like that it goes by quick it's just Friday I was kicking at my homies she got out of hand got a little faded and I just kept passing the pattern man kept passing the pan like a god they're good but uh I didn't get to chose like the video you know just to show you guys a little cut all I don't get me smoking in and getting the full experience all I did was help the video so you know don't matter so this is how all your boxes are going to be looking like the only thing hasn't come different in every box is gonna be this sticker or just gonna be according to strain this one's called jackpot so as you know so it has the slot machine on there and all the information in terms of THC percentage CBD manufactured date and all that Cindy found right here on the side this one's containing I think this one of the hardest fitting sativas it's containing 79 percent THC and 7.2 million Oh Lee Shin Semin point 2 milligrams of CBD that's a lot for a [ __ ] card to be honest you the side view and then on top she said I like Kurdish from the bottom 1000 milligram for the 1 gram cart and then the back has all the [ __ ] all the regular has all the regular warnings issue like that and to actually open the package its employee just open it at the top and you're gonna have your little Lakers bag right here and they're all gonna come sealed me on the top so you gotta cut it with scissors I think that's like the old grade now I even think it like rip it open with your hands hard so make sure that when you go to cop this cart and you want to smoke it you get need to have a pair of scissors on you and in terms of taste I've only had two la Cruz cartridges this won the jackpot which is Deva and the black gelato which I think was the indica or hybrid indica and in terms of taste this should taste way better but in terms of how high gets you or like the way he hits I would definitely definitely go to black Salado I mean yeah she was like a woman hit your query right this one you know I could take my complete not even to be here it's actually kind of hard to see but the agree with this elderly curse would definitely go on my top 5 cartridges although I wouldn't put this man I would put this above select for sure because I feel like that I'm like I really really really really extreme potent wax taste will select and that's one thing I don't like the bottom with these it's like a nice even Terpening flavor and wax you know and honestly like I said to this I got this what is today eight I think today is the 28th 12 I'm on my back today's a 27th August 27th 12 a.m. and I had about this August 23rd at 1:09 p.m. so that night I had to split it with like 4 different heads you know so we're taking this [ __ ] to the dome in the last two equipment and we're some heavy started you know but you know there's gonna last you a minute there's relax me this because know and interpret looks from all the cars ever used so far my top three would have to be Corolla LE push and vitamin I thought what I really like about this one is that it's white so it looks very like high and you know it looks more like clean like you could tell once when you see a white tip in terms of the jackpot strain itself your sativa liver I would definitely go with this strain because just two three hits of this will really get you up there man but if you take a hit round when you get up from bed bro you're gonna be up high that black the lot on I didn't get treating you that was before I was actually even making videos but man I should have nice long that she was in the good this has really high THC content so sativa gives you like anxiety I ought to be really careful with the dosage that you take from this because what's the team goes to like straight heart sativa sometimes I find to give me like a heartbeat or like going anxious but with this you know I take rips not to rip and oh cool but if you go just a little bit so you get really anxious off the teeth like to be very careful with this I just take people know they're hybrids just to be safe you know so now the only thing really left to do is hit the pen give you got some clouds give you guys some ghosts and give you guys some more review of the flavor itself also another thing to know guys that and notice with this cartridge and the other cartridge that I got a couple months ago is that when you leave them sitting down I'm not sure if it's because I leave it like sitting like this but I find when you you know set them down for a bit and you go back to hit it clogs up a lot and I hate that round this leg does that to men and you know how it has appeared tip after and I finally done is just a whole bunch of whacks at the tip I just gone to waste so I hate one cartridge claw girl that's something that Lucas really needs to fix because isn't just happening with the first one it also happened with this one so I know that [Music] [Music] eyes are Agrabah [Music] you gotta see just after those hits oh my god yeah my digital bling crop this year huh I'm gonna do it for you guys but I'm live pretty [ __ ] high just a little she hits does like what for his so yeah man shit's intensity he has loves TV I'm [ __ ] recommend [ __ ] but if what I said scare you guys like if you think you can handle just try it you know it's not that bad and it's a cartridge you know you can control gates I have not to get blink on this party but I'm gonna take his big brother listening I gave you got his that blinker on reg ascending on the rock garden you guys saw how that went so here we go guys [ __ ] that licorice blinker it's on the low setting bucket Jack pasta team I kind of this award-winning cut up [ __ ] strange he would go and this is a long time on man she's like 12 seconds in st. Anne's day [Music] I haven't seen to shave every what this is crazy road look at that [ __ ] from the fine video these five thousand bro this is five thousand I said father on you whoa dude looked at

phone exited on the camera so uh I'm where do the blinker real quick as you can see it was kind of filled up about the video new kind of new stuff I got this check for that plane and you guys get distracted with everybody so plane it was like gas-powered it really worked just crazy badass thinking this [ __ ] did that bear goodbye last night will be this shirt man this series not isn't on the website yet but I should involve teefin sellout who knows maybe you don't mean it they do these ready hey maybe it's gonna tell people maybe you're just a [ __ ] Savage yeah let's see guys I really want to start going up a little bit you know that look today and I don't really have that music every year so I guess I've been a good way to get subscribers but let's take the step by step actually got me high not gonna come you know was the right I recommend this [ __ ] [ __ ] idea let's go with the turn like a tiny house I'm uh I'm officially beginning that [ __ ] the Ellie curse just that doesn't be for the video man we found some money we leave that plane we'd have TVs and looting in the back what do you want [Music]", "w0lX0RJCQ7o": "it's been almost a week since my last video these front two are growing pretty nicely as you can see here this one's really performing well nice internal space in there so i think i got the light in a good good spot for it i'm really really liking the way the leaves look on this one though they're looking beautiful healthy happy say this one pretty much the same the runts look like they're working through some something they don't look quite as healthy as pretty but they look fine they look like they'll be just fine so hopefully in the next week or so we'll start to see them shoot up i'm currently going in in a tiny little tent i'm working on building out a room i'm using uh my mars hydro led light i think it's the ts 600 model i got it rigged up about halfway in the tent i'd say that's probably like two and a half three feet above the canopy right there just about to give them some water here so i like to do just a nice gentle hand watering i don't give them a ton of water now while they're young they're not drinking a whole lot i just like to get the top layer nice and wet and then i like to lift the pot feel how heavy it is so i can compare the difference when it dries out and i basically gauge my watering on the weight of the pots as opposed to looking at the soil or feeling the soil or anything like that that works best for me i like to let them dry out pretty good in between each watering make them want it and that seems to work pretty well they sometimes have a bit of an adverse reaction when they first get water but it doesn't seem to last too long with most plants then they bounce back up and get pretty perky and happy so i'm happy with the way we're looking right now we'll check in again in about a week or so", "5m_Q461PXxo": "you tube guys whoa all right last second man I wasn't even gonna make a video

review man and this has been a long waited like I swear how long has it been since like someone has asked for this video it's been a long time dude like to be honest it's been a long time like I think when I first started my youtube channel people were started and we're asking for this cartridge at that time so it's been almost a year since I have made a in my youtube channel I think it's been a year I'm not even too sure if but yeah man we're gonna get started Los Angeles kushman hometown man if you guys don't know I'm from Los Angeles man like straight out of the hood Inglewood [ __ ] like that and then I was raised up until I was there like 4 4 or 5 and I moved to another city and then we got raised up there but I'm originally from LA man I gotta send love to my hometown city bro so today guys the flavor in particular wouldn't be trying to is strawberry blondie and this was I try to do as much research as possible or try see what cartridge was the best one that they had and from from what I saw people were saying that the strawberry blondie was out of this world so this is brand new I haven't even tested it I literally got it probably five to ten minutes ago so we're just gonna do a first [ __ ] like hands on so let's see what's up so when you get it this is a packaging it comes in a little blue box and on the side right here imma show you guys all of this right now in a bit so it comes in a little wipe pouch it says Los Angeles cush on it and then we might have to take some photos of this [ __ ] or something los angeles cush and then this is a lot of the box like I said and then I'm gonna give you guys a little up close there let's see manufactured in La Vie that vat of it on 128 19 which is January packaged on two 13 19 and expires 128 21 so total THC 7785 let's see CBD 1.60 total terpene concentrate alright guys and this right here is a little close-up of the oil it doesn't really look like a full gram to be honest I mean these cartridges might be a little bit bigger than others but it doesn't really look like they give you a full gram they definitely didn't hit this because it was still inside the the sealed packaging so I wish I had a scale to weigh this out and things like that but I'm gonna take it into consideration and just hope that la cush really is giving you one gram but it looks very very clear kind of reminds me of the raw garden it's a very very nice video so now that you guys can see how clear that oil is it's pretty honestly this has to be some of the clearest distillate I've seen yet and not come like I said in the last of a not compared to raw garden dude raw garden and refined live resin is a whole different thing so this is by far one of the clearest I've ever seen so alright and I really like the packaging so far the white tape the whole sea salt thing is very very nice and I'm gonna try it on the rock garden battery first because it looks pretty nice man it looks like it fits very very nice like it's just one long white stick so we're gonna be taking like I said this is the first impression so I'm really really stoked about this and like even though they're a hometown brand I've never even considered trying them just because I was like LA cuz you know it's probably over hi brand because if they're just local you know locals always hype up their their local [ __ ] supporters things like that so cheers guys we're gonna be taking the hits off of this right now just gotta get straight into the video man I feel like I'm rambling too much so I gotta get straight into the video so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over you guys know the deal man and cheers boys os definitely that is delightful dude this thing has me coughing like crazy so right off the bat off of the first hit it wasn't really too much of a hit but I got a very very strong strawberry not like it doesn't taste artificial at all but definitely doesn't taste natural or it does taste natural but then again like I'm trying to figure a way to explain this but like it's like how strawberry smell is what I'm tasting you know so that's kind of that's kind of different but we're gonna take another rip and see what's up so yeah definitely getting this thing is good all right so now that I that second hit was a little bit more artificial than it was naturally it tasted more kind of like strawberry strawberry Fanta it has like a really really strong strawberry fan to taste to it in my personal opinion whoo but the high is very nice dude for two hits that I just took I'm already getting a head change I'm feeling my eyes getting a little bit low this is an indica dominant strain so I'm gonna and like plus me working ten hours today there's no why no like plus Eddings indica is like go to sleep dude and so that was the rock garden battery we're gonna be trying it on the slim twist so get that on there whoo airflow is nice bro so we're gonna start this off at three point three and then see see what's up with it so if you guys are smoking along with me let me know what you guys are smoking in on in the comments below and if you guys are enjoying the video so far man just hit that sub hit that sub button and let your homies know to to hit that sub button also so cheers yes Wow dude like this is definitely this is very very enjoyable like even though it doesn't taste like naturally like strawberries it does have that artificial taste it can pass as if it was like strawberry weed and um don't quote me on this I'm not too sure what the strains are in this I'll make sure and put that in the description below you guys know I always got you guys with that like but is this amazing dude this thing this car is definitely about 100 percent cup like I'm definitely happy that I was able to try this out and give it my initial thoughts and we're just gonna keep ripping it and then keep ripping it and then tell you guys what the full effect is I mean I'm not even too sure how many hits already taking but it's a very nice high so far and I haven't taken many so Wowz is dude not even gonna like the high on this is so good so good oh the more you hit it it's like a very refreshing drink of strawberry soda it's not it's not a bad though it's good it's amazing like alright where is it where has this been all my life ever I would have tried this months ago this definitely would have been on my top-five list this definitely is getting bumped up to number two right now so right now guys raw garden and then Los Angeles cush and then West Coast cured but this this right here this distillate right here is some of the best some of the best for sure I haven't tried any other but better just looking this and it keeps going better and better as I try a new of products like some guy some guy I've commented below and he said he said this I think he said um oh you think every new cartridge that you try is better and I'm like yeah dude cuz like it a new cartridge you never know what you're gonna get you know it can either be shittier than the last one you tried it could be better it can't or it could be just up I mean I've never really had a cartridge that's the same level as the other cartridge so you know that's that's my thoughts like I always try new things that I think is better than other things and I'm not gonna sit here and think that those old things are the best forever you know I'm always trying to find new product I'm trying to find new things for you guys especially because you guys always have questions about Oh what what should I cut what should i do I don't want to waste my money that's what I'm here for man this is what I'm here for like things like this like go cop this go cop this for sure I'm gonna take one more hit imma do the official review on this for you guys so yes can decide if you want to go cop it or not so who like this thing is gave me stone I'm gonna switch it to the raw garden battery because it was a really really smooth it off of it man this weather change got me with a little like the allergies my nasal congested dude freaking coughing horrible so we're to take one last hit like I said and then when you get to the final review guys cheers I'm like I said I'm happy that I picked this out this is by far some of the best distillate so amazing room sheesh man this is like another level of higher right here this is so amazing let me get into detail right now so all right so a initial taste I already said it tastes kind of like a strawberry soda Fanta it's not too dominating so don't they you're gonna get an overpowering ly strong strawberry taste it's very very subtle but you can definitely taste it and depending on how your palate is you know the way you tasting is it kid it can be you could like it or you can't but for the most part in my personal opinion I feel like you should like it as a consumer of thta's like if you guys like most of the things that I reviewed in the past you guys are definitely gonna like this one like this off the tops is taking over the best distillate this is from Oh taking over Stacey it's been taking over West Coast Cara like I said top distillate by far and you heard it from me and then so the high it's a very very very soothing dude it doesn't automatically just pop just hit you and then you're automatically like super stone you know you don't get it enjoy it go go like a level up level up you just cut you know there's been things like that and like this this cartridge right here dude it like you take one one hit I mean it gets you a head change you know it gets you a head change and that's what I like about it get your head changer that my I start feeling a little bit heavy definitely getting that indica right away and that coughing sensation who it man I killed like on that second hit if you guys go back in on the video and notice it I couldn't even hold that hittin I can't hold it in like that's how strong it is very very potent that turps are super super flavorful man there they hit you in the back of the throat along with the strawberry and it's like it's just a conjunction of just flavorful miss man it's amazing so Los Angeles Kush you've outdone yourselves man I'm definitely gonna be copying you products um I want to try the ill oh gee and then the Burberry cheesecake is next on the list - man I'm gonna be doing some more Lakers for you guys if you guys like this video man imma ended up here go cop the LA Kush and if you guys enjoyed today's video make sure you guys go leave a like comment sub and I just wanted to say man rest in peace Nipsey Hussle man true legend out there he did a lot for me growing up I just want to speak on this as an innovator cuz he did die on them on Sunday which is very tragic like I said hometown legend for me and he was like someone that I looked up to growing up because he was a very very motivational man he always gave that word out to like be better for yourself like it doesn't matter where you come from if you like he even showed everybody he was from the hood he was from the straight up like hood bro like Slauson like the where the bad [ __ ] happens about and he made it out multi-millionaire this dude was Boston up he just bought his own like that little store that he used to kick it out in front of he just about that whole entire building really the things he was doing was were out of this world he was true a true motivation that a lot of people should look up to instead of looking up to these other people that really aren't doing much but talking about money girl weed and [ __ ] like that so yeah rest in peace Nipsey Hussle man true legend imma have to get a tattoo for him soon bro so if like I said if you guys enjoyed the video make

sativa ask for a sativa this is what I got but on here they don't say it's a it's a team or a hybrid or nothing like that so I don't know it just says I like cake on it but I'm pretty sure that's just either since I asked for one but the cartridge overall guys it's fire has every CDs on special or just got the money to buy it I highly recommend it these things are really good man and go ahead and go to another one definitely you get that cake just la cake for a reason to taste straight like cake like a frosting type oh yeah you get some cannabinoids in there you get some all that good stuff I would recommend this to all my youtubers or looking for a fire cartridge but for the price I mean it's a little expensive but if you guys have a deal going on like a 30% off or something like that was

thoughts are witnessed a next and I crushed it yo reverse that Jai biting process you saline and I slept across blasting the South Stand impaired Nam store the top of the rankings your new road you see Duma I'm enrolled each on a flight go people what's good obviously for pundits I noted slightly different angles and usually used to basically this is my first flip in a day so I'm sorry if I'm not coughing out anything like that this is a little wake and bake thing but I needed to er I wanted to get a little reviewed on this La Push cake buy your bread pure farms but basically my back snow through the whole thing I've just wrapped it up spliff up now and I've got just get this from we've got that you're gonna see not too little looks left there you go so I just sort of quickly sort of chat to you about this stuff and do a little review so just what you know what I need to start a paneer that comes this time I'll just take this eight phases fingers off you know what I'll just grabbed a camera doing it all handhold sort of vlog ting no quick review on it and nap so I guess obviously I have cooked some videos when I first got the board I keep looking here from - no it's over there I have thought some videos are when I took the board when I first got the blood story so I'll show you that now so you can see what it's any cost Kate was saying I'll come back give you a little bit more detailed on it that sort of thing and yeah you never know this might get made into a short little video saying like that so yeah an equal skate by Brep your farms check these little clips out and we'll be back with you the second just telling you what this is and red tail of that [ __ ] so another day no package I'm not gonna take this over on the name of the fest I'm Scott oh this is actually supposed to be few of the okay you kill a headache okay five dread pure Bob's sure let's see what we've got here see back to think everything will just get that fine print and then we'll see exactly what we'll have to get through really well packed and as you can see just put it in this map right now average this stuff does come that Patsy exhaust or not if it is this clean food just a little inspection so outside flew at the back open would say it doesn't look like it's probably the dry came quite hard to sort of say too much about the board of our getting about the cases I will just I say it but now another proper look at that as you can see that is the La Push came back see this is UK grown isn't caddy we'd do take road it's going back in a little farm called bread peel farms first time smoking that product little smaller this fact they running these backpack seals try and not do it because for me it always seems that our over exaggerated like the smelling that and like when you smell the boots are outside of the backpack seals all the time they don't even smell like that without what they smelled up with you're sweating inside anyway so try not to do it too much it's cuz you know like against a lot of the wrong idea about how some fish smelling but just from initial inspection it looks pretty far to be fair not maybe necessarily like V best rim job I've ever seen now there's still a little sugar leaves and stuff there they probably could have come off or whatever but I've also got some smaller dogs as well I haven't got too many soft bigger dogs or anything like that but they are covered in tricare's don't wanna seem to focus to you well see that'll be bad yeah Javed and try to end I'd like to say smaller dogs the best structure to trim job part of my channel but they are still looking nice they're pretty dense I don't know say that like overly dense or anything about that but they are pretty dense like you know it's not a good density for UK weed they've got certain stickiness to them as well that you ain't got off every fit definitely quite sticky board as well yeah I mean I don't know what's a really about smoking it I'm still get almost a freshman the second it smells lovely it smells really really nice I mean it smells sort of what I was expecting it to you get certainly some of the Cushman's coming through doing that sort of cushy hugging almost minty sort of taste and then some of that sort of wedding cake coming through as well so there's more sort of vanilla nice sort of pong any sort of fresh notes as well yeah it's like a sweet sort of mint enos quite similar to like you know most more probably twelve Cushman's Lina also said the wedding keep cakes I'd you asked me to sort of smell wires of like push mints about animal wings a little cross of the wedding cake in as well maybe the best bag of people to see but again it's also not bad like you know the sugar leaves are a lot darker than the actual buds and you'll see that the buds are coveted trichomes damn and I've heard this has got quiet private powder as well so I'm looking forward to where it gets make it but yeah like I said it's by bread pure farms and UK and yeah let's just get this as a flash on quickly in the forest ops make my fruit there you go that is with the flash on the LED couch cake I've read pure farms so you can see that I could say you might only have small dogs and stuff like that you know real like huge Knox to show you but it has still got a certain level of bag appeal even these smaller dogs you know there are relatively dense they do have a really good tribe typical forage they could just do with maybe some bigger notes and maybe it's slightly bit better of a trim job but I do know this was quite a limited run and I think this is sort of the last bit of it now maybe four drums on it a bit soon I could have it go a little bit nicer of EQ I'm not complaining though because it does have back appeal you know you can see the track record we got it but it's quite long sort of like orange orange pistols right that orange zone sort of ambery really dark sort of sugar sugar leaves you can see where maybe put it on this slightly better trim and stuff like that but still lovely car went smooth can't see exactly what save and they cook a pie bread pure farms will get smoking that now I'd like to say will let you know what the thing to know that also getting through it so as you can see some real [ __ ] firemen this is the first time I've ever smoked by Bret deer farms I've got admit like yeah the a man I've had the best bag appeal I like all the Bulls I've been smoking recently or whatever bought this [ __ ] was fire bro like taste is so clean smoked so nicely Irish little smooth has been burning white in order first need to cough them I actually smoked and spoke to the guy at Brimfield farms I sniff you knew what the genetics were on this obviously jungle boys have their you know le cush cake whatever something for the same thing he said to be honest you want exactly sure and that yeah you know you've got gifted a courted and he's grew it out and it's what it is sort of thing but isn't exactly sure on what the genetics are and but I would have personally said that it is the same sort of genetics as the jungle boys one and I'll be really surprised as it doesn't have Cushman's in for one it's got that heavily sort of cushy minty sort of taste for again I wouldn't be surprised this across his wedding cake as well because I'm getting those sort of lie almost vanilla resort of notes coming through and uh smoking that it's super clean man it's super clean I mean the closest thing I'll smoke to that slide its taste washer stuff was the edit cush ke baare jungle boys which was fired you know I mean like I'd have to say this might not have like necessarily the best back appeal or whatever it's still nice and don't get me wrong like you know there were small nooks whatever but they were dense in that and the work of it in trichomes yeah man I've been the best rim job ever or whatever man up had the craziest peg appeal but smoke wise I can't really fault them too much you know like I enjoy smoking this it has been some real fire twice sticky board as well and I just have a real sort of stickiness to it when you grind it off as well like I'm probably have to feed my grinder after this one I'm not gonna lie this buddies [ __ ] [ __ ] I need to get any value a life but anyway bin super clean bin super slowly as well like really really enjoyable smoke but I say really clean flavor and it's got a good tie to it as well at that the effects on it stuff like that all really nice flat for a UK read you know just to shave you've had some really fire UK we didn't just before like the Platinum Girl Scout cookies on Mimoza the bag peel sort of they're on a different level bag appeal wise to this but this is sitting up there sort of smoke wise to me I'm saying this is a really good smoke still I've really enjoyed it I think if you get down to giving this rating so do you want to do I want to sort be quite quick and [ __ ] on this I'm gonna give this an eight point nine an eight point nine out of ten just don't know that 9.0 mark just like say a bit more bag appeal probably giving a bit higher and oh yeah it's just I would have liked for it to get more it would have needed more bag appeal or maybe slightly more to the flavor I like this cushion it sort of flavor but again it's not crazy Jeanette I mean that this is a good example of it smokes really clean you've always before them to thinking just off to smoke anyway that this is some Cali but yeah I just there's other things that I've had that I preferred and I have been much stronger highs and stuff but still I'm rating this I don't want to think I'm not like eight point nine that's two really good rate in anything above an eight is some fire really so don't think I'm not writing this big up the guys at prep your farms bring up the fireman sam sort I mean this first time dealing with either of these guys easy and [ __ ] simple and all that so it's what you want good service good board like I can't complain as people bow for you man like say I'm gonna give this eight point nine and maybe a different little cure ever to begin log to my pulled up a little higher rate rate of mark into those nuns whatever bought don't think I'm not writing this because I am writing it in fire yeah just for comment yell be this quick little review handheld thing to see what you want to say and if you'd like this thing for doing like this team I feel like you're proper up in my face and that so I don't know if I like this thing or whatever bought we'll see how it goes enough see how it goes and that I'm just trying to experiment a little bit didn't really get anything for doctor I'm just trying to experiment a little bit is what let's go say a time I'm making this video better

some good terps so i'm really excited for this uh now really quick let me make sure i just gave you all the back information okay um this is uh indoor grown no-till uh the lineage oh wow the strain lineage is gmo and orange skittles so that is what makes up the terpe slurpee here is the gmo and the orange skittles and i did not know that i knew gmo was in there but i did not know the orange skittles part so that that's so it's good to know something you didn't know before so anyway um is this keep refrigerated uh low temp dab at 650 degrees uh follow them on instagram echo you green no-till soil goons yada yada make sure to follow them um all great companies you guys can see all their products they're making and um yeah i usually i mean it it has the terpenes listed right here but usually i don't go by that i just go by what i actually taste and smell and stuff like that i usually don't go off of those numbers because sometimes i don't get the same thing that they're posting here um cbd is 0.17 percent and that's about all the information they give us there on the back now it is time to open this product and it is time to get high okay okay all right so i'm gonna open this bad boy up there we go there's our dabs nice and stable you can feel it nice and stable definitely snap and pull though because you can bend it definitely look you can definitely bend it so let's open this bad boy up look at that that is a beautiful product beautiful product guys very very nice product i like it nice and stable these guys really do uh do a great job now let's see if we can smell it oh you can definitely can smell a little bit of that gmo and the skittles in there yeah i know you can smell it it's very faint but you can still smell it all right you gotta have good nose all right so it is time to uh we don't need this oh wait wait a sticker i don't need that anymore but a sticker they give you a sticker um i think all echo products give you a sticker i think that is i think that's what they do and that's one really cool thing about it so i'm gonna make sure i take this peel this sticker off here just cut my nails so bear with me folks while i try to peel the sticker off there we go and then we're gonna there we go now we're representing all right echo all right let's dab this [ __ ] [Music] all right guys so for this dab we got the across the universe rig here very nice glass piece this is a mini rig and i really like it that nice function nice and i really love the planets it's got like a lot of saturn planets so saturn's my favorite planet let me know your favorite planet in the comment section below i guess i guess is to say other than earth but anyway i really like this rig uh we're going on a trip and your favorite rocket ship and uh of course we got a dab here already says damn healthy dab of the chirpy slurpee and i'm hoping that it's turpin and slurping at the same time you get what i'm saying all right by the way if you guys have ever had echo products before let me know your thoughts in the comment section below on this video uh if you guys have ever had the terpy slurpee before let me know your thoughts in the comment section below on this video obviously gotta get my carb cap make sure it's right there and ready car cap city and let's do it [Music] all right so my final thoughts and opinion on the terpe slurpee here by echo all right i like it i really do it tastes just like the flower if you've ever had the flower it tastes just like that it's amazing i feel like if i close my eyes and somebody just gave this to me and i didn't know it was a dab i wouldn't be able to tell the difference i'd be like whoa nice nice bowl of flower of the turkey slurpee and they'd be like it's calves [ __ ] and i'd be like no way no no and then they'd be like yeah and then i'll be like oh my life is crazy and upside down right now but no it is amazing it tastes just like the flour it tastes great even though it's only 4.3 percent on the terpenes uh it's definitely terpius [ __ ] okay it definitely tastes amazing you definitely get the gmo taste if you are a gmo fan like me then you are going to love this product it has that nice gassy gmo taste to it the gmo cookies the just that i don't know that loud gas to it okay that kind of diesely gas you know what i mean then it it hits nice with the fruity citrusy taste of the orange skittles like a fruity citrusy like i don't know how to describe it it tastes like skittles almost and it's really nice and it it definitely blends well together it really is oh i mean i'm just blown away just the fact that it tastes just like the flower to me like usually you can tell you know you usually it'll taste somewhat close to the flour or it'll taste like way over what the flour would be you know what i mean it'd be like a super gush of flavor in your mouth or something like that but it is perfectly part right there balanced as all things should be uh and i love it and uh it's nice it's stable although i wouldn't i wouldn't play too much with your fingers with it so if you're one of those people that just like to kind of get in there with your fingers and just kind of pull your dabs off and stuff like that you're not going to be using your dab stick forewarned it's a little little it will melt onto your fingers if you hold it for too long okay it's stable but it's not that stable okay it's not shatter um so i really like this uh the color on this that beautiful golden color i'll show you guys again that beautiful golden that is nice uh everything about this product is nice it's got a nice high i could definitely feel it you could look at my eyes and be like oh oh yeah you can feel it and i feel like yeah i definitely feel the high even though it's 74 i myself consider anything 70 or above pretty damn good okay as far as dabs go for like test results and stuff like that thc and stuff i consider anything 70 or higher uh to be pretty good 80 bomb you know god great but 70 good okay um and this is 74 you definitely feel it uh a little to no cbd i wouldn't you know it's not that kind of a high to me it's more kind of a mental high less of a body high but you do kind of get the mixture because this it does have a little bit of both i really enjoy it okay i'm just kind of rambling on because i'm stoned now because of this product but i really like the high uh overall great product great great great amazing product here in the state of oregon echo you guys are absolutely amazing i paid 28 dollars you guys can see right here on the top this is 28 for the gram recreationally here in the state of oregon that's one full gram uh this bomb for 28 bucks uh can you believe that folks uh i mean this is some really good stuff echo has won awards for how terpy and flavorful their products are okay they have won awards guys and uh i definitely tell i can see why i love this love this product it's definitely worth the 28 bucks uh it's definitely worth you know whatever they got them priced at at your local dispensary i would definitely try it out um and like i said they are one of the top tier companies uh in my opinion here in oregon okay they are definitely in a lot of people's top five i would say and uh they definitely know how to make a great product um i really enjoyed this i'll be enjoying the rest of

"welcome to edison limelight ultra sour strain review let's see how sour this really team start is show hey you welcome to my course review a juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view by the way you should sub to juvenile styles this channel is really dope now enjoy the video what's up world i got edison limelight ultra sour cush strain from nslc so i'm going to do a little review of it i've done it before but back when i was uh i always say i guess a little cringy and less uh experienced i guess we'll say so now that i'm a little better a little less stiff and i thought i'd give another few so i'm going to give you guys a nice close-up of this and then when i get when the close-up's finished i'll be back with the joint rolled up so check this out because we're down we light this up and light this up in a cup i can't stand up be a cyber monkey like the end of the part i get twist up keep your lips shut [Music] don't [Music] [Music] so i'm back i got the bat let's light it up and get high as my hat but it might not be that high but anyways let's light this [ __ ] up it does have the nice sour taste to it that i was expecting i mean how can you not limelight ultra sour so i'm wondering if because when i went and bought it it actually just said limelight so if it's the limelight must be part of the i don't know part of the company edison limelight ultra sour because i know ultra sour is a strain i've had before too so is it limelight or ultra sour it's a little confusing either way it is a sativa and it's 22 percent thc and it's not a bad grab as you can see it's a very nice like light green color it has some really nice colored hair on it has a lot of crystal too so and that's not a bad account for a gram so we still got this after having the joint so that's definitely not a bad gram from the liquor store and it was nine 9.78 or something like that so that's not a bad price for a gram so what i'll do is i'll throw a nice little piece up into the bong we'll taste it in the bun and then we'll rate the taste and then the smell in account everything else so let me pat a little bowl there we go as you can see we've got a nice little bit up in there let's take a hit hold on the hole's clogged a little bit i should have poked it through first oh god i'm gonna have to poke this first my bad there we should be good now maybe a little too good oh that was a nice day i wasn't expecting that you can see those little birds floating around my head [Music] i'm just playing but it tasted nice so that's all it counted besides it made me feel nice so yeah um i'll give the rating for the taste i'll give it a four oh no i'll give it a 3.5 i give it a 4 if you really like this sour strains but i have a 3.5 for flavor it's pretty nice flavor for rating for a pound for the gram it's not a bad gram at all especially from the liquor store they can look a little stingy sometimes so i say i'll give the account i give the account a three and a half as well it's not a bad account looks like a decent amount for a gram maybe i should start weighing them up for you guys on the reviews i might start doing that the next couple reviews weighing it and seeing how much it weighs compared to what it's supposed to be i might start doing that so i think that we'll give the limelight or the ultra sour the limelight ultra sour will give it an overall rating of 3.5 pretty good we pretty good ground but it's obviously just mediocre it's not top-notch but for the price it's a pretty good ground so that's where this one's from the liquor store it's the nslc here and i've had a few other strains from the edison cannabis co they're not too bad at all they have some pretty good strains so yeah i'll give an overall rating 3.5 to that and if you watch my videos i want to start intro and true interviewing like pop photographers and different kind of like weed influencers any kind of weak content creator so if you puff and record stuff hit me up and maybe we can set up an interview be pretty dope so with that i guess i'll leave it there i still got the stickers for juvenile styles if you want one hit me up in the comments or at me on twitter of my twitter in the description or send me an email at juvenilestylesgmail.com with that i'll leave it there i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good in your own personal lives thanks for spending

Shane I'm Danny and we're back for another strain review today we're actually hitting you with a little bit of a double strain interview I have two different offerings right here from Los Angeles Kush this is the LA cook this is la curse there's a ton of curse on the table curse curse curse curse curse we got red box and we got blue box essentially just two different females of the same strain the self-titled Los Angeles cush so obviously their brand is called Los Angeles cush this strain right here is called la cush this has to be their main squeeze right here I would guess so I mean check them out at la curse calm but you know I would imagine being Los Angeles curse that you're gonna grow a ton of OG and these two orgies are pretty dank I'm not gonna lie so obviously if you guys have been watching the show for a while you've probably seen us do a ton of OG reviews but not really any in a long time yeah and we've been actually getting asked a lot lately what happened to good oh good Oh G go yeah honestly this is the only brand I've seen lately at least in this area putting out consistently good og that takes me back to the heyday of cush man yeah I really yes I mean I'm gonna go ahead and go in on one of our tests right now and see if it passes as I have a feeling it's not going to that doesn't mean it's not good we stick testers okay oh it wants to grab you know it like grabs for a second honestly a lot of OG you know there is sticky OG don't get me wrong but a lot of OG kind of traps the stickiness inside because once you break it up it definitely is once you get into it but like on the outside it's like that also has to do a kind of a good cure so there's a few different like main classes of OG I feel like right you got like you're really fuel II gassy oh geez that I feel like for whatever reason those ones tend to be like a little bit gummy ER or have a little bit more of that stick of sex that you're talking about this is more the earthy variety yeah and I would say this red one is that you're breaking up ER I'm breaking up the blue one right yeah I would say the red one is straight marshmallow funk like sfv didn't we look up the genetics on these it's just LA cush this is the same le cush that we have been smoking Orca I guess on and off for the last 10-15 years now I remember way back in the day when you used to go down to LA and it was like there was really good sfv all the time and there was really there was a lot of other og cuts that were around all the time but I remember there always being la cush or LA og cush yeah and it was this thing we totally even of Denver I saw it around you smoking here I saw you know I saw LA coach around Denver and it was definitely a very very gassy cut out there even but uh I would definitely say that this is somewhere along the lines of like you know some type of SF VLAN image it's just [ __ ] good og what else can I say man I'm [ __ ] going on a rip on how you're saying we used to process this a lot for one of our partners out in Colorado for a lot of live resin especially and this strain always made really really good turkey live resin the I guess we'll just refer to them as red box and blue box I'm pretty fed right pretty much how they refer to ya the different different fee knows here at home the blue box tastes amazing to me and has a little bit more of like a citrusy a little bit more that few liter it's a little bit less earthy to me than the red box but very very similar as far as smell goes smoke is smooth as [ __ ] wow this stuff has not heard you know of manatees you know I don't know what that means a percentage but that's it so if they show the percentages when I got picked these up at purple Lotus and San Jose I've had them on the menu this one checked in about 31% one of the highest things they had on their menu and then this one right here was like 28 29 look you know obviously you guys have heard us say many times th see percentage is not a make or break statistic for us no but it is kind of especially depending on the type of weed that you're smoking it is it's kind of a an overall good baseline or place I start right right I mean you know THC percentage this and everything but I definitely want potently I just what we mean when we say THD isn't everything's just you need all the other cabin IDEs in the weed to actually work together to get the high at least i'm looking like OG Kush is a has always traditionally been a pretty high tea please dream right it's potent right yeah but it's it's whatever else is in oh gee coach that particular mix of cannabinoids and terpenoids effect that we talked about there's something with OG that's just a little bit different is that the Blues a little stick here I'm not gonna lie I would say this pass is a decent stick test also - we got this about what a week ago it was a little bit stickier at first got it to be honest but I do think the blue one is oh it has a little bit stickier resin yeah then the red one so as far as the way these hit you know it's it's OG so it's gonna be indica dominant the blue one leans a little bit more just towards being a typical hybrid midline the red one packs a punch it's way more of a couch lock type buzz yeah I'm just I'm in a daze right now I'm just feel like I'm sitting here looking down watching the covers right now on this [ __ ] third person yeah I'm Kirsch based I wish I wished hoped to be back for this review this this is he would love this we gonna curse on the table and we're getting a cush phase doesn't this kind of take you back though isn't this that just good old school classic og it really is man I'm gonna go in on the blue right here see how it tastes like we've been talking about there's just so much especially I'd say almost og more than anything now obviously cookies a lot of these other strains too but there's a lot of things that just come along are super fire and then quickly become watered down you know og unfortunately has fallen victim to that trend it's nice when you can find some [ __ ] that really lives up to the old expectation yeah that's good the blue is good too not gonna lie it's definitely more earthy and almost has more of like that kind of like really good oh sure taste almost you know I don't know culture you know from what I remember comes off like pretty earthy like gassy no I'm saying I like the way this breaks down a lot to that's the texture of it oh man I'm so [ __ ] high dude this stuff definitely packs a punch I don't know which one's hitting me harder whether it's the red or the blue honestly though if I had to pick one I'm gonna go with the red I'm gonna take red just because it I felt like it tasted a little bit better just to my palate personally would you think about when we smoked them in the joint so we smoked a joint of each of these right a couple of days ago what did you think about the two in the joints versus in the bond I'm pretty sure I remember telling you that I like the red even when we smoke the joints yeah I feel like the red one packed the punch for whatever reason cuz we smoked the blue first and we were kind of high and then we smoked the red one after I don't know if it was because it was the second joint and it's obviously you've pile it all whatever you did on the first one or the blue could just be creeper we'd like I don't know all I know is I'm really that right now I don't know the blue definitely did taste good in a joint - we smoked it first and it have been a couple hours since we smoked so it's like the first weed hitting our palate in a couple hours who knows there's so many variables when smoking they're both great pushes they're both smell great they're both similar they both look great I like the structure on both of them I like the flavor I like the high I think really it's just you want something that leans you know heavier on the indica side more couch lot more you know make your eyes heavy type lead or do you want something that's just a little bit more balanced of a hybrid right you know so it's pretty much that's pretty much the only thing I see that you know differentiates yeah yeah if I if I had to give it an overall rating though on each one you know I think I'm gonna go eight on the blue and I'm gonna go eight point five on the red really yeah I thought oh man I'm thinking a little higher I mean I've had stickier og yeah right you know what I'm saying I it definitely packs a punch though you know the effect is there I mean still that that's b and b plus you know on on my scale which is still or beat I guess B and just saw flat B but no I think that's yeah you're right I did a good score I think that's pretty fair I've had we've had some good oh gee man and like you know this has been sitting in a diss jar for god knows how long everybody knows that weed stays better up in a big football or you know the bigger it's stays in a bigger batch the less air there is yeah and you know air to weed ratio whatever you're keeping it in you want that to be loved you know only got me high oh yeah fact is a 10 okay that's what I'm saying I just I don't know maybe it's probably this doubt okay okay no I think you're right on the overall I think your opinion is gonna bring down my overall to about where yours is but I think it's just in the moment I'm it seems a little bitter to me because I just I've been missing that good classic Oh G me too but personally I do like a little bit of that gum e'er stuff like you're talking about you know yeah something that passes that fuel factor something was a little bit more lemony turf as yes oh the earth eater or a mixture of both I got lemon people gasp you know yeah something like that but overall I like these at the end of the day we smoked it to get high and I think we're both pretty fun I am cursed up baby thank you guys for joining us for another one make sure you like and subscribe make sure you turn on notifications make sure you follow us on social media it's down there in the description do all that [ __ ] do your homework we're gonna do ours so that we can come back for another episode next week yeah thanks for joining us for the CCC I'm Shane come dude we're out of here let's go come on [Music]", "9hevAjjLJqo": "good morning good afternoon good evening this is your pilot speaking rich from rich to be live thank you for joining me today today I wanted to speak to you about named estate technologies yesterday we had some huge news the more Act passed the house 24 to 10 and that signaled a huge correction in the cannabis sector and now estate technologies is one of those stocks that really has taken it on the chin over the last year I mean September 24 2018 they are at $3.74 they are now at 35 cents they've come all the way down and have not had any really large sustainable growth as far as the stock despite the fact that the company I believe is moving in the right direction and I'm gonna explain to you why first of all I mean I'm not gonna get into all of it but they've got two businesses that I believe are going to be great businesses the first one is kin Mart you can go to ken marcom you can see powered by NAMM estate technologies i think ken mart is a very good platform and all I've heard is good things about can mark all I've heard is good things about kin Mart everybody is really impressed with kin Mart so from people on the street that I've talked to Ken Mart is the real deal and it has a chance to be absolutely huge okay so essentially this is just one of their platforms that is I believe a very powerful successful platform that will give them the opportunity to scale and grow exponentially it's also an online platform it's like an online database where companies can go and put their products so they don't actually have to deal with any overhead other than managing the website the other platform that they are a big part of and a big owner of is pineapple express pineapple Express is offering Bing and delivery of cannabis products and brands and you can see some other products here look at this fresh at pineapple express they'll deliver right to your door THC premium label flower products so you can see they have a list of products that are available vape products so despite what everybody says a banana stay despite the fact that they're down a lot in the last year I think the upside is tremendous because this is a really good growing business like it's a real growing business you know and pineapple Express from what I've heard is very popular especially in the GTA in Toronto so Toronto being the biggest massive market in Canada I think this is a very good brand that has enormous upside and is very popular with people in Toronto from what I've heard I never used them before but I've heard only good things now let's get into their website name estate technologies we are the future of cannabis reimaging the cannabis experience we create innovative online platforms that deliver unexpected value for customers stakeholders and our global partners global footprint we are the world's leading online platform for

unique websites 5 warehouses and 20 countries here it is three continents one namaste we operate the most comprehensive online marketplace for cannabis products and accessories in the world exceeding

warehouses allow products to be shipped swiftly safely and securely clearly to mmmm satisfied customers wow that's a huge database of customers man two million satisfied customers let's take a look at what we do see a quick video here [Music] [Music] I love the direction these guys are going and to be honest with you guys I think it's absolutely brilliant and I don't think people really understand I think a lot of people are sleeping on that mistake I really do they were talk of the cannabis sector about a year ago they're very popular they were always in the news they were doing big things and then things slowed down the stock went down I mean like a look at the stock right we're talking about a stock that went down from $3.74 September 24 2018 not that long ago 14 months ago all the way down thanks to Andrew left and his team of guys and you left said he would take them to zero got pretty close they are now at 35 cents despite the fact that they have all of this infrastructure now to really grow and really scale and the news on nameste is getting better here's the news let's see if we can get into the news this is the latest NamUs day news NamUs days can mark signs of supply agreements with the Ontario and Saskatchewan provincial agencies and by the way there's a news that just came out that says that the Ontario government is creating a plan to open up 1,000 stores in Ontario in 2020 that's right 1,000 stores in Ontario in 2020 just to give you guys some perspective there are only 24 stores in Ontario right now in 2019 so for them to open up another 976 stores that's going to mean a lot of new revenue for all the LPS in Canada so I would be getting ready right now because companies I can mark our position to take advantage of that can Mart expands provincial business Channel which sites for more b2b market is expected to grow as a result this was as of November 12 2009 mistake technologies and in Canada a next ETF in America on the OTC markets and m5 BQ in Frankfurt Germany a leading online platform for cannabis products accessories and response responsible education today announced that it's wholly owned subsidiary can mark Inc has entered into a supply agreement with the Ontario cannabis retail corporation or OCR C operating as the Ontario cannabis store OCS the OCS is the sole legal online retailer and wholesaler for recreational cannabis for Canada's most populous province in addition can Mart has been registered with the Scotch Awan liquor and gaming authority s LGA allowing for the sale of cannabis products to permitted wholesalers in the province of Saskatchewan this closely this follows closely the recently announced purchase order with the province of British Columbia for pre-rolled cannabis products so they're growing folks this is only going to generate more revenue for namaste which has really been the issue with namaste namaste has not been growing because the revenue hasn't been growing I think they've been really focused on infrastructure I think they've been focused on building their management team up and I believe now we are going to see some growth in the revenue and it will not be surprised to see the price grow with it I believe that NamUs they will be at least at $1 in the future and for investors to get in right now at 35 cents in Canada that's a multiple of at least two times so I believe there's about 200 percent upside in my opinion at least for namaste in the future for someone that wants to get in a 35 cents love to know if you guys agree with me do disagree with me do you think that this is a buying opportunity nobody's talking about namaste right now despite the fact that they are really growing and building working directly with the provincial governments representing a significant more significant market opportunity for us says many more I'm CEO of namma State Technologies Inc we look forward to being part of the value chain for OCS and SL GA as we expand our presence in this sector namaste is pursuing similar arrangements with provincial governments agencies in an effort to further expand its customer base leverage its unique license streamlined purchasing process and diverse product selection through one location love it the Amazon of cannabis just saying Amazon just used to do books now they sell everything is can Mart and namaste going in the same direction I'm just saying can Mart is nama stays online everything cannabis store which carries one of the largest selections of legal cannabis products from well-regarded cannabis producers in Canada and around the world in addition the company has entered into a services agreement with native ads of Vancouver BC pursuant to which native ads will provide and manage a comprehensive digital marketing campaign for cash considerations of a hundred fifty thousand u.s. so they're spending money now on advertising and marketing you can surely assume that this is going to help determine the agreement extends from the effective date of September twenty fifty thousand nineteen until the digital media marketing campaign and related medium buying concludes the campaign includes but is not limited to content creation web development media buying and distribution advertising development and campaign reporting and optimization approximately 70 to 80 percent of the marketing campaigns budget will be allocated for digital advertising paid distribution and media buying and approximately twenty to thirty percent will be allocated for digital marketing consulting managed services and management fees over the campaign period neither negative ads nor any of its directors or officers hold directly or indirectly any securities of namaste the services provided by native ads may be subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval Stonebridge Partners LLC of Miami Florida has been engaged in a six month contract to enhance investor relations efforts and provide digital content marketing services for monthly fee of 7500 USD Stonebridge partners a stone bridge partners nor any of its directors or officers hold directly or indirectly any securities of namaste so they're clearly engaging in marketing and advertising in both Canada and the United States what are they what does this mean folks I mean something's brewing here I'm just saying something's brewing here just saying they're now focused on growing their brand and they're spending money to do so spending cash with the headquarters in Toronto Ontario and offices in both BC and around the globe and I'm estate technologies is the world's leading online platform for cannabis products accessories and responsible education the companies everything cannabis store can marcom provides customers with a diverse selection of a hand-picked products from a multitude of federally licensed cultivators all on one convenient site Namah stays global technology and continuous innovation address local needs in a cannabis industry requiring small solutions so this is the news that came out on namaste and I wanted to bring it to your attention that they are now engaging in advertising for one of the leading marketing advertising agencies in all of Canada and another agency in America and this is not going to hurt because they're paying in cash they're not paying in stock so there's not gonna hurt their visibility if anything it's going to hands its visibility it's going to hence its new shareholder base it's going to bring in a lot of new potential buyers of the security and based on the fact that

nine six percent pure leaf is up ten point three two percent oh my goodness I guess the Shorter's are getting their faces ripped off today is that what's what happened isn't that what Bruce Linton predicted that the Shorter's would get their faces ripped off so I've been live talking to bow namaste this morning there are up and in the green up to point eight six percent my question to you is is this a buy for namaste rain bond says nothing much you want to be rich then we listen to rich I told you guys the cannabis blow I've been telling you guys it was a buying opportunity I told you these prices weren't gonna last and I was a hundred percent correct I mean I don't know what else to tell you guys we're in the green gold sector is this green gold green gold isn't goin anywhere but up people are going to keep buying cannabis people are gonna keep buying bongs people are gonna keep buying vaporizers people are going to be taking CBDs and we haven't even launched edibles yet once we launch edibles I'm sure NamUs days gonna have edibles on their site too sure NamUs days gonna have edibles on camera I'm sure now miss they will probably have cannabis infused beverages on khon kaen mart - all of this is coming it's all coming it's not even here yet and the more Act just passed the house let's take a look at their last press release here before this one so namaste resulted the quarter of third quarter ended in August and it emerged that it had managed to boost its revenues from its main earning properties earlier this year the company had closed many of its online properties and made a conscious effort to concentrate on those that actually worked in the third quarter NamUs they managed to generate revenues of 3.8 million as opposed to 3.9 million in the same quarter in 2018 however it should be noted that the drop is not a lot considering the fact that many of the online properties for 2018 are no longer operational the company further indicated that it has boosted its earnings significantly from the existing properties another highly positive development from the particular quarter is the fact that the company managed to end the quarter with positive working capital which stood at fifty four point two million that includes as much as forty nine point one million in the form of either cash or its equivalents the companies based out of Toronto has a major hold over the Canadian market so the company's financial situation is strong that's why they can go out there and outsource media and marketing in both Canada and the US and pay cash to grow the stock price this is what companies need to do if you're a public company and you want your stock price to go up you need to hire outside help you need to pay them cash do not pay them in stock if you pay them in stock there's always the likelihood that that's going to dilute the stock and the price is going to go down so if you really want your share price to grow you need to hire professional marketing agencies that have a good reputation and you need to pay them in cash so they can go out there and they can put your brand in front of the investors that's what it takes companies that don't get this shouldn't be public if you don't understand this you shouldn't be public over the past months nameste technologies has brought a wide range of Canadian producers to its marketplace and its website namast\u00e9 MD komm could well be one of its more important platforms however the legalization of derivative products in Canada could be the biggest opportunity yet for namaste what I just tell you they haven't even started putting edibles on their platform yet when cannabis 2.0 rules out in less than a month many cannon many companies are going to enter the market and many of them are sure to seek the help of the sprawling online marketplace operated by namaste so they're gonna take their products and they're gonna put them on kin Mart think about it the Amazon of cannabis nameste has an online marketplace where all the other LPS can put their products on kan Mart think about it just saying man Amazon didn't become Amazon overnight man it took years they started selling books now they sell everything in addition to its successful e-commerce business the company has also made made several important investments it has picked up set a 49% stake in chocolate market chocolate which aims to get into edibles market in cannabis nameste also has a 49 percent stake in pineapple Express here's pineapple Express right here you guys want to see how big kind of pineapple Express is look at this look at all their products and we're talking lots of products CBD drinks drinks Wow look at this I do not even know this pineapple Express already has all kinds of drinks Wow so pineapple Express has got a lot of products and I've heard really good things about pineapple express pineapple express delivers legal dependable quality medicinal and

delivery process is love it you can get rewards oh wow so you can even get rewards it's pretty cool man kelly green gold I like that name kelly green gold so you can see all the different products they have in a lot of different products look at all these products Wow THC premium labels flower and I've heard some really good things about these products like they're very popular so I'll not be surprised to see nameste go way higher guys because honestly these guys are just getting started and I think that their platform is smart they got money in the bank they don't have a high overhead because it's an online website and all the LPS are going to be able to once especially once camera gets really popular why would an all the LPS put their products on camera why wouldn't they it just makes sense it's more distribution it's more sales it's more revenue for all the other companies and for an a mistake I think it's genius yeah I know you guys are talking about Andrew left how he said that Aurora cannabis was going to zero and I told you guys Aurora cannabis wasn't going to zero and I told you guys that I'm not selling my shares because this is green gold why would I sell green gold if you're willing to hold gold why wouldn't you hold green gold I think that the upside for green gold is way way way way way way way way more explosive than gold that's just my opinion that's what I'm saying I mean we see it today tilt is on fire or cannabis is on fire Keira leaf is on fire I told you guys we're at the bottom I made a video yesterday saying we're at the bottom and we just going higher crime is up 9% they're on fire why because we hit the bottom the question is is namaste at the bottom because there's still at like 30 what 35 cents 36 cents were that let's check 36 and a half cents 36 and a half cents for potentially a future giant just saying man ACB is on fire up 14% congratulations to everyone who's taking advantage Alex Castillo says namma stay low overheads that is why I have 38,000 shares I hope you win big my friend and you know what I honestly think that these are great prices for namaste I will not be surprised to see them get to $1 and beyond so anyone that gets in at these levels has a chance to make 200% upside and I believe it's going to happen and most likely will happen in 2020 that's my opinion love to know what you guys think infinite possibility says we are entering a bull market of course we are the entire sector hit 52 we closed for the last two years these companies keep growing people are only going to buy more products people are only going to learn more about companies like pineapple Express and order more as they get more and more products how can this sector get smaller when it's only just getting started and legalization in America is becoming a reality and closer to reality every day and not just in America we're talking about legalization in Mexico legalization in Germany we're talking about legalization around the globe Canada was the first to really make it mainstream but they won't be the last everybody's going to get in the question is are you in are you in to win and if not when do you plan to get in you don't want to get in at the top like a lot of people did on that mistake you want to get in at the bottom well clearly if you look at the chart you can see a growing company with great products great partnerships money in the bank strong management team I think this is AB I love to know your opinion do you guys agree with me do you guys disagree with me is namaste a bi at 36 and a half cents do you think it goes back to a dollar in the future and are you buying namaste do you hold an Emma stay are you interested in namaste I'm a big fan of namaste he bought it in the past and made money on it I haven't bought it since I don't own any shares right now but I'm very interested in getting in and I wanted to bring it to the community because I haven't talked about it a lot lately and I thought this might be the perfect time to start positioning ourselves right when they are about to start having a big media campaign and push in Canada big media campaign and push in America they've got all kinds of things happening with can Mart all kinds of things happening with pineapple Express and I just think that it's signalling a buying opportunity max power says this is the time to get in at the price Pacquiao says loaded 5k shares on a CB yesterday congratulations my friend you must be a big today you could be buying a car every day patio with all the winning you're doing lately appellee Cannon says I'm never going to touch namaste again hey I appreciate your feedback I like the company I like the business I think they're doing really good things I think pineapple Express is a fantastic brand I think ken Mart is a fantastic brand and if you actually talked to people in Toronto they will tell you that pineapple Express is a fantastic brand that's all I got to say everyone has their own opinion but if you actually ask people across Canada about can Mart and pineapple Express all you will hear is positive reviews I am focused on the quality of the business remember this stock went down because previous management was doing a lot of different things and that previous management is now gone they've made a lot of changes and I really like the direction that they are going in I believe at this point namaste is a Buy and I believe the up site from here is absolutely tremendous and I'm a huge fan of pineapple Express and I'm a huge fan of kin Mart and I believe that this is a great time to position ourselves especially when you look at the chart of namaste even the three munch art shows that we're coming off a bottom see that little curl right there shows me were coming off a bottom on the three-month chart the lowest we've seen is 35 cents in the last year the absolute bottom was about 35 cents so Louis has ever been in the last year infinite possibility says I love pineapple Express so good yeah man is what I'm saying people who like it so nameste owns 49% of pineapple Express guys same-day delivery service right to your door in the GTA the largest market in Canada I kind of love it I'm not gonna lie to you guys so what's gonna happen when pineapple Express can deliver edibles to your door cannabis infused beverages to your door you know that's coming in less than a month that's more revenue which is going to help the bottom line of namaste and once they report that revenue growth stocks gonna skyrocket just like we saw it with tilt just like we saw with Keira just like we saw with true leave if you report profit stocks gonna do well it's very obvious we've seen it time and time and time again namast\u00e9 is on the path to profitability I've told you guys I bring these stocks before they explode nameste is going to explode I want you to remember this day write it on your calendar November 21st 2019 the day that rich predicted that namaste will explode I'm gonna start talking about them more and more and more because I'm already predicting that they're gonna explode and I will not be surprised to see them get to 40 cents 50 cents 60 cents 70 cents 80 cents 90 cents a dollar and then beyond I will not be surprised but I just want you to remember because I'm not the guy that jumps on a bandwagon after something explodes I bring you the stocks when they're down before they explode so you can actually make money while the entire cannabis sector has been down I've been telling everybody it's been a buying opportunity was I right Andrew left sent me a message on Friday saying that Aurora cannabis would go to zero and I told you it wouldn't I told you Aurora cannabis would be a success I told you Aurora cannabis was too big to fail and what have they done and you left where are you now bro did you get your face ripped off by Aurora cannabis did you get short squeezed by Aurora cannabis I'm just wondering I got no I hate for you Andrew you could do whatever you want I'm just wondering did you get your squeeze on are you getting squeezed right now Andrew everybody that was short in cannabis at all-time lows for the last two years is probably getting squeezed really badly right now I'm just saying I'm just saying I'm just saying inbred Jed says namaste is in a unique space I love it been in since $0.50 I hope you win big my friend Ryan Hannon says hey rich hate to talk about Xena but what's your opinion about average ago back ripped I also hold 25k shares I'm holding my shares I'm not gonna tell you to average down I haven't averaged down yet other than buying my rights and then using that money to buy some shares I'm just gonna let it sit man I want to see them grow and I want to see the revenues grow would it be a good time to buy absolutely because it's the lowest it's been but it's been going down all year so I'm not gonna tell anybody buy that stock there's other companies right now that I think are moving in a better direction Zen abyss has some work to do I am a shareholder I do believe in the company but you're not gonna hear me tell anybody to buy it Wow

they're looking pretty good [Applause] i think we're uh in full recovery mode at this point all the new growth is really looking a lot healthier than it was looking so i'd say this is pretty uh confirming that the problem was in fact the paint fumes i think in a couple of weeks it'll be like nothing was ever wrong i think i'm gonna go ahead and top this this girl right here take that off bring a little bit of an even canopy between these two plants i do like how the the bottom branches are really reaching up on these and i don't know if that's just the strain or if it's because of the issues that i cause with the paint fumes either way that's pretty awesome i think uh trying to think if i'm going to scrog these two or if i just tie some branches down and spread things out a little bit and then flower them out either way i'm probably two to four weeks away from flowering these two plants i think the seedlings here two of them are starting to make a recovery this one's got some new growth up top as well as this one over here but the one in the middle does not look good it's not growing it hasn't done anything in a couple days the stem's still green so i'm gonna give it a shot and keep it uh keep it alive keep giving it water but we'll just have to wait and see what happens with that one i'm not sure if uh if it's gonna be able to shoot another note out if the top note is dead and it doesn't have any uh any branching on it or any leads i'm not sure if it's going to be able to survive and shoot anything new out or not but it'll be interesting to find out yeah so that's about it we'll check back in with you guys in a couple days and see how they're uh progressing see how they're recovering thanks for watching i appreciate everybody see you next time", "nrs7wxcCzbk": "hey everyone how's it going welcome back to the garden done a little defoliation in here uh the last day or so i thought of it a little bit too late but i should have did a video before and after show you guys the difference cleaned them up quite a bit these uh two la cushcakes in the back are pretty bushy especially the phenotype on the you can left see how many nodes this thing is shooting out here i'm gonna have to clean it up quite a bit more take some clones off it at some point in about a week and then we'll get them in the flower shortly after that they do seem like they've almost all been recovered from the paint fumes there's some weird growth for sure like you see that leaf is a little funky with this really long pedal but for the most part got some really nice looking leaves in here but this phenotype has done some weird stuff in here i removed a lot of the weird growth but you can see the weird stuff going on but yet a lot of the leaves just look really normal healthy happy i got the two hyper fuels here in front you can see a real big difference between uh the genetics and the hyper fuel and the genetics and the la kush cake got a lot more stretch in this hyper fuel that that one's by archive genetics very stretchy i planted these about a month after the other ones i'm thinking i'm gonna probably top this plant right here [Applause] clone it and uh it should make it a little bit more of a bushy plan out of this girl i don't like how how lanky she is in the future i would top her a lot sooner and top it a lot more frequently to try and get a bit more of a bushy plant out of her so that's the update and my cat's trying to go in the tent i'm thinking i'll probably top this plant here a couple times too to even it up with the canopy of the other phenotype there before i flower them so that's what's going on here i'm pretty happy with the recovery and hopefully we don't have any weird genetic anomalies and flower or too many bananas or anything like that probably get one more update in and veg before i flip them into flower [Applause] thanks for watching hit me with a like and subscribe and i will see you guys next time", "k_1cBjrY4Bg": "what up YouTube a bum in a box and we are here with a product review it is Thursday when I uploaded this at 3 p.m. so every Thursday at 3 p.m. you'll see a product review and every Tuesday at 3 p.m. you'll see a grow log of the Girl Scout cookies and then the nutrient battle of advance nectar for the gun will advance nutrients versus nectar for the Gods vs. Elite nutrients versus a combo of advanced and nectar so let's check that out every Tuesday at 3 p.m. subscribe so you don't miss it but uh let's get to this review which I'm gonna call it let's get actually let's go down to our tools we haven't done that in a while this is my email from hi-5 Apes which is programmed at 6:40 it should be 650 so it's getting there 650 the coil or the cord goes up to here to the coil which wrapped it around the nail alright this nail is from high-five apes everything is pretty much from kind of hi babes this is the alpha nail this is a big-ass bowl and this is my wack-ass little china banger with our china [ __ ] glass pipe bomb rigged dinging the trigger but uh and we got our our Matt dad Matt from bori the dab demon we got our tool we got our carb cap alright correctamundo oh yeah looks like there were some stuff on there alright so let's get to reviewing today we have raw garden let's light this horrible huh this is the flower rosin Slimer so the strain is called Slimer and this is flower rosin as I say batch number for packaged last month okay my car cap is also overall garden this was the orange cookies pretty good stuff the things are a little different doesn't say package or whatnot but uh yeah so this is recommended to me by a vory the dab demon the same dude damn man right I was looking for something else and I was like a man looking for something that smells good something that uh I can actually describe with my nose cuz it's I'm not a good person that could detect different types of scent like other people like do you remember the movie biodome where that dude print out his name but he farts right and then his homie starts smelling it he's all those are Funyuns he's out yeah up you know keep going keep grooving he's a peanut butter yeah help me up you know he can detect those type of smells and and tell you what it is I I can't and that's just like super strong and pungent but uh whatchamacallit so I was recommended to get this he said it's the best stuff you know that we're pretty much out of all the he believes out of the auto raw garden this right here the Slimer I got the slime or butter but he said is better than the butter and better than anything else so this is sound like a light brown with a hint of green type of thing now this you don't even match up my smile kind of smelly what you said to like kind of stir it up and what not so let's do that all right let's smell it okay yeah definitely a jet\u00e9 today so Slimer it kind of reminds me of that Mexican salt lime packets I say seven 7up or some [ __ ] like that they're little green ones you know they're supposed to be sour and [ __ ] this kind of smells like that that lime flavor Slimer got line it's it's crazy you know it's it's a weird texture it's definitely nice wonder how they press it all right so let's try it out yeah let's try it out see how good this [ __ ] is just to the side we're just going to do two shots from above because this rig is nothing cool or exciting you know I mean so see should be pretty good dab I'm already excited for it let's do the zoom in all right so let's pick up a nice little little dab now this is the exit the only thing left in my stash I pretty much ran through everything and I have some rosin here and there but you know nothing nothing crazy this is a half a crown nothing too crazy yeah baby lungs all right let's dab it up Cheers oh [ __ ] gonna carry this that's right don't need to zoom in there zoom out all right salut okay Wow hmm Wow definitely strong that lion flavor it's it's pungent you know I mean jelly bean Wow okay it's pretty good ooh all right oh I was pretty good let's do another I mean let's see I feel like my taste buds I guess as if they tasted something hot or something like my taste buds are tingling or something all right let's try that again it was like some gooey [ __ ] man that's a fact to him there we go whoo this is pretty good raw garden they've been they've been having a lot of different flavors they had the Slimer they have different versions of it they had the flour rosin the butter the other strains they have is camphor orange cookies which was actually really good what else a weird name Bubba I forgot the name Bubba something Bubba or Buddha or bought something beat but yeah I was about to get the camp for live present but then you know I was smelling in I couldn't smell anything I was like man it looks nice it was nice and sugary but I just couldn't smell anything and you know so he went he's all dude you just go with this bro super smelly like alright man I'll do it it was the last warrant so I was like [ __ ] you have to get the last one or something right but alright Cheers salute for people that are over there smoking dabbing along as well Cheers yeah I can't finish that oh I thought I was as small as they up do you oh hi Caramba so let's rate it packaging looks cool focus logo looks nice rock garden for this type of gooeyness you definitely need a jeweler and it's glut happy they use I think it's a real class I don't know but I'm able to use as a car cap so always a plus having a nice flat glass of material so I'll give that yeah yeah that's pretty good yeah ten out of ten packaging at periods means rosin is rosin you know you can't really base rosin on appearance I mean you can't to certain well yeah but not it's not a lot of times I mean there's been some ugly-ass looking rosin that tastes great you know just really depends on the strain I went on how you how its rosin in the machine but I'll give it 9 out of 10 taste-wise you definitely taste it the strain what they're going for yeah that's it it's good just at 10 out of 10 boom boom strength mmm I've been higher I don't know it's cool I'm stoned I guess this was my only two hits um I probably like let me get one more yeah so out of overall ranking raw garden you get nine and a half out of ten yeah I agree with that I mean I had your Slimer butter I had your orange cookies and those were both pretty good really great Slimer was really good I really liked the orange cookies kind of more more of my flavor the lime is very very strong but that's good I'm stoned so yeah nine out of half nine and a hat nine and a half out of ten for raw garden all right good stuff see it try it out I don't know how raw garden makes it there rosin I wonder if it's with a 20-ton press all right if it's a I don't know man but uh yeah that's it don't forget to check out the grow oh we got the four Girl Scout cookies you got the advance nutrients versus nectar for the Gods versus elite nutrients versus a combo of these two nutrients so right now we are was it yeah we're in date salmon still alright so it's Tuesday so we're in day seven and it's been one week it's been one week since you're looking alright so check it out every Tuesday at 3 p.m. this coming Tuesday will be day 14 and when there should be some signs of buds bug bud igniter was added to two plants the advance and the combo so we shall see if [ __ ] bud igniter is a product that you should probably use your money on or weight or just not use it okie dokie artichokie 's love peace and [ __ ] chicken grease", "wLCWVmjFVls": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out this Dorado premium extracts sour OG now last time I said platinum this time I got it right now it is premium and they labeled this as a blonde BHO so again the strain is sour OG this is labeled a sour OG shatter now shatter is a consistency not a strain as far as I know if anybody's got any different information go ahead and let me know but I would consider that that just like a typo and put sour OG as the strain just because this is clearly not a chef this is more of a crumble BHO Beck's type thing anyway so let's hop right into the numbers now THC a comes in an eighty 1.30 THC comes in at 8.40 with the total coming in at seventy nine point seven zero now if you don't understand why there's three different numbers for THC there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this towards the end that explains that and goes over it and while it's not required for you to know these things in order for you to enjoy your cannabis it is better to know more and then less when it comes to stuff that you're taking into your body at least that's what I think so with that I'm gonna go ahead and pop this guy open now I have a cool little container that I get to keep forever this looks like an SD drive or an SD card holder there we go so this is definitely more of a crumble than anything else let me zoom in for you guys a little bit over my yeah this is like a crumble like wax [Music] yeah more wax and then crumble actually [Music] yeah I would say that this is way definitely more more of a wax than a crumble as far as the smell goes it's just got a hint hint hint a tiny little hint of some citrus and a little bit of pine air not pining this earthiness so I also did just cut a bunch of cilantro so that might be messing with my nose a little bit um let me see hold on yeah so it has a faint pine enos and you definitely smell a little bit of earthiness in there and with that I'm gonna go ahead and try this and I will be back with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that sour OG and it was really good so it as far as the taste goes it wasn't two distinctive nothing I would say stands out as far as flavor but it was a smooth concentrate both in and out it didn't like make you die as you were like smoking it and then as far as the high it was a euphoric uplifting kind of a headiness to a high that kind of had a little bit of a heaviness to it but it wasn't so bad that like I wouldn't recommend it you know how you guys know I hate and like the heady like effect but I would honestly pick this up again because the euphoria out did the headiness the heading is really only stuck around for about 3045 minutes or so just in the initial like while your body's getting adjusted and then once you're kind of used to it mellows out and it goes full it's a TV I guess euphoric like viewing anyway it's like all around a good product great price point so far this is three out of three for these guys I mean they've done pretty well we've been picking because of the price point and the quality is choice so definitely worth checking out that's it I guess if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button and yeah this is recreational for toning I'll be back again with you guys soon", "J8dwN5FaxPk": "what's up y'all it's your boy shep and i'm back with another five ass video of waking bait inc this morning we

last night because me i sleep like a king every night and i hope you guys are having a grand rising this morning hope you guys had an awesome night last night this butt appears to be a little dry but

ass videos all right we got my uh kush cakes in there okay y'all know i do it all the time hello okay so let's get up in here and we're gonna try this today i don't know if i want this so much but we're gonna give it a shot immediately taste the cake oh it didn't take the cake it taste the cake i taste the cake i need to clean my my catcher but like i told you guys it has saved my ball from getting dirty all this is from dirk before i got the catcher to save my bomb so we'll clean that catcher today it's not a very it doesn't expand in your lungs super fast i'm sorry y'all it is quite smooth going down though i taste some type of it tastes almost kind of fruity like a fruity cake fruitcake face ass but it's got like a fruity undertone to it i have a slight burn in a middle back part of my throat like right here in the back i'm already starting to feel a buzz right behind my eyes okay okay okay we can do this this might be a good waking boy handbag i i'm not a fan of torches but one thing about a lighter is you have to hold that [ __ ] there but with the torch it's just uh and it's going oh yeah that is nice no cap it tasted exactly like i expected it to taste the way you expect kush kush cake to taste that's the way it tastes like kush and cakes i mean there's really no surprise with the flavor but it is delicious i'm not even gonna cap on that oh rudy and just like you would expect from it breaking up so easily it appears to be burning kind of fast okay okay all right let's get back in here i'm getting good bait now you hold on a second for the last couple days my eyes been bothering me i don't know what it is i thought it was allergies but see this one's all red i thought it was allergies but the first night scratched it so much that my eye was swollen in the morning you guys probably remember that video wow i'm starting to feel it like right here now like like head high like i feel it yeah right here and on my forehead i i didn't expect this that's i've smoked this before but i don't think i smoked it out of the bone and there's just something something about a bomb i could smoke a whole j you guys seen me smoke a whole jade like two and a half three grams and b be nice and high but i can pack this bowl a half a gram and be just as high as i was i am off that blunt that's crazy i guess it's kind of no sense in doing a live video after this because i'll already be high but i guess i can continue to smoke we are back ladies and gentlemen i'm just playing all right here we go i remember i was talking to my home girl the other day and that was as i was talking she was one like this and i'm like what's wrong with you she's like take some of that bass out your voice i'm like what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] you can't tell the dude to take some bass out of his voice but you know what that's like fighting words you know you say that [ __ ] when you're ready to fight man take some of that base out your voice me bro she said that i was like man you tripping maybe you should go stand across the room if i'm talking too loud for you there you go keep going keep going now close the door here there you go it just made me feel some type of way [Music] i wow that is um wow you know i'll leave that for the critiquing part but um so far we are good to flow i took a side trip there you guys wow wow i took a complete side trip i was like this sheesh you guys are there for the whole experience of it to experience that's how they say that maryland experience man you hadn't experienced didn't you it's experience no it's experience okay wow i don't think i'll be able to make a live video after this you guys look like i'm gonna be too hot oh so yes sir oh rudy tooty we'll take one more then we'll get in there for the critique so you gotta like this lighter though my best friend gave it to me on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of this kush cake we're gonna give it um a a it's a normal flavor in fact i expected the flavor that i got so it's not complex but i can't i can't judge it solely on i've tasted it before because it stands on its own so the flavor the flavor critique number that we're gonna give this is an eight and i think it only got to eight because of the the cake taste because it really tastes good now as i'm breathing out my nose i can taste cake so it is good so i'll give it an eight maybe a high eight that looks funny maybe a high eight anyway i think we're gonna have to pack another bowl because that one burnt burn did it up quite quickly get my butt's getting dry i'm to do something about that all right let's keep the party going let's break this down i had to put um some moistness in my uh in my bag because the weed is getting kind of dry so uh usually you know i tried to put those moist packs in it it didn't work man i don't know how fast i expected it to work but so what i put in my excuse me though if my weed is uh carrots cut up a couple pieces of carrots put it in your bud let it sit in there for a few hours it should moisten your weed right up some people use orange peels i don't use orange peels because i don't want my weed to have flavor and carrot gives it no flavor no i'm saying it doesn't add to it so i did i started doing that when i was a kid i don't know where i learned that from but see if i can find a piece of y'all so see i just stuck it in there like a couple seconds ago and my fingers are moist from the character so every once in a while you spin it around you know i'm pretty sure you guys have your own remedies or things that you do to moisten your weed up but if you're or maybe you guys don't have weed long enough you know to have to moisten it up see when you're smoking out of a pound then you know you're not going to smoke a pound in a couple days so i've i've had that probably about a week week and a half i know how to keep it in jars but it's so much easier if you got like five or six of those bags to have them in a brown paper bag or something if you got five or six jars like big jars and [ __ ] to hold that man you gotta have some space for that [ __ ] you know nephew's house and got all that space so let's keep going y'all i'm finding it hard not to turn this into a a live video you know what i y'all know mean live videos are talking about random stuff random educational stuff to some now that was nice i like that [ __ ] um that green hit i mean that freaking green excuse my language i like that green hit oh wow that was quite pleasant wow it's just a habit now i guess so [ __ ] something to do so the heart is really starting to kick in now and you guys are you guys see i'm taking [ __ ] uh side trips here and there and [ __ ] and [ __ ] i don't know where that came from said what the heck was that wow that was really tasty i think i'm really big guys some people prefer to use torches i don't see no seeds in the bottom of this one guys no pretty goodness oh that was another side trip i'm good though i'm back oh i was gonna do all that whoo that would hurt so i noticed that ever since i've been taking that uh sea monster rsc moss i'm coughing stuff up because that rsc moss is a mucus remover i don't know i guess the toilet just wanted to chime in that helps you know i'm in the bathroom even though it's way down there [Music] oh [Music] boy you almost got me that time goony goo ah [ __ ] all right that was a masterful cough hit i didn't even remember what i was just doing sure oh wait only google okay all right that's it tastes good tonight tonight i feel like this is um uh indica dominant but because although i'm feeling in my forehead i'm really starting to feel it behind my eyes right now and it's like i'm pretty big right now dude like pretty blown away i don't care it's a habit now just add it to the clip rest of the click [Music] it goes on see and after the first day my eyes started doing this i was rubbing it and scratching it now it's all raw and [ __ ] so now i don't scratch it it's like okay i'll just wipe the little tears away and we'll keep it pushing keep it pushing let's go um all right oh wow okay so i think we're pretty base man so it answers that question ah on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] 10 being the good [ __ ] of the high critique of this kush cakes i have to give it a i have to give it a 9 man because i'm pretty high i'm there you guys wow yeah yeah i'll give it a nine definitely um sheesh it it surprised me like i said i've smoked the blunt of this before man i was high but i went this hard and that's only what maybe a gram maybe a gram yeah i put maybe a gram in there the whole time and i'm baked anyway you guys hope you guys enjoyed the video hope it was informative for you um i would definitely recommend kush cakes to anybody man to my homies my friends my people man y'all should try some kush cakes if you run across it get your hands on and grab some of that chip right there heard me um you guys have an awesome day man go be awesome i was gonna say so i was gonna say go be blessed but you guys know what i feel about the word blessed i don't know be less i don't know but anyway you guys have an awesome day pure positive energy and love to you guys i got nothing but love pure love for all of y'all that's unconditional you only got to go home but you got to get the hell out of here you already know what you got to do stay baked", "cX0NVC6d6Bc": "[Music] [Applause] yo what's up guys welcome back to our review and this time as you can see by the title we were obviously back on the caddy weed looking at the year drunken boys packs again it's been a little while since we would pack obviously last ones being me there creams caught and the lava cake you always say I really read both off things we preferred the lava cake too we've still seen here high octane wedding cake as you can see back again this side Lenore wedding cake Ross is coming to have a cupcake so here's the cross for the wedding cake and it's taken out seventy to seventy percent sativa I've just got this sweet so what I'll do is I'll let you not see the year the videos are talking I first got to pack and show you this or close up to the book and all that so guys as you can see obviously but again more jungle boys this time this time little calendar year and they push skating before Cushman's Protestant wedding cake scheanette stems the 70% indicate fate sensitive up 26% in 4.2 THC 31 basically total avoids all the other ghosts or three dark brown just go pack as you see or see [ __ ] you with a new pack now we can verify them and [ __ ] if I can be asked I will stick the very funny like the picture of it being verified in kind of verifiable ever oh well that's yeah if you remember to thought already every yeah as always quite a show you the packaging before even get into it but then you and will cut open will see exactly where the guy doesn't like it got quite a nice move here so it should be quite a nice for you five simple things about this any push Kate in critical thinking personal quite excited and as some of you followed me assume you'll see obviously I did get a free gram of orange cookies recently which are really really good definitely cover packet out because that's some of the best chocolate boys over snowed but I'm excited to try this still see what this is same so yeah we'll get that open see what it's actually looking like as you see she's got that pack open got to be fair I've got some really nice-looking notes just looking in there a lot of tracking coverage as always just wanna see my jungle boys say people seem to have had experience with involved yet to see it so far who knows maybe this will smell like [ __ ] but it's looking now so far I'd say why does submit a wedding cake as well soon as you can smell that wedding cake before yeah nice-looking enormous that's your sleep yeah pretty nice look you're free floss do not too many complaints were straight out the back a couple announced Noakes Sudeep dance probably get that dentist from the Coachman's although I've had C wedding kid it was Dennis like if you watch mark or if you had the wedding cake worked with farmers every day I was super dense - my jungle boys wedding cake this looks like a while ago it's great someone gave me a little bit I didn't actually have a pack what that wasn't quite as dense as this so it's probably getting that from the Cushman's actually had a sort of an opportunity to smoke some Cushman's by a [ __ ] of high the other day but fortunately I didn't know she go through that actually got our wedding cake instead by Teddy coupons let's say regret because that was super young whatever you go watch that yeah this is certainly got a wedding-cake small to it but I think there's I know it's hard when I initially told packet when I first opened out for could smell some of the Cushman sin they're sort of when he's small wedding cake especially to avoid honey cake him you know if he was running cake there is often in that sort of dank fee sort of pushes running that anyway that only slight gap sort of smell and this sort of does have I don't know how the package of smoked more like wedding cable when I did sniffing about packet before I thought I could smell some of the Cushman's going through some of those sort of favors there we go some of those sort of course players coming through but now let's have a packet I tell you what it just smells more like wedding cake straight up sort of vanilla sort of frost in a bit sort of like fresh bait Sordo sort of snow it's a super super nice but nice-looking notes as well a lot see the dents they're a bit either no they're not like here but what we're trying to say there they look I don't know like two more boys sort of wedding cake a little bit more than Noakes there are super dense but they do have that sort of like odd structure to it and like I say when the coachman I saw anyway they had a bit not nice of structure because actually these are super dense but they're a bit soft more well-formed and then these are a bit Nazis aren't looking super suit hanguk say everybody's gonna come mother and they're all board's gonna come differently or whatever bought she's looking fire coupling tract homes a really nice or like green color not the orange hairs are really really bad the room is like a yellow the orange you can't really see that too well yeah the owner G has a very little clock or anything that come aboard in real life the are kidding me quite annoying I always like yellowy cover they do go by orange but yeah I guess we'll get one with the flap shot so you guys as you can see that's the Le crushcakes by Rumble boys push my trusted wedding cake with the flash on you see those pistols colors how they've really really light at the various light cuz they are super super gnarly well I have city Corbin in trichomes absolutely covered yeah to be fair I've got bit mother pushed up going through there the Cushman's way through a bit more on that one but certainly get the wedding cake through the I gave my push-me is actually nice very little bit more coming through what certain you've got the wedding cake to it that's certainly the dominant so a bit of a loss for smaller looks as well pretty smoothly as officers but couple of really really nice ones not too many complaints really I'm just sort of bag appeal some super dense nice naugus I could say they're all absolutely coping tricare's absolutely covered did you see and they push kick number four seventy percent IndyCar little free fall back we can see you know Steve see if no well yeah anyway we'll get back to the review wants to sort of smoke through some of this now you know detects what I'm thinking about so as you can see sweet the fire looking weed really had a really really nice smell about it definitely got a wedding cake fruit when he can't meaning in the Cushman's and the smell but it does have the Cushman's there as well the transmitted radiation notes you see have still got a little bit one tiny one and one side a big one really nice package it is voice do alright with that package in not saying it's the best package in board for so alright now you know if we all know what it is you know I mean obviously half of the intention of the package in anyway so it's a sitting there like 26 percent THC just mention all the times about txt results and store-bought you know some people care about it or bestowed on ones they don't give a [ __ ] about them probably because you know where we are a lot the book that's grant money you ain't gonna get you th see tests on it and stuff like that so I guess in some ways I'm just more used to try and but seeing for myself for the effects to uh stuff like that but yeah they said Niko skate I've got to say soup soup fire really really enjoy that that's say I should have seen really dense North covered in trichomes reading ice or green Cottenham as well yeah I mean every choice I've had so far has been really good let me sprang cranking with an internal so far was the water minutes get also chicane and nine you know I still thought that's pretty far we you know I said of the time of ascending I bet we'd but it was still the fiery or whatever and I've got to say I think this is one of the nicest struggle boys pack stuff person meets moment it's really really nice and it's quite well balanced in the taste you definitely get the wedding came through which is obviously really nice to know I did a wedding cake review recently by Kelly Chris bombs if you haven't watch that go watch that you know but in case one of those trains that it's a lot harder and it came out you know sort once the scene property a few years ago people start paying those attention to it grumble boys doing luck with it and you know jungle boys have got a lot to sort of save for that height and so if you know they're but they're probably what put a lot of people onto it and they've done some great things to some of these wedding cake crosses as well not so I really enjoyed that lava cake and but I think this probably tops it and I've only got a little thirty-five there's a little bit of shame for me this panel pretty but a little bit more the clothes I would have loved some you know bigger notes and stuff like that but yeah it's it's it's got to be up there it's got we want a nice you to go boys packs of certainly smoke for me anyway I mean if you follow me on instagram you will see I got a free gram of porridge cookies bad little boys definitely grabbed a pack of that at some point to properly review because that was sued fire I think that would easily contest with this and it's very different very different in a lot of ways but certainly up there and this sort of level of that that quality but this burns really really nicely super super nicely like ice white sort of a black thing you know it really is uploading have seen Lee and how sort of nice and slowly and consistent you know the food Birds flavor-wise it's all there you know Vince again is one of these strains that has been Gavin a lot Hart round it there's a lot of people that I've been [ __ ] with it doing some really big things of it and back cut boys to bear one good run I nearly had a chance to grab some coffee minutes by a [ __ ] from hi Kelly Park not a dog you on hottie named Taylor uh maybe I should of I'll never actually smoke dresses straight of Cushman's ever have something to eat you know you know restraint across this stuff but this you think you shouldn't get through on the flavor the wedding cakes there some of that Ives the I see sort of vanilla sort of doughy sort when it came to a repeat expect but then it has got this like course wonder turn to it with some of that mint is the wrong word because they don't have a minty taste to it but it does have those almost like just like minty notes to it even with the coffee that makes sense cuz I'm certain course takes a different you know there's cush to taste more like there--they and its course to taste bit one mint a little bit others and this is certainly get some of those notes fruit not to say that you know they're overly apparently not but he's quite more balanced is what translated flavor you know it's quite often we see these strains you know that get crossed and you have like for example push me on this and cross the wedding cake it's quite often you know one of them can get lost in the strain and it seems like once but you know it's really more thumbing in one side I mean thinking about that lava gate you know certainly a lot more high-octane Union than it was when ek be in it and that's why I didn't give it its very high score so I'll get it up so it's lap to do remember that but this is really really well balanced and then it says what it is what it says on the tin what can't say it is wedding cake possible questions you can certainly tell that you know Pink's it's what I was expecting it in many ways you know it hasn't let me down whatsoever I've heard good things about this Elliott cutter cake you know I get it what are they drunk boy perhaps that had to cool things about so for a copy of an it was there and but yeah you know again I said this earlier every time I get an was it's been good so far really quick to be honest you know I've seen people have complaints about certain strains you know say this what's coming that means but I haven't seen it yet you know for Duke I will say now we're just do something a good brain because it is true more boys at the same time lots going not something down cause it'll go boys and this has been a fire strange you never few like push myths and that if you want your type of thing you know and as you like wedding cake as well then this is bang-on feared you're not I mean it if you like their flavors you're gonna love this for me personally I probably wouldn't say this is my curse and all that preference of best flavor I've ever sort of smoked but it's so you know he's so well balanced and it's so sort of thing before you what it's meant to be yeah I can't knock it down too much because it is like I see what it says on the tin if that makes sense a good sort comparison I guess is addressed on the ping crunch of you coming back so back again if you haven't watch that go watch it see what I was saying on that obviously that got a really high score as well I probably preferred that flavor and you know that sort of skateboards crossed with gelato those hobbies I thought very brave sort of notes and a sweet sort of gelato days is that sure you split it and I probably preferred that flavor if you just could compare down to the two flavors this smoke is so clean and you know probably a bit cleaner than vibrant in all honesty you know it's well it might not be is certainly a [ __ ] nice flavor and it's certainly really clean smoke and it does a job as well you know is she but we really really high it's like as much as a barbecue but I definitely lock it down too much because it does still have really good effects you know you do certainly feed it all the way through your body it lasts for a while as well yeah which is what we're looking for really humidities it's all good having good you know feelings off both with Inger and that's for too long and you miss make them through that we've quite quickly but this is really nice long lasting effects I'd like to say again the taste you know gosh minutes maybe that maybe it's not my perfect strain but I've got a lot of respect for it because every time I've seen a strain with it involved it's been good so far and like I say I did see some pics of that Cushman's publish up high and did a little super fire I might have to grab some at some point see exactly what that is saying but yeah I've not been disappointed by this one it's always been oh absolutely fired from the boys back you know as far as sort of the dream of us we've had on this channel I think I'm gonna say it's probably the best party pad on it so far and I think I've been thinking about rating for this board it's quite difficult certainly the knives they certainly quite hard arms yeah give this board a 9.5 a 9.5 I was very very close to giving it like a nine point six nine foot seven it's just the fact that this flavor isn't necessarily my favorite flavor if that makes sense it's hard to explain because it's absolutely fired absolutely fire I'm not from a knock it at all because it's like to say the best room was packed with having the channel and it is absolutely fine really clean smoke but I just think like that white rooms for example I preferred that flavor and the things that I've given higher marks in a 9.5 like the wedding cake you never gave it off with six like a pound cake in half okay warheads given up by six all of them I did prefer to this soon as I mean whether this is some of the smoke this was maybe a little thicker in a bit it sort of smoother the midway through those those flavors what sort of put them just a little bit higher like the wedding cake and the warheads and the pound cake was even higher than that because no need to look further flavor but the saw it cleanness of the smoke could also level with this quite easily and the board structured all the rest of it so yeah I'm gonna give that a nine point five like safe this is a first if you are watching sorry if this is the first review you're watching and you think in not when fire boss who's not getting it a ten you know obviously it's not quite all that no data forward you know go watch some of the other videos if it's an anti five that's absolute fire I didn't give out that scores I got to you know all too easy or whatever so yeah and I'm point five I'd like to say I'm really happy this back certainly one of the best from the boys back to that obviously I've been smoking and fly through all the color packs and I've been solved moving away from the boys a little bit trying for you all the things and you know some have been better than jungle boys so I've not been kind of get back to it too much but I have seen you know they've got some really five strings so I think I'm gonna have to drop back to my phone in a little bit I'd say I do need the Irish cookies in my life to do a proper review and then the stool of things I want to try as well a mai tai The Milk Bone closely I've seen the play with star dog before that was quite interested and if being from over here and I'm CPS or there's sort of breakout Starbuck you know the last sort of four or five years the amount you know it's gone from it literally just being like Manchester to every one of the country smoking a star Barry a few notes here as much a me about all these different crosses as well sort of thing I need Starbucks been around for longer for five years both if you came really blew up that four or five years ago so it's crazy to see sort of drama boys claiming strings like that so I thought that was interesting max to upon that but yeah there's a couple there's a couple of the dry recently that I thought they'd little fire to be fair should really see what they're say anything get manzelmann but we've certainly got some more fire coming your way not necessarily doodle boys but there are packs in the pipeline so far UK some more fire Kelly packs I can't wait to review really Ford smoking strip but yeah um the boys aspire like say this Cushman's I do need to drag it myself my hands on the proper course means because I'm trying to watch you strays now with this you know it's been crossed with you know cooking this part of genetics and I've really enjoyed every well I know he like plays maybe it's not my perfect flavor boy the buds always seem to be coming down to the moment when everybody Cushman so yeah I'm reading it again another five little boys back again you know that smoking was worth 22 a long time ago and not a long tapping table a while ago and it wasn't my package some wanted to bless me of a little bit of it let me have a try and stuff and I'll read this more than that or more than erase that little bit yeah not if you aren't already following his Instagram gay father wasn't now you know subscribe leave us a comment here's a nice let's me if you submit this if you enjoyed it if you've got any strange YC try and get hold of let us know 21 that's showing support and you know showing love or whatever you know big thank you and yeah way back you have another review", "dn0IqgWcR9w": "got it yep okay so today it's I went to I dropped off the dead head at the cop you did you know and Clio yep no it was that vehicle city social which is up in Flint oh it's not right off a door but it's a mile off the door Highway I don't remember the other Road but it's like you walk in and their security person checks in and at first I had to go straight through because where they're taking the stuff was in the back of like a back section that was not being used okay and even back there they have booths it was like it's an old restaurant slash camera clothing so me you you type thing because it's bars all the way around and everywhere in the bars are farmers market is a farmers market basically yeah they have a farmers market what is this all day they go not be usable like you walk in so you walk in there's woman is all over toys yeah just boost everywhere and people are smoking I don't know we're about to find out that's where you guys yeah so that's where this comes on I like to vehicle is it East ocean so so okay is what it's called and right now in vehicle city social this guy sells his stuff there Iceman's premium meds I put lift it there so I think I'm pretty sure he said this was the best we got Ellen cush cake some cherry it's just a cherry on the thing and then I don't remember what this one is yeah and then I forgot what the third one was we're also doing another car so glue yeah question mark yeah question mark yeah well said carry something it's just cherry cherry yeah it's a new money to the boy that's nice it says everyone so okay so la cush cake we'll start with but yes it was a was it pretty cool yeah I mean it's they just took my money chatted with me a little bit but oh that's what it is this is super glue I remember now Oh super glue glue yeah the end that's why I grabbed it it was like now glue and cookie cutter using it the most attention right right so super glue is the third one we're gonna test okay so everyone pass it around the buds I mean all right they're dense but not funky dense I guess does the word we like to use funky dancer yeah well you know where they've got that sponge it's not hard news yeah it's spongy but official the artificials yeah yeah I think I think so let's introduce we got a round here today oh Rudy as always you can hear Zane already yeah and then I got my buddy chef here joining us today [Music] smells good it doesn't have that weird sponginess that you're talking about you yeah it is a little spongy but it's not as like super harden so right all right but we'll see what the smell like that though that's yeah so I'm probably gonna have chat or cut make some search for the river of Hashcash cousin not used to do and walk wrong with at least shirts on that's a michigan cannabis review awesome dude I like that oh my gosh this little dude seriously like every time I think about it man yeah you been though haven't you I've never missed a year yeah how is it what is it like it's the coolest thing I've ever seen in my [ __ ] life hands it down everyone is blaze they're demantoid free dabs people got live plants they're [ __ ] live plants yeah the sell well we're just there so while some people yes so for example they have a company that makes nutrients or whatever and they were giant muscle it was Brule she looks like shows up show what Lanta yeah and what one company rattled off a three pound plan which I thought that was a great way to get your name out there you know seriously like three powers exactly well there was an estimate obviously yeah yeah exactly yeah it took like a half hour to just to cut it down cut it into little buzz be gentle with it I'm like I just want to [ __ ] her down here throw it in a bag and drive it home if do it it is the coolest thing I have ever been to in my life seriously like and and I planned this trip like way ahead of time already bought my tickets and a hotel and [ __ ] like I would have cancelled I won't have to to already but I go with my family so like you know yeah and the VIPs are all so into it collective yet these are all sold oh I dunno well the VIP is they sold they actually sold out before like earlier like a month or two ago and they really they release some more dude that's awesome I don't love to hear the people were you know yeah it gives you I think they have a special area to smoke with water and 1te to get it yeah yeah your bathrooms yeah they go to a three well there's three different color Brisbane exactly like no just the movement last weekend and you know like the only difference at the VIP is like the like nice bathrooms too which is fine it's the old bathrooms to piss in and I like this with like some of the posters I got in previous years are [ __ ] dope man that's almost yeah a pee interest but it's only forty or five dollars more exactly yeah well you're gonna pay that much water or l4 up a baby right yeah we just was this is a la p\u00eache I'm sorry yes no Nico should take the other he's going to the Voodoo fest e1 tickets on the radio no New Orleans look at 3d Festival nice show it up the day after Halloween guerrilla [ __ ] all three days damn but yeah that was that's why I was like here trying skin because they had little scanners and the wristbands there I don't know if I can get it right yeah I would recommend getting there early dude I got there a noon once and waited for hour and a half to even with the VIP a yes seriously dude that the Chen ta emission was shorter line than the VIP one there's like oh I don't think that's gonna be the same this year you don't think so no because I think the GA is gonna be very the general mission is gonna be a lot just from people from fact that sold out now right for a VIP well I'm talking to will called out where you got to go and get your wristband right I got a piece of paper I print it out you got to take that piece of paper to the front desk and have them give you a wristband for oh okay if the will come that's the line that takes forever if you don't get there early enough but I made some cool friends in mind you know that's usually what happens where they're waiting in line like that but I only have me smoking some weed yeah it's awesome and we should I got to be Danny Danko a short life right or not even doing they're just walking around you know if you recognize them I saw Jenny take a walk through the bathroom I'm like okay what's up man he's like you know he's like 4 foot 10 so yeah I was like oh okay well he's not bachelor he's a really short guy you know like that I know it's right away he's such a cool dude though right pretty much he's the man he's the man dude this whole thing and he's super nice you smoked me down it is [ __ ] cool as hell okay of course he's got a line of people that want to talk to him okay zealot I chase them I've talked to him you know like it's pretty well there's a bit with my tail - that's the wrong table in my back room tell people you get drinking it's got to be inside the inner circle [ __ ] cuz then even deuces tail would go over quiet before the storm really interested because I talked to the guys up north well I dropped off some stuff saw the property it's a giant piece of empty land obviously is that one little build yeah and it's literally right off the highway so it's a block or like a half a mile off the exit you're gonna be working at wall yeah something awesome too late we're still waiting for all the you know because he he was telling me today that let's do this real quick and and we'll go in today all right I'm gonna I'm gonna start this one the LA cush cake I get a five I think it's there's not really a lot of flavor to me but it's it's fine it doesn't like have a bad taste that makes me want to do it yeah but at the same time it doesn't have a strong flavor uh-huh that's how I feel I'll give it a five so let's go Rudy I'll give it a four to half four and a half to be honest why before that the taste is so so it doesn't have a bad aftertaste but eight yeah what's it taste like it does this like it does have a beauty does it was like blue tit yeah I agree with you I want to give it a seven because after I hit it the second time all right thing I'm gonna say six I thought like you know it's smell what a friggin then dug up Oh smells so [ __ ] good but the taste that really translates milk to the smell which is kind of a disappointment but you know not horrible you know better than average but if you turn to help tell what the high - you know when you're placing all day all right unless something really punches through then you know but right is this your first walk of the day already today my weights on my way to work about 5:20 and then in you know the way of course of course just after four 20s I get our 4:30 that fellow's enough all right so that's not bad 6.1 that average the taste is mild like the smell to me it's mild see I thought that smells pretty strong like when you're brushing that nugget well it don't know aftertaste no smell a little chewy yeah I'm looking that is kind of cheesy smelling a little bit but you know compared to some of the [ __ ] we smoked I definitely see a six point one cuz like I said yeah the scale is basically five means I'm going to hit it and I'm gonna be like cool for sure you know I'm saying right six seven it's gonna be more like like saying stuff where I'm gonna be like what the [ __ ] is it I magically after the second eight I'm like yeah taste those something different there no yeah so and then that happens with yeah that's gonna happen that's why you know you got a swamp at least three or four hits before you [ __ ] you be given an eight second one I've given a you don't coops give them I mean yeah that's the hate Ross hate like actual cake yeah Miller cake oh okay I guess that's why it would say cake I pick up a little on that damn cake stream before that kind of tasted like that is evolving a little bit more it was around I forgot to bring the [ __ ] gelato haha all right underneath", "g9wtSpo_7pE": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're going to be tapping into another alberta-based grow with natural history melon cookies you guys voted this and it destroyed the nor'easter from scotia that it was up against so let's tap into some melon cookies today i'll see you guys on the other side uh when we're actually getting into this train y'all cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro today we're going to be getting into natural history's melon cookies so this is going to be a sativa dominant hybrid based strain it came in with a thc total of 18.8 a cbd total of nothing zero snota nothing there it was packaged on the 28th of our august august 28 of august and it came up right around that 40 to 45 dollar range for the eighth plus tax 42.99 i believe is what it was for me at my shop so that is the information that we have for natural history the only thing i was able to pull from it for like strain grower based information is that it's from the atlas growers company and that is going to be based out of edmonton so only two and a half hours south of where i'm located so they're local or as local as uh we're gonna get on a national market you guys so i'm really excited to see how this alberta does alberta bud does we are uh gonna roll on over into the urban scale now because i don't have any more info for you guys so uh i'll see you over there when we're getting into the look and roma before we pack up the vaporizer the bongs the pipe our joint then we finish it off with the high in the overall you guys we got a score out of 60 to get into so let's start doing it with looking roma see you guys on the other side of the intro welcome back you guys now that we're officially going with this garbage scale let's crack open this bag and see what we can smell wow i'm already get before i even have the zipper open i'm already starting to get a kind of dank aroma for this bag so let's open it up and see what we're going to get you guys oh definitely stinky bud it's got a really fresh kind of fruity aroma to it overall you get really nice quality nugs in here decent cake let's open it up get a little sunlight in here so we can see how these buds look they're absolutely coated in crystal you guys this is some of the best looking legal market cannabis i've ever seen holy crap they do look like they weren't hang dried but more trimmed and laid to dry there's a little bit of pancaking to them but all in all that's not a major disappointment for me you guys at all like a little bit of a pancaking nug because it was not hang dried that's a pretty minor thing for me to get up set with with these eights um the aroma you're getting off of this is gonna be a really kind of cushy hint but it's got that sweet um all right that's there we go i dropped another one of these big ones it's got this really sweet kind of kick to it at the same time the flowers themselves are really dense moist as well really good coloring you've got the purpling in there really deep emerald green as well just a beautiful looking but an outcome to this grow you guys i i'm not going to give it a 10 just because the aroma isn't blowing up at me and really getting me as excited as i um think i could be and it's more just a personal preference to to the way that these buds tend to smell but i can't knock it down more than that one preference point right it's a personal preference point that is really what that 10 is and a 9 is incredible you guys i am very impressed with how well this bud looks and smells and just overall quality especially being in the bags where they're a little bit more exposed to being crushed and being um like damaged there's a lot more potential that when they're in the bags versus the containers you guys just when we're handling them versus being bounced around in the containers so i don't know it's it smells great when you bust it up in the in the grinder it's just got that same rich flavor and aroma that's pushing through there you guys and the 9 out of 10 is the best i'm going to give it but we'll be back when we have everything packed up and ready to go and we'll be taking our first tastes through the boundless vaporizer here you guys i'll see you guys when we do have all that ready to go and uh we're getting going cheers and i'll see you over there hey guys so we've got the boundless vaporizer packed up and ready to go we're going to turn that sucker on and we're going to run it at 175 degrees to open this review off at 175 degrees we're going to get the limonene and the maracinin flavors primarily present being present in that temperature because that's really where they start to boil off after that we bump it up to the 205 where that's going to be the next major point for the majority of the terpenes starting to boil off so you're going to get the rest of the flavor you're going to start to get that chocolate that cheese the the richer flavors that you're more accustomed to having when you're smoking and then once we bump it up to the 220 we're going to be getting primarily a beta-carotene dump so that is going to be where you get your peppery woody type of flavors as well at the 220 you're gonna get the heaviest dump of thc coming off of these plants as well because that is primarily where the thc starts to boil off so with all that rattle off you guys we got the 175 ready to go we're going to take our first taste through here see how it does and then we're going to move up to the 205 the 220 before we start playing with some flame and getting into our bong rips but for the time being you guys 175 is the temperature we're going to play with so let's start doing that really light dank flavor there is some kind of humid dewy touch to it it doesn't really lean one way or the other it's just really refreshing and it's kind of like uh a um like infused water like a melon cucumber infused water kind of flavor with a little bit of a cushy undertone you guys it's not bad it's quite enjoyable to 175. we're going to bump it up to the 205 and see all of the rest of terpenes starting to come into the play because something cool with with these bags i don't know exactly how the terpenes line up with color but that bar right there is supposed to match up with the terpenes that are involved so the black and these are all my guesses you guys the black i'm going to guess is going to be the beta carefully with the black pepper the yellow is going to be the limonene to the lemon oh we got kind of a cushy tone in there you guys that that undertone became the primary tone i'm gonna guess the red is probably going to be a maracinine flavor the blue i'm not 100 sure what the blue would be the green there i would assume is going to be a uh pinene flavor like a penine flavor and then that purple on the back is going to be the linole linolol but that that one and the blue that's the one thing i'm not sure and then i don't know what would be the last one there you guys but that bar is supposed to be there to tell you about the terpenes the terps that i'm getting at this 205 level are going to be that cushy dominant that really heavy kind of cookies flavor i'm getting there and i'm really enjoying it at that 205. it's not overwhelming it's not over dominating on the flavor it's very light very kind of water infused type of flavor and honestly you guys it is blowing me away and i'm enjoying it so much right now but we're at 220 degrees we're gonna see what the beta carefully and the thc dump is going to do with the flavor i'm hoping we get more of that woody flavor keeping it light keeping that infused but uh i always end up getting surprised at this temp you guys so let's try it out oh it did go with a heavier pepper but it's not the burn it's just that kind of rich spiced flavor like there's no ring of fire around my throat that i typically find especially with that pepper flavor but all in all you guys it was really light for the flavor that i was experiencing and i wish it was a little bit stronger even in the end i wish there was a little more to it i'm going to give it an 8 out of a 10 because there were some points in there that i did enjoy and that kind of infused water flavor was enjoyable and quite delectable actually at that 205 that was really where i found it the most enjoyable because it had the kind of water infused damp flavor that sit on your tongue and then it would also transition into kind of that dank undertone cookie type of flavor that i do really enjoy you guys and it did quite well with the two but before we move on into the bongs i'm going to quickly go and grab my ashtray we'll be back when we're starting to light these seconds up through the bongs and you guys know how we do it we start out with the hemp wick we follow it up with a clipper lighter and then a jet lighter last so when i'll be back hemp works gonna be lit up and we're gonna be ready to roll through these three rigs y'all i'll see you over there there we go you guys now the sun's transitioned a little bit we can bring a little more natural light in and improve your guys's view of this ugly mug but the only way we're going to get this review back on the road and back where it should be headed is lighting up the hem brick and starting to smoke from the rigs you guys like i said before i uh left we're going to hit up with the clip the light the hemp wick then the clipper before we finished off with the torch you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how uh how this melon cookies are gonna taste to the rig i hope we get a more intense and more enjoyable flavor than we did through the vaporize you guys but as i always say the only way we're gonna find out is by finding out cheers i'll see on the other side of these three bomb rips here's our [Music] oh hey guys so i'm gonna give this a 10 out of a 10 for the taste from a bong this blew me away honestly for the flavor it blew me away right from this little guy all the way to the big cyclone the rich dense flavor that came off of these nugs and this strain holy [ __ ] is all i'm gonna say um then i'll explain why but um it started off honestly the flavor increased with the rig that i was smoking the bigger the rig the bigger the bowl the better the taste the the cyclone surprisingly was the best tasting bud and i do think it's more so from the jet lighter than the rig itself because the intensity that i got through the nice glass beaker the medium one the second rig was just as enjoyable as a cyclone it just wasn't as intense and i'm thinking the amount of bud played a factor into that versus the s and and honestly the ignition source too because there's a big more mud more bud in the eyeball bowl in the third rip than there was in the second one and i usually do that because lighting it different ways the least amount with the hemp wick it's the longest draw and some strains taste better when you let them draw out you can really get that resin build up in the bowl too that i lean more to the hemp wick but strains like this where that fast burn get them hot the jet lighter was definitely my preferred way to smoke this strain for the flavor you guys and i i really enjoyed it and as we got bigger bongs bigger bowls bigger flavors so this is definitely a strain that i'm finding the taste is gonna be dependent on how one how you consume for the bong and how big of a bomber if you're willing to take the bigger the better in my opinion with this drain you guys but uh we're gonna find out if the pipe's the same way we've got our crave straight pipe here we're gonna light up with the hemp work today because why in the [ __ ] not but um let's uh see how this pipe does you guys and i'll uh be chatting your air off on the other side nine out of ten without a doubt you guys this developed into a totally different kind of flavor one that i was not expecting what so ever it produced a chocolate flavor like i don't know what part of the melon cushy combo is gonna produce this chocolaty flavor but it did and i'm enjoying it a lot you guys like a lot um it's not something i would pick over the that really cushy flavor that i got in the bongs i much prefer that flavor just for my own self but this was a good good unique kind of uh kind of take on the strain and i'm i'm enjoying it i gave it a 9 out of 10 purely because it was quite enjoyable but not what i want you guys and that's honestly why i knock points out is more personal preference than anything else but um i don't know why i stuck the lighter in my pocket but parker lighter in my pocket lighter in my pocket but take a couple dry hauls through uh through this joint where you're using one of these piranha cones i've enjoyed these quite a bit they're not quite at the elements and vibes blue paper level they're just a hair below still good enough to smoke for a review you guys ooh really fruity and really fresh kind of flavor there is that hint of a kush but still really enjoyable let's light it up and try it out you guys i'll see you in about halfway through okay guys i'm gonna get into end up giving this a nine out of ten has a pretty enjoyable flavor overall and it's quite an intense experience from the start to the finish i'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys however it does go more that rich chocolatey side and not so much the sweet cushy side that i really fell in love with through the bong um i'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys and the 9 out of 10 isn't is a really really great score for this train i just honestly do wish it had more of that kind of sweet cushy flavor that it had through the bong but uh yeah oh [ __ ] of course she went out but we're gonna give the high as well a 9 out of 10. it's a nice body-mind combo it's got more relaxing and ease to it than i was expecting and then that i uh i honestly am enjoying it quite a bit but since the first rip um through the cheechbong i've had a little bit of a headache sitting in the back of my head from it and it's disappointing you guys it really is especially when the high has that good mental drift to it you can kind of ease it out but that headache was there right from the get-go which is disappointing you guys really really is disappointing the body ease and relaxation i'm i'm enjoying that i just i wish that headache wasn't there and it'd be a no question 10 out of 10. but we can only give her a nine just because of that headache lingering there but the mental drift and that body eats it's it's definitely a video game type of weed you guys but overall and uh wrapping this video up 54 out of 60. beautiful herbs without a doubt it did incredible i am been so lucky with the strains i've been smoking lately they've been all really incredible and i've honestly had kind of the pick of the litter i've been picking the top strains that excite me and really get me um looking forward to these reviews and excited to smoke these strains and i'm really finding that uh lately these these straights have been doing it for me but the joints done i hope you guys enjoyed we're gonna wrap this

what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review it's coming to you by mojave reserve i know i have done a few of these recently but i'm falling in love with this company uh so far they're a perfect two out of two let's see if we can get a perfect three out of three today the strain we're going to be reviewing is the kush cake it's coming to you at a 27 on the thc and a .05 on the cbd that comes to you at a total 32 percent cannabinoids which i hate saying that [ __ ] word it's got a real gassy plus a little bit of a sweet smell to it it looks really good it's got a lot of uh frost on it nice dense buds they look really good and they smell amazing and like always if you guys want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out as you can see there it looks tremendously good it's got a crazy good smell to it this is a hybrid i want to say it's an indica dominant and how you get the kush cake is you cross cush mint with wedding cake well that's the information i found online if that's not correct then [ __ ] are putting out false info and this is going to run you 36 for the 8th at blue fire dispensary in merced california where i get my amazing product so without further ado let's get into it people cheers the kush cake by mojave reserve that was a fat hit i could already feel a sweat starting to come damn that was [ __ ] excellent for the first hit first initial thought it was smooth it doesn't have my throat [ __ ] up but it gives you that lung expansion your head [ __ ] instantly fills it your eyes go down uh this is a heavy you know a heavier weave this isn't one that you're gonna want to smoke and go to work on this is a relaxing [ __ ] a strain right here [Music] man so far i like everything that i [ __ ] touch by mojave reserve it's a great company i highly recommend trying them out they do have a black label and a white label i want to say the though the jars with the white labeling are lower on the thc i don't i don't know if that's like outdoor grown or whatnot i'll do a little bit of research for you guys and find that out for you but as far as i know the only difference between the white label and the black label are the thc content they say the white label is lower and these are your higher [ __ ] thc so 27 it hits like a 27 percent it's quite good but like everybody knows two for the review i got the other one packed with my other bong here just give me a second gotta get my my lungs back that was a pretty heavy hit holidays are coming up we got halloween uh then we got thanksgiving and christmas uh make sure you guys don't get your [ __ ] christmas shopping late get it done early bust out the holiday movies start watching the the home alone one and two those those are always perfect for around christmas thanksgiving they're well more christmas it's a great christmas movie i [ __ ] love uh both of them one and two i don't like all the rest that they made but home along one and two the one with macaulay culkin that was a dope ass flick okay let's get the other one in two for the review we are going to be ending it with a shotgun so stay tuned for that all right damn it first one got me let's see damn these bongs are like got a lot of water they're filtered really well so they do hit very smooth but i can tell you this is a for it being as as heavy as it is like a heavy hitter like it is it's a it's a really smooth strain it doesn't get your your throat all [ __ ] up but it does get that chest expansion and you do have to take a second in between hits because it does hit you pretty hard and that's coming from me i smoke a [ __ ] lot so the kush cake by mojave reserve not bad at all it's right there even with the other ones that i've got the skittles i think it was called skittles mints the other one of the other ones and the other one was the mojave kush i think if i remember correctly i don't know what score i gave him i know it was in the mid like the 8.45ish type deal and this is going to be right there with it you know let's calculate it up price thirty six dollars uh an eight at blue fire dispensary other places it might be different but where i go to in merced california blue fire it's 36 dollars for the eight the look and the smell amazing it's real gassy a little bit of sweet uh it's very well manicured looks really good really good the smoothness is there the flavor is i can't really pinpoint it but it's not bad it's it's a good flavor and the high is definitely there it's becoming a typical [ __ ] mojave reserve high for me i'm loaded and i'm gonna have to give it right there where i give the other ones this one is a 8.4 out the door it's a must grab if you guys see it i highly recommend almost any mojave reserve product i'm giving this one the kush cake an 8.4 out the door it's very [ __ ] good i highly recommend it and uh let's get the shotgun in huh people and we'll do a hoot and shoot style smoking on the last of my la cush federal federal reserve cart if you guys haven't seen that review go ahead and go check it out but without further ado a sealed beer as you can see let's get this in huh still catching my breath from that last hit i'm telling you this [ __ ] packs a punch i like it though i like a real

unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing kush cake number five by divine river healing company and the kush cake is a indica strain it is a hybrid indica dominant strain that is crossed between cushman's and the ever popular wedding cake both of those two strains to the parent genetics of this are two of my favorites so i know the child genetics are going to be ones that i like so i'm gonna go ahead bring this stuff up on the screen right now for you guys to check out and then we are gonna take a look at it together all right so you just had a chance to check out this kush cake number five by divine river healing company what did you guys think so before i get into it and i pop the top on this i kind of want to tell you guys about my experience of buying this stuff so i purchased this stuff from the nirvana center in tempe and i had a bait and switch from those guys and so i want to tell that story what had actually happened you guys i was going in to take advantage of some first-time patient specials in there and i saw on their website that it said restrictions apply under the new patient buy one you know eight get one free so i called and said well what are the restrictions you know is it apply to certain brands like if i get one growth science can i get another growth science yeah yeah you can you can verified exactly what i needed to know only to get there for them to tell tell me no no that's not the case actually at all you have to pick out one of our strains it doesn't apply to guest strains the girl that i was working with phoenix over there she was extremely extremely sweet went up to the manager explained the situation manager did absolutely nothing you guys did nothing to stand by the fact that they gave me misinformation and rather than just take it you know take care of it what would it have cost to them you guys it would have cost them so so little but now i don't plan to go back to nirvana center to be honest you guys because that experience was terrible and i am going to tell you about this kush cakes and i don't think this part has to do with nirvana center but you guys when i first got home i pulled one of these nugs out okay just like i'm doing right now now you can't see it and i'm gonna try to block my face so it zooms on this nug and this nug looks great by the way this nook had tiny little hairs like they weren't spider mites or anything they were tiny hairs embedded throughout this butt like as if this got a dog was just rolling around in it and mind you like it wasn't like they were just sprinkled on the outside like they were embedded in there i needed to use actual tweezers to pull out hairs from one of these buds and it was just one of the buds but it was like one of the biggest nugs in the jar and the jar didn't really come with very many nugs since they were both just like kind of two larger sized nugs so one of them legit had tons and tons of hairs i was plucking them out with tweezers and then when i called to tell them about it you guys they were like kind of like being like oh yeah you know you're gonna need to like bring this stuff back and yeah we're gonna need to inspect it and something like you guys i drove 30 minutes so it's you know 30 30 that's an hour round trip i'm not sitting driving around with this stuff in my car for weeks until i get down to tempe arizona meanwhile i live in scottsdale again i thought that was just so booth you guys so bunk on their behalf like i'm not planning to go back to nirvana center and though phoenix was a great dispensary agent like this quote like that can't happen divine river healing and cup and inc you guys this sucks this review sucks for me and i'm gonna tell you why this review sucks for me okay cuz gosh this looks this bud looks amazing like bag appeal you guys to me it's a nine on the verge of a ten like it's right there bag appeal so nine in between a ten and i don't even know no matter what how good this is potency-wise i don't think that i can possibly recommend it because of that hair situation i mean i'm going to try and look past it and we'll see i'd like to give them you know the benefit of the doubt that something just happened with that but talk about quality control that is crap quality control you guys a bud full of hair not just sprinkled on the outside again embedded in the bud you guys unbelievable so let's talk about this stuff so you guys when i broke this jar open i forgot what we were even reviewing today i just pulled out one of the jars and i had gotten many different things so when i pulled this stuff out i was like man it smells like kush then the next thing i said was man it smells like almost like wedding cake too and then i look at it i'm like it's kush cake that's hilarious so talk about you guys when you've been doing this as long as i have and you can identify a bud strictly based on its smell like that was even honest to god when that happened i was like damn dude you've been doing this a long time you need to get a new freaking hobby man you're a nerd so that was hilarious you guys is like because the terps on this are banging like you get that kush then that wedding cake i kind of put it into like the docido category there you know but like it is it's wedding cake you guys kush with wedding cake just perfectly like they had a baby almost more of the cake smell than the kush but god the terps are banging on this stuff you guys and when i broke this stuff up for the vape the terps were hitting even harder like aromatic filled up the room so man i can't wait to smoke this stuff i'm glad i got all those hairs out of out of it i actually think i took the nug that didn't have hairs in it because i am honestly i'm gonna bring this stuff back you guys like this to me is like unacceptable um but you gotta draw the line somewhere know your boundaries you guys today we're gonna be enjoying this out of my arizer extreme q vape i've got it set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see there and that is then been fed into my scientific inhalations triple filter bubbler whoa and that is right here i've just cleaned this bad boy out as i do before every one of our sessions here just so you guys know these are completely fair starting with ground zero so i've got nothing in the first chamber which is where carbon goes that would typically catch ash in the second filtration chamber which is just some brand new purified water in there and my third chamber i've got as always the organic cotton filter to filter out any remaining impurities that did not get purged out in the growing process so without further ado let's try out some of this cushman's number five by divine river healing inc now wow buttery smooth you guys buttery smooth classic pine flavor kush is cutting through actually that wedding cake now which is funny because the smell to me was more cake than kush but the other thing i wanted to say with this stuff you guys is it's like it's still a little bit spongy a little bit spongy and like damn that was actually some like they call it hang time you know like when you're pushing you're pushing it together and then it sticks to your fingers i typically don't like to do that but you guys it's it's like not super super dense not super fluffy so kind of right there in the middle but i'm diving back in for the second one i want more of that flavor i'll savor the flavor oh wow this thing is firing on all cylinders and i had a real nice little head rush there so there's some potency to this now you guys that subtle sweetness from the wedding cake it's kind of coming through now i'm still getting some of those kush flavors there mostly the kush flavor actually but now that sweetness is lingering on my tongue so it's actually interesting like really good variety of both but like those terps are super super fiery you guys so i'm gonna finish out this bowl and then while i'm doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen so you guys can check this stuff out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so here it comes now all right so you are looking at the kush cakes number five by divine river healing incorporated you guys talk about unbelievable proportions of crystals to hairs this looks like quintessential wedding cake but it is like those bright orange hairs we love seeing with those amazing neon green undertones there with even a little bit of purple kind of coming out from the bottom there this stuff looks really ridiculous all right so i am back after trying out this kush cake number five by divine river healing inc and i want to talk about it you guys so i'll tell you what you know you guys just heard my story about this stuff here and honest to god it just that crushes me right that crushes me so like what i would say about this stuff is it's hard to even i i i don't want to review this based on the one bud that i got that was covered in hair although i should although i absolutely should disqualify this stuff consider it a snickel immediately give them the x don't try this don't buy this and honestly you guys you know i would say maybe just proceed with caution from here on out because this is like a disclaimer that like if you're getting this especially from that batch from nirvana center make sure that they're looking at the nugs inspecting the nugs there because it's basically deli style there which means that they're gonna be in big jars which i think actually is probably the better way to sell this product um and then they'll weigh it out for you so make sure they're looking at those buds really really well if you end up going out to buy this stuff and i mean you know my personal take on this stuff is like it tasted just like it smelled and that made the actual smoke of it really really enjoyable for me it was extremely smooth you know the wedding cake always had that like nice sweet creamy like light delicate sweet cake kind of flavor you know um so think of kind of creamy sweetness you know but then those cush undertones are still there which makes this stuff just a friggin damn killer for me um i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one more time so you guys can check it out one last time before i give you guys my final rundown on this stuff okay so you've seen it a handful of times you guys and you know i gotta tell you i gotta tell you like i was sitting and i'm like oh you know because i'm not rating it as if you know there was a hairy butt i'm just rating it as if this was like a nug that again had nothing wrong with it when i first got it and one of these nugs or the majority of the nugs didn't have anything wrong with it this stuff looks killer you guys and honestly they've got flavor it smells it's got the terpenes it's got terpenes you guys the terps are there and the taste is there and the potency in my opinion is there like this is an indica hybrid and i would actually go ahead and say i pretty much agree with this it's hitting me more like just a hybrid a balanced hybrid but i would say that if you're you know not quite as heavy as a consumer as i am you know then you're probably gonna take this like an indica i'm not joking you guys don't play with this stuff ah because it's fiery i wish you guys could smell it i wish i could give you guys a little smell right there a little smell test there you guys i'm not joking this is gas and i think it's like 42 bucks or what it would probably be about a little you know you're you're actually closing almost to what at least three bucks tax you know 45 bucks for the eighth you know so you're in that high end category you know as it should be it's a 9 out of 10 for me you guys this stuff is friggin bomb and divine river healing i think this is the best stuff that we've seen from them but again i'm actually going to reach out to them you guys the more as i'm sitting here and writing this uh you know writing this review i'm recording this review um i'm sitting and thinking i'm going to write them uh you know a little note and let them know about this because i didn't like the way nirvana center handled it either and i mean you know i uh i honestly i really like the ganja but i did not like that hair that was in the one huge nug that i have that's not cool you guys but it's still a 9 out of 10 for this cushman's number five from divine river healing inc so boy that surprised me i cannot wait for the next one i've got some amazing stuff lined up so if you see any of that gas fire floating around the valley here even in some of these other states that have gone recreational california nevada let me know what you guys are seeing here on that west coast fire that i need to be on the lookout for because i want to be bringing you guys the freshest strain reviews because these are unbiased you guys i am not getting paid to do these and i know you guys need the info that nobody is telling you about who's telling you that there's hairs in the bud that you're buying besides me you know so make sure to look out for that if you're picking this stuff up you guys that's why we do the test that's why we are here for you to make sure you're getting the best medicine at the end of the day so with that being said you guys take care of yourselves and one another and until next time [Music] peace [Music]", "B1fY6OfPcAU": "hey everybody so it looks like we're coming in to week 9 now of the outlet cush cake grow and everything is looking alright I think that got a little crazy with the newts or maybe it's just getting to the point now where the leaves are starting to die off and turn yellow I don't know you guys tell me is this normal or is that just nutrient burn when I'm getting a lot of curling I'll think the lights too close you know my temperatures are great my humidity is good the buds seem to look good but the leaves are looking a little shabby let's see if I can turn off the red book wrong light let's turn off the red light put that one on see if we can get any good shots and strike so I am going into week nine now and this is definitely a 10-week strain because I'm not seeing hardly any red hairs and under the the scope looking at the Tri cones they're still pretty clear I thought I was going to be finishing up but these girls are telling me something different and they're saying I got at least another week or so left so I'm guessing this is a ten week flower not an eight or nine which is fine it just means that they're going to get even fatter really fine with me as you can tell they're just all the way up and down the the buds the sticks and branches [Music] every single branch has a nice little cluster of buds going up and down [Music] back and you guys can get a nice view of up top Kolak Ola colas yummy canap\u00e9 seems to be pretty even like all the all the branches got a good amount of bud just all the way from at the bottom all the way up I love the way that the string stacks stacking is just beautiful whoops freakin my girls out sorry ladies just think that it's a lightning storm but there is start of week nine I'm guessing that which is going to be a ten week string not a nine because everything is still white hairs and clear on the trichomes thing can be another week after this I just want to taste it hurry up finish I'm getting impatient I want to put you in a barn and smoke yet all right everybody there is we finished a week eight starting of week nine on my first cannabis grow with La Push cake hope you guys got a good view of the bugs there and you can see how much they're stacking and getting fatter and when I when I go to harvest this I'll make sure to get them under a nice light so you guys can actually see how crystally these things really are I'm pretty sure you're not going to be able to see it in here let's see if we can charter it was no no it's not gonna come in I wish you could see it because the

Karma's off mentally I'm off everything's off my whole little world's home trying to fix that and get some medication to me we got a new strain you know that I'm sitting on this bags been literally sitting on my calendar in my kitchen for about a week and a half now went off by week and they're trying to get around to it but actually really glad it's been sitting here x.x ran out of medication so neither that's really badly right now umm what this is it's not a strain from advanced grow-ups it sounds like it's give me a fighter strained it's a new indie call that came out it's called in to call JK I believe as far as the CT M&P name goes and verify that right now I can Christmas noise and every time we do these it's great I said yeah IndyCar JK advanced prolapse and what this is it's the LA cush cake la couch cake is a cross of the Cushman's and the wedding cake Cushman's wedding cake La Push cake um how's it give me a fire straight I'm assuming to be frosty [ __ ] and what's a medicated I could use a good into correct now because I I just need it nice let's just check the show oh that's nice smell your breath of fresh a mmm that's really nice well it's it's it's that's really nice it really does it kind of has like that like when you open up the door a front door on an autumn day or fall in it whoa you smell the other kind of bear eats you kind of like the same kind of brush gives nobody now it's not it's not sweet it's not spicy it's not another [ __ ] it's almost like musty in almost a cool smelling so the buds range from some big guys here to uh to all the little guys here and some solid ones leave ones decent a little bit shook his shell only a couple pulls me in the neck I'll be back two rows so here we go so here's the overall spread of the eighth that I got in the mood for heizak we'll just started I under corner this is a little straggler you just see sinner but even they're stragglers are extremely covered in trichomes so just to start off with what you see wait normal run-of-the-mill a GL style marijuana super coveri pretty tight little buds more or less you get a couple of leaves in there and shape it just chalked it off to off off trimmed a right I mean the trikes are clean that white dress the buds no get up here we need some of the bigger buds that's more of a uh a dense nugget you see you spent nice tip a nice tip man okay okay dude whatever that one looks delicious right get the nice Purple's on it no couple orange hairs on my straight covered don't he'll appeal to me yeah that's a little leafing there's a big I have the blood oh nice thick golf ball-sized ugh still come down kind of small kinetic you play there's a little guy right there you know a nice guy pretty clean looking specimen or what we're dealing with tophi blood piece I guess the nice clean looks free dense yeah she's fat god I'm pressing hard that's marble table there's a couple leafy guys can't kick down to the side roll them shits up you know that's a lot roll mean a lot has to be done that beautiful purse that was the money shot oh nice oh man so yeah let's let's find some buzz I'm gonna take the money shot piece all day take this little tiny hair down here too then we take this out a little tiny guy right there and I'm take this little tiny guy right here I'm take these four little tiny dudes that's gonna be only two balls all this register with most of the stragglers and I find that way take a so-called straggly everything how beautiful was stragglers out of the batch and work your way up every time you go ahead you battle the other best buds Kenny makes his pension instead of working her way down to the sweat and the smoked fish they can't work away to the top I'm saying I think about that hmmm that she make like a machine hear me out I'm just saying there's like antenna brainstorming ahead like I know sounds weird but something like a little pack or something else sounds kind of funky me I'm trying to light your brains from really maybe you tack just your body somehow and you got like you know you're sucking up and taking the you know the initial effective African is life like have this thing and bed it into your lag armor shape that don't know but you can't little port in your body you don't think they'll over can like outlet then you get a machine like a [ __ ] pig pen kid or something like that hook up your [ __ ] you know strap it on you and you can change the cartridge isn't there I'll just [ __ ] inject each seeing your system randomly throughout the day I don't know I'm trying to think a couple years in the future and how we can inject marijuana right into us in our mainstream don't have to worry about you know taking the time to do it you'll just a nice dose of THC and reflected our or somebody need twenty milligrams that's better rough day yeah anyways talking that [ __ ] not ten years from Rp avoid twenty milligrams good idea Craig playing with that [ __ ] made a bunch of money thanks man Thank You Man okay anyways okay so my shut the [ __ ] up now chains wean me okay so this [ __ ] stinks like B time is breaking up it's gotta it's kind of a wild crazy like misty outdoor smell then it's almost got like this nice sweet kind of marshmallow flavor do you smell some of these purpley buds this is light enough fireworks firing latter rounds where I live tip old house rounds new house fireworks move to the right reasons [Music] stay on this one [Music] [Music] small fish [Music] another long ribs that's nice all right all that flavor in that smell ton of it but daily ample eyes on the inhalant face fantastically delicious that is amazing that tastes fantastic it's got a nice nice medicating effect I really like that go figure that makes you feel nice and happy and calm Wow Wow it's actually working much better that I was gonna ask you this makes me feel great certain strains for Gregory make Gregory feel good this stream makes regular to feel good well to each his personal opinion specially but it wasn't marijuana strains the phonics is all-new not one strains can do the same as will for me as a well first you or will first Joe smaller blow blow you know I'm saying so this one particularly I feel fantastic like for what it does for me that simple as I need well I have all bugged out this is helping there isn't one of them in make me feel gay at the same time alright so do ball number two I'm gonna continue I won't mind I in a better mood I love the fact America Marwan is such a good day for love it has for so many years I've been using this [ __ ] since I've been 15 years old damn they're 40 and honestly if I didn't have this out a long time ago mature but thank God I didn't I have a beautiful family now thank you all the fact that you know think a lot in fact this has helped me get through it so ya know one program [Music] that's really nice fantastic taste amazing tastes great by the effects great stress relieving effects I'm great you know mental uplifting effects at the same time so body anxiety Ian's head oh it's good combination I guess I'm out Jessie doing this", "miBkbOdob2Y": "hey everyone it's been a little over a week since uh the last video update i did things are looking quite a bit better since the last check-in they're looking like they've almost made a full recovery at this point the color looks pretty good most of the old damage stuff has been taken off but you see a little bit still in the canopy they look pretty happy overall they're really turning into some bushy plants not a lot of vertical stretch on them so i don't know if that has anything to do with the paint fumes that they absorbed or if that's just uh the genetics for these la cushcakes i guess we'll see when i try another phenotype at some point in the future [Applause] i got these two hyper fuels going they're doing pretty good they've made a pretty solid recovery overall at this point um i think i was pointing this the weird growth on that leaf out in the last video it's it still kind of looks funky but it looks very healthy and the newer growth is starting to look a little more normalized and maybe that's just uh part of that strain so that's what's going on not a whole lot i've just been watering and letting them grow trying to get the flower room ready so i can get these ladies down in there and flip them and maybe another week or so of growth and maybe maybe maybe like more like two weeks at this point they'll be ready to flip i'm probably gonna even the canopy out with a little topping on this plant here to take that off [Applause] and uh do a little bit of defoliation here shortly canopies are a little little dense a little denser than i generally like to keep them but i just i'm trying to nurse them back to health at this point not do a whole lot besides get him nice and happy and healthy i have noticed uh the phenotype on the left does look a little bit better than me some of the leaves on this one on the right look a little bit funky and i'm assuming that probably has something to do with all the paintings that they took in and just taking a little time to work it all out so hopefully one more update and veg and we'll get these ladies and flower and get some flower updates going soon thanks for watching um if you haven't yet feel free to give me a like and subscribe i'll keep bringing you guys these updates and uh hopefully we'll get another flower update soon with the la cushcake have a good one", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did don't forget to click like subscribe for more videos and got a lot more on the way and if you need more popcorn in your life you can basically follow me everywhere else on the Internet I'm pot underscore porn on snapchat pop porn on Instagram I'm popcorn TV on Twitter but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace", "8igkZNRB2Nc": "hey everyone welcome back to the garden things are looking pretty good um i went ahead and defoliated the canopy a little bit especially the plant on the right and as you can see it's looking better than it was the last time it's looking happier leaves are pointed up towards the light more so that's good i went ahead and raised it up on a little box there to kind of even out the canopy between the two plants here today is day 14 so i'm gonna do another uh heavier defoliation in about a week really strip them down and uh help let the light penetrate down into the forming bud sites i i'm not sure how much lollipop in i'm gonna do i might just let them let them go get the popcorn the bloodsides are really taken off here having trouble focusing but here we go you can see the pistols are shooting out pretty much from everywhere now a lot of bite sides here i have a feeling that we're gonna have some nice dense fat colas on these plants from the overhead view you can see the right side starting to form quite a bit more on the plant on the left though than the plant on the right it looks a little bit more laggy in its bud development which is which is interesting it was the less stretchy plant but i would say overall more vigorous it produced more more growth i cut a lot more off of that plant i probably needed to have even heavier defoliation this buds over here is is particularly interesting to me it looks like it might be a mutation like there's two tips to it i'll follow that we'll check in with that next time and see how that progresses along i think overall things are looking really good i'm really happy i think in about a week i'm going to add the two hyper fuels from a couple videos ago into this area because there's more space under this light and we'll get those started flowering and we'll have those a little bit staggered behind these so when i harvest these those will have a little bit of time left so anyways that's the update here um i've gone ahead and insulated the room so i'm getting better temperatures the the room is sitting at about 70 degrees without the space heater running at all now and under the light where i've got my sensors i'm generally reading about 75 we're running about 47 48 humidity at the moment i've been keeping that um right around 50 which i think for 75 and flowers pretty solid vpd the plants look like they're enjoying it quite a bit so that's uh that's what we got going on here day 14 end of week two getting started with week three of flower with the la kush cake thanks for checking in you guys have a nice one and we'll see you next week", "59u8VaYyILY": "what's up everybody King pong here today we are reviewing the ember Valley crush cake hybrid flour I've got an 8 here leave us thirty five point seven six percent THC we'll do

Cushman's and wedding cake I love this strain as cakey it's minty it screams jungle boys what more can you ask for I hope you all have something fire to smoke with me I'm almost died juggling boys so I'm gonna be going to LA very soon if you guys are in LA hit me up YouTube you go follow me on Instagram go follow me on Twitter I just made a Twitter at smoking ass [ __ ] yeah I'm yeah we can smoke some jungle boys maybe I'll do a video smoking jungle boys will be a subscriber that'd be kind of fun you guys I love LA like I won't move there low-key I never thought I would say that I was like so over I was like so over California when I moved from California but LA in the bay is like [ __ ] world different like the cub place you could get in LA for the same price of a place you could get insurance this goes like that's not even available in Sarah's visco you know I mean like you could get a nice ass place in LA for not like a lot but not from beard to like San Francisco I wasn't someone was like like commented and I think my thousand dollar way da and he's like like why would you go to LA to get weed like don't they have good read in Vegas or something like that listen okay here's the tea I went on a cruise and I was in the hot tub and they're like these guys they're in there talking to me and whatever and they're like where are you from and I'm like Vegas they're like oh we were just in Vegas like before we go on this cruise like they had flown into Vegas and then drove to LA and then got in the cruise and they're like telling me like oh like I love Vegas like they have the best weed in Vegas like blah blah blah I asked him why and they answered they're from New York so I'm over here thinking like okay yeah that makes sense because like we it's not even like legal in New York so I could imagine like if they came to Vegas and you could just buy weed if you're old enough like I mean okay here's the thing don't get me wrong things Vegas does have good weed but honestly I feel like it's hit or miss like like the [ __ ] that I have right now that I got I started run out jungle boy so I've got like two differents from clubs run Vegas I got a Bruce Banner and watermelon gelato from Vegas and I mean it just wasn't as like these eights were kind of dry y'all and I'm just gonna say like sometimes I get top shelf eights from Vegas and they're they're either like really good or they're like kind of dry like not really that good but I'm not saying you can't get good weed in Vegas but the thing is for like top-shelf [ __ ] it's either hit or miss and it's like $60 an eighth plus tax so it's like like why would I even what like might as well go a jungle boy so I can get shipping knows gonna be stupid-ass gas stupid fire like for an even cheaper price cuz their shows like $60 an eighth including tax but it's cheaper like the more you buy so I don't know I just preferred jungle boys and honestly I love going now I like it's not like I have to go to LA to get weed but I think I'm gonna start going to LA to get weed now cuz I just love jungle boys so much more than we think in Vegas and this time I got jungle boys I think I'm gay or this time I go to LA I think I'm gonna also stop at the cookies club and see what they have there see if they have anything good I don't know I've been willing to try banana mochi is so so yeah hopefully maybe they have this I don't know but yeah Ellie's not too far from Vegas it's like 250 miles or something like that like it's honestly not that far it takes like four hours maybe top like it really depends on traffic though it could take anywhere from like three three and a half to like five or six so but yeah [ __ ] with you la la push cake don't you guys love this little artistry though they have like it's literally like the skyline of LA so I'm done something like okay now I realize I know one really smokes weed and could do a story time or anything cuz if you're smoking weed and then you get in from the camera you're like like just so [ __ ] high and it's like what do I [ __ ] I really [ __ ] with you guys you guys have been showing me so much love and commenting on my [ __ ] and stuff it's much appreciated you guys you guys talk about it seriously like it's crazy because I never thought that people on YouTube would be so nice like the youtubers are always complaining I feel like like oh haters those haters that like I really don't get really hateful comments like you guys are all the best that's why I'm Jose but yeah I really want you guys to go follow me on Twitter because that's where I can do fun stuff like [ __ ] and I don't know just ask you guys well what you care it as we like brothers so much [ __ ] I swear I wanted to talk about and I was like have you guys ever had this like literally it's kind of good right it's like tea and lemonade and alcohol kind of good kind of bad I used to love like mixed ass drinks like that but now I can't do it anymore like those malt those malt drinks like [ __ ] I don't even know I used to love that [ __ ] like colored [ __ ] like colored like I don't know like mixed drinks in a in a bottle my ex-boyfriend told me I get that cuz I'm like oh I'm like want like he knows I really only like mixed drinks but like I don't like them mixed drinks are pre-made like I don't like the [ __ ] mixed drinks like that are like in a can or a bottle or whatever like I like [ __ ] real as blender ass mixed drinks I have a Vitamix so you know I make you a bomb-ass drink frozen peach Bellini I made the other day I always make lava flow or Miami Vice pina colada mojitos I've been making all types of drinks I always want to do like where I like film me making the drink and I'm like drinking it in the smoke with me but I know I always forgot to record me making the drink cuz I'm like it's just doing the most on a side note I feel like it would have been so cool if I was doing YouTube when I moved from California to Las Vegas because I feel like a lot of people at that time we're like moving from California to Las Vegas and like literally I couldn't show you guys like literally the shitty-ass apartment they lived in for so long versus like this house in Las Vegas I we moved to literally the same price the same rent two thousand dollars one I used to live in a [ __ ] rain vested rat-infested do you hear me literally like this is not my fault either okay like get it good I have so many if I could story turns out this shitty apartment but okay so me and my mom used to live in this little shitty apartment it was basically all we could get because housing is so [ __ ] tight there like it's just hard as [ __ ] to find apartment so I only moved into this shitty apartment right cuz this is like all we go for it because it's still a lot like literally for a shitty-ass apartment it was like $1,900 a month for two bedrooms so this apartment is so sad yo lady tell you okay first of all I was literally downtown like in the ghetto this complex was right by this trail or basically everyone it's basically a homeless encampment so but we moved there like years before it was like super bad like it is now like now it's like in the news for being like literally like Skid Row of Santa Rosa type [ __ ] like oh no no Skid Row the Bay you know I'm just trying to give you guys a picture but anyway so we moved into this apartment the apartment just to give you a reference was like about 900 square feet it was two bedrooms two bathrooms and it was on the top floor so the first kind of thing that kind of sent me weird about the apartment after a while of living there maybe only about a year like we had a neighbor downstairs who was like directly downstairs like he was directly under me like a toddler apartments so every day I had to walk up these stairs directly above his house so basically like the stairs are right here and then like his front doors right here right so I'm like walking up the stairs every day and like sometimes he's like coming out so I would always see him but he would never say a single word to me and I was like fifteen so like like I'm not going out of my way to let go talk to the neighbor so I just always saw him I never said anything to me and then just a curiosity I think I was watching like some ID thing or something in there talking about you know you know it's good to check I forget what's called this home registry to see the sex offenders around you so I was like sixteen or something 16 or 15 and I was like okay I should probably do that right like I want to know like who's a pet Fowler on me so I like know to [ __ ] avoider on this complex or whatever like I'm a smart girl like some people like it kind of offends me when some people are like oh you're dumb as [ __ ] like y'all know you're talking about like I mean obviously that's offensive but like I mean really there anyway I'm like looking for the sex offenders right you guys literally literally right on top of my house there's a pin and it literally has two downstairs address with the picture of my downstairs neighbor the creepy old guy who I always [ __ ] see but never says anything and so I had him it said he was a sex offender and said he was like doing like pretty much molesting like a little kid like he was like doing lewd acts with a minor like under 13 or some weird [ __ ] right and then yeah so I'm like okay oh that's scary like that's creepy that he's living right [ __ ] under me and there's nearly nothing you can do about that like the apartment complex does not have to warn you I had all that a pedophile is lit oh sorry oh my story times aren't literally about pedophiles I'm so sorry I just realized that I don't know it's just a common recurring theme on this channel catching pedophiles I don't even know exposing pedophiles I don't even know Chris Hansen Chris Hansen who so I go tell my mom and I'm like hey like just so you know like the guy downstairs is like a pedophile like you know if you ever you know just like letting her know like if he's ever like coming to the door or anything or like you know trying to be weird or asking to come over anything like that so you know what I was just letting her know for safety and then she's like she looks at me she's like oh my god oh my god and I'm like what and I guess she was talking to someone else in the complex this is so [ __ ] sick and weird it's crazy I guess she was talking to someone else in the complex about him and she was telling my mom that he was a teacher like this guy's literally a [ __ ] teacher somewhere where I used to live that's [ __ ] nuts what I literally did one Google search and he's on the National pedophile registry and he's a teacher is somewhere where somewhere where I used to live and I was pissed about this you guys I I literally was like like what do we do like you know that's [ __ ] up like what do you mean that's literally not okay I'm gonna call like someone to get him fired but we didn't know where the [ __ ] he worked so I had no idea who to call like I don't you know like it kind of just got like dropped but like I hope that's not true and he really didn't work out of school cuz that's really [ __ ] creepy but anyways he lived under me okay I mean so anymore this [ __ ] got me lit review bro I always forgot to even review the [ __ ] revealed that a leak is cake fire I love that way I love John Williams I hate to sound like such a jungle boy sighs [ __ ] but like I Sam now if I check out me Lydia [ __ ] [ __ ] just all her [ __ ] like how like jungle boys we just hit some different like that compared to we did an old Vegas like it's just it's not the same like as jungle boys is so dense and moist and no I mean it's like literally painful hard to break up like you know hurts your fingers so anyway we lived in this shitty-ass apartment and we lived there for for like a couple of years a few years and there was like no problems and then like out of nowhere to like literally like my mom like just sees like oh brat like on top of the dishes like one night like in the kitchen and she's like what she like walks into the kitchen and she was like screams and that like runs back into like some hole and then we're like what the [ __ ] like that was the first time we because and you guys like I cannot stress this and out like we we do our dishes every day take up the trash every day time [ __ ] like we do not have like a pile of dishes or anything there's probably like one or two dishes on the counter and there was like literally a rat on it like eating some some food that was like left on the dish and we're like oh my [ __ ] god what the actual [ __ ] there were like different scenarios of like when dye might think over I was like behind the couch and then like slithered back into the kitchen and I'm like a new crack and it was so disgusting cuz we couldn't figure out what the [ __ ] was going on like where they're coming from and they're very like elusive so like you and you know like you really saw anything so literally like the next day though actually saw the rat like we called like the maintenance people and they literally came and looked at like art literally guys that [ __ ] piss me off they came in our house and looked at our tiny little trash can it was like literally like it was like one of those mini ones like in school you know it's just like a little box like it was like one of those I was our trash can for our whole kitchen and they looked at that and it's like halfway full cuz we took it out the night before or whatever and then they looked at that and they're like I think they're coming in because you need to take out your trash like you need to take out your trash or if they'll come in I'm like what's the funk like why rat like literally what the [ __ ] like what like this is literally like the apartment pests guy saying that's like you're not gonna do anything except told me to take out my trash and then he was just so rude and then he was like he was like trying to tell me like they're not mice like they're Burt their births in the Attic like what the [ __ ] I literally am see like we saw rats like okay so fast-forward the maintenance people do nothing my mom puts like a rat trap out and then apparently she caught a rat I don't even know I was like at my boyfriend's house like ex-boyfriends house and then she told me like she caught a rat and she's like I'm really gonna throw on their desk and be like Louie are you gonna do something now no but she threw it away and then she's like total maintenance people though like okay yeah like there's literally brats like I caught what like can you like do something now so they came in and said like - like a bunch more traps or something oh my [ __ ] god you guys literally I wake up one day I wake up it's like probably like around noon I wake up to the screeching noise and it's like screeching like just a screeching noise like I thought the alarm like fire what sighs I called like the fire alarm was going off at first or something it was just like the screeching noise so I like right out of my room and literally I look cause like as soon as I step out my room like I look to the left and there's like the kitchen and there's literally you guys I'm like PTSD over this there's literally there's literally a smashed screeching bloody rat flopping around on a [ __ ] clip into a mousetrap literally flopping around bloodiest [ __ ] like live flopping around the kitchen like flying screeching flopping around and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I was scared as [ __ ] like I ran back in my room and like called my mom I'm like oh my god it's literally screeching and I literally you guys literally was a sassing ever I literally was like like this in my room cuz it was seeing there screeching I had to like listen to it you know like trying to fight for its life and it was like dying and I felt like so terrible for it like like no one had to die like [ __ ] like this is terrible like just the noise I was making guys that's the worst thing I ever heard like I cannot stress it enough like it was terrible and then I had to like literally open the door to like go answer it for like the maintenance guy and the maintenance guy to even come he sound like literally this teenage Mexican boy like so yeah that was terrifying and after that I'm like literally I have to get the [ __ ] out of here cuz I'm not gonna live in this ran fest apartment that was honestly traumatizing I don't want to like see that like literally when I woke up and saw like it was traumatizing like I had a hard time like we're calling it cuz like I had tried to like block it out of my [ __ ] memory like that shit's traumatizing and I moved to Vegas and I literally like I'm in like a nice ass hearted house like huge and ass house like for the same price no rats no [ __ ] weird [ __ ] like there's barely even any spiders like there's never really a spider like thank God like and my old apartment there would be a spire like virtually every day like if you've ever lived or live in Northern California you know there's always [ __ ] spiders around that [ __ ] like in Vegas no spiders like I don't even know but we have a pest guy who like comes and sprays and he actually just like an amazing job and he's like $35 and he's beautiful beautiful for coming and being beautiful for our best guy no I mean like it's a beautiful thing he's doing for us oh my god this is so chatty like yesterday him I spoke with me I found it the jungle wood jungle mint smoke with me from where I literally did not say one word what was I talking about the yeah everything's cheaper in Vegas it's actually really nice like sometimes I'm like oh I live in LA and I'm like literally everything's ten times more expensive though for no reason like cuz everything's way cheaper here like gas is only like two dollars something like I think 241 a gallon for gas the other day you know how much I live in in Cali like 441 but y'all the tea is the real tea is in other places gas is actually cheap because they have what what I don't know universal gas or or whatever I don't know it's called but why I went to Mexico it was like two hundred and twenty pesos or something for like a gallon of gas and I'm thinking like how do you know I was like it it was like a dollar or something antiquated they're like a dollar it's like maybe is like 120 yo you guys Mexico's [ __ ] kind of kind of crazy it's not scary like for one part of it like we were in but I remember we're in like [ __ ] where was the last place we went I guess porta viar-toe i don't know we're a weird Mazatlan and we literally had no idea where we were and it was kinda scary but we were liking downtown and then like it got hella crazy hella fast like there were like dogs running around like one was trying to attack my mom like and it was like just like a little deja vu but she was like scared of it but it like got out so I CLE got back in like it like jumped out of its like window to attack my mom and then she was like screaming I'm like mom seriously it's a chihuahua like cuz I can smell your fear like it wasn't attacking me like cuz it's just a chihuahua like like I used to be like kind of like scared of little dogs too but now I realize like there's so little like they wouldn't know they could know him and hurry you like they're not bite you they're like their bark is bigger than her buddy are you guys this

like and subscribe for more spoke with me it's lit and I hope your lip stay lit keep it with I'll talk to you guys in the next video bye", "Ckp6uGj7QOM": "what's up YouTube mr. from the back against when we take two for my Odyssey strain review I'd already tried to do this video but um I think just gone back in through the information and this kind of stuff that I had to go over i ended up saying the word um um there it is again an excessive amount of time so I'm just going to say at the start of this video I'm sorry if I say that to an annoying level because i was even annoying myself when i reviewed the video so I'm gonna try to cut that down but when I'm thinking that's my go-to word so yeah anyways in this video I'm going on being the Odyssey I actually picked up the strain because of my epilepsy I was talking to the guy down at the dispensary and I have noticed that he tends to have a lot of the same kind of issues as me especially when it comes to the epilepsy also has epilepsy that's very very similar and he ended up recommending this strain I'm just based on the fact that it is very good for anticonvulsants it tends to work in tandem with the other drugs it's definitely not something that you'd want to just completely switch over if you have a main problem like i do i do you definitely find that ebbs off how much of the narcotic type drugs i have to take so you know if I can come back that any it's a good thing the strain tested in at twenty-three percent THC I forgot what the CBD was but so it's not overly I mean it's up there I think the highest percentage I've ever seen at my dispensary was like thirty one percent I thing and that was a really insanely high i think the highest rain they've ever actually produced for THC level has been like 34 points something not too too sure on that so i'm not going to get into it too much but yeah so it's kind of an up their strange seems to be doing the trick so far so many ways the odyssey just in case you're wondering it is an indica sativa blood and um I wasn't sure which side of it was more dominant whether it was more into sativa but just from smoking it I'd have to say it's probably more indica I definitely get the couch flock from it I definitely feel just that kind of low down stone where you don't really want to do much but i also have a little bit of creative thoughts and stuff like that to keep me going not sleepy by any means so it seems to be doing the job there as for smell it's kind of got a hard to describe it's kind of like that piney smell which I seem to be getting off a lot of my weed lately has that kind of pine smell and I'm not too much of a fan of a weed that smells like that for some reason when that smell hits my nose your guide 'less of the quality of weed something just tells my brain that when I smell that that it's just not the best quality which I know is kind of really stupid but that's just where my brain goes but it's a it's kind of got that son too but it's also got more of a a deep spice to it um just trying to think of something to compare it to and the only thing that's coming to mind is one of those beef bullion cubes I don't know if anyone cooks but if you ever need to make a soup base you'd use one of those beef bullion cubes and it has a really kind of spicy beefy deep kind of scent that I would compare almost exactly like one of those little beef cubes um I mentioned that I thought that to my sister and she said that for her um cheese so Seeds that's not with hot dogs so I don't really know but that's what I'm associating with and of course my bold piece is clogged so I need to go find my little pokey thing shouldn't take long and because i'm lazy and don't clean out my bold pieces too much they do get clogged sometimes I just have my little puppy thing to clear them out if anyone else works that way just a little tip of a good thing to use that i found i use a lot is if you have a girlfriend or someone who doesn't mind and they got any extra meals around those are the perfect size to go through most bold pieces and as well as if anyone you know crochet is one of the crochet hooks are actually especially because they come in different sizes so you can usually find like the best size my bowl already see how this stuff tastes now this is actually going to be my first bowl of the Odyssey I haven't smoked any yet which is really rare but I figured since I was going to be making a video reviewing it I wanted kind of the unbiased opinion so I was just going to smoke it right on the spot hmm that's it for taste it's pretty much the exact same as the smell slightly different I'd say when it smoked it takes on more because she kind of skunky kind of tastes whereas what I'm smelling I don't really get much of that um as for the first hit I definitely feel it already it's definitely not too too strong but it's there so that's always a good sign and I'd actually been going through a minor kind of shake attack with my epilepsy I have a kind of main attacks where my eyes will just roll back into my head and I'm on the ground doing the chicken for a couple minutes it's a very scary thing for my family unfortunately or fortunately it's not too scary for me because I just kind of wake up on the floor a few minutes later feel and kind of beat up but a lot of the times it doesn't get that bad but what does happen is I start um just doing that kind of these random shakes it's kind of like I shivering it's a not anything to do with the fact that I'm cold though a lot of times it's uncontrollable and I don't know if anyone has ever been out the cold and shivered for any length the time but after a few minutes of just constant I'm convulsing and shaking it really really starts to hurt my shoulders all through my chest stuff like that and i find that pot not only usually takes the shaking away within my first hit if not the second hit but by the time i have smoked you know two or three bowls it's totally on and the pain from the initial shaking is greatly greatly reduced also did some reading on the strain this is an all around good strain some of the other things that can be used for is just you know your average of its good for nausea it's good for appetite it's good for your pain reduction which I'm noticing um it is good for any psychotics as well now I know some people who are on antipsychotics they're good people but you know they're not without their issues I know some nanny site or I know some people who are diagnosed with them lots of issues like that who can totally operate without any kind of drugs and they just smoke pot to kind of off their bad feelings but I know other psychotic people who are a little bit more intense and I'd almost argue to say that when you're in that mindset to begin with some of these people tend to get amplified when they've been smoking and you know it's bad for me to be such a pro pot kind of guy and kind of a begins tweed but I just really think that um it's all in the person and for people to be using this as an anti-psychotic I think yeah I could definitely see it puts you in a better mood and stuff but you just gotta be really sure that that's your best option that being said though I just want to mention that I have been on antipsychotics not for any type of psychotic issues um they seem to be prescribing these drugs a lot more for other issues it seems I was prescribed forget what it's called now I think it's sirak well but um that's an anti-psychotic and I was actually prescribed it for my sleep disorders and I figured out through my family doctor later on that the person that's prescribed that for me um tune of prescribed that for me and my doctor took me off that immediately and she was actually quite angry that someone had put me on that for my sleep issues and um yeah so you just really gotta watch out and I think if you could get off something like that then definitely pots the way to go but anyways kind of a longer video I'm not going to keep it to too much longer just going to finish off my last bowl here noticing this pot by the way is just a really nice fostering I got it was a Romulan cross I forget what it was crossed with but I found maybe it was just the way it was grown um maybe it was just a little bit too moist for my liking and I found that it really caught my throat and the string isn't doing that at all I find I can just freely talk even after taking my I don't have much recovery time overall I'd give the strain odyssey of eight out of ten definitely had a lot better but it's definitely getting the job done and doing the trick and I definitely recommend it anyways guys thanks for watching this video if you like what you see please

favorite kind of concentrate and i love how most of it has these crazy huge diamonds in it that looks so sick but what is it i'm about to tell you what these diamonds are how they get there and why they're only in live resin right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed these chunks in live resin sometimes called live diamonds or diamonds and sauce are just straight up chunks of thc and the runny part are the sauce is a collection of mad terpenes and cannabinoids and this is why i love live resin so much i even made some live resin gear for the strange show shop just so i would have a sick hoodie to wear i mean live resin is just the perfect combination of the runny smelly terpenes i want plus a bunch of chunks of thc that sounds perfect to me speaking of me my name's matt this is the strain show and this is the channel where i answer all the questions you ever had about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain branch so almost all weed concentrates except for things like cbd extracts have thc in them but you usually only see these diamonds in live resin and not even all live resin has these diamonds so what's going on here what's the difference why are these thc diamonds only in live resin and how do these diamonds even form in the first place well that all has to do with how live resin is made with most weed concentrates all of the weed that you use has been dried first like all of the weed i hung in this humongous drying room but with live resin the weed that is used is cut down quickly stripped of all its fan leaves and frozen as quickly as possible like in these big bags of frozen weed i have right here when the weed is quickly frozen instead of being allowed to dry it retains almost all of the terpenes and cannabinoids of the living weed plant hence the name live resin the terpenes that give your weed all of its smell and that give your hash all of its flavor are liquids and when you dry the wheat out you lose most of your terpenes and most of your flavor but with live resin you keep all of that but that only tells us why live resin tastes so good but what does that have to do with these diamonds forming well i was wondering the same thing and luckily i have friends in very high places so i reached out to some friends over at viola extracts here in denver where they make awesome concentrates and they're always pushing out some fire live resin and i ask them for an expert's explanation of how all these extra terps and stuff make these thc diamonds form in something like live resin but they don't form in something like shatter and here's what they told me the crystalline formations are dictated by the volatility of the source material the more volatile the source material like fresh frozen weed will produce a more dynamic chemical reaction under purge resulting in the separation and formation of crystalline structures a less volatile source product like dried weed produces less of a dynamic reaction and stabilizes before attaining crystalline structures thus the solid homogenous structure of shatter so basically the oil that is extracted from these live plants starts off without these diamonds in it but this oil is made up of so many different compounds that there are all kinds of different chemical reactions going on between different parts of the plant while all this is going on and the extraction solvents are being purged off tiny crystalline structures of thc begin to form and sink and eventually they stick together and form these huge thc diamonds and sometimes they grow huge like this monster here in the oils extracted from dried weed there aren't as many components or chemical reactions and the thc never separates and forms these crystalline structures and that's why shatter is just hard and dry it was made from dried weed that has way less terpenes in cannabinoids to cause those chemical reactions and crystalline formations and now that i know all about what these thc diamonds are i'm about to go right here and hit some fat slow-mo dabs of these guys and that's the video i think you should watch right now this is the video that youtube thinks you should watch right now so i don't know you tell me but yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got these nuggets of knowledge

cures what's good doing a west coast we tour review featuring the buddies brand forbidden skittles liquid diamond live resin one gram baked cartridge i'm excited we've got a buddy's brand vape battery it's going to be an exciting time now the cool thing about this particular west coast we tour review is that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring

above to make me change like a castaway you know you pay that you bought the cooler today hey guys I just shot this entire video and I wasn't even recording man so I'm stoned as heck right now having to rerecord this for you guys but it's alright that's alright so without further ado guys my name is Teddy G welcome back to my channel for today's video guys we got something crazy we got a freaking comparison all right guys from two of the biggest brands out on the market right now we are going to be testing out this dizzy live resin and we're going to be comparing it to the raw garden refined live resin alright guys the only reason we're doing this is because I felt like you know these are two of the biggest brands on the market right now in terms of cartridges so it would be just fun to just see what's that what what is the difference between these cartridges you know what is the taste difference what's the why is raw garden refined light resin and why's dizzy luck regular light resin and we're gonna touch base on every single detail as to what each company brings to the table and just so you guys know man who is the best live resin out there right now before this video starts though I want you guys who are watching this video right now let me know in the comments below spam that [ __ ] let me know what do you guys think is better we got this dizzy live resin or we got the raw garden and refined by resin so hey let me know if you guys have tried any of these and let me know what's your favorite and why alright guys so without further ado man I think the only thing there is to do now is to test these out get an ice and stone and let you give you guys the full rundown as to what I think is better alright guys so we are going to be testing out this one right here which is the key lime pie it is an indica and we are going to be compared - the banana slim from raw garden which is also indica the raw garden is sitting at 85 point 95 percent of THC and though it is e itself is the seitan at a nice seventy nine point seventy one percent THC all right guys so the difference is already you know seven to seven percent differential in the THC percentages is it really going to make a difference I feel like it all depends on the product itself man it all depends on the strain it depends on you know yeah I think it just depends mostly on the strain and how much smoke consumption you can get because obviously if you're not getting enough smoke in your lungs then you're not getting hot so I don't know which one to test out first geyser so we got the key lime pie plus the sour gorilla which is a hybrid I'm just trying to compare both of the indicas though so not that we go with this dizzy first alright guys so we're gonna take a big fat blink of a note off of this dizzy and tell you guys the full flavor profile what kind of time it gets me get to be right off the bat because with the blinker man you have to feel something right guys so cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 man that's all I'm saying choose the initial flavor flavor that I'm getting I am getting a little hint of like select a line like Elvis citrusy which is pretty freakin cool man none to say the least but I uh I'm also getting that natural like if you guys know if you have ever smoked live resin you guys know that it tastes kind of like it doesn't taste burnt but it does taste like like obviously something very very earthy that like you know it's something completely different than the within what you're used to if you smoke raw garden something completely different man this type of live resin you know is actual live residence how it's like you know the industry standard of live resin and that's what's tizzy puts in the pot so comparing it to the refine light resin though so pretty much what raw garden does what they're refined light resin is they take out any extra lipids and things like that carcinogen I mean I'm not really too sure if it has carcinogens but if they take out pretty much any extras that they really don't feel should be vain alright guys so compared to this one this one might have NEX some extra lipids just from the process of the you know squishing the plant itself as opposed to this that it's gonna take out all that extra stuff so that's why you also get it so clear right so it's just refining it that way you get a better end product it's basically what they're trying to do so without further ado guys I think we should just go in for a fat little toke and yeah choose [Music] oh my gosh dude the raw garden blinkers literally they kill me every time I like I used to when I first started smoking these I used to take blinker after blink after blinker but by now man I don't know what it is but they're just so like so much harsher now and then what they used to be it's out there so much harsher or it's just my lungs they're you know slowly decay ting but either way man it doesn't matter yeah take touch base on both of these though man off the first two initial hits like this one right here I got it was it wasn't as Turkey is what I'm used to to the to the raw Gardens but they that's what sucks about these is they always change man I mean the base flavor profile Oh is always the same you know it's always usually the similar taste but I'm talking about the Terps you'll get some that are really really really chirpy and gassy and they just like you know expand your lungs and destroy your lungs and then you'll get something like these that are kind of kind of subtle like you know the Terps are very very subtle in there but they these always have more Terps in my opinion compared to these live residents from ste I like the the ones from Suzie honestly they're just like very very smooth and they're not too harsh on your throat like I said like I could let you guys saw me take a blinker and just take it like a champ right okay as opposed to this when I was coughing like a little bit after like these are a lot smoother the live resin is they give you the full entourage effect so the highest completely completely different guys all right and that's what I'm gonna touch base next after after the flavor profile so yeah this is like a more plant-based you you're not really getting too much Terps it's more of just getting you the full entourage effect and what that does is basically give you a full spectrum hot alright guys as put to this this one it's just the flavor puffs on this is just turquoise tantrum and likey there's nothing else to say about it I mean not this specific regarde in general you know they're known for being gassy for being therapy and yeah man so flavor-wise I do like the raw garden a lot more so next up on the list though like I was saying we're gonna go based on the highest and I know I'm not I'm not basing the highs as a right now I'm just basing the overall highs that I've had in the my past experiences and I'm gonna just let you guys give you guys the full rundown all right so with with the Stacey live resident I do get the full entourage effect all right which is basically I do feel like very very soothing it's a very very soothing high man and it's not if you take a blinker you're not gonna really feel that high right away it's a high that progresses so every single time that you take a hit you're gonna get more and more high and it's not really a very very rapid high at least for my personal experience is it is a slow high but once you reach that peak level it's a very very enjoyable high as opposed to the raw garden where I feel like this one man you it's just in your face it's just very very in your face but the thing is it doesn't it's like quick it's a quick high you get me so you'll take a hit of this you'll take a blinker hit of this so you get a very very stone you'll feel like like oh my gosh dude like I'm stoned right and it'll last at least for me it'll last for like 20 minutes at most and you know I feel like I have to take another hit to get that high again and it's just not it's not it's not a soothing high as opposed to that how this dizzy is right this one is just like I said like I was saying it's very in-your-face and it's a very being rushed high so you just like you just like oh my gosh you're like I'm a high like I'm super babe and then um you don't really get a chance to just chill out in my opinion you know it's a very very like dude like I'm afraid and I have to get like you know experienced the highest opposed to this one you could just sit down and chill and enjoy the full effects of the plant and how it's supposed to be soothing you which is really really weird man it really goes to show you know the different types how different types of live resin waxes things like that affect your body affect your mind and things like that so take it from take it from my point of view guys you know give different things to try don't just be stuck on one product because you enjoy that hi you know there's you'll probably find something else that you might like a little bit more you know so I think the only thing we we talked a lot right now but I think it's tough to get nice and baked so Cheers [Music] like I'm super bagel I was saying in the beginning of the video I made I want to say it was at least that eight to ten minute video guys for you guys and it it was going so good in my opinion who is it was really really good but I'd like this one's probably gonna come out a lot better just because I picked out my flaws on the last one so this one was just kind of just donating rolling rolling rolling but yeah that kind of pissed me off a little bit but we're already started so really couldn't be too pissed off but I'm just enjoying it I'm enjoying doing these videos for you guys I love the support that you guys have been showing to me man if you haven't already what are you doing man go ahead and hit that subscribe button it supports me more than you think alright guys so let's go in on this raw garden hit next Cheers [Music] therapy super therapy we tell you guys like the flavor profile from the raw garden is just completely different from this dizzy man and I feel like that's what that's what's gonna really make this decision hard is the fact that I feel like these two even though they're both like resin I just feel like they're two completely different things you get me like right here we got a very chirpy pen that's just a very very completely different high right here is something that's very very subtle but it gets you it's a very very soothing high and yours you're getting the full flavor profile from the plant as opposed to this one I mean I don't know I don't know it's like you get me if I smoke the plant well it will it give me the same high is what I'm trying to say it's like I don't feel like I'm gonna get the same high but I like with if I smoke the plant from this but if I were to smoke the plant from this I feel like it would be around the same high you know and it's kind of something that that I don't know if that just kind of brought it to my attention is the fact that you know and why how much can the highs really change from the bud look at that bud state to the wax date you know and it's very very crazy man they're very very crazy guys so I'm gonna be honest with you guys I am NOT gonna be able to decide who's gonna be the winner because like I was saying there are two different completely products and I'm gonna need your help for this one guys all right so let me know in the comments below I want every single person watching this video to comment down below if you've tried these products which one do you think is better and would like tell me why tell me why do you think they're all arms are better tell me why you think this dizzy is better right I want to know your opinions I want to make this interactive video and hopefully you guys are down for it so because I can't really choose I'm gonna need your help on be 100% honest right so I'm gonna drop this video today and you guys are gonna we figure out which is better than what so without further ado I'm gonna end out the video go upload this and so you guys have something to watch alright guys hope you guys have a blessed day don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on the next one we practice is a great function on the ground buddy know cuz I've been super buddy I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "OYzizoPgQZo": "[Music] [Music] try and make this right if you try to make this right what's a guy's simplistic hair fact with another well I'm just if you want you should always put someone biting your thing I dunno what's up guys simplistic so guys simplistic here back with another video if you can see or you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be a diamonds bear labs review but we got RJ eats you know I'm saying shout out to the homie and also tattoos by kaze if you guys haven't checked out the merch I'll also post got in the bond description below that is my homie right there and he does tattoos so if you're interested in the Modesto 209 area show you boys and love you know I'm saying I show you the back and I mean yeah yeah so yeah which is surprising that cos he actually went up to me and was like someone actually messaged him through Instagram through my videos and was like can I get one of these so that's pretty cool another thing I like to mention I'm not gonna probably mention it and then in like the next coming videos probably do a few more times but my merch is going to have a coupon code because it is my birthday month and if you enter March for all caps you get seven dollars off your merchandise so should be a good little discount for you guys but like I said I'm gonna mention it in probably like a few more videos because kind of getting annoying and now I've already did it like twice and I feel like it's a little bit repetitive but you know I'm saying if you want some gear get some gear if you don't okay no I'm sayin so we got some bear labs and just as like the other video I'm gonna have him open it and then imma film it with my camera that way I don't have to take off this you know right here is sherbert so right off the bat you could notice that that ninety seven percent total cannabinoids but just for those of you who think that that's THC it's not tht is actually on the top left right there no off 20 on the bone right there so it's actually 85 percent THC at low temperatures so right off the bat like from looks when she showed me it no diamonds don't mean like that means she's a little small so open [Music] this smell is actually like so I'm okay so with diamonds usually there is like barely any taste I've noticed because it's like I guess it's like THC a diamond I don't know what it's not really good though there lies always smells good and they see you know yes - Wow we're gonna reserve our judgment till we actually tried the damn thing you know anything but rather bat I'm gonna be using the utility and you know I'm saying we got the bubbler from brain fog er brain we do it gentlemen this start it already let's start reporting oh yeah is it it's gonna be for this actually no it's because there's no stabilization on there you definitely notice it instead of like on the camera [Music] yes so if you haven't already try to look for some extra videos it's kinda like extra videos from my channel you know but it's a his perspective you know like if you if I don't upload on that day maybe check out some more videos baby no no my boy I'll post every dance and I don't know he's five days woman if I did yeah I stream on Tuesday and then Friday at a deal Cheers we're gonna pecs on my wife's hands it we got judge this wax first goes in give it a shot up you gotta start cleaner that's probably my taste Wow yeah not bad bro just like a better version of the candidate no it tastes like it tastes like what choppa Canada tastes like when it's good well we try it yeah was anything mean was that less trouble Kenan could use no I just said it server honey no I said it please like like it should have been it [ __ ] truck in bucket truck I subscribe why we're picking that up again a Linda I receive it some rubble looking right away and about address agent the truck panic look into other direction we didn't see that [Music] it's not bad honestly for diamonds I thought it'd be less curvier we're like no taste at least but I wanted to do this video for you guys bear labs dine in sherbert diamonds number one we call it it's actually pretty smooth to so but in car it was good better than trouble Kenny Kenny's that keep picking up in bear laps maybe you know continue I always show love regarding this one in blue $27 over there 29 row garden that's do so yeah no I checked this is 29 oh that's why been buying raw garden guys I'm trying to try some new stuff and uh with new stuff I could do videos you know nice room no I'm pretty sure you guys are sick of raw garden wax videos cartridge videos I'm not sure if you guys are sick of it just because they're cartridges but we're gonna take one more parts we're gonna get into cartoon and it's so convenient how you can just have it anymore any time adjusting it and good good size not bad but for $29 I probably wouldn't just spent $2 less in garden for maybe four dollars less and Bob got easing in because like I said I only bought this because this is a new thing I've been buying buddies lately wall garden all other stuff and to switch it back to their labs you know every now and then and it's not that it's not not the best you know the best of their labs I think was for me in greeters that all the one that I did a video on I'm not sure what it was yeah no mine was like banana or something banana really no it might have been something cookies I don't know what it was but I'll check it out but yeah there you go

longer once we left in total we all picked up like 50 candles total for a little more for sure yeah the deals though for real they were ten dollars each yeah we had to it was like he said that he wasn't going in mind with like grabbing some but they ended up getting eaten i ended up getting so i kept showing her something she didn't like any of them and i was like i want them so i ended up buying all the ones that she didn't like so she's like you got to put them in your studio instead of our room that's fine like i'm with it that's funny what are you guys favorite candles comment down below do you guys like candles as well i feel like she was talking about how earlier she never imagined when she was younger that she was going to be waiting like a candlelight you know excited yeah like things that you never thought you would be so happy for like i never honestly thought i was going to be owning some crocs too like when they first came out like i'd be like what's the hype about like peripheral they're not comfortable though they are yeah we have it on the red setting which is the lowest setting so we're gonna get flavor of that concentrate very excited yeah i'm excited i always like trying new products it's always fun um i've never i'm not gonna lie and say every product i've tried has been the best because there's been some concentrates where i'm like oh [ __ ] no what about you guys huh cheers everybody she's going in on the dab yeah with the loud guys she wasn't playing like she pulled up with some fire all legal clean brandon stuff congress not playing with no like we hop boxed earlier before there's two huh even like a seven gram joint anna blantee pulled up with the blunt how did it taste it didn't taste like purpley did it taste purple um it tasted more on the turkey side for me yeah for sure oh it's sour diesel my bad yeah you're expecting like a grape type flavor yeah i really was i'm like damn but it wasn't bad i think you'll get a flavor dude you're like i'm getting all the wreaths for sure i'd be doing the same [ __ ] can't waste wax it's too good to be wasted you know we're gonna start unopening this up so we're not just looking at edmond and just staring at me he's all getting high by himself cheers guys i was telling them that this cartridge reminds me of that um push-up candy for real flo says she's going to attempt to 20 seconds she's like nah now here you can try this there's no way it made it 10 seconds yeah it was good i got as [ __ ] does it taste like grape or anything like that like no this was more for sure on turkey terp for sure yeah but yeah we're gonna go eat right now bw [Laughter] i'm dead yeah we have we haven't ate all day literally from five to five we haven't eaten and we've been um smoking since like 12 or whatever i guess we got a pretzel but like we didn't even finish like a snack you know yeah like a little pre breakfast oh that scene has a 20 second blinker that's insane that's crazy that is insane i've actually attempted it it's not fun to do this more like uh i gotta take out the camera and do it here and then it's not like i would do it every day yeah and we were just talking about it like you don't do a blinker honestly every single time you have the chance like more of a challenge type of [ __ ] yo this thing's getting high for sure though i think we haven't smoked in a while the cartridge i feel like it tastes like a dab yeah that's just like really dab like uh-huh it has like i thought it was gonna be fruity some type of foodie but for sure it gives me like more terpenes yeah concentrate um vibes like a dab you know you're smoking like some strong [ __ ] for sure just based off the flavor yeah you can take another dab pack it up yeah they're gonna be back to back that was the last one to take it down still don't have to get down damn you ready to eat yeah i'm ready to eat hello like i said we're about to go eat um i think i i need to hit the ursula a little more but i actually liked it um i wasn't bad because i felt like the cartridge definitely gave me that like liquid diamond effect like a dab effect i felt like it was a [ __ ] dab out of a cart um so i would recommend and i like the packaging too i like products that go all out with their packaging and are just creative it's just not a whatever packaging yeah focus the whole universe vibes for sure

attire and then we got the zeros just testing it a little bit of both 21% almost 22% TC which is real dope already got in this edition is far stupid fire I can't wait smoke throws but enough rambling it's your boy like to signing out peace", "F2kLMhp4bOs": "this fridge guys this thing comes in clutch look at all those concentrates boys but today we're going to be using this bad boy welcome back to another sick quick little video by your boy sebiji man today guys i thought it'd be cool to do a review on one of my favorite pods of all time it's been a long time since i've had this one man i've actually only ever had it once and it was when it was first released man so i kind of want to you know give it a try again maybe maybe it's not as good as i thought it was or maybe it is as good as i thought it was the first time all right guys so without further ado man as you guys can see by the intro we got the cannabis derived terpenes pod by stizzy right there boys nice little silver packaging and this one right here is the chem dog all right boys so this one the tc man the thc on this one is sitting at a high 89.78 thc so it's almost at a full 90 percent man so i'm actually really really excited to try this one now let's go ahead and pop this sucker open take it out of the case go ahead and pull the rubber off and then for the battery we're not going to be using a regular battery man we got a big battery right here boys i got it nice and fully charged so hopefully we can get some nice hits off of this and really really i just really want to see if it's as good as it was from the first time i tried it alright so without further ado guys let me know in the comments below if you guys have ever tried a cannabis drive terpene pod from stizzy if you have let me know what flavor man so without further ado guys let's hit this cheers oh yeah that's good well hold on now for the first hit add some fire it doesn't taste as gassy as the gorilla cake that i had it the first ever one they're garlic like i don't even know if they make that flavor anymore but that gorilla cake man it was one of the most phenomenal strains that i've ever had in my life it was so gassy and citrusy maybe that's why sizzy gave me that flavor so i could you know hype it up but so far man this one i'm not getting the super gassiness maybe i just have to bust it in you know get the coil wicked up all that stuff so let's go in on hit number two [Music] yeah it's just getting more and more gassier the more i hit it far after the two hits man this is a hybrid and i'm getting a little bit more of the indica dominant side of this because my head change was just so sudden and so like quick that it has to be indigo bro because i've never felt this quick of a head change from a sativa or you know i mean it is a hybrid but guys i don't know what it is if it tell me tell me that you guys feel the same way because whenever i try a hybrid cartridge sometimes it either does completely nothing to me or it completely destroys me when it's indica dominant so i don't know if the manufacturing companies you know the lab testing whatever it is maybe they just don't really do a good enough job to tell you if it's an indica because this one right here it might be an indica from the head change that i'm experiencing i could definitely get i'm starting to get like slumped my eyes are starting to get low i'm starting to like slur my words a little bit i'm trying not to but if it happens it's because of this dizzy pod guys come on don't blame your boy all right so what's going on hit number three man this is so far i'm getting the gassy notes but that's all i'm getting it's nothing like crazy flavor and it's not necessarily bad but i definitely want to taste a little bit more of i don't even know what to expect actually i don't know what i want to taste more out of but it's just a straight up gas and it's not enjoyable enjoyable i'd rather have a little bit more sweeterness or pininess terps but this is like just straight up gasoline you know terps so it's crazy something new for me so let's go in on hit number three okay and that one was a little bit from this one i'm getting like a little bit more muddier like flavoring to it and it's not like nasty but i just like the weed bro it's just the weed is just very very heavy [Laughter] and very very in your face it's like boom like me as a heavy hitter this is actually just very very in my face bro like i'm literally choking up over here trying to just hold my breath in from what i remember you know that's where chem dog gets to the name the cabinet is just super gassy toxic likes flavoring and it's just boom hits you in your face and i've never really had a good chem dog so i can't really say that you know i've i remember exactly what it tastes or smells like but this if this they probably brought out in this specific pod they probably brought out all the flavor profiles the entourage effect whatever it is because i'm tasting and you know feeling the high that i've never felt off of a chem dog so maybe this is a true form of the chem dog because honestly it's a pretty crazy high man and the flavor the flavor that i'm telling you guys is just like a skunky disgusting like taste bro and it's just like it's just from the plant you could tell us from the plant the terps are just just like just like some it reminds me kind of like some gmo to be quite honest it's just like garlicky like really deep muddiness taste to it but it's good you know you know that's kind of what you want out of what you wanted to just like destroy you in flavors i mean this is a whole different flavor profile that i've ever had because i'm more used to like you know sweeter terpy you know og piney notes but this one is just like intoxicating so far this cartridge um or this pot i should say is just insane like i'm faded right now probably on a scale from one to ten maybe like a eight so let's try to get to ten boys let's go [Music] yeah the flavor profile is insane like i cannot really see myself [Laughter] this is what a 90 cartridge does to you man this thing is annihilating my lungs like i'm dead serious i cannot even like catch your breath it's just like pow pow pow all in your face like the high is just i'd probably maybe up skeletal 8.2 i'm definitely getting a little bit more more and more high as i hit it but [ __ ] dude i'm baked and i'm pretty sure it's also because i'm pairing it up with the big batter because if i were to have it on the little body i'm pretty sure i could take blinkers and [ __ ] like that but ah guys i'm sorry i apologize i'm over here trying to catch my breath this is the first time that a cartridge has done to me you've done this to me in a long time it's insane all right so chem dog definitely some fire 89.77 tc is one of the highest percentage cdc's that i've seen on a cartridge honestly it's very very rare that you get those thc percentages people lie in like bs like distillate cartridges like 97 thc and in reality it's not even close to that so this i can truly say that it's actually pretty close to like a 90. it has to be like what they're saying it is because it's so fire and like the flavor the flavor is just something i've never like tasted before it's insane so chem dog you got me laid out this is definitely what i'm gonna put in a head stash for like when i'm dry or something i know this is gonna be the go-to to get me nice and faded right so we're gonna go ahead and end out the video here guys ah i'm faded i don't even want to take any more hits so i still have to edit this video do a lot more chores i'm going on san diego tomorrow so you guys might see a little san diego trip so you know let me know in the comments below if you guys want to see that let's get to 400 likes and i'll record my san diego trip all right boys so i'm ended out here i appreciate every single one of you g fam one last favor

doing this job with C&C connoisseurs and I got a good one for you today all right so I picked up a gram of summed abstract live resin this is some Hawaiian golden pineapple libraries and gems and juice there's some of the numbers there the Terps teetsi you guys already saw this whenever I did a review all I'm doing right now is I'm gonna try to play with this stone that's in here so you guys get a good look at that diamond community digger another drop it right on the old mat there [Music] you know you can see this is one faceted stone there [Applause] [Music] I can smell this this is just it's a very piney super um spicy [Music] kind of a smell it's um it's very solid as you can see it is one solid piece and this has a lot of Terps on it and my dumb ass has dropped it not to worry like I said it is just one solid chunk [Music] all right well that's been John with CNC connoisseurs playing with a diamond that I got in a grandma dabs you guys have a good one and as always tune in for some more we'll see you later peace", "iYaBriy2mh0": "[Music] [Music] what up guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Dave and we are back again for another strain review today we're checking out some open team you haven't done any OG in a while I think the last OD we did was either the blue box or the red box or both of them together from Los Angeles coach yeah this is another one from LA cush this one right here is the ill oh gee that's right so this is from Adam hill and it is a turbo Jeep back cross of bx1 guys we're going what three generations nothing like that I think they yeah super super true oh gee back cross with itself I guess just you know supposed to be a nice og in the past all the true og I've tried I want to say the first time I saw it was this stuff elemental we used to like win the cups with or that was like their big house string back in the day mmm-hmm always like a high test there like a lot of good og is sometimes not the biggest buzz for Oh gene you're not gonna have those big knockers like a SFPD or something but it always packed a good punch and have pretty good flavors yeah this right here says total cannabinoids 31.8 three percent total THC twenty six point eight nine so as oh gee always does its testing pretty high and I'm not gonna lie guys I'm pretty hungover I want to say just for a second that weed is the best hangover cure so I'm gonna get high yeah I wanna be the best ready gotta be man I mean seriously I'm feeling kind of like nauseous right now got a headache it's kind of pounding a little bit my tongue that I smoke weed and it always goes away so I called you as my Energy's a little down I got hammered last night the should this should help probably like you said nothing helps to cure a hangover better than we do definitely some OG - I'm not gonna lie we're huge FG fans here and you know I always loved og especially the first time I ever smoked up just like Dan but it does have its kind of negative connotations like we've talked about a lot in the past with gelato kind of being the one that's getting played out right now like we always talk about how there's these crazies and these fads that kind of come and go it's purple then it's OG then it's cookies now it's gelato when the og craze is hidden we were reviewing a lot of Boujis and sometimes people like hey man review some other stuff a lot of like our European viewers like where's all the haze is that you know that type of thing right a lot of times where we review things that are popular in our local market at the time we were viewing different types of strains that a few years we were in Colorado you know people smoked different stuff when you go to different places and so you know we kind of strayed away from doing the og previews for a long time just as we had done so many of them you know back in the day but I haven't seen some good og come around recently when we were kind of complaining there for a while about oh gee how do we you know been watered down over the last three years and just not being as good as it used to be yeah so this stuff right here's got this earthy thing going on and I think true OG always kind of landed right in the middle between like gassy and earthy yeah I like it I think it could I want to see the flavors good I think when I first crack the jar the cons I was talking about with OG the one calm is it goes scales really bad yes a different smell when it's been in the jar hasn't breathed too long it kind of gets that we are I think I said it before kind of like a tickly thing sometimes almost especially the more earthy variety as opposed to the orgasm usually variety for whatever reason you know put it lagging off smoking here I promise I will smoke this eventually make it now it does taste good though bargain lot once you finally crack in their crack past and you know the cure get inside the bud it's still somewhat moist in there and sticky and gummy so I do like that but the jarred feel on this stuff was not good guys mockingly it's almost like the term we say milk gone bad the milk kind of my bad on this stuff I talked until I cracked into the know yeah you know I'm saying it definitely has that thing where I guess the best way to sum it up is a lot of times when I get oh gee that's bought in a shop I pay attention to the package date on the on the label sometimes more than I do with other stuff just because of those packages couple months ago it definitely has that stale thing that we're talking about going on sometimes more so than other strings and I just don't know why that is but I love og I still smoke it to this day this stuff like you said when you first opened the jar not the most amazing smell but as you as we were breaking it up if you take an ugh and you kind of just squeeze it a little bit you get a lot of the flavor that I think was more record of better representation a better representation of what this looked like when it was fresh off the plant some time I see weed like this I'm like I would like to see this before was packaged in the turkey bag I'd like to see some of the bigger notes if there were any definitely I'd say this sock that we got a lot of these nodes are on the smaller side this is about as big as any of em yeah that's gonna be one of the knocks I give it the buns are pretty small we apologize got as yesterday's fourth of July we went ham so we might stumbled on the date on this from the wheel bebop oh yeah I'm definitely doing on I'm feeling a little hazy today but not really having smoke [ __ ] today I have to say that my headache is like 80% better than it was 5 knuckle knock down 85% better than it was eight minutes ago so I'm happy for them sometimes we go into these videos and I finish I'm like oh man that was a train wreck and then we put it up and it seems like you guys like the ones where we fumble them a little bit better you know sometimes I finish the video and I'm like ah man we get done with the video and then I'm really high like 5-10 minutes later yeah oh man I wish I could have portrayed the real effect the way this you know the buzz is hitting me now right you know you doesn't come through in the video sometimes when we try to pack these reviews into 10 minutes but this stuff right here I'm definitely feeling it already like and that's what I'm looking for with a good og that's why we still smoke it to this day because it's the one thing that almost always gets me hot I feel like it just gives you more munchies the highlights longer I feel I get so long it's like a slow upward slope and then slow downward slope when that downward slope usually ends with me in bed like last night we were smoking lots of Christian cleaning this stuff and I gotta say it's some good Kush but the number one knot is the buds are too small and number two and this is just with a lot of wreck meat man and you jar hug like we said in eights we're just keeping them in like five pounds lost 10 pounds keeping it off tearing together eight jars it's gonna get that milk nonfat quick I've even noticed that with some of our stuff you know and we buy it if we don't package it and get it out and get it sold quickly sometimes it'll have the same thing you know if it right it's somewhere whether it's you know bad on our end for you know not moving through our inventory quick enough like not selling the oldest [ __ ] first always you know I'm saying sometimes you get something that's really good and then you get some hype stuff right after you put the menu out people like give me that new hype stuff you know so you have really good wheat sometimes it's it's and it's like if if that was my weed at home in my jar and it was sitting I would at least go burp it once or twice a week or whoever makes the note around shake that jar or something you know I feel like there's no really way there's no way to get around it yeah that's daily thing I mean oh geez just I feel like worse than other ones too so is Jack I feel like even in turns out like you know what I used to go around and still to this day when I go around and check out you know big lots of pets it's usually the Jackson the oh geez if they've been sitting there for more than a month without being properly sealed nitro steel whatever however you want to keep your packs you know it starts to get that milk gone bad smell even in the big pounds even in the five-pound bags 10-pound bags one-pound bags the OG and the jacks yeah mm-hmm they just really get you if I had to say my favorite thing about this and we break it down as far as the rating has to be the buzz yeah I don't know what's going on here but uh yeah lit up like a parking lot as we like to say yeah so let's go ahead start with our highest rating the buzz you know I'm I'm not gonna give it a 10 I'm gonna be a Stifler we give a 9.5 I do like it oh gee usually tends to give me that really happy feeling that I'm getting right now and it took my hand over the way 9.50 allows for me yeah I'd say that's fair sometimes I feel like when I see smaller buds I don't even know if that's necessarily not because like you said even the good Trillo jeans that I used to see back in the day was always kind of smaller that's for OG but the good oh gee has that gumminess that's big factor right cuz I'm breaking this stuff [ __ ] it has pretty good stick partner you know I usually say if that stays there for about 10 seconds that's what I'm looking forward though Jean and I think this one probably passes this big test true you know generally so let's go I'm gonna give this one a 7 ok as far as smell goes and flavor it's probably a seven and then buzz 9.5 so maybe like eight overall something like that I think it's a very fair rating you know the taste I think that's fair to take somebody give like a eight and the the looks I'm gonna give us seven so seven eight nine you guys can do some pretty easy math I think that rounds out to about an eighth right yeah something like that some guy oh gee you know like I said when I biology I just want to get with it yeah just give us lit yeah got a little sweat going over here is some doing the rambles it says hands selected by hashtag J 0 9 0 2 I don't know what that means if that's a batch number if that's a Instagram hashtag if that's you know obviously out of mental selects this stuff there but it says it right there clean packaging eight overall from the CCC four too easy yeah man homies got his own string so props for that when you gonna get yours ma'am are you gonna do this with that funk master coach no fmk coming soon right we got we got other priorities but that's always been a dream of mine we did the bhagavata oh geez yeah this first we had to we had the representative Don so one more hey let's try this little trick I got hangovers gone though it's smoked out in this burger if everybody had a good fourth of July like subscribe give all that [ __ ] coming back for more next week see my favor", "UUrEmhHjY-c": "hey everyone you're here with me mr dabber on another before you vape today we're going to be taking a look at the steezy live resin pod now i haven't tried these this is the orange float by the way so i'm really excited to see how much different is it than a regular one i went on their website website's pretty awesome has a lot of information on all the different products not so much on the strains but the merch and whatnot yeah you'll find that so let's go ahead let's open this up and let's see if their live resin pods are worth the vape on the front you'll find the authenticator type of strain their brand type of pod and the stream on the bottom turning it to the right we find the government warning the back has where i purchased it some words ingredients instructions a warning and where to find them turning it again is where and how to open it looking at the top you'll find the branding underneath we find the strain information this one coming in at 79.46 percent thc and 0.87 milligrams cbd to open it just push the tab in and pull from the top the nectar looks extra amber and much darker than the distillate pod let's compare the two with the big and regular steezy i had no problems this one has a very sweet orange turpey taste to it all the way through i really enjoyed creating with this one and it kept the good energy going the pod had me feeling more medicated with less and lasted me about five days with heavy use is it worth the vape look if you've never tried the live resin steezy and find them on sale [ __ ] yeah try it out let me know what you think but at full price you might be able to snag a battery and cart combo from a different brand for about the same overall i am impressed with the live resin steezy pod so much that i went to pick up another while the cell was active the taste and effect are a tier above what you get from the distillate carts but at the regular price point it's hard to recommend i want to know how the live resin steezy pods have left you feeling tell me in the comments down below and thank you for watching this before you vape if you

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's good what's up ladies gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shakka and we're back here for another video boys we're back here for another video um shout out to everyone who saw my last video i made a nature sesh those are the type of videos i love making just me you just chilling smoking relaxing but you know your boy had to pick up a cart for the the cart for the week you know what i mean because you know i always got to have a car on top of weed so this this time your boy got the new stizzy straight and if you guys have been in the live stream you guys know i got this new stizzy strain orange float it's a sativa i got a sativa guys just because young boy's been smoking a lot sleeping a lot young boy needs to get motivated so your boy got himself a sativa and also a new battery boys so let's get into this let's get into it usually um i always get live resin so i had to stick with the live resin but the next time i do try stizzy i want to try their new louis xiii um mango flavor stizzy it's a distillate so we're gonna get that next maybe we'll put it up against the plug play let me know what you guys think in the comments down below but let's get into it guys all right guys sorry about the lighting but it's a little bright right now we got the sun literally right behind my head i'm blocking it with my head so you guys can see me but yo we got the orange flow guys shout out to stizzy we got the orange flow it's a sativa like i told you guys just before it's a sativa and um we got a one grammar guys we got a one grammar that's what it looks like hopefully you guys can see it pretty good sorry i'm not gonna get a close-up this time i'm just going to show you real quick it has that dark live resin goodness like um like most live resins have guys but um let's see what we got on here we have it has delta 9 thc in it 794 milligrams of that but all total total thc in this is 79 and 79 is actually pretty [ __ ] good guys for a live resin because usually you know live resins are even lower in the 50s 60s because it has more other cannabinoids in it because it's a live resin um usually when you get a distillate they're trying to get the most thc they can out of it so you know what i mean um so we got the freaking live resin guys it was good and then we got the camo battery i had to get the camo battery because i used to have a camo battery guys you guys probably seen it on my fakes dizzy versus real steady and i lost that [ __ ] battery so your boy had to get a new battery and we got one so let me open it up real quick and we're gonna hope that this thing isn't dead and that i don't have to charge it because i don't want to charge it so hopefully we get some hits in here it's that camo edition i remember when people first saw me with this camel um stizzy they they told me it was a fake sizzy i was like it's not a fake stizzy battery it's just camos they're camo version man come on now but you know people on the youtube be saying random ass things so sometimes you just can't take that stuff to heart guys you can't you can't take everything that people say on the internet the heart or you're gonna have a bad time on the internet you know what i'm saying that's why i don't like when people say stuff to me and like get mad at me i'm just like whatever like you're not hurting my wife boy i don't even know you i can't see you say it to my face but [Music] yo got the pod sorry about the lighting in this video again guys i might move when i hit this i might just move so here we go i'm actually moving so we're on the move now guys so here it is here's a more close-up look and you can see how dark it is guys it's nice and dark and that's what i love from this um from live resin if it's not dark i kind of think that it's like raw garden that you're trying to be like raw garden and you're not necessarily um a real stizzy like you're i mean not real a real life resident i said it real stinky and you're not really a real live resin you're just a refined you know whatever you want to call yourself so let's take a hit guys man i've been talking for too long let's get [ __ ] higher let's see how potent this is i haven't smoked all day and let's get it because i haven't smoked because this is the only cart that i have guys i have this cart and then i have weed and you can't be smoking weed at work you don't want to smoke smell smell like the dank you don't want to smell like the dead guys so cheers guys i hope you guys are smoking and let's see what this thing tastes like oh [Music] off that off back guys i'm starting to get oh there's a squirrel i wonder if you guys can see him but off back guys this [ __ ] it's given me um it's giving me uh orange cream vibes like it's probably so i'm i'm guessing that this uh strain is actually you know the same strain that they made the live resin for 710 labs the creams creamsicle i think it's called i'm not sure i made a vlog about it go check out that vlog but i'm pretty sure it's like creamsicle or orange orange creamsicle or something like that and this literally tastes just like that guys like tastes so freaking good like it has a very orange citrusy like more like orange peels with a little bit of you know dankness like earthiness to it so it tastes like tree but it has like an orange peel taste if you get what i'm saying not necessarily orange but like orange peel but i'm just chilling guys man just trying to make the most of my day i hope everyone's enjoying their week and in their day man let me know what you guys are doing down in the comments tell me if you guys are in college if you guys are working and if you guys are just you know just trying to make it through this coven just living you know i'm saying but we out here let me take a blinker here we gotta take at least one blanket here i'm taking one blinker hitting us dizzy let's go i don't like taking blinker hits office dizzy's i don't like taking blinker hits off a stizzy but yeah boy had to for you guys one time but like i don't like doing it too often on stizzy just because they their batteries it like it overheats the concentrate so you can definitely burn your concentrate and it won't taste the same it's not going to have that that um that freaking weed profile that that flower profile that you want that taste that you want it's going to be gone it's going to taste burnt it's not going to taste good so make sure you smoke your [ __ ] on lower temp if you want to get that nice taste make sure you don't burn it i mean you could put it to a certain tim to where you still get fat claws but it's not burning just be careful guys we

car push button start i dream every day as i look to the stars all alone", "jgz3vCyAzrI": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video and i picked up some papaya punch and let me get this out of the way i already tried this i ran out of wax and i wanted to open this and it was too dark to film like a like a you know the opening of it but i already tried it and it's honestly very good very much more enjoyable than the mars one and i enjoyed that one but this papaya punch one uh let me just uh zoom in or let me get a video of the packaging for you guys to show you what it's running at so uh but yeah we got the papaya punch right here live resin purchases for 28 out the door at authentic as you can see right here buy a punch even have a number to call because the qr code as well but you know with these that they come with a little field dab tool it's pretty nice uh i have like two of these now you see a little field just this way [Music] very good stuff sugary wax consistency all right now that we got that out of the way um good stuff i mean you saw from the picture the smell it kind of smells like purple punch but only a little bit and i'm guessing that that's maybe one of the crosses in this papaya punch let's get started let's take a [ __ ] here [Music] so he's packing the gobi my trusty gobi that i've been using the [ __ ] out of i mean you've been seeing it in the videos lately it's just been a dope device and uh what's cool about this is i've only charged this twice since i got it and i use this every [ __ ] day let me just tell you that i probably had it for like a month or so now and i've only charged it twice i believe the battery is 1500 milliamp per hour i could be wrong i think it might be uh no i don't think it's 900 i think it's 1500 that's a fat battery that's like a double of a phone battery you know so in a phone the screen takes so much battery you know what i'm saying so like this is just it turns on it heats up i mean it lasts pretty long [Music] life should be much easier but every hidden day that i harbor ain't no angels like me but i see them turning darker wet in the water life should be much easier but every day very enjoyable refreshing taste and you know i was i was taking hits from this yesterday night i was definitely stoned like i needed it before i started editing because yesterday i edited a 30-minute vlog and uh kind of needed some inspiration you know i'm saying and this definitely did the job uh papaya punch i'm gonna assume that it's a hybrid just like it's you know ancestor purple punch but i could be wrong don't quote me on it i will post the crosses right here post process but you know what i'm saying papaya punch is the wind in my book i wouldn't say i'm the biggest fan of purple punch but i love it or i like it i love it um and i enjoy it so like every now and then i'll purchase something punch because when you get something punched purple punch papaya punch [ __ ] skittles punch it's just that sweetness that you it's just a refreshing like satisfying hit you know i don't know how to explain it may sound dumb as [ __ ] but whatever cheers guys oh perfect way to start the morning and i'm saying i'm gonna take one more hit blow it towards the fan because you know that's what i usually do i like to see the smoke and as you can see this is awake and big this is actually the first time i'm smoking today my hair is all over the place i'm sorry but i just woke up put on this bandana and set up shop now we're you know we're smoking and we're recording two of the things i love to do you know what i'm saying so appreciate the [ __ ] out of you guys for just kicking it with me um throughout these years you know i've really come to just appreciate

feelings that i harbor [Music] life should be much easier but every day gets harder searching in my sofa hidden feelings that i i know angels guide me but i see them turning", "TyuAC616qCM": "[Music] how's it going YouTube I'm always placing here back with another video today is going to be a strain review and for review today we actually have some wedding cake so without further ado as you guys can see I'm in nature here actually just in a little forest near my house so hopefully you guys enjoyed the scenery today but anyways let's get right into the review it is wedding cake so obviously we're gonna give you the genetics of wedding cake which is Girl Scout cookies crossed with a cherry pie so that's what makes a wedding cake and let's jump right into this review basically wedding cake was bred by cookie fam genetics they bred all those famous hype strains like Girl Scout cookies gelato and a bunch of other stuff so yeah without further ado I can't give you guys the looks of these buds because I don't have a nut I will show a lot of pictures at the end of the video so I'll give you the smell of this wedding cake which is something very very unique it has like a very just dank doughy vanilla cookie scent in my opinion it's like really really really good it's very hard to describe when you crack open the jar it's kind of like a doughy vanilla just dank muskiness that just hits your nose it almost smells like when you're baking cookies or like croissants or something like it's really crazy but yeah so I'm gonna give you guys basically the looks on the looks of these buds were just dense frosty just rock-hard just amazing beautiful nugs I'm gonna show you guys all the screen shot at the end of the video a quick tip for you guys if you guys want to learn how to light a joint properly this is my way of doing it you obviously want to get the end lit get a cherry going and then just spark it up all right so as you guys can see this joint is burning nice and white the ash this cannabis was flushed very well the grower is actually fat farm craft cannabis Co I'll put the link in the description and you guys can check out his Instagram an amazing amazing grower he actually grew this zombie curse that I reviewed not too long ago but let's get back to the review for the wedding cake so as soon as you pull this it has like thick dense milky smoke but the flavor is like I said it's a doughy vanilla kind of cushiness like it's it's very unique I've never had a strain that tastes like this or smells like this it almost has like like a baked goods kind of reminiscent taste that just coats your mouth like I said very vanilla a very musky dankey cookie just overall an amazing amazing strain another thing I want to let you guys know as you guys can see I'm wearing my portugal jersey let me know who you guys are going for in the World Cup it's been an amazing tournament so far and I can't wait to see who wins I have a feeling it's gonna be an underdog team but we'll see but yeah good luck to your team in World Cup as well let me know who you guys are cheering for in the comments as you guys can see nice white ash beautiful color nice resin ring going right around the joint it won't be able to focus sorry guys I'm using the front-facing camera I actually have my phone lodged on a like a broken tree branch right now so that's how I'm filming this going woo but for the effects of wedding-cake it is a very very very nice hybrid strain it's an indica dominant hybrid I would probably say an 80/20 75 15 or 75 25 kind of like something like that very very heavy just hit you right behind the eyes you just start getting very relaxed and mellow and just stress-free and it's just an amazing amazing full body relaxation no pain in your body like I said if you had any depression or anxiety it would just completely wipe it away and just coat you with an amazing feeling of just being uplifted and happy and just in a good mood and like you know an overall good enjoyable high but at the same time like you're stoned - it's really nice Wow another person's walking by right now so just might see a dog or something in the video yeah I'm kind of in like it's kind of like a ravine kind of path or bike path kind of thing it's not really like a forest or like a park it's kind of a weird area but either way who gives a [ __ ] I'm just smoking a joint anyways if you guys didn't know kind of Canada actually legalized cannabis and it's going to be coming October 17 2018 so go canada baby so I'm gonna get into the ratings out of ten for this wedding cake for the looks out of ten this is a very very nice-looking bud big frosty dense nugs I would have to say out of ten I would say in 8.5 out of 10 very beautiful nugs frosty dense smelly sticky so that's for the looks the smell the smell is also an eight and a half out of ten it's not the best smelling strain in the world but it's very unique and it's almost kind of like one of those dessert kind of strains that you smoke after dinner right before you hit bed or you know just when you're chilling watching a movie it's kind of like a treat when you smoke a joint of wedding cake like how it makes you feel it's so amazing so that's for the looks for the smell is also an 8.5 out of 10 look smell taste the taste comes through exactly like the smell it has that vanilla doughy cushion muskiness that just coats your mouth and just sits there I would have to say it's pretty unique there's not a lot of strains that taste like this there's a few maybe cookie strains that might have that dough anus in there so for the taste I would also have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 what else can I say look smell taste the effects the effects of wedding cake are in my opinion really really really good for an indica dominant hybrid it's exactly what I want I'm clear-headed I'm able to speak properly without stuttering without feeling foggy but at the same time I'm very relaxed and like very stoned and you know very mellow right so it's an amazing feeling I don't think you can really get better than that for indica hybrid effects in my opinion a great daytime smoke and nighttime smoke whenever you want you can even wake and bake if you actually want to I won't really put you right to bed but yeah overall for wedding cake I'm gonna have to give it a solid 8.5 out of 10 it's just that a really well-balanced strain it hits all the marks looks smell tasting effects it's really dank you know the Terps are there so in my opinion it's a very solid strain make sure you guys can get a verified cut of wedding cake if you guys are looking to pick this up so yeah this has been I'm always blazing's review of wedding cake hopefully you guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in the next video have a bake day guys [Music] [Music]", "mX8pvVaptjE": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is trippy Tuesday episode 52 today I am reviewing some taffy diamonds sauce truth Gold Coast's this is their new sauce line and they're calling it diamonds with a Z and it's really just because the THC a chunks in it are really really fat and you'll see that here in the the close-ups as I stir it up tangey is kind of actually subdued by the smell of this apni which is kind of like Afghani oh yeah really really getting that that earthy kind of earthy kind of firm kind of hashey taste along with the tangi funk from DNA which is undeniable and when I was handed this and I was like ah Tandy I don't know I almost asked her different flavor because I feel like tangi is gonna overpower especially in a sauce any other flavor that it's mixed with and this stuff is actually a really even 5050 I was I was really pleasantly surprised by it yeah yeah the tangi scent and and terpene profile is just not it's not overpowering oh but the smell is so dank it is just so so fire yeah I could say outright as far as just a super strong Afghani funk and I concentrate this stuff is probably the loudest I've ever smelled any Afghani it's just reeks out of control yeah just like a spicy not I mean yeah kind of a peppery earthy really funky Cushie taste that's the best way I could describe Afghani ever had a hindu kush it's kind of similar to that this one is yeah the blend of tangi and happy is so big it just smells so fire together when I got this sauce from the booth looks at the underside of this lid and realized that a bunch of the Terp liquid soap into the the styrofoam was like [ __ ] you know so I messaged Gold Coast and I was like hey you might want to have a look at this packaging is I think this is a the very very first drop a release of their sauce so they responded right away and they were like hey yeah we noticed we definitely noticed that straightaway and we changed all the lids so you don't have to worry about that happening to you but unfortunately I think I lost a little bit of the Terps to this lid however I'm still a super flavorful sauce and and really be at the visual appeal of the thca chunks is awesome right guys going in on my first AB here of the taffy diamonds live resin sauce from Gold Coast extracts here in California got them from the booth at a chalice yeah it was really cool meeting you guys seeing the whole crew there yeah I mean really Gold Coast is easily one of my favorite companies you guys stuff is always kill I mean I really I love the white Walker a level the the canopy otic slavers you guys run and really really looking forward to exploring more flavors in this new sauce line which is just killer cheers guys [Laughter] oh man the tangi squeeze yeah the chunkiness of this is really really cool and it's a nice visual reminder or indicator of how much THC a is going into your dab whereas with a couple sauces I bought recently are just so runny that for all I know it's pretty much just mostly Terps and I like there to be some THC in there for sure so if you can visually see that you're dabbing giant chunks of THC you know it's kind of a no-brainer the high will come and with this stuff it is definitely no brainer tangi and the after you which is a pure indica so I'm Amy the hybrid nature of it is such a harsh contrast it's just that it's got the up nature of the tangi and then the full body buzz of the athletes yeah and the flavor is really really unique which is something that I guess as someone who loves concentrates I mean I'm always looking for new flavors this one the taffy yeah keep an eye out for this Oh killer get another tab here going in on a second dab here guys of the taffy diamond sauce from Gold Coast this is their new sauce line Gold Coast live resin that the diamonds big giant chunks of THC a yeah really really killer flavors on this concentrate [Music] I don't know if I mentioned it before but the readings on this nail are maybe not quite accurate this nail has presets or for a lot of different Lee nails so this one this one has a preset but the Sapphire preset I was told by the developers the email needs a little bit more work so the temperature is not quite accurate I think also I have my coil on this leg or modified I stretched the spring coil I kind of stretched it out with pliers so that it fits onto this thing really snug and that really makes a difference on the temperature to you that makes about sixty degrees of temperature difference so in summary you can basically add about sixty degrees to whatever number you're seeing here on the screen and that is the approximate temperature of my dabbing situation so I get that question a lot what what temperature do you set your email to and it's like it's tough because this you know it's really like it's preset based to your specific email so it's kind of like well if you don't have this liger with the Sapphire insert then what I set my email to is completely different than what is probably gonna give you an ideal experience but yeah I try my best yeah the eye from this is very much the harsh unless a harsh mixture but like a harsh contrast of Tangie which is very much an uplifting sativa high of the citrus turkey and profile and in Skunk and then the the half knee which is very much indica definitely giving me that Afghani funky vibe and the mixture of the two yeah it's just as its knocked out it isn't instant buzz hmm Anna and the Indyk that kind of creeps on you too if you do a few dabs of it so yeah I would highly recommend this one to anybody if you see this I haven't seen it in San Diego yet the the Gold Coast sauce but yeah I really hope it gets down here soon the diamonds with the Z the diamond sauce is so fire man and the chunkiness of it too yeah it's really a joy to deal with and the nose on it it is it is something a lot of sauce and it's it's really a joy to see that coming from big-name companies yeah just really really killer stuff that's gonna wrap up this episode of Turkey Tuesday this has been episode 52 again reviewing the tapi diamond sauce I got from Gold Coast booth when I was at chalice festival melting out the desert yeah next year I'm hoping it is somewhere that is more air-conditioned like a giant convention hall or something yeah the Gold Coast had their own building and and their booth was really badass so it was really really awesome to get a hold of this stuff and try it out and so glad I did yeah it just killer sauce I'll see you guys next week thank you so much for tuning in to the CCC 420 peace [Music]", "9C2D6rp64Mw": "[Music] hey what's up guys we've got a really cool video for you today we're going to be making rosin infused gummies [Music] the recipe is simple all you'll need is a box of jello mct oil agave or corn syrup sunflower lecithin citric acid and gelatin first things first grab an eighth of some balm weed and go ahead and pack your bag bottle tech style we are going to be smashing on the nug smasher x so we're using nug smasher x 120 micron bags the x is a dream to operate one button extractions it doesn't get any easier than this [Music] [Music] [Music] we collected our rosin and we yielded a little less than a gram next we're going to heat our x-plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit grab your d-carb capsule and throw your rosin in the rosin pot close up the d-carb capsule and put it between the plates for 20 minutes so we can activate our thc [Music] once our 20 minutes is up be very careful when releasing the plates a ton of pressure is built up in our decarb capsule proceed with caution when removing a decarb capsule from between the plates [Music] now that our rosin is ready to infuse we are going to add 10 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker [Music] add low heat to help the rosin infuse with the oil [Music] [Applause] [Music] now that our mct oil is infused we're going to add a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin and we're going to stir it until it fully dissolves into our mct oil [Music] once our oil is ready we'll set it aside so we can start making our gummies [Music] first things first we're going to add 1 3 cup of water to our beaker next let's add a quarter cup of agave to our water you can use corn syrup if you like we chose to use agave instead go ahead and turn on your magnetic stirrer next we're going to add a half packet of jello you can pick any flavor you like we decided to go with lemon [Music] add one packet of knox gelatin to our mix next we are going to add a quarter teaspoon of citric acid [Music] let the mixture stir for five minutes on low heat so that the gelatin can bloom and all of the mixture looks consistent and doesn't have any clumps [Music] and for the final step we save the best ingredient for last we're going to add our mct oil and let that infuse with our gummy mixture grab your gummy molds and spray them with cooking oil using a dropper carefully fill all your molds let them sit out for about 30 minutes and then place them in the fridge for another 30 minutes [Music] let your gummies aerate for 24 to 48 hours to achieve maximum gumminess this will also help with storage bon appetit your weed infused gummies are ready to eat thanks for watching and don't forget to keep calm and smash on nug smasher rosin made simple [Applause] [Music] you", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "-VzHBMDntHg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another cali kosher video i ended up going to authentic again and i picked up some of their zerbert sauce i will post the video of me opening it i did open it but i didn't try it yet so uh basically on camera you're gonna get my initial reaction to the wax hopefully the lighting is good uh it's pretty dark outside i mean that's all right uh but yes serbert sauce let's read some of this stuff it is a hybrid 73.09 percent thc with cannabinoids total up to 83.93 percent uh cbd not determined uh manufactured date 619 2020. yeah and then package 6 25 20 20. all that stuff i bought it authentic for i believe it was 29 they did have lemon lemon something still but that was one of their old strains of the cali kosher so they sold it for 25 this might have been 27 i don't know could be wrong actually let me see all right so [Music] cali kosher was 25 so i'm gonna be using my inhilco e straw this one uh is pretty much a little bit clogged i haven't been i didn't even clean at all since i got it but uh usually with the first one i usually run it just to have it run and uh heat up and unclog itself so yeah [Music] so just like the other way i'm going to basically get some dab on to this so i don't waste all my dab because usually when you just dip this all in your wax it leaves a stain and it's very unappealing all right let's try that so set that up you guys probably seen this by now it did look less than a gram but let's see so all right i'm gonna take about two hits i'm probably gonna finish it off with a utilian hit why not right because i don't think uh with this you can only do it uh there's like you got to wait like a minute in between hits [Music] that's pretty lacking well the taste is not bad um what is this screen oh the strain is uh sherbet all right let's try this again cheers boys it is on the red i really do need to char this charge this full way but i'm treating it oh that was tasty [Music] i really didn't give it too much justice on here i mean it was a pretty all decent hit but let me finish off the review with the utilian the trusty old utilian thing so it's right here very very um how you describe that flavor i don't know it's a very it definitely tastes like wheat like uh it it tastes like the the strain or not the strain i don't know i haven't tried sherbet in its flower form but like it tastes like flour i had to uh compare it to anything but we're gonna take this last hit i'm gonna blow it towards the the light for you guys just to show you guys that we getting smoke here [Music] so with that i'm probably gonna take one more hit for you guys but as far as this wax goes for 25 dollars not bad i would say it tastes very similar to the other cali kosher like i've tried cali koshers that tasted like this before but i would say this is a more stronger taste it's a very og earthy [ __ ] pungent smell or like taste i don't i don't really know how to describe it but you're definitely gonna get caught up if you smoke this [ __ ] like it lingers the smell lingers so just let you know you're you're warned so definitely doesn't smell like it or tastes like it smells when i smell it it does smell like like a like a light fruitiness to it but when i'm inhaling or when i'm dabbing it it doesn't actually necessarily give up the same that it smells just weird usually it tastes somewhat similar you know so let's try this last hit hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately and i'm saying i've been doing my best to uh just upload um constantly you know that way you know you guys always have something to watch you know especially in these times and age when just [ __ ] is boring you know people can't go out people can't do [ __ ] you know youtube's being watched more so why not make more videos you know so cheers boys [Music] so look all right guys that's it for the video hopefully you enjoyed the video you know what i'm saying i do have a new wax that i haven't tried yet so be on the lookout for that subscribe you know click that bell all that good stuff if you haven't already i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "UJjCm66lHAE": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is a Cresco review I guess but before I start this video I like to mention this isn't going to reflect the review on their product but it's a story when I went to haul the flowers me and the homie calamity we approached Cresco and before we even like approached them I already knew what Crisco was I've always wanted to try their products just because I've seen them on Instagram look like a very reputable company you know I want to try their cartridges they looked pretty nice you know so I definitely knew about them going into haul of flowers and going to their stand but like I just remember like I introduced myself I said I had a youtube channel obviously you know it's it's nothing over there I wasn't a business owner or anything and I was just like a so you know if I could just purchase one like full price like purchase one of these cartridges cuz I you know like like I said I like cartridges that's what I like and I wanted to try their [ __ ] and basically they told me they only have one left and they're like trying to save it for like let's just say dispensary owner for them to try and see if they want to keep it in there if they want to actually purchase more for their dispensary and I feel it but as we were walking away they basically laughed at us like like we were like nothing or something and I'm not saying I'm like importing in the world but to like laugh at us as we were walking away it just really left a really bad impression on I know it's if they don't probably reflect the whole company but the people that represented them at all the flowers basically laughed at us saying that was weird or some [ __ ] like that's never happened like a person just offered to like buy their product you know I want to make a video on it but yes fast word today I finally got one of their products obviously I wanted the cartridge but this is gram of their wax which was only twenty dollars pretty good and I've already tried it it's been open already oh that's good stuff I like to mention that the dispenser that I went to doctors Medical Center or whatever the [ __ ] doctors med I'm sorry I just ate a lot and drink a lot of liquids but uh basically I went there and they had like a stack of these like it looked untouched for only $20 a gram so that either means that that deal started today or that the deal has been going and no one's just been buying that either one of those you know I'm saying but I got one for you guys and you can see all the good stuff right here hopefully the Lighting's good in my room but like I said the experience I had at the stand that Cresco does not is not going to reflect this review although I think those guys were [ __ ] douche bags but that Cresco is still pretty good baron you know star or very these fellas strawberry wrong and I'm saying we could make do with that so this is running in about [Music] 73.8% tasty and yeah let's just get into it I got my pen right here and I already tried this um so the first initial hits that took him nothing special I wasn't too tripping about it too much because it was $20 a grand and it was $20 out the door so it's a good deal you know but then towards like maybe my fifth or six days started tasting better you know not gonna lie but obviously if in terms of like what I pay like a $5 extra for raw garden or a little $10 extra probably but I wanted to try it for you guys and the price was just appealing you know but you just got to wonder why this is priced at so little you know no I really don't know but here's what it looks like guys very very very very good stuff from the looks of it right this is live sugar and they have some pretty good streams as well so hopefully you guys can see I apologize but as you can see it's a very sugary like consistency you can leave like this you won't fall well yeah just that experience just I'm I don't I've never been laughed at like that you know it would have been cool you know if I said something funny or if I approach them the wrong way or whatever but all I did was ask if I could borrow her if I could buy a cartridge you know full price didn't have to give me no deal you know I've been wanting to try this [ __ ] I've been wanting to try them try chemistry and all these other stuff but they're not near me so when I had the opportunity to go up there and try to ask for one [ __ ] laugh at my face saying that you know they said their thing where they wanted to say that last one for the people but as we're walking away you just had to laugh and basically tell us to [ __ ] off like come on but we're still gonna be hitting this but overall it's been tasting pretty good I still haven't tried their cartridge but um from the looks of it it looks pretty good you know just because I had a bad experience with them doesn't mean I can't admit that the product looks good yeah cheers guys whoo-hoo but good one now there's one so definitely better there's like a weird taste initially that you get passed and then you get that strawberry banana taste I'm not saying it tastes like strawberries or bananas but strawberry banana the strain has a specific taste and it tastes like that towards the end of the hit but yeah just uh pack another bowl it's or pack another hit and they were probably gonna call the video here and yeah if you see Cresco just let me know if you've tried them let me know if you like them and let me know how your experience I mean you probably haven't like met the people that work that Crespo because she probably buying it at dispensaries but I don't know that whole thing was just I could have cheers guys oh that's going to be it for the video hopefully you guys enjoyed it peace out [Music]", "j3CRe2-R8Yg": "cheers this film [Music] [Music] yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back - true so I have another training review for you guys in this video actually a concentrate review we're going up with a brand trip and we're going over the the wedding cake chatter so here's the package for you that's pretty simple so I'm really not gonna go over it because it's just just a [ __ ] envelope but if you want um there's our social medias right there so you can go check them out if you want to do some more research on know more but every what I mean so there you go on that um besides for that you guys know what [ __ ] wedding cake is I'm sure like everybody does by now she smoked weed I've got one gram of shatter gold wedding cake that's what it says the harvest eight six twenty seven nineteen which is like two two months ago from the day I'm recording this so not too old they have a size four that there's really just and what I mean so let's it's sealed by like a little sticker right there so I dropped it so let's go ahead and like take that stick with I'll crack the steel and open this [ __ ] up so yes oh I didn't open this thing up so so so we got it open Ned pretty self-explanatory pretty simple packaging I mean it's [ __ ] dope it gets the job done like it definitely gets the job done and it looks [ __ ] dope with it I mean just not really much to say about it like it is what it is you know what I mean so yeah um inside that though he's in parchment paper and your shadow right there so go ahead and open this up oh yeah just looking fire I'll get some close-up shots for you guys in a second here you guys go it right off the bat that's just looking [ __ ] fire so let me get some close-up shots at my phone real quick for you guys and then tell me down below in the comments where you guys think of it like looks-wise on then we'll get the [ __ ] spoke initiate you know what I mean so yeah just give me one second and then we'll get into this [Music] I got like 30 seconds recorded on my phone so I got some close-up shots for you guys but oh but yeah I want to start smoking on this channel I'm trying to get high right there for a second but not for oh I'm trying to focus on this so the TAC you're in though I'll give that sugar rating already I mean like it could it's [ __ ] dope for like for what it is you don't mean like a lot of companies issues like rebel envelopes and like they finally just white and boring you know I mean I always say if they went out of their way like to like put that like whole 3d and not 3d effects but like um what do you call that shiny effect on it and make it look oh I like make their own car inside its cardboard - it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments

see you guys get notified every time we upload my go everybody will catch you guys next video yep", "3jmZbv3IdD0": "watching it live I'm sure this guy of course of course he goes Palm Beach of course this guy goes for the best tastes like the way it smells guys good to see them and the people that hate it and then love it we're gonna beat the people to know long", "kTGQsPVB-68": "all right uh welcome back you guys loony with another video i am [ __ ] excuse my language i'm pissed i'm pissed so i uh already opened up the key lime this key lime pie and this shabbat gill and i literally was doing a comparison and this key lime pie 79 percent tac and the cherbacho alien labs coming in at 68 thc 71 cannabinoids got the key lime pie i was doing a scientist i was doing a comparison in terms of potency how it smokes how it feels and everything and eight minutes into the video uh my silly ass didn't have my phone on uh silent so someone called me and it literally screwed up the whole video i got to start it from the beginning so here i am reviewing these products again for uh so um which is you know i guess it's a blessing in disguise i just sucks because i didn't get i opened up on camera and now you guys don't get to experience that with me so that's that's the only thing that sucks and you guys didn't experience my first hit uh with this which also sucks but this key lime pie tastes just like pie just like the pie dough it tastes uh very uh it smells very leafy which is weird it doesn't smell how it tastes it's very dark it was made on the the second this uh this uh zero two of 2020 which is crazy that's like so long ago so you can tell it's an old batch because it has an old sticker and so all in all this is doesn't feel this one doesn't feel as potent as the 79 percent as it claims to be and i've had th thcs i've had i'm high because i took a a lot of pus i've had stizzy's at lower percentages that hit harder so i don't know what it was to do with that but this is the only life resident so far that i would wouldn't really recommend key lime pie it feels like it feels good don't get me wrong the high feels good it just doesn't feel as good as the previous ones i've had and i still have a lot more to try so i'm excited so so far this key lime pie i wouldn't recommend like i said earlier just because uh the smell is weird it doesn't smell very good it smells like it's uh smells like uh smells like smells bad like you just someone with someone else who's less who doesn't have much of a vocabulary will probably just say it smells like [ __ ] but i would agree you know sorry about that um let me guys let me show you guys the view where i was where i'm sitting here enjoying myself smoking doing this review with you guys reviewing this product so all in all key lime pie not a fan sour diesel the one i was smoking earlier yesterday i reviewed this one yesterday i'm not a big fan of it either because you know i'm not a big sativa guy a lot much i like uh hybrids a lot more i want to apologize for uh yesterday's video it was kind of bland just because i wasn't fair i wasn't feeling very well i had a headache and i shouldn't have i probably should have heard off held off on the video but either way i'm not i knew i wasn't going to really i went into that kind of like uh you know because i'm not a fan of sour diesel like that i just trying everything just so you guys can you know get a sense of how every product is for the most part so this cherbacho this [ __ ] alien labs in general i love it like this oil is so much so much more clearer than this dizzy will like this dizzy almost looks black look at that dude it's crazy like i don't know this it might just be this batch specific batch that is just not that good but every other live version from steezy i've had was amazing like i mean the high is good i'm not gonna lie the high is not bad it's just not as good that's all i'm saying it's just not as good and it's 79 almost 80 percent thc that's high percentage for a live resident i'm like let's be real this [ __ ] is coming in at 68 tc and it smacks me way harder than this so you know it's it's something you guys got to look out for but this is a lot more expensive to 60 and a half grams so you know i just picked it up for 40 uh 40 for 45 i mean because i was on discount but let me go ahead and try this one for you guys i'm trying both again and then i'm gonna try to give you guys another uh flavor profile let me cleanse my palate though all right try the stitchy one first yeah dude this smells bad like it makes me want to pull my nose away from it it's like uh you know that's that's i know you guys are not going to want that so unless you get a key lime pie that's a brand new batch like recent like last month couple months ago and it's you know the oil is a lot lighter it might be better but i have no idea they might all be like this let me go ahead and try i might even try another key lime pie in the future just because i might because you never know you can get a hit and miss it could be a duck just like edible eat a hundred milligrams for some reason now it hits you and then you eat 100 milligrams uh another time and for some reason it doesn't hit you and it could be the same brand so who knows it could be like that with these cartridges but we'll see let me take this hit see i'm kind of upset because [Music] i think that's the first time i've ever coughed from a hit as of yet and that's why i said it makes me upset because it feels good going down like it gave me lung expansion to the point where i actually took on my throat made me want to cough like in a good way like i feel good i like that and it tastes good but it's just the smell i don't know why the smell is not coming through oh see i'm not gonna lie you take a big rip of this it's actually uh it's actually good like i'm not gonna see it like i'm it's hard to uh it's hard to judge it now because i've i was i took like three hits of this uh off camera on camera but you know i had to start all over all over so i took three hits of this and i had took one hit of this and then that hit you guys just watched me do that so that's my fourth hit of this it was a and that was a you know that was probably the biggest hit i've taken so far so it feels good like it i'm not gonna lie it feels good but like i said it just doesn't feel as intense as the other ones like the other ones like the gorilla glue number four if you go to that video i had to close my eyes for a second like that's what i'm saying like right after the hit i'm like i'm like oh trying to catch my breath that's what i'm talking about that's that's the intensity i'm looking for you know but i'm gonna go ahead and try this one for you guys actually tastes amazing chewbacco tastes amazing i taste the gelato and i taste the sherbet because that's what that's what makes chabakio gelato 41 and sherbet and i taste both of those crazy in the in the in the flower version strain version live resiny it's amazing it smells great too like i can i can just i can leave it here and enjoy it myself while like you know smelling this wonderful marijuana aroma but this on the other hand when i smell it it makes me want to pull my nose away from them like you know it's like that's that's i don't like that because it kind of like kind of ruins my experience especially if you blow out the smoke i'm so i'm lucky i didn't i'm surprised i haven't smelled that that smelled that blowing the smoke out i don't even think about it god but it tastes amazing though like it tastes good well still i feel i feel really [ __ ] this shits when you combine them of course it's you know you never can never go wrong but obviously this one's gonna you know hands down is better than the stizzy but there are some stizzies that hit just like this one so it's it's hard to say so for the most part i will still stick with your stizzy live resins just because you got to just make sure that before you cut before you purchase them which i should have done just look at the dates because you can see that you can see the percentages on the boxes before you leave which i do all the time so as might as well check the dates i don't even know why i didn't check the dates but that's something that's a tip i'm going to give you guys and that's that's gonna be it for this video i still got two more uh still got two more uh stizzy's to try the super green crack which i'm looking forward to forward to even though it's a sativa and a silver line just because green cracky masquerade crack it's iconic super which is a super silver haze and green crack makes super dream crack so that's for just what you guys know if you guys probably don't already know and then i got the other one which is a chem reserve and uh forget what it is right now because i'm pretty stoned but when i come up with that uh hybrid it's a hybrid live resin i

tested or a batch number try that psi live right there it's when it was tested nine sixteen nineteen it's an $80 grandma wax right here eighty dollars for this little box it's nuts damn I thought this was an intercom kind of pissed it's a hybrid Oh CBD though got this little case he comes with it make sure it's a straight always got the [ __ ] on the back of the label to blow tongue crack this I haven't even looked at this yet so see what it looks like ooh get all that it's like sand almost focus [ __ ] see all that shine this is what diamonds look like alright let me show you this is without flash you can see it a little bit better than on the light you can see those crystals down there it's kind of like Dustin I think so so big sand got my dad picked timers on I'm going to take this cloud insert just fill it up look at all you just give one last shot of this before their debit so if you don't know what this is this is a cloud insert here's the packaging for it you can get these for $12 they come with a little tool that's about 25 dollars and this is the instructions on it so if you take this little thingy put in your banger and you wait 25 to 30 seconds wait no after 25 to 30 seconds then you put it in your Bangor and yeah you just smoke starts creating yeah and you'll see right and mixing it with this one where is it they both look the same except this is just older than this this is brand new I actually think I've taken more to this than I have this take a little bit of distiller so I got my rig heat knocked down over here where got my rig heating up right here see it gonna be taking the element see that right over there just take a dart sprinkle someone in on there get it all sticky just dip it right in there get a nice little dab on there I'm trying to see it take your time a glass flip that over wait a minute let's take another look at this so some of you are asking probably what does this taste like so what is this taste like there's like a hint of cherry in it like yeah it's cherry cookie but like I didn't think you would actually taste cherry but she do I don't know if I were to give this like a 1 out of 10 there zero out of ten I'm not too sure there's not really a taste on it I mean yeah you can taste the cherry in it but it's not like heavy taste but let's go ahead and take this dab I put the dart down there so they kind of affected it a little bit but like you guys ever ate like a cherry pie before it's kind of what it tastes like", "1DRnOtwc9fY": "[Music] hey everybody welcome nother episode you do my name is bud thank you for joining us I'd like to say thank you to my subscribers right away in recent weeks and months we've been I've been getting a lot of subs for this channel so thank you comments as much as you can I'll try to get back to you today we have something very exciting we have if you can see in front of me we have from the company we'd - deals dot CA I have a couple of different strains and I'm gonna review over the next couple of weeks and this one here is the LA Kush cake so it is seven grams that they sent in this little package I'm just going to show you how beautiful these Nuggets are okay look at this I'm gonna actually maybe just put them right on the table and you can kind of you can focus in a bit looks oh good look at that stuff and it smells delicious they're really dense like thick thick nuggets this one right here will most likely roll two or three joints so really good quality at this point on the nose oh it really has like a a bit of a lemon zest citrus fruit kind of a smell to it a little bit pungent like a little bit of a cheese smell really really nice you can tell this is good stuff I can actually put it back in the package before I screw any of it up but again thank you - we - deals dossier for suddenly this stuff a couple of other things that I would not be promoting these products if I didn't like them what does two of the things are gonna be using quite a bit now the grinder here it's magnetic so it snaps together which is really nice and then the their version of a Zippo which is kind of like it has like that like the cop taser lighting process there and at the bottom it's a charger that you can just keep charging it instead of having to buy very expensive lighter fluid okay so I think what I'll do is I'm gonna chop this up get a nugget or two in here not many just a few it's you can tell when you push it on to the grinder that it's quite sticky which sometimes does not grind very nice but we'll see how it goes here we go so you just kind of push it together and snap it and then you start to it rolls this grinder just grinding so smoothly it's amazing then as you get down it gets closer together oh yeah really gonna grind it up nice and fluffy oh there's a bit of a chunk in there try to get that down too and as I'm grinding the aromatics that are coming off of this stuff are incredible oh it's a little bit more earthy a little bit more herbal dirt kind of notes to it I'm gonna just get my nose in here yeah really nice so it's a sweetness to it a little bit fruity okay here we go they did weed - deal za also sell rolling papers that are on their website and they have kind of these built-in filters and you can make the joints as long or a big as fat as you want I still I'm gonna always gonna stick to my zigzag whites let's see how this goes here we go one thing that's nice in the the weed worlds there's just so many strains nowadays that you can try and and the variety it just keeps on changing and I think it's kind of like if you were to be a connoisseur of say like whiskey or something like that it's just they keep coming out with new versions new years of different strains and sometimes they're better than previous years and so on so it's kind of endless here we go the stuff is nice and sticky I can already feel it sticking to itself a little bit and long rolling this hold on there we go and that little bit of pot that I put into the grinder you can see that it probably that nugget right there round enough for two joints so that's kind of cool okay here we go again using the weed deals Zippo I personally don't like to put it in my mouth and do it it's kind of like when you just burn the end of it it's really kind of perfect oh yeah look at it get tasered awesome there we go mmm really kind of nutty nutty and buttery so what we have again this is the La Push cake it doesn't tell you on the package if it's an indica or sativa but a lot of the time these style strings they are hybrids anyways so it also doesn't mention the percentage of THC versus CBD but I know from the products that have tried from these guys so far it's been really really good clear-headed style stuff so almost in the sativa world but it's really tasty really aromatic those smells really nice again it's got those earthy flavors a little bit sweet in the realm of different fruits really really nice stuff I'm actually going to only have two or three puffs maybe one more just for that I can blow at the camera here oh yeah all right well again my name is bud subscribe click like if you haven't already I try to always call respond to comments most commonly asked questions so far our a myself African no I'm from Canada but I visited once and I have a hat that's kind of as far as that story goes and no I'm not seth rogen but we are both from the same province and enjoy our weed so Seth if you're watching get in touch ok cheers everybody [ __ ] you soon [Music]", "jZ6x8shCQqI": "- PO Boxes you're gonna be doing a video today for you guys I really hope you guys are doing good it is Wednesday afternoon today I'm just kicking back - I was just wondering you know what do you guys prefer you live residents really hot right now really popular now compared to distillate which distillate pretty good you know don't get me wrong it's still [ __ ] fire but a lot of people been saying you know distillate get you a little bit more higher than live resin or I don't know it just depends but they say live resins way WAY tastier than distillate but this really gets you higher than live resin so here we have a live resident Stiggy what a distillate is your regular stays you know that means hopefully you guys got a close-up on the tasty percentage so one has more CBD than the other one so that's pretty interesting as well so let me know what you guys prefer a live resin or a distillate you know pretty curious about that so we're gonna see you know to me I honestly I love both I [ __ ] with distillate a lot to me honestly I love distillate since dizzy came out it's one of my favorite distillate cartridges or applause whatever you want to call it plug and play and there's just other some other distillate cartridges are pretty fire out there but here we have a live residence tizzy this was a this was a living cookies you know I did a review on it but I haven't dropped it it's just I've been really really busy you know it means daughters coronavirus [ __ ] going on but if you guys haven't noticed live resin is way darker than actual distillate is as you guys can see this little a way lighter than what a live resin is so you know first when I seen a live resin cartridge or a pod I was like what the [ __ ] you know cuz it's way way darker so that it was like one of my first times I had try live resin so it was way darker so I was like kind of sketched about it but you know they taste really really good they taste fresh like most of life resin cartridges are really dark you know dark amber color compared to like a rocker which is really light but the but the taste on it is way way different but so today we're gonna do comparison table I'm gonna take a blink round of both of them and I'm gonna hold it in and see which one will choke me out a little better to see which one will get any high so first off we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and hit this regular distillate sativa cartridge it's a Sour Diesel as you guys can see I've gotten out of my dispensary in the fake [ __ ] you know it's good to spend extra money on the legit cartridge guys you know to make sure you guys are smoking no [ __ ] so we're gonna go ahead and take a blink out of this distillate pot and I'm going to let you guys know if it's better than the library cheers guys if you guys are smoked a lot let me go ahead and do so [Music] those who know distillates dizzy pods are always [ __ ] fired the blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play but the blinkers on the stasis are [ __ ] fire you know all you need is like maybe one blinker or two and you're good so the oil on the dizzies on the regular distillate they're really thick compared to a life resin after couple hits the live resin the library will run way way more than what a distillate when you know what I mean so if you were to flip it upside down after hit a night it will you know the oil will go upside down real quick so I'm feeling pretty high running off the distal ahead so we're gonna let him show you guys a close-up on the life resin one as you guys can see it's darker as I was saying so I suggest to see the California little sticker but they say you know don't be sketched about it you know if you guys get life rising cartridges and they're darker just because you got smoked rock garden and they're little lighter doesn't mean they're good you know but like rock garden is far but I'm just giving you guys an example you know just because it's darker doesn't mean it's bad but I take a hit of this life resident cartridge and we're gonna applaud whatever I just get mixed up by same pot and cartridge but we're not going to see what's the difference on it so I'm gonna take a blink row this life resin this is the lemon cookies I'm gonna see how it tastes [Music] Wow now the taste on it it's really fired to be honest the THC percentage it's a little lower than the distillate but the feeling you get on the throat is way different it's more like if you took a DAB like an actual diet and the taste on it it tastes so better it tastes it tastes so clean like it tastes like if you actually took like a DAB you know like the smell of it like you can literally taste like the actual terpene in it you know compared to the distillate you know the d\u00e9sol\u00e9e it does taste good but you do get like a little fakeness taste to it compared to life resin but it tastes pretty good you know I'm going to take another hit you know that's how good it is if you guys haven't had the lemon cookie you guys time how the lemon cookie won this one's pretty far ready going now to take another hit off to the [ __ ] taste so bitter [Music] but the light resident does run out a little faster than the distillate guys now now that we hear both of them honestly it's up to preference if you guys prefer life resin go ahead and drop a like or whatever let me know in the comments section of you guys prefer live resin or a distillate cartridge to me honestly I smoke any one it just depends you know I'm not really picky when it comes to smoking cartridges as long as they taste good and get any high as [ __ ] I'm good with that but that doesn't mean I'll get like the cheapest [ __ ] but you know I just like to try new [ __ ] not like I'll let you guys know if it's fire but to me honestly I'll [ __ ] with both but let me know what you guys preferred so now that we tried both of them it's time to abuse the share of these bad boys let's go ahead and hit both of them at the same time oh wow catcha is really good you know I see a lot of people that carry two batteries at the same time it's just one of them [ __ ] up so I had to get another one but ended up working all of a sudden so now I have to so that's pretty dope I really hope you guys stay safe out there while she got his hands coronavirus a [ __ ] so don't really want you guys to end up and catching it and nothing like that so you guys be safe out there take care of supra-conscious and you know and drop a like and comment what you guys would like to see next but peace guys",

like a yellow rock like the [ __ ] is like the for real for real and how they make these guys is it's with a CEO to process and I'm gonna take that rock out real quick and just show it to you a little bit more I'm gonna grab my little dabber here and I'm just gonna take it out like that right like that I check that guy out while and they make it with a co2 process and what happens is they let it cure and they just keep cleaning any cleaning it and cleaning it so I'm gonna show you this now on like my hand I mean you can actually like touch this this is like it's like a diamond I mean it's it's really like a diamond I mean that's what it feels like it's hard it's like not like gooey like you know your normal wax or whatever but again this is a concentrate product it's this is like wax this is pure why so now what we're gonna do is let's do a hit and I'll give you my honest review about it now I'm gonna put this huge guy right back in there and I'm gonna keep this nice little fat chunk right here and just stick it on the end of my diver right there and I'll heat my pipe up now normally I smoke with glass but unfortunately before this video I got all waxed up and I [ __ ] drop my glass and I broke my bulldozer or so I'm kind of just like last minute hitting in this doing this review for you guys and letting you know about some freaking diamonds because this [ __ ] is just so so pure it tastes so good I mean the just the quality of it is just saying 100% I mean this is just like the purest pure form of THC you can actually get you know the stuff that you know everybody smokes in the carts and stuff that stuff Scott you know it's cut with like you know could because coconut oil or various other types of you know cut but this right here this isn't cut at all this is just pure pure cannabinoids and THC so I'm trying to heat this plate up as hot as I could get it cuz I want it to just be like glowing red whenever I throw this diamond on there and then it'll just kind of vaporize and then just really kind of expand my lungs and the gelato it tastes like really super good I mean like it has a good fruity kind of like real nice and smooth taste to it so I think I got this guy hot enough I'm gonna go for it mmm Cheers yeah that's the [ __ ] wow that may be slobber Wow yeah so uh you don't need much of these I would suggest to do like I call poor head so I go

body through my neck my neck pain has disappeared I have arthritis and my neck neck pains gone I have bad knees and arthritis in the knees as well that pain is gone um you know I have a little bit of

that just ripped me oh my god hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today we are doing another delta 8 thc video quick recap that is a cannabinoid that is extracted from hemp cannabis plants it gives you a similar feeling to delta 9 thc that we all know and love but we sort of like to think of it as thc's little brother something that's not going to give you those same kind of paranoid effects from higher doses but i think the biggest surprise from this video is that i had no idea how many different ways you could apply delta eight for this video we've partnered with hometown heroes based in austin texas using hemp grown here in the united states they extensively work with veterans and a portion of all proceeds goes to help the vfw and the dav they sent us this big box so let's pop open this box and dive into it so let's start with the way that we've already at least featured on this channel before which is using a cart so we've got a 510 thread vaporizer cartridge here it's got 600 milligrams of delta eight and it is flavored after strawberry coffee and because it's a 510 thread cart you can pretty much put it into any battery is good for those carts and install it click a button and you're good to go oh cheers alice there we go i love it get this started oh nice big hit off of that yeah does kind of remind me of this kind of cotton candy flavor to it especially with the strawberry cough oh yeah really nice flavor it's not like overly sugary candy but this is this is good i would not mind smoking on this all day long so another way to consume delta eight is actually by smoking moon rocks kind of like a turducken of cannabis you take bud you take wax you take keef you push it all together into this crazy kind of hash sort of looking like thing and you can easily add it to a packed bowl or even sprinkle it into a little bit of a joint what this is is cbd bud with delta 8 distillate on top and then rolled again in cbd keith another very easy way to consume delta 8 is actually with delta 8 infused edibles edibles everybody loves edibles yeah we are looking at three different flavors gummies are kind of the go-to for edibles i love that i'm looking at pink lemonade fruit punch and blueberry and blueberry so these have 25 milligrams of delta eight per gummy and there are ten gummies in each container pretty good off of this vape i've taken a couple hits a bit yeah it's it's not that i'm high because i know what that feeling is this is different but i do feel pretty chill pretty uplifted that's what's so great about delta 8 is that i feel like we could dabble in every single way here and not get so floored that we couldn't get off the couch because that's not what the whole point of deltate it's to give you a kind of milder experience so cheers cheers everyone yeah that's good get a little gummy definitely don't taste the cannabis i don't taste any cannabis in this whatsoever if i just ate this out of a candy jar i would not know it's inedible what's great about these two is that it's kind of in the same genre as cbd which a lot of states have legalized and are allowed to ship and everything like that go ahead and check out the website for like exact details on bi-state specifications but pretty much all of this can get shipped nationwide which is really cool great way to experience cannabis a very popular cannabinoid without worrying that you're like breaking the law this is only one cannabinoid off of thc is delta nine that's delta eight exactly right another edible way of experiencing delta eight we have a couple of different tinctures usually one of the strongest ways to feel the effects of cannabis definitely the strongest in this box yeah yeah this is each bottle comes with 1200 milligrams that's insane 40 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter with tinctures usually it's good to just do them right under the tongue absorbed into your body really quickly tend to take effect really quickly great way to infuse food too if you're doing any kind of cooking add a couple of drops of this to it and like bam your whole meal is now infused this is the natural tincture this is mint tincture and this is berry i'm gonna try a little berry oh going for it you know i'll try a drop of the mint it's like a i was expecting it to be a little bit more syrupy but it's flavored water almost yes there's there's a lot of different almost like mouth sprays mouthwash that kind of reminds me of i mean this is also the mint so i'm definitely getting that's true that's true you should be feeling the effects of these very quickly i know i'm already just now starting to feel the first effects of the pen getting in front of the camera you're just like oh what's the next thing going but this i'm just like in the flow of it right now yeah there is just kind of an uplifting sort of happy mood and we haven't actually smoked any thc today so this is all just purely a delta eight high rolling on to the next product i see what you did there we're looking at this roll-on topical i know you can infuse delta nine you know thc with different topicals especially because it works really well for like veterans for anyone that has chronic muscle pain you can roll it on to very specific pain points on your body relaxation it has a kind of like i i rubbed a little bit on my arm earlier and it has a kind of like minty tingle feeling as well yeah i could actually see this working really well for any kind of a like post workout regiment um i did just roll a little bit on my arm and i do see what you mean there is kind of like a cooling like very light tingling effect feeling really good if you've got any kind of like neck or back or muscle cramps of just rolling that in and feeling the medicine get inside that's great nothing to do with like smoking or eating i this could not be easier for anyone that is totally adverse and afraid of cannabis in general the last way to use delta a that i was really surprised at hometown hero is introducing this to the market is dabbing it dabbing we've got delta 8 dabs here color on that is really nice and light let's try a delta 8 dab and see how we feel pull out the last things we've got some goodies here these are both dope rolling trays like cool and kind of trippy and sort of like future get kind of westworld vibes from these got kind of like alien sort of angel robot it looks very cool on camera too with the light hitting it damn yeah i'm trying out the sixth final way to do delta eight which is dabbing it cheers everyone as alice the first to try this this new delta eight experience infusing it into these dabs that was a big dab too it tastes a lot like cbd very cbd taste but i do enjoy the taste of cbd so there you go that just ripped me oh my god cheers everyone yeah i am feeling nice and groovy right now between the vape and the edibles and the tincture and my arm is feeling all tingly we've also still got the moon rocks there i i love it shout out to hometown hero i really am a fan that dab is kind of like next level and if you want to see more delta 8

wow what's my intro i have an intro i don't have an intro i never having to drive this problem every time the do i say it will start i didn't see you coming yeah i'm getting a little crunchy around the edges okay everybody this is the february nightclub box so okay okay i'm good i'm good i got this all right no i got this i got this i got this all right hey guys it's march but this is february's box and as you might be able to tell i already opened it and tried everything inside so this time a little bit more of a review than an unboxing but you know we'll make it work uh first thing you might notice first thing i noticed is the new box um you know we've seen them do a pride box uh christmas box this one for february black history month is partnered with the last prisoner project and it's covered with the names of people who are still in prison for non-violent cannabis related offenses which is ridiculous because i can sit here on the internet and actually consume cannabis that i bought legally and some people are still in prison for it so i really appreciate that and if you're interested in that you should go ahead and check it out but i'm just going to be talking about cannabis for the rest of this video so let's get right into it the one thing i didn't try right from the start and i tried right before the video which is currently uh you know kind of doing its thing is this hint of lemon cannabis infused thc powder drink mix by chill with l um as far as i can tell it has no chill um this is fast probably only drank it about half an hour ago and it's good my mood's elevated i'm feeling like something's going on i will say not the most delicious thing i mean i see why they called it a hint of lemon and a lemonade or lemon-based beverage or anything like that because it uh yeah mostly just tasted like lemon thc um but went down easy uh doesn't appear to have any serious amount of sugar two grams um yeah so i'd say if you if you like drinking your cannabis more than eating it and you don't like how long edibles usually take i think about checking this one out that's a hint of lemon by chill so while i'm on the topic of this one i'll talk about the other edible i got last month right here and you can see it's in the nug club colors so it's like a direct nut club collaboration with corolla and this is their cannabis infused 100 milligrams of thc chocolate dipped cookie now that's a lot that's a lot even for me the uh the packaging recommends splitting it in four and i gave it a try that way myself and i can tell you that within two hours heavy heavy effects so despite the fact that it is the ned club branded and just a single package cookie which i thought maybe meant it was like white labeled and not that great it was it was excellent it was really strong and it was a good cookie um these cannabis infused cookies for some reason always come out a little dry in my experience and this one was the same which is probably why they dipped it in chocolate um that gave it a very nice mouth feel compared to just crumbly ready thc um so i'm not sure if this is something that's going to be going on indefinitely if it was a one-time thing or if you can even find this specific cookie not through nudge club but if you have the opportunity to get it as an add-on i'd highly recommend it um i think it's probably a great value uh the only pain in the butt is of course it's 100 milligrams you got to be careful you got to split it up and it's a cookie you can like precisely divide that unless you got out of scale or something so you're going to be rolling the dice a little bit and if you get a little over eager and eat the whole thing you may be in for quite a wild ride so yeah corova nut club cannabis infused chocolate dipped cookie white chocolate by the way that makes a big difference do you okay then the remaining four items are all vapes which i've mentioned before are my absolute favorites so this boxes mix of things i'm a huge fan of i got kind of everything i wanted i got some edibles to try out see some new things and i got more than enough vapes to last me through the entire month of february i actually haven't even opened one of them so we can start there this is california diamond sauce which is as you can see a standard 510 threaded uh vaporizer cartridge with a kind of golden colored concentrate in there it clocks in at 76.9 thc with 83 total cannabinoids and it was packaged july 19th uh so not not too long from there to here um yeah yeah yeah i've gotten both a battery and uh concentrate from california before through node club and i liked both of them i thought they worked great their styles really cute if you see it's it's this very kind of colorful block printed nature inspired kind of deal so i haven't tried this one specifically i have every reason to believe it's going to be excellent um [Music] yeah yeah california sauce the strain was not given i guess it's a diamond sauce is it okay so onto things that i have tried uh this guy we've seen before last month also got a friendly farms uh vaporizer cartridge this month got a different flavor this one is cushman's which is a hybrid and it comes in at 71.4 percent thc packaged back in december 2020 and so again like didn't come straight to me but like still before its expiration date which is december 2022. now the friendly farms cartridge last month i was really prepared to be upset about it and say it didn't work i had issues with it it was trash but i reviewed their cute little literature that they send with every single one of their cartridges and it says in a big bold warning at the bottom that's red and boxed uh using a battery with the wrong voltage can result in an unpleasant cannabis experience and i would characterize my experience with this uh product as unpleasant i had it on this cobra battery which goes from three to four volts and according to this little guy you need to use a battery that is under 3 volts so i overheated it and exactly as they kind of say the oil ended up with a harsh or burnt flavor and i went to the cartridge really fast i actually um ended up seeing the fact that it was getting burnt i didn't realize why uh but if i take here's this month's friendly farms uh there was a clear like color differential showing up around the intakes little dots of like almost black city looking stuff so if you're having problems with a friendly farms cartridge or really any uh cartridge where you're seeing that burning at the bottom and the taste is off it might be the voltage on your battery and it might be a good idea to turn it down uh that said according to these guys the cartridge can even burn itself out and cease to work as well which is not something i knew could happen so learning things all the time um but this month i put it on a smaller battery one that does not get up to four volts and uh had a much better experience with it i'm still not um i'm not super impressed with the amount of vapor it puts out actually obviously it's a lower voltage so it's not going to be the same as some cartridges i can use with the 4 volts but even with that it it's kind of a weak drop but the product is really strong so that's not much of a problem i don't have a big issue like getting the dose i want out of this guy so i guess mixed feelings on friendly farms they're super upfront and they taught me something about how cartridges work but it's also a little unusual that most cartridges i receive will work uh all the way up to four volts and work great all the way up to four volts and this one was on the verge of self-destructing with that same product so if you got a friendly farms one and you have a couple of different batteries i'd recommend rotating through them and making sure you get one that actually matches up with the voltage that it needs all right now vastly less complicated are disposable so you don't have to worry about that because you don't plug it into anything and that's what we got here from leyon an all-in-one vaporizer i actually bought one of these not from nug club years ago to take with me to a music festival and i thought it worked great for that purpose it's [Music] a really cute looking unit in this orange with gold polka dots and it says lean and gold on the side one side has a hole in it the other side has a little led and the flavor was pina daydreams like a pina colada sort of thing and i came through really strong it's been a long time since i've bought a flavored vape or even like received one through node club so that was kind of surprising i've been used to sort of these um like live resin mixes and like pure distillates the diamond sauce uh those come through with kind of a plant material uh sometimes bordering on like chemically dryer sheets vibe this one definitely tasted like like a pina colada like really strongly um like if you vaped off a hit of the flavoring from like a pina colada snow cone but uh what was what made this one different than all the other ones and even some that i've got before it wasn't that strong it's actually only 55 thc but fully 29 cbd so they bill it on here as like a two to one thc to cbd ratio and i really liked that it was a very mellow effect it gave me a lot of the sort of relaxation and body heaviness that you might expect while leaving my head pretty clear to do whatever one to do um so i really liked that it was actually um i've mentioned before i always go for the disposables first when i open the box so this is the first one i went through also just because it was the weakest and i like to like sort of start low and ran my way up to the stronger ones um but i really liked it it was probably probably my favorite new thing i got i would say just cause effects i hadn't seen before and it was fun to have the flavor thing i probably wouldn't choose this particular flavor again it was kind of a lot for me um but i liked it i really liked it i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a all-in-one vape that isn't too heavy and is not going to give you a lot of like paranoia sort of things um came in this really cute metal tin and uh yeah i believe now it says liberate that's not really a flavor but a variety sometimes you get those on pre-rolls and things too yeah leon pina daydream and lastly which wins my award for coolest packaging of the whole box is this also metal really badass looking uh tin from centurion which is you can see their little logo there um now they say aim high it's our way of life so a little hard to take them seriously but assuming it's tongue-in-cheek i kind of like that vibe it's it's goofy um you squeeze the package and this tin slides open and says the clarity you've been looking for and then the cartridge was sitting in there and they've got some nice instructions on how to screw a cartridge onto a battery in case you're very confused and if you remove this uh it says head stash in this little tin so clearly they kind of want you to up cycle it and hold on to this so that's always nice in terms of the product itself what what is this well it's billed as an indica and they did not give a strain but it is fully 90 thc so far and above from a thc standpoint the strongest one we've gotten in quite some time and i would agree with that in terms of my personal subjective experience of this this is a strong this is a doozy this causes the classical cannabis experience you're going to be laughing you're going to be a little sleepy a little sedated moving a little slower so if that is what you're looking for and you want the most rapid and intense way to get there this is this has got to be one of them um i threw it on my cobra extracts battery here and you can see it's a pretty unique cartridge it's clear at the top in the mouthpiece and i've used about three quarters of it but down here at the bottom the liquid itself is borderline just translucent it has maybe like a slight tinge to it but it it it was basically a clear liquid so that's probably due to how purified it was yeah yeah yeah i don't say a lot about the process but you don't get up to 90 thc without pulling a lot of stuff out so this one moving very much uh in a different direction than these like live resins we've seen before that are trying to replicate the exact experience of a specific strain or plant this one just thc and also interestingly enough it was kind of flavored like like a watermelony flavor to it very faint um but definitely not something that felt like it occurred naturally in a cannabis plant i guess like literally this color like it tasted like this weird magenta here um but i liked it i liked it um yeah so awesome package centurion's a brand indica is the variety and it's a one gram vaporizer cartridge so this month i got one two three four vapes and like i said this one was a full gram these two half grams this guy uh 250 milligrams um in the past i've usually gotten about 1.5 grams of vape stuff split across everything so this is actually more than i usually get really showing the value in the box um i pay a little under 130 uh every month for this whole thing and i feel like just getting maybe the centurion this cookie and this diamond sauce at a club would probably cost you about the same amount so i cannot recommend enough the savings let alone the chance to try out some cool weird things um yeah yeah that's the most box thanks for watching use my referral code in the video description or probably i'll throw it on screen somewhere if you'd like to get your own box for 20 off first box only you've got to live in southern california and you've got to be over the age of 18 but beyond that check it out uh all right chill okay well wow it's like a crystal light packet live focus is having some interesting trouble with the glass i'm not gonna lie [Music] it's not uh it's definitely a hint of lemon as it says just lemon flavored weed water but like um like a lemon hit candy lemon not like a real lemon i don't know why i poured so much water said 10 to 12 ounces of liquid and i trusted them based on the size of this [Music] they're just tricking you into being hydrated there's actually no weed but you will feel better oh yeah it's organic grape and fruit sugars citric acid vegetable juice coloring sunflower lectin that's giving me the uh the mitch head break joke i met a wino and he was buying grapes i was like not yet gotta wait man [Music] are you more or less angry now that that was actually silly enough i think i'm less angry we'll check back in in uh 15 to 20 minutes", "k2acjssmPNs": "all right today today we're going to taste test the stizzy cake 31.47 percent thc indoor flower let's roll it up and see what the hype is all about [Music] yo what's up dudes okay all right today we're going to [ __ ] all right today we're going to taste test this dizzy cake this is rocking in at 31.47 percent let's let's check out the nugs huh let's see what's up there youtube we're just taste testing this this cake here so this was packaged february 20th now this is almost hitting over the six-month mark the thing is though they keep their bud fresh inside these jars i highly recommend though putting one of those boveda or integra humidity packs in your jar once you're done opening it up so it can remain fresh for as long as possible the fresher your bud the less likely it's going to be harsh on your throat when you smoke it but let's take let's check out these nugs all right let's do that again [Music] oh man that smells good it was packaged on february 20th i think we're well over the six-month mark but it's gonna be okay because it's still what the [ __ ] just say what you just said all right so i just opened up the jar it still has a nice terpene [ __ ] don't come on what before you do your video i'm already doing it what what's up biscuits or potatoes ah the potatoes are fun yep thanks all right let's do this again all right i just opened the jar took a nice little whiff now the what is this package date february 20th damn that's like almost six months the bud still looks fresh though i definitely after i open this i'm gonna have to put a boveda or integra humidity pack in here to keep it fresh because we all know if the bud is really dry it's gonna be harsh on your throat and it's gonna burn that was are you shitty in the morning all right [ __ ] it just let's go at it the world's not going to stop for us all right so i just opened up the stizzy cake took a whiff and it smells danky this was packing [ __ ] all right i just opened the jar of this dizzy cake it smells danky it was packaged in favor oh that smells good i just opened it i need to be in like a soundproof [ __ ] studio or some [ __ ] huh everybody and their mom is is out today um all right let's just [ __ ] do it it's not gonna stop all right i just opened up this dizzy cake it was packaged february 20th but that's okay it still looks fresh and we all know the older the bud the less fresh it's gonna be and the more harsh it's gonna be on your throat so let's bust out a nug and let's smoke it i hated that one that's horrible all right um we just opened up this dizzy cake it was packaged in february [ __ ] you car all right we just opened up this dizzy cake 31.42 thc it was packaged back in february a little over six months but it definitely looks fresh i recommend since i open this and if you guys open your jar to put a bovita or integra humidity pack in there to keep it fresh a little bit longer because we all know the drier the bud the harsher it's going to be on your throat there we go that was the one alright you can see you know [ __ ] this you can't really even see anything [Music] mm-hmm [Applause] remember stizzy grinder oh sorry sorry i know so hey matt hey how are you good how are you doing good hanging in there how's milo doing since the uh dude okay i have to carry you up and downstairs though to have a walk but he's doing better today is he still i mean the same milo you don't see okay my friend said is he the same one well first of all i just he was barking at some male dogs testosterone isn't gone yet i remember i don't like that dog i was like well oh what's up dude oh he's gonna be great see you later yes he will all right so we rolled up a joint of the cake from sizzy they started off as a oil company they only made cartridges pods you know the vapes but then they stepped it up and they started putting flour and some jars let's give her a try uh so it has the white ash the white ash white ash is symbolic for a couple reasons the main one they flushed it properly they got all whatever nutrients they were adding to make this flower taste even more robust than it naturally could they made sure to flush out all those salts and all that excess [ __ ] that you don't want to be smoking on that's why the white ash you can see it just like that if your joints do not have that white ash there could be some other stuff in that grass but anyway or it just won't taste that good this tastes really good hence because they flushed it properly and they knew what they were doing major props dizzy i give you five pot leafs out of five pot leaves wow let's do this again what's up youtube so this is a dji osmo pocket they work great they're 4k they're on a little mini gimbal and it helps you if you want to just film videos on the go and you want to have some high quality videos i definitely recommend getting one of these these will these things a couple years ago were about i think 300 400 bucks but now they could be a lot cheaper but if if you make videos at home if you if you design shirts if you just whatever this little camera right here is highly recommend it highly recommend it dji osmo uh what's up efrain i was just doing a uh since we opened this up last night i i was doing a a product review of the stizzy cake for the baked flowers uh youtube and baked flowers instagram but i wanted to come live so you guys could see the the you know see me [ __ ] up a bunch of times trying to to do the review um i hope your day's going good buddy i really need to try those raw garden carts i really need to try some raw garden um oils um you know what i don't know why raw raw garden needs to get you a sponsorship we need to figure out we need to figure out how to get efferent a sponsorship from raw garden i'll tell you what you know what you should do efren i'm not even kidding you should do some videos of of opening up the raw garden packaging or or taking a dab of the raw garden or taking some photo like and and just you hit them up on instagram or [ __ ] it send me the photos and stuff and and i'll i'll say hey we have well i need to get the product first or that doesn't work hey we have a customer that really loves your product he does all this stuff you know hook them up um all i'm saying is companies that have brands and products wish that they had dedicated people such as yourself that that stand behind the product and um because you keep going back to them why because you like it you keep going back to raw garden because the quality is consistent and you like it so um same reason why i go to stizzy i'm consistent i like it they supported my business since the beginning and these guys actually are ones that come from the street and you gotta back and get behind that why wouldn't you but but yeah dude efren i hope you have a good day buddy hope you enjoy yourself i'm still wearing this shirt from yesterday uh we'll have more soon oh you know what i think the reason i'm i'm not that's something you can you can break out of you know you just have to number one just be yourself and not care if well maybe being shy is you so just don't care what people um it's actually easy for me to say because i've been doing video stuff since high school so it's real easy for me to just be like dude just get in front of the camera but it's it's not that easy for for everybody especially because you know just thinking about how many other people could maybe watch this and they're watching your face they could um you know if you worry about what other people think too much you just get all worried about man i don't want to make a video because people might say something so anyway well you're gonna get on camera when when i come link up with you and we dab some raw gardens together uh that's when uh you're gonna jump on camera video matt here i'm hanging out with efren we're taking two dabs of raw garden and we're going to the moon so all right i'm going to hold you to that dude in 2021 or if this covet is over before that i'm coming to find you and we're gonna dab to the moon raw garden style sponsored by big flowers and raw gardens i don't know where you guys are at but it's starting to heat up out here have a great day dude", "vsvY-GLdYQ8": "good evening YouTube this is Callie grower and we're going into coming up into the seventh week of flower so we're getting down to the very in here and everything's doing pretty good so everything is getting really right all the leaves are starting to die off which is completely normal a lot of purpling that's not just the light it's actually purpling I've been keeping my temperatures down this time I'm not sure if that's the reason why these are going purple probably [Applause] but the reason that I decreased my temperature this time is because my last time it was a little bit hairy and I kind of wanted to get a little more density to the buds and yeah that's working this is coming into week seven now so we still got two more weeks I'm not quite sure I think maybe only a week but you know the way that the hairs are all turning red and the trichomes are a little cloudy with just only speckling of amber right now so maybe two weeks but we'll see they seem to be ripening up really quick here's the other tent we can get it closed up there with some close-ups [Music] how do you like my tape my tape job here but with the weird thing about that is if you notice on the branches that that I bent over the buds I mean and they just get bad on those it's like it it likes it like see that it's another one that's bent and all the buds on it are pretty thick nice so those are those two are gelato and these front ones here are the cookies the back ones the DOE sees how much leaf is starting to die off on that yeah I got a sloppy grow this time everything's just falling over I mean trying to yo-yo him up here and there but I don't know it hasn't really bothered him I haven't completely laid down and they're still getting a lot of light on him so they're doing good they're getting fatter actually the ones that are laying down like that let's go back over here to the front one here event emoji beautiful not a big big bud producer but stanky is hell oh my god it stinks and then the middle one we're going over to here is the Nepali pink that's the Nepali pink and then the back one is the sunshine server right there's actually resting on the bottom and then these two three the middle one is gelato this line is gelato [Music] [Applause] so I have not been giving them any more nutrients I'll take that back a lie I did do this for the last two weeks just overdrive and then a couple of the week before overdrive and our overdrive in my a and B from advanced nutrients that's kind of just helps it ripen at the end helps to produce more try cons there's like these bad boys I don't know if you can see that but the leads on this thing or look like they have a fur coat there's so many try cons on it [Music] I wish I was able to show you through the magnifying I mean every little square inch of this [ __ ] has just powdered out [Music] but the nugs are very small on that plan these ones here these three here came into the tent late so these definitely got two weeks left on them maybe three maybe that's why they're still a little small on the bud size on some of these they're not bad look at this one look so heavy eight won't hold itself up pretty good size buddy nice whoo man you just touch these things and so stinky all right guys so I'm gonna try to keep it short there we go end of week six going into week seven and my second grow there it is all right till next weekend thank you

with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "-x3UYdAmjos": "[Music] what's up everybody thanks for stopping by weeds reviews and checking out another one of my videos today some more products from a platinum vape new strands that come out that i was slacking on getting but i have gotten and i'm here to review for you guys today i'm gonna look at a sativa and an indica the sativa we'll be taking a look at is apple fritter and the endicott we'll be looking at is motor city kush motor city kush indica apple fritter sativa which one should we do first blindfold motor city cushion is one gram indica testing at 76.86 lab test 835. now this is indica so look for a relaxed kind of hungry euphoric thing out of this one at least that's what it says on the packaging again i will say everybody's body's different right elon some of it isn't healed some of us don't that being said screw this bad boy in let's get a taste of it that bubba um uh detroit was it bubba something about detroit bubba that i reviewed last time that was a really good cartridge from an indica strand um i'm hoping this lives up to what detroit bubble was motor city kush let's see boys girls yeah we have girls on this channel now hey how you guys doing for a while there's just us boys all right this cartridge is nice too cool this one has its own taste not really peppery like i was thinking we were going to see a lot of pepper from platinum vape now like it was going to be like their signature taste not the case this one here not peppery whatsoever real sweet decently real sweet diesel earthy taste no pepper whatsoever smooth nice tasting cartridge tell you what platinum knocking out of the out of the park at least with their indicas a couple of their hybrids nah i don't know yet like there was khalifa or that was cleveland khalifa kush with khalifa there was khalifa no they're uh khalifa kush it wasn't that great i was kind of let down with that one it was okay it was still like a three it wasn't like like hitting like a presto or uh you know like being like a a mittens extract it wasn't nothing that terrible but it was nothing great either like what you expect from planet vape like you expect kind of a quality cartridge quality cartridge sorry package quality cartridge every time from platinum vape because that's just what we're used to we're just using quality from planet vape when we're using instructions coming out kind of being shocked at how good they are because it seems like they're put way more and more into this they're coming out with new strands all the time now which that was something i had complained about with platinum how cool quality of the product was and how i would just wish more with strands would readily be coming out and that's something that they seem to be doing which other companies aren't you see mkx they're not keeping up with platinum vape platinum vape is blowing them out of the water right now because these new strands keep coming out all the time and they keep doing a good job with the ones that come out but every now and then out of the couple that they let out there's a few disappointments and that was one of mine so far motor city cush though definitely a five-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it up our sorry definitely four-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it a five yet because there's just so many of these other products that i still have to test i don't wanna make that make it so high that i have to keep giving out fives whenever you know there might be some fours and then one will be incredible to where it'll be at five but so far just a four nothing blowing your socks off but a really great cartridge again this was motor city cush indica one grand by platinum vape also i want to touch base on something you guys platinum vape's got a thing going on right now for the golden ticket when you buy a cartridge you get a golden ticket you win their little um sweepstakes that they got going on right now so they got a golden ticket sweepstakes going on right now we've opened three so far we haven't gotten it um i'm sure it's not gonna be too easy to get but it is a thing going on so when you open your cartridge look for your golden ticket willy wonka you want your golden ticket because that would be your golden chance to make your way because with the golden ticket it's a golden day you know come on people it's how it's gonna be so apple fritter sativa you guys all know you're on the channel you watch me if you can watch the channel i'm not a big sativa guy i test the sativas i do occasionally like to have steep around i have two up there so you know i open this one they're probably all going to fall nope i opened this about a month ago you can see i just really don't hit them that much i really don't his teeth that much um just because it's really not my thing and i'm more of an indica guy or a hybrid guy i'm really more of indica person myself if i'm going to buy a cartridge not just to review just a smoke i'm going to pick it in to come most of the time but this apple fritter was last tested 12 22 of 21 comes in at 70 76.6 we'll get off and take a look into it i had never known this around i actually went to a dispenser i never go to i've never really been to i think i've been to it maybe once in two years i went to it last weekend just stopping by coming back from my sister's place because it was actually close to there and it was a sunday and all the other ones were closing so i figured i'd stop by this one because it was on my way home it was close i could get there in the time allowed it and they happened to have this so i just grabbed it i seen it i was like um i've never seen it anywhere i'm gonna grab it so if you guys have seen this you already had it let me know in the comments what you think if you think the same thing if you haven't had it well we'll see what it's like together right away and outside of the cartridge is really sticky feels like maybe bad pour and maybe they clean it up as good as they should have but yeah the whole outside of this one's really sticky so this is the apple fritter sativa by platinum vape like like i said again 76.66 coming in lab tested 12 22. now this says it's supposed to have a real that's why you never go by what it says in the backbone i'm telling you you can't ever go by what it says this one says here it says earthy apple and sweet okay now i'm gonna tell you what it tastes like there's no earthy there's no apple there's no sweet it's a real chemically gassy off-tasting smell our taste and smell that comes off it not pleasant not whatsoever oh this cartridge is bad guys i mean i'm not putting on either i would give it a two and that might be pushing it i don't think i can even smoke this car the rest of this cartridge the reason being it's real chemically tasty it tastes like i'm smoking uh one of those trees for your car the air freshener trees that's what it tastes like i'm inhaling really bad cartridge i don't enjoy this at all elon even if he handled he wouldn't enjoy it yeah if you guys bought this dude if you agree with me let me know in the comments if you haven't bought it you probably want to think of it twice before doing so there's no apple to it there's no fritter to it there's nothing sweet there's nothing that tastes good about this cartridge and now like i said i'm not just putting on i'm not making it up if it was good i would say it was good i'm not just saying it because it's a tiva and i don't really like sativas because i there's a lot of stevia i did enjoy um this one here is just not there especially after tasting like trying like the new um detroit um kush and all those other ones and this it's just this just does fails in comparisons big time big time big time that's the apple fritter by planet vape i don't know if i would erect i can't recommend this car whatsoever i wouldn't say waste your money on this maybe if you're picking up four or four hundred you just want to try it or you haven't tried it you said [ __ ] it i don't care what this guy thinks i want to try anything for myself go ahead and do it but let me know in the comments what you think if you agree with me if i'm crazy but this cartridge here real chemically real are it just doesn't taste good at all it doesn't yeah i mean i can get a sense of what they're trying to do with the apple the other tastes there like this it just doesn't balance out well and it ends up tasting chemically yeah it doesn't balance out you can pick up the apple in there and what they're trying to do but it's just too artificial and it becomes chemically balanced tasting it doesn't it's bad it's not a great cartridge guys so that being said if you haven't subscribed guys i really appreciate you subscribing it would mean the world to me and if you haven't or if you have thank you so

"upuSg_qn6NA": "good afternoon youtubers so we are going into week five of flower right now and just doing a quick update add a little bit of problems with these girls here they started getting a little too top-heavy and started falling over and in the beginning I I did start to train them and and bend them over and keep them in an even canopy I think what happened is I took a little too much time to flip him into flower because I was too busy so we got too tall and I didn't put a second row of frog net up which I should have kind of got a little lazy on this grow just because I've been so busy lately with work and everything and thank you everybody for the advice on you know bending them over and doing the see agreeing and frogging them properly I will attempt to do better next time I actually kind of like using the the racks like the old tomato plant racks here it just seemed to you know be less congested and you can pull the plants out and you know you can do all your cleanup and put them back and you know you get a problem in the back of your tents you're able to pull them out and get to it unlike when you're doing the the scrog enough you're very limited on where you can reach and get back to them and you start having any kinds of problems and it's you're kind of stuck with with the net and can't just pull it out and get to your plants or pull them out or separate one that's having you know some really bad deficiencies or bugs or something which you know if you're here and you got one plant that's unhealthy or you know it's just starting to attract bugs or something you can pull it out and treat it you know and then it wouldn't affect the rest of the plants so I kind of like that versus you know doing this here also I want to appreciate and thank everybody that that responded to my questions about the four lights inside here being out to come find out those were infrared lights and now that you guys mentioned it I can see a little slight bit of light up in there which is you know like you said very very untransparent to the human eye but that makes a lot of sense and again thank you everybody that answered that question I appreciate that so all right let's get some close-ups here the buds you know so this is week five coming into week five and they're filling in pretty nice you know I had a problem with this one here this this particular tent like I said when I woke up and went to open up the tent there everything in there was just completely falling over like like it was like they increased bud size overnight and the limbs just couldn't handle the weight so it was a mess like every single one of these branches were laying down on top of the strog I had to pull the straw had to unwrap each branch from each other ended up breaking a couple of branches on accident which sucks because you lose you lose a little out of your harvest and then gave them a good watering you know to make sure that they just weren't limping over because of water but they're standing back up again and back in full force and again that's another problem with the scrog is you know you kind of you're limited to what you can do if you make a mistake and not do your second row of Skagen you're kind of left on that so what are you gonna do come back in and do another layer right now and try to bend these over kind a little late in the game now I should have thought of that fire but anyways here's where we're at so coming into week five other things looking pretty good starting to see the leaves turning yellow and giving you an indication that that they're getting close to their end and some of the hairs are starting to turn orange not really seeing the the bulkiness that I wanted to see not really compared to you know when I did the Evan flow system the buds were a lot more bulky of course I'm just starting out with cocoa so I'm getting familiar with cocoa and how to you know how to water that I'm from probably not doing it 100% correct well you know we're getting some pretty good results not too bad of course everybody wants to see the bigger fatter buds I mean that's what it's all about right big fat buds so these here are all the cookies the dough sees and the candy land to be honest I really can't tell the difference between them I guess that'll come with experience they all kind of look like the same thing to me I guess there's little tiny indications of differences here but looks like this is how it looks like the same plant to me but as you can tell we've got gelato cookies and candy land in here you got the dough see does in the back so you tell me if you could tell the difference I don't know I can't although you can tell the difference in these ones I think the problem with these these are Josie's problems with these ones here was I started him out in a lot smaller pot compared to the rest of these and I think they just ended up getting really root bound so it stunted their growth and they were way small way smaller than this before I put them into flour and they have different from all the rest of them the hairs I don't know if you could see it but the hair is on these are like really green and like almost rubbery looking kind of weird I mean I haven't seen hairs like that on the buds before not like you know I don't like these where you could see their white you know we're just really strange I don't know maybe somebody can tell me what causes that because those are doe sees and then you go back here and these back one's I said Oh", "3VjXJobmnA4": "hey what's up everyone I just got back from my leg I just got my hair down by the way I'm have short hair now oh hello and I just got back from a trip to Long Beach and you know I had to stop in LA at jungle boys so here we have today an ounce of jungle boys I'm going home all right so first I think I'm going to show you guys these jars aren't on the hoist but I bought them at jungle boys but they sell other weed of other brands apparently but these are two strains that I really liked how they looked in the case so I got ice cream cake from ember Valley this ember valley brand if anyone's had these before they saw these that cookies - I'll enter a video of all these weeds hey it's me Lauren Taylor I know it's kind of repetitive putting the shots of the ice cream cake in this video also but you guys wanted to see the weed in the hall so here you guys go these are pretty dang gasps looking nog so don't you think and this other one I got is watermelon gelato this one looked and sounded it's super fire and let that [ __ ] nug in there like I'll show you the video but look at that that's a fire you know badass my bow huh the nothing on this is fire and fat so I really [ __ ] with this one watermelon gelato just like I've imagined that like just I had to get that [ __ ] like I should just sound so amazing all right now let's get into the actual boys just start off with the first thing I sneak Space Age cake this was their new drop that they had in the display case they had like nine of these and I don't know I picked number six I guess that looked the best biggest next most fire as you can see and will facing Cushman's this one's dangerous [ __ ] I didn't talks I think I like their new drop like like this was like in a whole case like by itself like so like space-age cake like we just thought of is like come by it there's nine options okay I'm half jungle voice but yeah space-age good I got a quarter of it and I had never done this before but I realized getting a quarter would give you bigger nose I really got and I like the size of this package y'all wait this is besides my hand so you the other quarter they got it is hot case I have been willing to try this string for so long this is strawberry shortcake and wedding cake you know I love my strawberry shortcake yeah this one that's beautiful it's all beautiful beautiful dank [ __ ] but really I wanted to try this hot cakes for so [ __ ] long and I love this [ __ ] what even is that Joe yeah I know all right this one's also really good at this is LA cush cake iconic jungleboy strain right here I like hush cake number four the genetics are Cushman's and wedding cake I'll say yeah this is [ __ ] beautiful it tastes minty cakey like just [ __ ] like what our unique flavor and like let me tell you I was [ __ ] smoking this on my way to go get some lunch and then I come back in my car with the lunch all this jungleboy smoke is like billowing out of the car and I heard these guys like saying [ __ ] like oh that give me a high like from a block away like they're saying you feel like that like think it's like and I smelt it like cuz you only smell it when you're like smoking it cuz you just don't smell it that much until you come back in the car and all the smokes like blowing out and it like hits you and you're like like you this train is fire for show definitely one you've got to try like yeah I was skeptical on this cuz I don't really like push strings per se I'm just anything Kush like um not really the biggest fan but this isn't like it's Cushman's for like Cushman's is like in like a law there are other strains too so I don't know it's really good at like it's like really minty but like not like much like oh no it's super unique this got like twenty nine percent total THC this is fire I also saw a review of this on YouTube which made me want to get it and it was like oh forty percent like well mine's not forty percent and I was kind of saying cuz I saw the review it's like Le cush cake like forty percent and then I got this and I'm like okay this one's really high but it's not forty and then yeah but there are different batches so this is number four I guess I don't know which one was forty percent probably number one that I don't know I don't [ __ ] know alright this train is also really [ __ ] fire and I really like it this is jungle mint this is super unique I've never had any wheat that tasted anything like this like it shouldn't really go crazy like it really does this is jungle cake and la Kush cake I'm telling you right now you want to try this like if you just like good weed like I don't know I probably want to get this if you aren't into minty things obviously but spring minty but it has like this jungle cake like flavor it's so interesting and it's really wrong y'all this really the one like the smell like the flavor it's so unique like this is when I come get jungle boys for like this unique s melon flavor it smells literally I hone you know what just way your imagine jungle mint they should some straight cast though I really like this one yeah I really like this one jungle winds let me take a picture with all my Z alright so I got an on-site jungle boys all together all this weed is an ounce and I paid three hundred and eighty eight dollars that's how much is sometimes people ask me like how much is it that's how much it was three hundred and eighty eight dollars for an ounce including text so yeah pretty good deal considering I spent about 550 for an ounce like cookies and naming it all top shelf I got like one I was like $30 and it was actually this brand I got it and it was like whether discount aints and like I really like it was like just okay but like I wasn't that big of a fan of this brand because I got $30 it's from cookies it was like just okay so when the girl that jungle boy is brings out these eights and these packages I'm like what is like did I get that like what is I don't like that one like what is that and she's like it's a watermelon gelato in the ice cream cake I'm like okay those look fire and the we thing on here was really fire so this that's cool too this this one with the real baby it's right here all right you guys thank you so much for watching my jungle boys haul I will be doing and smoke with me on all these weeds so don't worry about it you'll be getting a full in depth review smoke with me from me on all this jungle boys so subscribe if you wanted to like for more videos like for more smoke with music for more jungle boys hauls like if you like me and subscribe please with that being said love you guys thank you so much for watching and I will talk to you in the next video bye", "ZS6N6LJmUmA": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another constant rate review we're actually taking a look at some more rosin from 7-10 labs today we really enjoyed that GMO we checked out last week we figured [ __ ] let's do another one we've actually got the Layla number six right here yeah that's right this is the lair of number six and it does not have gelato in it guys it's got via Sheila and the Sputnik two strains I have never heard of like Dan said finally some not gelato for once this but Nick is a [ __ ] I looked it up a little while ago I forget road down Apollo 13 and Black Russian cross so the Leila overall is definitely gonna be indica dominant I guess but you know pretty much a hybrid I'm going on a dad here right away yes so I've got this a few times honestly I'm not gonna lie there are some videos where I do take the first step on camera with you guys this stuff I couldn't resist after I tried the GMO I had to try the Lela and I gotta say this stuff packs a punch as well but the flavor is not quite as crazy as as the GMO I mean that's just I feel like that's just because of the terpene profile on the flower the starting material itself that being said this stuff does pack a punch although smooth it's very smooth and I think it's honestly stronger than the GMO effect wise so I'm gonna confirm that right here with some more come on say right now this is some of this new add as smooth as any rosin or almost any extract I've ever smoked yeah yeah let me get let me actually get my key pre-heat that last little ooh good that shows me that it's good this isn't necessarily my typical turf but it is interesting yeah so I need to do a little more analysis on this stuff right here but as you look at it it's meaty right yeah I don't know sorry I froze up it's very very you know they buttered up overnight on us just like the other stuff so the consistency is different than at what I'm looking at right now is different than what I was looking down a few nights ago this one I had already started to butter up a little bit in the corner whereas the other one was still completely translucent you know yeah but you know it still looks amazing the color on all of 7/10 stuff lately has just been amazing super blonde super by almost whitish it's the best part about them doing everything under one roof taking the plants from start to finish all the way through is they can kind of grow strains for like you know set this part of the room up you know with screens that you lift that you love running for Ross and then run them amount of time that you like running forward rosin get the resin itself exactly the way you want it okay now this part of the room we're gonna run these trains for live resin and sauce in this type of [ __ ] okay now we're gonna run these for full mouth we're gonna do rosin from these mint it's just it's pretty dope what they're doing over there being able to do everything kind of under one roof yeah you know full vertical vertical integration over there and just I feel like we've said it before but I'll say it again seven to ten laps right now in California is kind of a model for what where everybody's trying to do I mean yeah they're killing it says right on their packaging that's produced out of Oakland I believe they grow in Oakland as well up I believe they just have a facility there that's all in one pretty much grow and extraction and they do everything there from you know their BHO to their cultivation to the rosin and you know shout out man like like you guys I think know that you know we always give credit where credit is due even though it's friendly competition it's that's all it is is friendly competition and shout out to them yeah yeah I mean it's tough enough to just do one thing right just to kill it with a flower line right just to kill it with a concentrate line just one type of concentrate they're really firing well with every single thing that they dabble their hands into I've been nothing but impressed with all their product that I've tried like we said from the flower to you know that concentrates everything else yeah you know the everything looks clean as far as the packaging the presentation when you talk about prices when you when you talk about you know the top quality type stuff it's always going to be higher prices but when I talk about prices I think more in terms of like the competition like if they if you sell an $80 gram how good is that a dollar gram compared to the other 80 grams on shelves at different shops you know in the same market and I feel like with 7:10 the quality is always just as good if not a little bit better than the competition at pretty much whatever price point you're shopping out in a hole that you score Oh gotcha I had no idea what he was just talking about coming a lot a great point great point sir oh she just blasted right here on the inside packaging says quality drives every decision we make garden to the lab to the jar that holds your stash happiness you flip open the other one it says oh geez make better oh gee oh man whatever this is I don't know what the two strengths in going in are but like you said it's very mean teens it's almost got a cush after tasting going on which I love it's very floral right very floral like I get the mint floral kind of maybe like like woody notes or something when I when I smell this mm-hmm but when I when I smoke it the flavor that I'm getting was super heavy on the minty cool yeah so this is gonna be hard to judge from the honesty 9 cos you know we say we say that we smoke for flavor which we do but sometimes I do smoke for that punch to the face and I'm not gonna lie I came into this video I offer dad with his stuff and I'm a little off I feel like and this stuff just makes me feel whoa and you know a little goofy trying to pick my words right here okay I do a little bit more research just it makes me really goofy and laughy it gives you that laffy high so I love this so what I was getting at is like we gave the other stuff of ten the GMO and this stuff doesn't quite taste as good but in my opinion it packs a much heavier punch so I mean it doesn't taste as good but it gets what question would you say that taste is the toughest one to rate accurate or to give a rating that you feel confident be confident in because there's more personal preference involved in that than maybe some of the other ones at least that's how I feel when I talk about how something tastes I'm well aware that there's certain flavor profiles that I just gravitate towards naturally like over and over through years of smoking weed like I really like meat it like this I really don't tend to like stuff like this but I know a lot of other people I dish it right so how do I go about rating the flavor sometimes you know well yeah and everybody I believe has a different like palette and different taste buds right I'm not much of a genealogist or wherever you call it but yeah I'm more of a gentleman than scholar oh yeah exactly I got some type of degree but anyways my point being is I'm gonna get into rating this stuff because I feel I got dab did enough he's gonna do some more analysis over there I'm gonna give this stuff a 9.5 and that's really hard for me to do because it's got me really high I'm like kind of sweaty around the eyes a little bit on the nose but it's 9.5 because I smoked for flavor and I thought about that overnight and what my consensus was gonna be what my conclusion be and that's the one I came to so that's why I'm I'm edging the GMO over this but this definitely does if you're looking for that kick to the forehead I believe this one gives you more of that in the GMO but for that news that I'm giving it a 9.5 because it doesn't have the flavor that the GMO has yeah I'm high as a kite I'm ready get out of here honestly so I hope he's ready I hope his analysis is complete and I hope he has their complete II know what what processing processing oh it's it's what is it car buffering he's buffering buffering 9.41 - Oh a nine point four one two coming in with a nine point four one - Wow very smooth very heavy loving the buzz on this one while flavor I can't give a ten I don't know if it's personal preference I don't know about packs when you break it all down nine point four one two don't sit I'm like that's going for digit soon I think that's down to the thousand good either man hundred about there's some crazy equations and can different types of math concepts and calculations I had to draw forward to come up with that but I'm confident in it 99.5 use 9.5 that's sorry I rosin mm-hmm ash 710 Shane Danny all right Celie later subscribe yeah hit the buttons do all that do that stuff yep and then or a bang hua hit you in the chest like Stockton wheat - Wow homie I'm here I'm talking triple splash like my name klay Thompson get up on the mic and I'm Charles Bronson on the blacktop playing the whips called a matchbox ragtop rolling with the gas in the stash spot real one since I came up at the sandbox no gang got the game on pad", "P2cqM2eB9yI": "hey Danvers and Avenue of me mr deburr on another before you dab today we have a

minigames as well as my Instagram you'll find the links of those down below thanks again everyone and hope to see you next time peace out", "_lhXWfNIXyk": "look nothing like these ones here probably has something to do with going out of focus there probably has something to do with the way that they're a lot shorter away from the light maybe they're just not getting bleached from the light like these ones here kind of getting a little bleached out being a little too close to the light but there's still grown good got a couple more weeks three weeks left on these and then you know these are my babies here these three right here in a row are the dark heart nursery premium clones that I got and that's the Napali pink for the event emoji and the sunshine sherbert man this a Nepali pink ooh man if you could be standing here right now and smell this thing now these three were brought in I want to say like a couple weeks after I started all the rest of these cookies and gelatos and everything and they caught up really fast and trying to keep these things cleaned up so that they get light through the canopy is damn near impossible I mean these things got such massive growth like vegetative grew up I mean look at that it's just enough I've cleaned these things up probably three different times just to try to you know make sure that the air gets through the canopy good make sure that the light gets through and it seems like you know a few days later a week later they're just full again but that could just be a good indication of an excellent strain of cannabis you know these guys are well known for really picking the some of the best cannabis and making sure that they're putting out the highest quality and it shows I mean I've had no deficiencies with these plants had no bugs with these plants no mold no nothing their colors have been fantastic all the way through to grow unlike the cookies and the gelatos and all that I've you know I've had to fight the deficiencies and the calcium problems and you know just trying to make sure that they they stay healthy and bug free which didn't happen unfortunately I had to fight off some some might surly in the grow right before I flipped over into flour some spider mites that was over in this tent here one of the plants were kind of deficient and it wasn't a matter of fact it was the it was the gelato this bad boy here this particular plant had a hard time in the very beginning and she caught up towards the end here but her deficiencies ended up attracting spider mites so luckily I got that under control before we flipped over into flower and it's resolved now no spider mites no other bugs no mold so but like I was saying with these three dark heart nursery ones the venom OG sunshine and nepali pink I just when they say the key to growing good cannabis is having a top-notch strain that comes from a reputable company no doubt I mean it's like night and day growing these things I've had no problems with these things and they just they smell so wonderful every single one of them you just rub that little branch right there and smell that so strong and every time I go to foliate these and take these big leaves out my hands just get so sticky it's unbelievable how sticky this plan is but I can't wait for the end results on this these three right here I know for sure are probably gonna go you know a couple more weeks over all the rest of these because they did come in late and looking under under the scope you know we're still clear through all the trichomes are just absolutely clear no no cloudiness or amber colors at all these ones here are a mix of cloudy clear and just just very speckled ambered so they're a little bit off still but you can tell they're way ahead of the rest of these these girls here from dark heart so anyways there we go we're getting we're getting there we're getting all thickened up getting the nice little fat buds starting to come in a little bit more keeping my temperatures this time way down I think the last time I made a mistake with running too high of temperatures on the in the canopy like I was at a good 80 something all the time and this time I've really focused on keeping them temperatures and humidity way down like I like to keep my temperatures down below 70 and my humidity down you know 50 45 as much as low as I can get I haven't been able to get the humidity down to 45 I just just open these up and turn the AC on so it's still a little bit warm in here right now give it about 20 minutes and this will be back down to 70 71 in 68 which I've noticed that I'm getting a lot more denser buds than I did last time last time with the LA cush cake that came out kind of I mean they came out good-sized buds but they were Airy a little fluffy and they really didn't have the strong aroma the gas that they really needed I wasn't super impressed with I mean the look of the bud from my first grow was fantastic I mean it looked like some top nuts but really crystally hairy but as far as the density and the aroma this wasn't there a little fluffy and just this wasn't very gassy at all you know and everybody here in Cali we love we love our you know we're connoisseurs we love the taste we love the smell and we love the look and if it doesn't have all three we'll pass it up even if it's really really good but and you just get you high as [ __ ] we'll pass it up just for the fact that it doesn't have that nose and doesn't have that flavor so keep that in mind out there if you're growing and you're new like me Cali people love their kind of swords of their but they love that top-notch smelly tasty yummy stuff so okay well we're into week five countdown to the", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to

a dollop you should dab or how much chatter you should share off remains an ongoing issue and will be the stoner whose jar of bubble hash opens in their bag or whose vape oil canister breaks in their pocket luckily Portland's Iowa vapor has devised a really clever solution NAB taps each of these little ceramic pellets is infused with 50 milligrams of cannabis concentrate they won't break leak sweat or spill their THC rich contents and they're extremely easy to use simply drop a tab onto your dab Briggs nail or set it in the heating crucible of your preferred vaporizer and heat it up as until it warms the concentrate trapped inside will slowly boil off for you to inhale and since each tab contains five standard doses you'll have enough for a full session in each if not just add another tab plus while the pellets released their THC cargo they visibly char and pit making it easy to judge how many draws you have left before they're fully spent the real genius of DAB cabs is their portability and versatility they're functionally inert until you heat them up so there is effectively zero risk of them spilling or leaking what's more they can be used in any vaporizer that accepts loose-leaf or wax based concentrates during my testing the tabs work smoothly with the puff coke peak the Storz and Bickel mighty the PAX 3 and the vape exhale cloud Evo heck you can even put it in your pipe and smoke it if you're off in mind I especially appreciated that I could start and stop sessions at will without repercussion with conventional rigs if you inadvertently use more oil than you meant to or have a bigger hunk of hash than you can handle your stock muscling through the bowl until it's either cashed or you're left to stone a useless heap on the couch both dab tabs which can be subjected to repeated heating and cooling cycles without any noticeable change of taste in the vapor you can set the pipe down and back up off it at your convenience this combined with the tabs set 50-milligram can ability all contents makes monitoring and managing your dosage a far more simple affair than with existing concentrates the rule of what you scrape is what you vape thankfully no longer apply though they're quite handy dab tabs are not perfect for one you're gonna have a heck of a time trying to find them before next February ILO is partnering with local concentrate suppliers and it's soft launched at select dispensaries throughout Oregon they hope to expand distribution to California Nevada and Maryland early next year what's more since the infusion process requires extra labor and materials expect to pay a premium on top of what you normally would for that gram of hash still you can't put a price on convenience and boy are these ever convenient [Music]", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "qfXbm3Z9Nys": "hey guys logan here from o2 vape and today we're going to show you how to charge your battery now I know this sounds simple but there is a wrong way to do it so what I'm going to show you is the right way in the wrong way to charge your battery so first thing we're gonna show you a couple wrong ways to charge your battery so what I have here is a buttonless OH to vape battery and a three point seven volt charger what we don't recommend doing is screwing the battery on to the charger first what you can do is you can tighten the battery too tight which in turn pushes the connection plate down and you don't get a good connection with your cartridge therefore making for a bad experience if you get experience at all the other thing that we don't recommend doing is using a fast charger or a rapid charger indicated by the lightening bolt or tablet chargers as these put out too much power and can fry your battery the correct way to charge your battery is to use a laptop or a standard 5 volt black charger that you plug into the wall and what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to plug in your USB charger first green light comes on and then you're simply going to screw the battery on after what this allows you to do is see the light turn red right when you get a connection so as you see it didn't take much to tighten it on there and we can even tighten it a little more but we have a good secure connection we know it's not going to damage the connection plate and we know it's gonna be ready to go when it's finished so thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "AD3QNMgqgkU": "[Music] first step is to weigh out 3.5 grams of our cannabis flour so you want to break up the cannabis to allow a lot of surface area exposure because otherwise you may not get a full extraction add the cannabis to the canning jar and 1/2 cup of coconut oil now we seal the canning jar very tightly add the canning jar to the boiling water for about 2 hours we're gonna pour this through cheesecloth placed over a metal strainer gather up the cheesecloth and squeeze all the remaining liquid out add the 1 ounce of coconut oil to the 11 ounces of honey add the blended coconut oil and honey mixture to a blender now we pour the blended medicated honey mixture into the empty honey jar just put the cap on the bear and you have some delicious medicated honey", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

we're back for another concentrate review this time I know a lot of you guys have been requesting that we take some more dabs on the show how we've been sticking to the weed reviews heavily but we definitely like to get our dab on every now and then we'd have all day whatever on the clock if you remember f9k dabs all day in the bay and he doesn't smoke a too often anyway we are yeah a nice batch of some rosin here this is a collaboration between alien labs and field I don't know if we reviewed field before on the show but I know we've smoked them a couple of times more recently I don't know if I've tried the rosin yet but I've tried some of their sauce and was pretty impressed I think this is the first rosin collab that alien labs has done with any other flower like on the legal market yeah so I don't know I don't think I've actually dabbed in the alien labs yet but I have dab field and they're bomb both companies are reputable and wow this stuff is um dank this stuff looks good smell is amazing so this the strain on this one is baklava now I've seen some different things online I'm pretty sure that sure this baklava is kosher and gelato 41 um there I think the plug seeds sells seeds of baklava online that's like wedding cake in gelato so people's gonna wanna you're gonna see different things whether it's wedding cake gelato or kosher gelato but to me I'm definitely getting more of like a kosher thing I feel like you know I mean this girl uh keeping that dab on there for the next two minutes until your nails cool down this stuff is super loud haven't tasted it yet waiting for my nail to cool down here but the appearance and the smell so far are tens I ain't gonna lie this I mean like you said we're coming around on rosin a little bit lately and this far yeah I know we might have given a I've been hating on it but maybe not necessarily given rosin it to do when we've talked about it in past videos just cuz we've never been the biggest rosin guys when I'm gonna dab I've always been a little bit more into the hydrocarbons for whatever reason yeah I think it's just like it's one of those things where like rosin has to be like like I love the upper like 1% of the upper 1% of rosin you know I'm saying like the best of the best rosin is about as good as anything excited for this well a lot of it overall especially a lot of the hash rosin a lot of this bubble rosin unless it is like I said the best of the best of the best it ends up kind of just tasting like generics bubble hash I feel like a lot of times I know you know there's obviously the rosin boys out there that are gonna give me some pay for this one but I feel like a lot of times we're gonna get more distinct terpene profiles with like I said hyper thought of an extract rather than Rosalyn but like you made the point earlier we've been coming across some rosin lately that have you know you had it on a pretty big one there pretty big well obviously it didn't kill me like I was expecting damn pretty expansive expansive the flavor it's definitely fishy you're right it's definitely leaning more towards the kosher we still have to be I guess watch the last five cast I went to hit it on the podcast but dab is some fire come my present really really wanted to try off of the pink of with my last stab of it on there and [ __ ] atomizers out so well kind of sucks I'm only got one week for this video makes things a little bit difficult but hopefully all the next concentrate review will have to keep looking as well well it's kind of nice to do like the dab when you compare that to what it's like a very nice nothing like a good old dad with a smoke smell no damn good old dad gets it sweatin I'll tell you what rest up spoken man it got me really high it only said it's like 70 something like that potency wise it's on there you gotta breathe you know yeah we're seventy four point five eight percent THC right yeah but holy [ __ ] it packs a punch Dione care what that says cuz I am high he got me like the full like you know I'm not sweating but it gave it away gave me a little preparation is that perspiration yeah really I feel like this yeah I did a couple of days of this yesterday but not a true first impression review for me but I noticed the same thing you're talking about it settles in quick yeah like you feel it immediately but for me especially dabs I feeling way more in the head as far as like the body effects go and then it settles down slowly but this [ __ ] I feel like it kind of just moved its way through your body quick oh nice body high on the [ __ ] for sure all right now I'm loaded yeah the effect is definitely the best 10 this is a 10 dude what about the flavor which if you had to guess we talked about oh you think it's the kosher you think it's the wedding cake based off the flavor what would you get it was pretty cushy I don't know I'm gonna think I'm gonna go with the kosher in the gelato 41 but my guess is just good as anybody else's there's probably somebody out there that's like no it's [ __ ] wedding cake dumbass but I don't know the flavor is amazing I honestly give it tens across the board I'm super high I'm super Spacey right now oh my god eyes are low I'm trying to hold back his cough I'm [ __ ] up ten and and overall and this is some of the back this is like the best should I've dad since that GMO for that I got it [ __ ] all flour and it was poppin bumper select something like that what do you think yeah I got the instance wet gift and I don't know if it's from these lights and my mates that [ __ ] was about gonna just exhale that dab man yeah flavor is very true to the smell I definitely get I'm getting a little bit I definitely for me this is more of a kosher thing I don't know maybe sometimes I get something gassing this from the wedding cake - yeah but I'm getting super gas and I'm it's on this when I smell it like if you just smell the jar it's definitely a heavy on the gas but the flavor I'm definitely kind of getting more of that gelato thing and I know we're beating a dead horse here with you know gelato and how it's kind of played out right now and it's like when you hate all the people like oh you don't like gelato a lot of farts oh yeah good gelato is fire good week but they're not every single new strain that needs to at the market for the next three or four years needs to be gonna blow across I think we need to you know now that we've got legal weed and we've got different states and your charter breeders and we've got you know now that this [ __ ] is opening up let's uh let's try to get some more variety in the mark Dave you don't need to have these five ten-year runs like we have in the past purpura and cooker runs not that we did above them yeah blue dream [ __ ] let's bring them all the time just not bring but let's not do the gelato thing for 12 years you know what I'm saying I'm ready let's move on the next thing we're talking to all you hi boys and all the people out there that push yeah that that area of this industry though in my boss dreams the exotics as we like to call them and usually usually we move on by crossing the staple with new so start crossing and I know gelato is getting poured out make me miss it what's fine site and new let's get some new heat out here and then bring back a couple new gelato crosses in five or 10 years and they'll be nostalgic will long for them but I'm really not longing for any gelato at this point that being said it does taste this is a [ __ ] fire dude I like gelato I smoked it a lot it's in my jar over there right now it's in this jar right here at least it's crossed in this jar and that little gelato ramp doesn't necessarily apply so much to this other than it's technically part of the genetics or whatever but this is definitely some some more interesting smoke for me and I'm saying this is Turkey this is flavorful I definitely like this it's so blonde it's so pretty the consistency is perfect to me and 10 like why you didn't break it down right it's ten Cayenne flavor buzz 10 super hard put this up in a tree hm shoutout to atrium yeah saving your boy some of the fire every time I go down there I always know they're gonna have some heat for me in this stuff pricey but you know if somebody who's gonna come out here and pay top dollar and try to get the best thing they could get I would not feel bad recommending this to them or sending them home with that you know either because you take one job and you're like whoa yeah man shoutout to field like I said first time trying to Ross and definitely impressed hopeful and you know we like a lot of alien labs flowers so hopefully they keep doing called more collaborations and doing more extracts is definitely enjoyed this one smoking more earth let us know what you guys would like to see us review next time what are you smoking on let us know down there in the comments yes smash that like button make sure you're subscribed and do that do all that stuff that keep the girl keep the game grapy keep your drinks up yeah we're out of here man yeah yeah that's how I feel yeah I'm not sure about you guys but whoo see this is the point in the video where the whole business aspect of things just goes out the door and then we'll just sit here in [ __ ] like I might say here just start over for three minutes yeah this is what we do after the is every really good at just extending these things like wait - are we over 10 minutes it oh yeah 12:15 sounds about time like we stick a few more dad's going to mini wheats ecosystem any weeds oh no cinnamon toast crunch is what you got up on the wall on the podcast yeah we're trying to grow a little healthier guys is that healthier I really think or it's just marketed that we literally made out of the same exact [ __ ] [ __ ] it's all wrong in it I woke up and roast on this one and we'll quit [ __ ] cinnamon on this one yeah come up with a different cartoon character and that's it mini wheats or CT crunch guys let us know what are you guys saying anyways CT crunch what's the best cereal ever made you know I feel like Daddy that could be a heated debate for a lot of people yet will be for the rest of time yeah people come out swinging when you start talking [ __ ] about cereals yeah anyways [Applause] [Music] it's just the way that I saw song I'm cooking on the bottom", "AzgjpRbeBz0": "hey growers it's Eric again with LED grow lights Depot calm I got my hands on the growers choice roie 420 LED grow light which was released in early May 2020 stay tuned for a full review part testing how this light compares to the growers choice roie 680 and my final thoughts on this light the roie 420 is growers choice second LED light and it's based off the best-selling roie 680 it's a plug-and-play bar style grill light which can be used for vertical gardening tents and open grow rooms in home or commercial settings the unit's dimensions are thirty five point three by thirty four point six by three point two inches and it weighs nineteen point four pounds the total light output of the fixture is reported out 1090 micromoles per second with a high efficacy of two point six micromoles per Joule the light will flower a solid three by three to three and a half by three and a half foot area or veg a four by four area at full intensity expect to use a slight at around six to twenty four inches depending on the footprint you need to cover and intensity that your plants desire the roie 420 draws 420 watts at the wall according to growers choice when I measure this grow lights largest draw at the wall at 117 volts I received a reading of 439 watts at an amperage of 3.75 the widest draw that I measured is within 5% of growers choice specs expect a heat output of 1432 BTUs per hour from this fixture or around 47% less heat and energy than an 800 watt HPS the e 420 is rated for 120 volt and 240 volt applications the plug is a NEMA 515 P 120 volt style plug so you'll need to use a 120 volt to 240 volt plug adapter if you have a 240 volt application if you are in another country you'll need a u.s. 120 volt plug adapter for your specific country there are three different odds room diodes incorporated into the AR ie 420 warm white cool white and 660 nanometer deep red the spectrum is fixed and can only be dimmed to preset levels on the fixture of 75 percent 50 and 25 percent using the growers choice controller for most other controllers you have more control and options over the set intensities including timing there is no UVA in the spectrum but there is far red which is naturally present in the white light diodes growers choice uses their GC 3k full phase spectrum in this grow light it's a full spectrum and we'll take plans from seed to harvest the spectrum is a little heavier in blue than some other full cycle lights on the market which is actually ideal for increasing quality during flowering the added 660 nanometer deep red is ideal for speeding up photosynthesis can assist in increasing yields and it helps boost the efficiency of the light the spectrum is similar to other high efficiency quality LED lights on the market such as the Gavita 1700 II and the HL g650 are expect a lifetime of around fifty four thousand hours until the LED arrays reached 90 percent of their original light output the lights come with a three year manufacturer's warranty our ETL DLC MCE certified there are also ip65 waterproof and dustproof I put this fixture in a three by three 10 but it's a tight fit although it would crush it in the space due to the tight fit I tested this in a 4x4 10 even though the par readings were lower on the edges and corners now keep in mind that that 4x4 10 is about 43% larger than a 3x3 10 let's check it out the first reading is gonna be at 24 inches 24 inches we're hitting right around 630 ppfd moving to the back of the 4x4 430 into the corner about 370 so this would be a good height for veg in a 4x4 area you could flower at this height but you know it's not that intense so I recommend moving the light a little bit closer but notice we're getting pretty good even coverage across the entire area ii readings gonna be 12 inches above the sensor where we're hitting almost a thousand ppfd in the center moving to the back of the tent almost 400 and into the corner looks like around 305 so I'm just following a 4x4 footprint right now and next I want to show you what this is gonna look like in the recommended coverage area of about a 3x3 square so just following the edges looks like we have a range here from you know it looks like 500 600 sometimes a little bit higher now just looking at the uniformity across that 3x3 square you know also see a range but pretty good even intensity right around 700 800 900 which are all really good intensities so overall this light will perform in a three by three to three and a half by three and a half flowering area what are my overall thoughts on roie 420 the e 420 has a great spectrum that will take your plans from seed to harvest its efficient and will give you excellent uniform coverage in the recommended coverage area with a retail price of six hundred and forty nine dollars this comes out to 1.5 $4 per watt and 59 cents per micro mole of light output this is not the most powerful fixture on the market nor does it have the largest footprint but for the price wattage draw and light output it is one of the best lights that you can use in a three by three to three and a half by three and a half foot area I also really like the preset dimming switch on this light this takes the guesswork out of the intensity and allows you to dim it without a controller yet if you want to run this light or several of these lights with an optional controller you can I briefly want to cover how this fixture compares to the e6 80 in some it's basically a less powerful version of that light but the design is quite different the e6 80 has eight bars while the 420 only has four bars it's also about seven inches smaller in length and in width furthermore the e 420 has a light output of 1090 PPF or about 38% less light than the roie 680 for reference the e 680 has a power draw of 680 watts with a light output of 1770 PPF the efficacy is the same in both lights clocking in at 2.6 and micro moles per Joule which is very very good the recommended flower coverage is a three by three to three and a half by three and a half foot area on the roie 420 while the e 680 will cover a solid four by four or a bit more the spectrum is also the same in both of the lights the roie 420 has a couple of other small features that the e 680 does not first it has a level on the front and back so you can ensure the fixture is straight and ensure even light intensity over your plans secondly while both of the grow lights fold in half the e for 20 has bolts which allow you to lock the bars in place so it won't collapse if you press up on the center bar I dropped a link to the product page in the description if you want to learn more or purchase the roie 420 I also link the e 680 product page and review in

"RvCuAGDyEZk": "what is up what is up how's everybody doing so i've gotten some questions about this uh this light here the tsl and growers choice collaboration of the e680 and um let's talk about it one heat doesn't produce much heat um outside tent um you know is pretty much comparable what the inside tent is going to be obviously you want to have good airflow in here um if you have fans that can blow on the on the light itself well that's going to be beneficial as well but always have good light flow uh another question how how far away from the light is the plants um well i have one plant that's a little bit taller than the other one that's about a foot and a half from the light to the top of the planet on this one here this is at 100 percent and we'll call that five inches and it's at one hundred percent tops aren't getting bleached plants looking healthy and nice well as healthy as it is since i wasn't adding cal mag and was trying to kill my plant but got calm going in and things are looking a lot better it's but um as far as i'm saying is it's not bleaching on the top it's not killing the leaves it's it's doing good and that's at say about five inches um one of the guys that i know on youtube here okeygrower75 um he's actually said he's seen these plants grow through the light this is a great light guys um if you can look into them great light it's doing good here in my 5x5 um yeah um another thing i'd like to talk about real quick my upcoming nutrient line i have coming that i'm going to be using zen products base a base b be using those through uh veg and flower see got the big bang big bang balloon got the candy man and we got some cow mag jaybird i know you're already running this stuff man so um anyway guys i had a video a week or two ago talking about their ph up and down uh i met with the uh the owner of zen products uh johnny green real cool dude um follow them on instagram zen products check them out and uh the next grow is going to be using zen products they're not organic they're not salt based they're mineral based and uh kind of interested to see how that works out but yeah so zen products they've got many other products as well um they do have some organic stuff so check them out look at their website i'll put it down in the link or in the description i'll put a link to their website so uh yeah joby nooner by bearded bud brothers harley grower i i'm gonna start its flush this weekend so in about two weeks we'll have that done and and it is absolutely a beautiful beautiful plant the smells that come off of it is insane absolutely insane i absolutely love it um definitely one that i'm going to be growing again so all right guys well i hope y'all have a great rest of your evening check out the growers choice roi e680 and then also check out zen products peace you", "oTaYrUiTK7Y": "[Music] another mastermind hit what's up everybody boy mastermind here for ohio cannabis live and we're talking about garlic cookies by riviera creek it's at 36 percent cac terpenes are lemony mercy and pineapple and as you can see it still comes in a bag this time we didn't get the box i still think riviera creek should change the packaging to maybe some type of jar i do like the box riviera creek this is my first time trying the garlic cookies at 36 percent i've tried many other batches i think i've bought like 15 bags total of garlic cookies since october of last year so i've definitely had success with this particular strain it's been good for my pain and anxiety and it's also been useful for me in the evening the buds are pretty much average size buds for this type of product as far as with frivolour creek they're not bad but um they could always uh be bigger but uh it's only 2.8 so i say they're pretty giving me some pretty nice size nugs here the smell is pretty much the same even though i've noticed the terpene profile percentages have declined over time i definitely give this one a 90 on the mastermind score and if you like the videos make sure to like subscribe button and i'll see you next time peace you", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "fsGg64R-ILw": "all right how's everybody doing this job let's ENC connoisseur so you got

gelato this is distillate running 91.3% and I'll set this over there and I'll come around you guys close up real quick all right Wayne there's [ __ ] down like this right here what lose him like this right here [Music] sorry about the air compressor guys like I said I leave my shop all right so first things first you got the receipt here we'll go with what's first well first on the list here top of the list we're looking at nature's gifts retailers of fine cannabis we've got - track original glue opal sugar 1 gram which is a hybrid tax included 28 dollars and 49 cents so that's this right here live resin is an a.1 dope cup award winner there's a hybrid is live resin opal sugar premium extracts now you got your original glue live resin opal sugar total cannabinoids of 8730 THC is 76 - all right there you go what's next on here we got dab X gelato distillate that's a hybrid one gram tax included twenty two dollars and seven cents well here's that dab X [ __ ] look at the color on

out nature's gifts give me a comment let me know what you guys are getting your belt for we'll see you later peace", "nigBtfIJcaQ": "hello rso sosa and today i ain't stopping people don't get me wrong it knocked me out at 5pm last night with that weed [Laughter] woke up today and i thought [ __ ] it let's get a reload so what we've got is in this one is this is what once is i think this is the white rants this one well that's the wheat ranch one of these is the white ones that's probably the wheat runs and it looks weird yeah that's gelato both look pointed are we in it well i'm confused now moody packaging then it sandwich bags i'm saying that's what it rants in there and that one is some gelato stuff i can't remember even that got a lot of i don't know something cool feel though the ginger balls on it yeah that's the gelato we won i don't know what the name of it is but it's gelato something or other but i'll let you know in the comment section five [ __ ] balls i run it all day strong whoa so then we come to whitehouse mcrunter snaps through our ass absolute gary glitter balls in this [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me bash it up looking forward to a drink to that so we've also got some pink sandy and animals so we get these animals out see what animals are saying let's see if we're getting to the bottom of the bag of all god's animals miss it by day and it all goes away isn't as potent as these two but obviously gelato comes with a heart hurt thing and white runs well you are right smells very nice though very very nice it's animals and then good old [ __ ] pink sandy's going your t-birds how are we doing pink sandy i want to just go you're the one you're the one one go on pink sandy the glitter balled up to the eyeballs a little definitely got smaller nugs than we did yesterday but like i said leave it a day it all flies away but we don't stop cherry pop fireballs upon fireballs upon fireballs upon fireballs stop i couldn't stop couldn't start nearly bought half ounce of two different flavors at half our free [ __ ] i had yesterday and cosmic crisp or whatever the [ __ ] it was but that cosmic crisp weren't good enough to be buying a half ounce of and zr3 i thought you know what i've tried it i'm gonna go for four different flavors half ounce and then saves the pennies done it while you get to taste the rainbow so what we're going to do is we'll start with these animals from flavours no moody packets or whatever people go on about it but flavors is animals i'm going for this one first because i don't think this is going to be the best out of them i think it's going to be the worst to be honest with you so rather get it out of the way first of all see how we go mr malocco first type very smooth very nice very very nice it's got very clean sweet with it it tastes very very clean this dude very very clean not not overpowering with a turp profile so getting a little tingle not a bomb straight in the head but yeah you know you're smoking a bit of bang bang here it's animal very clean very very clean that's all i can really say about it it's very clean about seven out of ten on the kick starting to get that caddy bang bang swept with it now but overall clean smoke right the next one i believe guava latto guava latto i think this gelato gelato guava one of them as the videos going i'm sure by the time we get to the by the time we get to the description or the title we have the correct name down another lawyer please all the turp profile you could hit straight away soon as you ever talk through that is it be is it me straight away straight away that one there there's animals you toke it and it's it's clean it's nice it's power but just clean with this one with the gelato we're not i suppose it's coming with that gelato tur bit it's [ __ ] nice you know i mean it comes with the power with a nice gelato okay it's a very sweet lovely that's wow nice that is that's very very nice i don't know i missed the cross with the la wherever the lotto is but what happened i was it quite interesting wanted to see what this one actually is you could talk about that that would be happy very much taking the taste of sure but that's what i'm saying it's got very nice very nice profiles but very very nice smoke's very clean as well i would prefer this one over those animals because it's just got a bit more of a turp profile to it you know it's over i'm getting more higher because i've smoked the next joint and that's why i'll get you more stone don't know much you've just had some weed of the other one charming get your head straight you can't but the power to the face flex to the face rso is it's left a lovely turp profile on your mouth now after you've exiled you're left with a lingering scrumptious should i say not really wanted to put it down to be honest with got it's microphone ash have a bash i would tell that have a [ __ ] bash and if you don't want to ever take these off then we're going to go for white runts i've had this in a while believe i have had white rants before you know been a crocodile last time i had weight rants but at the menu on the second go round our four yeah come on then let's have some wheat ranch on it profile ain't as good as sharper very sharper this one that one's got some depth in the top profile this one comes have some of that very nice though very nice once again i don't know if it's just because it's the third joint but this joint's feeling look it's got more power tell you what though falling asleep at [ __ ] 5 r5 yesterday in the afternoon after all them bangers feel [ __ ] tested today fan [ __ ] tastic white runs if i wanted something where nowhere you want to sit there and get a nice taste on with it i would choose the guava latto if i wanted something nowhere you're feeling all fresh and just thinking so what [ __ ] it get moving just have a nice drink i'll go for the go for the white runs it seems like that that guava is more of an evening you know when you're in the evening you just want to [ __ ] really sit there and enjoy your banger guava i think would be nice for that the white ranch is more like daytime freshy i like it's deep but more moose pig sandy i've left this the last because i thought this is going to be the number one bang bang a real head high [ __ ] turpee profile fingers in a pie aye aye captain barrels eye do you know what i mean jelly bean pink sandy [ __ ] andy just comes with a whole swap to the side compared to these ones this is cut it be on the right side this did it's come in with a the brass bands just come in and start kicking off you know i mean they're playing now i don't know this because it's the fourth joint but see guava's coming at you with a turk profile which is very similar to [ __ ] gelato even if this is quite like i don't know let me just be july but it tastes like [ __ ] gelato but with a rump on it this pink sandy's coming at me with the same troop of strength from the profile of that but with a whole different type of profile more sweet more a step five distance this is how many blind side in yeah one bang to decide what didn't see that coming rough i mean left with bit pink sandy walking home i'd have done him if i knew that love that means he said you and sandy's walking home you've been sidewinded that's it [ __ ] over at it at least you and sandy will be all right though old stroke pig sadly i would smoke pig sadly out of these and then i'd go for the guava then the wheat rats and then there's animals peace out people", "xlilu8hTPpI": "[Music] what's up guys john here with respect my region and today for our west coast weed tour review we are going to take a big dab of some king's garden royal concentrates it's going to be their wedding gusher shatter all right so how this is gonna work uh we are going to do 10 categories 100 points i'm gonna go through everything sorry i'm gonna pull up my review so i don't mess this up sorry about that 10 points uh 10 categories 100 points i'm gonna take a dab i'm going to talk about it and yeah i'll explain to you why i gave it the score i did so this is the package it came in the 35 gram shatter this is the package it came in gold pretty plain doesn't really stand out too much but what stood out was the strain wedding gushers and the price 35 dollars good price it's pretty good for shatter you want to be a little bit more translucent but that's got a good color on it all right so i'm going to break off a little piece here boom i'm going to throw this into my my wriggler shout out to higher standard for the beautiful piece all right so we're going to cold start this dab because you want to full start the dab that way you don't burn any of the terpenes and i can get all the flavor i can see that melting up in there nice okay that's nice and melted oh wow yeah you get a really a really gassy flavor wedding that's wedding cake and uh gushers crossed together and uh you definitely get the gas of the wedding cake there so presentation 70 it's just plain gold packaging and i can't see the shatter um it's really hard to justify spending any amount of money when i can't see the product but luckily the the wedding gushers strain just really stood out to me um shattered the fact that it's shatter alone stood out to me shout out to palm desert you guys have a really robust shatter market which is awesome the shadow markets die down a lot in washington state it's hard to find a lot of good shatter there are a couple brands that make it but it's really hard to find a lot of good stuff but uh the bud tender recommended this brand for the bang for their buck so uh so it gets so the product appeal it bounced it back up to a 90 percent color eighty percent uh it looks like good shatter i wish it was a little more translucent but it does look really good uh smell 75 percent shatters never really gonna get a crazy smell category the aromatics on shatter just really aren't there but the taste is wonderful 88 just pure gas on the taste potency again 88 it hits you right away this strain hits you right away i'm kind of fumbling through my words a little bit so i can tell that it's a little bit more of a heavy strain probably not one i would use during the day if it weren't for me doing this review for you guys more information available i had a docket a few points on this too i really only get the thc information 72 thc and barely any cbd so you know i wish i got some terpene information i wish i got you know maybe some strain genetics uh you know anything to tell me about the brand or the product more other than basic thc um which is on the category of why i buy products thc percentage is is lower i would almost rather see terpenes by themselves than um just thc percentages on a concentrate if i'm being honest because then i at least know what kind of flavor i'm gonna get but i would still recommend this product bang for your buck 35 bucks good shatter good taste good high can't really ask for a lot i like i like i said i like the price 35 dollars is really reasonably priced for good concentrates especially in california so if you're up in the palm palm desert area definitely look out for that i gave it at 82 overall like i said i wish i could see the product before i buy it um because like i said i think their product does look good so if they showed it off you know more people would probably buy it the packaging doesn't really stand out and there's not a lot of information available but all that being said i would definitely buy this wedding gusher shatter again from king's garden so if you like the review like like the video subscribe to the channel check out our entire library of west coast weed tour reviews and that's all i got for you guys today see you later", "HgprBo4nKzk": "YouTube sorry I didn't make it yesterday to show you anything but I had injured myself at work so I'm kind of just trying to get through that at the moment but this is a 4x4 you guys haven't seen this yeah this is going at the same time as the one I've been showing you smurfing into Smurf ninja dream crew badass aretha solar flare looking super frosty that's my little 4x4 similar setup drain aways elevated pots circulating fans clip fans 600 watt single ended 80s air cooled hood will go over to the 4x8 all the lights are off right now cuz until in the morning I gotta get going to work but as you can tell we got some serious frosting icing going on hand see if I could sit back here I mean yeah they're big buds we're having a good time over here GG for sunshine to dreams just keeps going smurf ninja nice and fat - really frosty really fast here we got Rita doing her thing [Music] nice more tricone coverage than on the 4x4 but a little less fat because I had this [ __ ] over here leaning over the whole times well I'm gotta get out of here but sorry it was a day late dollar short but as promised it's here this week I hope you all have a safe continued Cove in nineteen experience and smoke a lot of weed that helps Cheers", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "33gS1z4W-n0": "well hello YouTube sorry it's been so long been super busy been so busy that I've already gone through the vegetative state of the new growth and I'm moving on into flower right now so to catch you guys all up my last grow with the LA cush cake came out to fourteen point seven ounces and there's some pretty good bug not too bad for the first grow and I've changed my grow still doing some hydroponics but I'm using Coco fiber instead of doing the Evan flow system kind of wanted to check that out because I was so busy and I really didn't have time to babysit the Evan flow and change the nutrients all the time this seems to be a little bit more easier the growth is is phenomenal and so I started out with clones on these and I have several different clones that I went with so I have the the dose Eidos the cookies the gelatos and the can deal and also some more gelato cookies Candyland but I also picked up three premium clones from dark heart nursery those guys are awesome and I got the sunshine sherbert the you can't really see it Nepali pink and the vin emoji so I'm still using the I really can't pronounce the name of these damn lights the bliz on or Phil's on two thousand watt LED lights with the with the cops and they've been pretty good lights so far you know the plant growth has been really good but for some reason and maybe somebody out there that has these lights can answer this question or maybe the manufacturer themselves can answer this question because they have put comments in my comment section below about having any questions to go ahead and ask them so on every single one of the lights there is four lights this one this one this one and the one all the way back here and it's like that on every single light doesn't matter whether I turn it on just the grow or if I turn it on just flower those lights seem to stay off and on this one these ones kind of went out on me but it also had the same for out here here here and if you go over to these other lights here same thing same for on every single light really weird I don't know what that's about maybe somebody could tell me I don't know but other than that they seem to be doing ok plants seem to love them haven't had a lot of problems with them plants are kind of stretching a little high getting a little too close the only problem with this light is that they're really powerful really strong and in a tent it's kind of difficult to you know try to get the plants away from the lights cuz you only got so much room I mean I'm okay yeah I'm almost to the top here not a whole lot of wiggle room left to go up so I might have to just go ahead and build a different room and just take them out of the tents and just build a room for it but so I'm in the third week of flower right now and they're just starting to develop and getting their errors and getting their little stars star flowers excuse me looking pretty good healthy praying they love their nutrients still going all organic nutrients no chemicals and I've just got done cleaning these all up so I defoliated all the all the little leaves that were kind of blocking all the light from going down to the smaller little bud sites down here I want to make sure that you know they got enough light so all the lower stuff can grow and from my other grow the last grow that I did which was my first grow with the LA cush cake I decided to really trim all the bottom grow all the way up to the canopy any of the skinny little branches that were like for instance this one here which I'll probably take off because when it came to harvest time it's a real pain in the ass to cut those buds up so this time I really kind of adjust lollipop the [ __ ] out of them and have been defoliating pretty well so that they have good light coming through the canopy and it seems to be working pretty good buds are developing nicely and we'll see what what happens with this grow here so nice seeing everybody again or excuse me talking to everybody again like and subscribe below have any comments or questions please go ahead and you know ask down in the section below and if you guys have any answers on the light situation please comment below and until next time I'll try to you know get back into doing some more videos I know that I've kind of been lagging but as you can tell I've been lagging a lot because I'm already you know getting halfway into my flower already so there we go so my last grow for anybody that wanted to know I ended up with 14.7 after drying 14.7 ounces and you know it was one of the jars I'll get a little close to the light here I'm actually filming late at night this is one of the jars and it's a lot of it's already gone yeah that's it was actually came out", "5F70AV7eXQ0": "what's popping what's popping what's popping is your boy mr thc man and today i'm back at it with a banger i'm in long beach california and we're going to be

kind of mixed up on with the relax the calm and the sleep is most people think that they're the calm is like oh it's going to put me to sleep no it's just going to control your anxiety and your mood throughout the day relax is kind of in between almost the same as calm but it that's something you would smoke when you get home from work that would kind of unwind the sleep that's going to put you

impacts later who does all see us go but I think we'd cures one so you guys are awesome subscribe", "OM5r3zFdvPg": "so real quick before I even start the video I figured the reason you clicked on it was to find out how to see if a Wankel oil card is fake so let's just go over that really quickly first up the Wonka oil label will be raised but every individual letter will be embossed into the packaging as you can see this is raised but every letter is like the same texture so that's not a good sign secondly up here it should say Wonka's Cecil not Wonka ceramic and thirdly there should be a sticker in every package that was your quick thirty second guide on how to tell a real Wonka oil cart now let's get into the video [Music] all right hey guys what's up it's you boy mr. bling seat back again with another video today I'm gonna be doing a little rapid-fire review of these Wonka oil carts I am 99% sure these are fakes but as I'm unboxing them I'm gonna actually like look at them very closely and confirm whether or not my suspicions are correct um so yeah let's get into it I'm gonna start by looking at this trainwreck Wonka oil cart the reason I think that these are fake are the boxart for starters it's a lot more faded than the actual box art you'll get from Wonka loyal carts 'as it has the same writing on the back as the normal packages from what I can find online but the thing is when you open a true Wonka oil cart and you pull it out there should be a stick I don't have a sticker they come with a little Wonka oil sticker so you can like put it places and I guess the fakes they didn't decide to like recreate the sticker that long ago oil gives the cart feels heavy the wax looks a nice color and let's see if it moves at all it looks like it's barely moving so that's a good sign for this being a fake cart but that being said even that TKO cart I looked at uh moves really slowly also there's a white ring on the inside of the cecil atomizer and a lot of you guys in the comments have been telling me that the white ring means that it's a fake sea salt atomizer so that also is discouraging considering the fact that like you know you're buying these carts you want to have good atomizers with them the wax is still barely moving but that just could be because they mix it with something hella thick so I won't be able to know the quality of the distillate until I actually get to vape on them so imma go ahead and open the other box for you guys just so you can see that one maybe that one's like a real cart um but yeah I'm open the other box and then we'll go ahead and take our first puffs okay so next up we're gonna be opening the savage easel Wonka this one looks like it's already been looking a little bit before that's discouraging I don't think whoo I got these from would take out the stickers but like they're still out there here's the card let's check the wax quality same as with the last card it moves barely at all like that I'm really happy with it and I'm really hoping that these end up being decent because like I'm tired of buying really crappy fake carts it's got the white ring which means that it's a fake see cell atomizer so just like the other current I'm pretty sure this one's a fake so let's go ahead and puff on them see if they taste good at lease or if they hit hard and then hold you take a day to review them like usual and I'll come back at y'all tomorrow all right so to cut down on time I already loaded my vapes with the carts this is the train wreck and this is the Sour Diesel oh these are DAB cap compatible so I'm going to be hitting them through the deaf cap as well as hitting them just through the vape so first off we're gonna go with the sour diesel off the seesaw silo just to hit it see how it tastes and see how it rips so cheers guys okay it's not hitting like immediately and I don't know if I've like screwed on my vape thing too tight so let's see if that was the case okay so no it wasn't the fact that I screwed on my date base too hard it's just not hitting this is gonna be really disappointing I'm unscrewing it and it smells like how these discipline cards usually smell like so I doubt that it's like fake fake fake fake like a bad fake so let's just try it one more time I'm not even getting a draw on it I don't understand what's going on okay I might be experiencing technical difficulties with my silo so I'm gonna see if it hits off the m3 so cheers on that hopefully oh that tastes really good that actually tastes amazing there wasn't that much draw resistance on it at all after hating it off of this battery um the taste was amazing and it felt really smooth if you notice I didn't even call and I'm pretty sure I got a good vapor cloud so I'm gonna hit it off the dab cap real quick just to show you like how it will rip through a piece so cheers on that [Music] [Music] it really does taste very good so like I'm a fan of that that's the train wreck so after trying nated the Sour Diesel off of the Cecil m3 I noticed that it didn't even work either I'll show you guys real quick it's not hitting so I'm gonna have to transfer the distillate from this car to another atomizer and hope it works then so I'm very happy I ended up buying an actual Cecil atomizer so before I get to the other half of the video I'm just going to take one more rip of this trainwreck through the dab cap through this guy cactus right from pepper and then we'll get to the other half so I will see y'all tomorrow Cheers [Music] and that really does taste amazing I'm very happy about this train wreck at least so yep see you tomorrow guys all right so rapid-fire review on both of these carts first off the Sour Diesel after changing it to a sea salt atomizer easily my favorite out of both of these this cart hits right up with the grates of this channel like the dab woods carts and the dank vape I'm going to show you it through the dab cap real quick and then I'll talk about it a little bit so Cheers alright so the sour D it's like a tank three rips out of a dab cap is amazing with this cart it's easily enough to get you a good buzz and even sometimes get you high depending on how long your hits are five hits and I am fried for a good two and a half to three hours I would highly recommend getting these carts but if they're fakes switching them to better atomizers because I'm sure they would hit better that being said the train wreck it hits alright just not nearly as well as the Sour Diesel out of that new atomizer that being said this one worked from the box versus the other one where I had to actually transfer it thoughts on this cart the highs are okay but they take forever to get I think six rips from this cart or what gets me high and I have to like keep smoking just to keep the high going um the high off of this cart can best be described as just feeling tired and kind of heavy headed but also relaxed so that was a good thing um the high on the Sour Diesel though was very energetic it helped me focus a bit so I was very excited about that but yeah let me go ahead and take a rip out of this through the dab cap just to show y'all and then we'll go ahead and wrap up [Music] so as you can see the cloud wasn't as good but it was still pretty smooth um but it's not really gonna get me high it takes quite a few rips out of this atomizer to get me high overall I would give the Sour Diesel in this new atomizer an 8 out of 10 and I would give the trainwreck in the regular atomizer a 6 out of 10 that being said they both got overall positive reviews so I have something special planned for our final hit we'll be right back so this is something I usually do for my friends on snapchat but uh I've hooked both of these carts up to the dually from hemp er and a dab cap so I'm gonna hit them both at the same time through a rig I'm gonna try to do a blinker so uh stay tuned for that let's go so you know nothing can mentally prepare me for doing this but anyways if y'all made it to you into this video thank you so much please like and subscribe and leave in the comments some ideas for other upcoming videos I have a few ideas but I'm always looking to like see what y'all want to see on the channel I plan on doing a timebomb for a thousand subs cuz we're about to hit that I'm so excited and thank you all for 500 like I think that time I'm uploading this out be at 600 but like I'm blown away by the support I'm receiving thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart and there's blinkers for y'all so let's go
