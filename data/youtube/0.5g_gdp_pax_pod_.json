{"F438gDUlCWU": "[Music] while dabbing cannabis concentrates does certainly give you the biggest bang for your buck accurately judging how large of a dollop you should dab or how much chatter you should share off remains an ongoing issue and will be the stoner whose jar of bubble hash opens in their bag or whose vape oil canister breaks in their pocket luckily Portland's Iowa vapor has devised a really clever solution NAB taps each of these little ceramic pellets is infused with 50 milligrams of cannabis concentrate they won't break leak sweat or spill their THC rich contents and they're extremely easy to use simply drop a tab onto your dab Briggs nail or set it in the heating crucible of your preferred vaporizer and heat it up as until it warms the concentrate trapped inside will slowly boil off for you to inhale and since each tab contains five standard doses you'll have enough for a full session in each if not just add another tab plus while the pellets released their THC cargo they visibly char and pit making it easy to judge how many draws you have left before they're fully spent the real genius of DAB cabs is their portability and versatility they're functionally inert until you heat them up so there is effectively zero risk of them spilling or leaking what's more they can be used in any vaporizer that accepts loose-leaf or wax based concentrates during my testing the tabs work smoothly with the puff coke peak the Storz and Bickel mighty the PAX 3 and the vape exhale cloud Evo heck you can even put it in your pipe and smoke it if you're off in mind I especially appreciated that I could start and stop sessions at will without repercussion with conventional rigs if you inadvertently use more oil than you meant to or have a bigger hunk of hash than you can handle your stock muscling through the bowl until it's either cashed or you're left to stone a useless heap on the couch both dab tabs which can be subjected to repeated heating and cooling cycles without any noticeable change of taste in the vapor you can set the pipe down and back up off it at your convenience this combined with the tabs set 50-milligram can ability all contents makes monitoring and managing your dosage a far more simple affair than with existing concentrates the rule of what you scrape is what you vape thankfully no longer apply though they're quite handy dab tabs are not perfect for one you're gonna have a heck of a time trying to find them before next February ILO is partnering with local concentrate suppliers and it's soft launched at select dispensaries throughout Oregon they hope to expand distribution to California Nevada and Maryland early next year what's more since the infusion process requires extra labor and materials expect to pay a premium on top of what you normally would for that gram of hash still you can't put a price on convenience and boy are these ever convenient [Music]", "ELmdFELWwNc": "the Joe Rogan experience it's just nuts how much money is involved in it and how many people look away you know people are trying to stop different flavored tobacco smoke I see you're a vapor well that that I actually looked into that very very deeply this was that the tobacco industry had a problem the problem was this I kicked cigarettes with this because it's just you know you can have nicotine in it or not but you know it's not and if you had any health consequences from using that thing zero keep hearing about people getting lung issues well okay so a couple things happen the lung issues and I don't know who you know personally but there was this don't know anybody person there was a scare and the scare killed a couple of people like ten people and what it turned out was that was people who had vaped THC cartridges and some chem the people who put the you buy your THC cartridge from a dispensary here it's actually packaged by somebody else not by that person so you have you know King world or whatever these different you know that's kind of a reputable brand but it's packaged somewhere else that means putting it you know putting the stuff in and they put in some vitamin E acetate and that just kind of like created a wet you know heat that up and became a web of some [ __ ] inside your lung and [ __ ] you up so that's a man thing but that nothing to do with vaping nicotine with it with the typical chemicals that you get from reputable companies this is the the vaping from marijuana what their process is more problematic than vaping of tobacco well it certainly was in that case because I just someone so change the formula then you need to have some some oil in there in order to keep it you know liquid and for to you know just for it to be able to go into the vape and not the issue was actually just vitamin E oil yes yes and and so that stopped of course somewhere someone did something shitty and that happened you know a really high guy actually said this to me once he he told me that he uses organic MCT oil for his vapes and he was like handing me his video like let's suck on your vape I don't even know you you could be a crazy person you could be literary DMT vapes they have DMT vapes now that's somebody hands you a vape pen you might be in orbit for 20 minutes yeah for 20 minutes before driving oh you know I've flown a helicopter high on DMT no non weed oh that's a dead man yeah with an instructor you know he wanted to see how I did it and it was perfect yeah I play pool which is a very sensitive thing not quite the same death by helicopter but you're controlling the rotations of a ball it's very literally the amount of effort you put if you like you watch a good player the amount of effort they put really accurately depicts how many revolutions of the cube I'm sure yeah and after it's colliding with the object ball and you get more sensitive to that when you're high yeah jiu-jitsu is another one a lot of people do jujitsu really yep and it's really really really common guys smoked out in the parking lot and then go roll it's really common well that was I did the most perfect landing ever when I when I super into it oh and it's very small input the helicopter you've seen it yeah yeah anyway so the tobacco industry had a real issue and that it also comes back to the states because there's this Master Agreement that was put in place decades ago that tobacco companies would pay a percentage of their sales to all states to as a pre compensation for whatever [ __ ] up [ __ ] people get from smoking tobacco and all these states wrote big bonds against that money and so when the income from the tobacco companies was decreasing significantly because of vaping all of a sudden the states are going especially this one what the [ __ ] we have these bought these bonds are gonna you know become go bust that's you know when you have your your state bond go bust this is a real problem it's a financial issue states and the cities and everything go broke so everyone had an incentive to get rid of vaping and get people back on tobacco so they Altria bought Jul the the the main that's what I mean this isn't this is you know hardcore this is you know got a battery it's all technical you get the babe juice Joule is a prepackaged product kids were buying it like like what the benefit of that over a jewel you can control how much does it look like dragons and you can you can put whatever you wanted it not just limited by what jewel wants to sell you anyway back to that because you like this story okay so Tobacco States everyone skied up they buy jewel for 18 billion dollars they buy it as a write-off they want to get this company out of the market then they go to the FDA and they start all this [ __ ] about flavors flavors flavors flavors you saw it everywhere it was massive it was a perfect storm we got 10 people dying from vaping something completely unrelated but vaping East cigarettes he had an e-cigarette he died it was actually yeah he vape but he raped a bad THC cartridge and you know got a severe problem so you know how the media plays that and it just kept on spinning spinning there's like well we have to stop the children and the way you stop it is by taking away the flavors because children they want flavors that's what the problem is so that [ __ ] jewel over and actually Altria who used to they bought philip morris basically so it's the biggest tobacco company they start they already wrote down half of it like just taking the [ __ ] L on it they want to get rid of it because in the wings they had their competing products which is IQ OS I quit ordinary smoking small I capital Q OS and it heats tobacco so it's a it looks like a vape pen it has though but it actually runs on tobacco and it doesn't burn it it heats it up has whatever some kind of mechanism in the filter you inhale and it's almost there dream which is the smokeless cigarette very close to it but most importantly it's not a nicotine synthetic nicotine it is tobacco product which is their business and they got they really ratcheted this up so high that they got Trump involved and Trump actually with Melania they did a thing with Alex SR the Health and Human Services Secretary he said well you know be this vaping is very dangerous we have a kid actually you know was one of those moments where everyone loves to jump on Trump he said Melania has a kid you know he forgot to say it was his whatever it was now he's actually been overheard saying I wish I'd never gotten involved in that [ __ ] thing because he figured it out he figured out was a huge scam you know that the bill has been stopped but now they're still trying to push through a bill that will help the tobacco companies even more by outlawing any type of flavored cigarettes or juice liquid or they just want to get rid of it so it's really like who killed the electric car it's exactly that and they just go look at it now I QoS they're launching there's new stories today that say oh my god it's the saving grace we have the new product we've all been waiting for it right at the moment that vaping it's going to kill you it's hooking children because of flavors so do you think they're they're hiring people to write news stories and the news organizations are picking you up because they're being told to just do a press release to do press release meet come on it's so easy in the media to do a press release and oh by the way we're Altria so we're going to buy five hundred million dollars worth of advertising over the next five years would you please run our story or you know you might want to look at this come on it's tobacco so do you think that they make a deal before they accept the press release to do advertising or do they wait a little bit you know it's the only I have to say anything it's just the yeah it's implied why do you not hear why do you not hear the discussion about overmedication of children on television there's a look at the number one advertiser right you if you start talking it's just not discussed you can't have as it is a controversial subject and it would be a good subject not as hard a lot of people paying attention to it right it would get a lot of ratings if you have a lot of stories about overmedication of children like what what is going on it'll be something people be interested in yeah and yet they don't do it because the advertiser right I mean that's Lou look at your advert I have to turn off the sound these days because I'm sure that I'm being blanketed with so many ads that eventually I'm going to get propecia eventually I'm going to get high blood pressure I mean my dicks not gonna work because that's what you're telling you every every commercial block now everyone its pharmaceutical until you know like cable news especially because an older demographic but even if you watch what is it what do they have a where they have two and a half men running all TV land to a Half Men and what's the other one Doug and Carrie come on Kevin James is a to knife man no no the Doug and Carrie where is that you okay in Queens technically yeah but I don't want I'm an i sitcoms and I can watch that that's fine show I can just watch it over and over again good dude but then very funny every commercial break boom drugs yeah what is it which documentary was it there that had a description about the United States saying that we are one of two countries in the world that allows advertisers yes foster alia is the other think it's New Zealand okay let's see the Australian sorry either one because that's like a real [ __ ] yeah call out the wrong one of those things pretty sure it's New Zealand but that for whatever reason that everybody else is like what are you crazy and once we got it in there it's like once something becomes something that everybody does we are crazy it's really difficult [Applause]", "CAdtEFU2oy0": "sup buddy welcome back you glad you found the place well I told y'all he's gonna give you a little how-to and what's up so that's what we're going to do in this one in the last video we showed you how to prep your material in your tubes so if you ain't watch that when you trying to do this you might want to go and check that out but now let's go ahead and get on with showing you how to how to do the rest of this so what you're gonna do we've told you in the last one go ahead and refreeze your tubes after you pack them that's them over there so we've real froze them for ya bout 12 hours get your tubes ready and you get your water boiling alright so you're gonna have your water boiling on the stove and then once that starts boiling here's where all the fun starts so we come out here always always always do this outside don't ever ever ever ever try to do this anywhere covered or under anything or yeah that's I mean I ain't go I usually you know you don't have any slick baggy clothes or none of that dumb  on you know what I mean like nothing that's gonna create sparks no flannels nothing like that rubber soled shoes try to keep to a minimum so what you're gonna do is you take your hot water you put it in your square big pyrex dish right so then we float the pan that we're blowing into onto the water alright so what you're gonna do is you just float your little pan in the hot water you get your tube alright so we got our tube here it's all frosty ready to go we got our rubber bands down just a little ways from the lip you know what I mean by our cap now for this fresh frozen stuff you're going to create a whole lot of pressure that's gonna build up and if you don't do it right you'll blow this filter in a hole bunch of material another out into your pan and you don't want that so what you do to prevent that is you take like a hose clamp all right and then take your bandana and you wrap it around the tube anyway and then you take your hose clamp and you put your hose clamp around where the rubber band is usually rubber band it's like a gasket to hold the in there all right and then you always want to take something them pop down in the hole I take a little tiny metal screwdriver and poke down in the hole and clean it out and that really helps but make sure you keep that hole cleaned out and then you just go ahead and you're in two cans to 300 milliliter cans of butane they're each one of these little tubes and then after you've ran your second can you just shake your tube out into that pan there like I said you'll have to change the hot water in here about every three tubes all right so after you get it ran out into the pan and you wait till they'll be you know probably just a couple minutes and then the liquid like the actual butane liquid that's in the pan will start to evaporate off because the butane starts to evaporate I like 32 degrees or boil off it like 32 degrees so it'll start bubbling real big and then once all of the liquid is out and you're just left with the jelly oil kind of then that's when you want to blow your next tube into there and I don't never blow more than you know in a box you get about six tubes there's 12 cans so I never put more than than 12 cans so six tubes in one one pan once you get more than that it just starts to kind of saturate and you're not really it's just too much to work with but don't just keep blowing and filling the pan up always run the the butane out let the butane purge off from the heat eat before you just fill the pan up that's how you have accidents always always always keep your fire extinguisher over there and keep your assistant decide so keep all your together all right so that'll be this one that's how to blow the the next one will go ahead and run you through a little bit about how to purge it come on back now stay safe", "8tOcvbcqIl0": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy savvy g guys man today getting straight into this because this is this is gonna be one of the craziest videos that i've done in a minute okay guys so i have seven disposables right here okay disposables not cartridges all seven different flavors um varying from you know sativas hybrids and indicas we got them all man these are all by a company called lido i have one open right here let me show you guys real quick this one right here is the skywalker og okay this thing right here man is phenomenal i've been using it if you guys have been seeing my videos i have been puffing on it for the past couple of like i want to say maybe two or three weeks almost coming up on a month now and man do these get me faded every single time that i use them okay so what we're gonna do man what i have planned for today's agenda guys i got seven of them so i was thinking man why not go ahead and taste test every single one of them but with a blinker okay yeah we're gonna be taking blinkers off of all seven of these and we're just gonna be giving you guys a taste test alright so we got blue dream we got straw anna we got gelato we got maui wowie this hand we got strawberry cough skywalker og and purple punch so it is quite a variety of flavors boys and damn i'm ready to get into this okay so the first one that i have actually popped out right here for myself this one is the skywalker og i've actually been puffing on it so let me just go ahead and take one blinker so i give you guys the full rundown on this cheers yeah that is so good dude this premium distillate is just so far you guys know i'm a fan of distillate just because i like the flavor mostly you know when it comes to live resident things i'm not really too much of a fan of it but when it comes to discipline i always feel like companies especially as this one litto they do a fire job man i just being able to provide you some high quality distillate and man this is one of the newer ones in a disposable i usually rock cartridges but now the disposables are i feel like they're the new wave man they've been a lot more convenient to me than a cartridge and a battery just because i mean it's just one single-handed device you know you don't got to be carrying all that other stuff but all right so too much rambling let's get into the flavor review okay so the skywalker og phenomenal you get that earthy tones you get the smack you in the face og and it's just phenomenal man off of the first blinker yeah it's just so good i could probably keep hitting this skywalker og for me is one of my favorites of all time so yeah skywalker og tastes exactly like skywalker og next up on the list we got the maui and go ahead and open that up for you guys pull this sucker out so this one right here is a sativa if you guys don't know so i haven't smoked a lot of sativas lately and i'm kind of excited to try this one so cheers [Music] oh that one is so smooth bro holy crap usually sativas are a lot more smoother than indicas and hybrids but this one was flavorful it tasted let me catch my breath for a second and it tasted i can't really pinpoint um describe what it tastes like but it tastes kind of like a fruity cocktail nothing fake it just comes it just smells it smell all right it tastes like a bowl of fruit loops that's what i'm kind of getting an apple jack something like that i'm not too sure but you get really really fruity notes in this and it's actually a smackers man that just got me a little bit more elevated so maui wowie a little bit more on the fruity side but fire next up on the list we got another indica guys this is right here the purple punch purple bunch for me is one of those flavors that you just cannot mess up man and if you mess it up it just says a lot about your brand but purple punch you always get those sweet grapey little fruity notes and that's what i'm hoping for today so third blinker in man we're only three blinkers in and i'm faded already like it's not a crazy faded but yeah i could definitely feel the head change okay so number three we got purple punch indica uh you guys know me i love indigo's cheer um cheers dude i felt like that that that blinker took a look a little bit longer holy crap the flavor profile literally i just died after that blinker right there but it's all good i just had to go get some water because my throat was dry so that flavor profile guys it tastes it kind of reminds me like a stizzy purple punch it kind of reminds me like it they give it this hawaiian punch taste i don't know if you guys know the drink the red one the hawaiian punch but that's kind of what it tastes like to me without a doubt the high on this purple punch is it's smacking me i'm literally still recovering from it so going in on number four guys i'm literally just getting so baked right now we got the gelato this one is a hybrid so hopefully it doesn't smack me in the face too hard you know just pop it out the packaging give it give it a little sniff this time try to see if it smells like anything it doesn't really smell like anything yeah you can't really smell anything so let's just go in on the fourth hit a gelato hybrid let me give you guys a little bit of more of a close-up of the battery i know some of you are probably wondering yo that design is freaking sick bro why haven't you showed us a close-up and i'm just like man i was just trying to get high bro so there goes another little close-up for you guys very very sleek you can see that little that little line in the middle that's the oil it's very very sick so going in number four or five i don't know i don't even i forgot i already lost count so we got the gelato all right guys blinker time baby yo if you guys are hitting my bad my bad if you guys are enjoying the video so far let's try to smash over 700 likes okay we got seven different pods right here seven different disposables i mean so 700 likes just kind of seems you know on point so going in on gelato cheers [Music] okay okay that that was actually really freaking good that was super milky and cloudy i got a fat rip i remember guys with every different strain i feel like you get different hits because with different strains i guess the yield output the oil how it is it's not always going to be the same so sometimes you'll get you know less milky clouds sometimes you'll get really milky clouds it all depends on the strain but oh my goodness that was fire that literally tasted on point gelato like literally topped it and that was smacked me in my face i'm literally gonna die right now but i'm trying hard not to i know you guys can hear in the voice but we're gonna keep our cool we're gonna keep our cooler after four down we got three left boys we're going ham we're going him so next up i think i'm going with the sativa because i need a little light break from the heavy-hitting indigos and hybrids because honestly i feel like sometimes when they say hybrid or this one by the way is the blue dream sometimes when they say like hybrids i feel like eighty percent of the time it comes out to be a little bit more heavy on the indica side all right so a little bit run down so far we're four in and so far all the flavors are pretty smacking man i can't really complain that there's something that i can't smoke because so far i've been able to smoke them and at ease and i'm pretty sure if i continue to smoke those flavors throughout the day i wouldn't even mind it so next up on the list we got the blue dream sitting in at number five how many of you guys like blue dream let me know down in the comments below old school strain cheers boys hmm i'm sorry if you hear me smack it but i'm just trying to taste this that actually tastes phenomenal i can't i can't describe what it tastes like but it tastes like what a blue would taste like [Music] well that's so weird to say guys but it literally tastes like if the color blew like like just gave out a taste like that's so weird to you know kind of comprehend you know how do you even taste the color but like like a blueberry i guess you can say man it has like a blueberryish taste to it it's it's very very subtle but it's fire this one oh my goodness it has a very earthy taste to it too but it has the blueberry hint of sweetness and wow that actually surprised me so number five blue dream blinker fire literally see it in my eyes dude and my expression in the way that i talk that how faded i am i have not taken like this many blinkers in a row in forever bro like literally this is some [ __ ] i used to do when i used when i first started you know chief in cartridges it's crazy so i feel like a kid again i feel like a kid again so next up we got the straw nana hybrid i'm i'm i'm powering through this boys so quick little insider on this these actually are one gram pods okay they're not point fifty point twenty five you know usually disposables i don't know why companies put point 45.30 like bro like what am i supposed to do with point 30 like what am i supposed to do with that like take like three freaking hits and i'm done like you know like at least give me like half a gram but i don't know companies are wilding so first time i've ever seen a one gram disposable which is pretty freaking dope so straw nana man i am faded guys i am sorry i am sorry here man i got the dab sweats i don't know if you guys could see it on my shirt maybe in my armpits but i'm literally not drenched but i'm almost there guys because of these these dab sweats guys that's how hard these are hitting okay so straw nana enough of the stalling let's go okay so right now i think the issue that i'm having is that my mouth is very very my tongue at least you know my taste buds are just filled with so many different types of disposables that i can't even tell at this point but i did get a good hint of straw like strawberry i didn't get a hint of like banana too much but you do get that strawberry and now that i'm exhaling i'm getting it in like my like the back of my nostrils i guess you could say i get a get a strong sense of like strawberry but it's this is definitely a hybrid you could tell this is a perfect 50 50 because i didn't feel like i got higher but i also didn't feel like i got like you know like jittery so this is a good this is some good stuff man so next up i'm actually glad that i that i um i'm trying this so uh next up last one but not least guys i'm faded off my ass six blinkers in we got the strawberry cough that's that's all on this last one man strawberry couldn't have ended it with a better dessert guys while i personally love strawberry cough it is a sativa for those of you that don't know but i don't even think it matters at this point because i'm just so high like in my eyes like i don't know how i'm even gonna edit this video today probably gonna have to wait till the next day that's probably you guys probably aren't gonna see it upload until the next day we'll see we'll see so going in on number seven okay oh by the way i forgot to give the review to that one i just forgot it was oh yeah actually i did give the review you know that's how you know i'm high guys i'm forgetting about doing things that i already did so going on the last one we got the strawberry cough okay [Music] cheers dude what was that that thing did not stop i don't know if it was just in my head but i think i counted more than 10 seconds but i was literally power lunging it i had no more air in my lungs i promise you that was more than 10 seconds either way we killed it it actually tasted pretty good i i did taste strawberry again didn't taste too much stuff because i was dying but for the most part that was just a hitter bro seven blinkers in a row guys i'm gone look at my eyes i can't believe this so we're gonna go ahead and edit this out here we actually did the challenge all flavors were phenomenal i if you guys enjoyed today's video do me a favor leave a big like it helps push out to the algorithm and you know comment i try to respond to everybody if you guys have any questions let me know and last but not least hit that subscribe button alright i'll catch you guys on the next one"}
