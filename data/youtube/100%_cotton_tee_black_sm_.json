{"Y-Goi_A2CZo": "Today we're talking about our Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt is our standard, most\neconomical t-shirt that we offer here. It comes in a wide range of colors\nhundred-percent cotton more generous fit than a lot of the more expensive brands.\nI'd say this is our go to shirt for a lot of large events. If you're ordering for a big group go with the one hundred percent cotton. It offers so many colors, it also comes in a comparable ladies\nstyle, so you can also order a ladies style to complement the unisex. Now, more\ngenerous fit, just like I said so just, instead of telling you about it we do have our model here. He's gonna come over and you're going to see what I mean. First off,  more generous fit here, it's not going to be as tailored. There's no side seam, here a lot of the more expensive shirts. A Canvas, Next Level,  American Apparel, Alternative and so on They have a side seam here, which basically is going to be more tailored, more contoured fitting. This is going to be more generous. Also, it is a hundred percent cotton so it's not gonna have kinda that pull to it. It's gonna be more contracting. Which, you don't have to worry about shrinkage and is pretty true to size but, just with that over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, there's a chance it could shrink if you dry it on high So, with that being said this is more of\na one time use shirt or, you know, a few uses. It's not gonna be one that's gonna be your favorite for years to come. In terms of the fit here the sleeve, more generous cut. I wouldn't say it's tapered by any means it is going\nto be a little baggier. Standard length right here it goes kinda down the bicep. In terms of the neckline here, very standard collar, it's gonna be right up on the neckline. The pull of it, it's always gonna come back, it's not going to be very stretchy. It's pretty much just the\nstandard cotton. If you want to step up, we really recommend maybe the Next Level hundred percent ring-spun, the Canvas one hundred percent ring-spun or even the American Apparel those are great kind of step ups. But this shirt right here amazing bang for your buck and nobody's\ngonna complain because they get a great shirt. It's just the soft factor is not all gonna be there. So, you look great in this, Tyler. Thank\nyou so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "2jwkXLlyJvQ": "[Music] please like comment share and subscribe [Music] hey now it's your girl shanita nicole and welcome to do dream one if you're new and if you are already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back okay y'all i'm geek today i'm excited today i am going to be using this poly acrylic i'm going to be using this some good old h2o and i'm going to be sublimating on a hundred percent cotton shirt so i'm gonna do two i'm gonna do gold because i'm feeling bold and i'm gonna do white you see this white so these are just your classic gildings i don't know about this when it's a heavy cotton these are classic guildens 100 gildan excuse me 100 cotton shirts both of them are 100 percent content now both 100 content and we're just gonna see and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you the image that i'm gonna use but i'm excited so what we're gonna do is we're going to use um this is spray bottle i got from the dollar store gonna use eight ounces of water and we're gonna use two tablespoons of this poly acrylic okay so the finish i'm doing is clear satin they have matte they have a bunch of different ones but this is the one i'm using so we gonna see how this one go okay okay so this is the image that i'm going to be using and now i just want to see how i want it on the shirt um the shirt is gonna be a medium shirt i typically really wear i could wear a medium large or extra large depending on how i want the shirt to fit i just grabbed a medium that was the first one i chose so i'm trying to figure out i think i'm going to duplicate it just in case i mess up i'll have the original copy right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to stretch it out a little bit i'ma see if i could do it because i like the page flip this way but i'm gonna see if i could stretch the image out a little bit just so i can wear it the way i want okay so right now we're just playing with the size so that's something you always want to be sure of when you're creating things how it's going to look on the shirt so remember the area that i spray you want to make sure you can actually see the image right so i'm letting it air dry then i'm probably going to just blow dry it to make sure it's all the way dry and soft and not like hard because if it air dry it'll probably be hard so i could throw it in dryer or blow dry it whatever i'll probably just blow dry because i don't feel like going down there so i mean i'm just keeping it real y'all know that's what i do so i'll make sure that i have enough of the image um so it can be this way yes i'm just doing like this now a few things this neon which i'll talk about later when i print it out it's not going to be neon because i don't have neon ink sublimation ink they do have it i just don't have any so it's going to that green is not it's probably gonna come out looking like this down here green okay so i do know that so i want the colors to pop but i know neon won't show because i don't have the colors to mix to make that so it'll be a different variation of it so i'm going to go ahead and send this to my epson workforce 7720 um and i'm going to do two of them because remember i'm doing it um i'm a print twice because i'm doing it on my um the gold shirt too just because i got to be fancy i don't know i just said i wanted to try it just to see how it would stick on that one too so we are going to y'all know i have presets already my popping colors i'm doing this in cassette 2 because that's where my larger paper is i'm printing two copies and yeah so that's the image we're gonna print it out i'm gonna come back once it's printed out and dry and we gonna get this thing popping ten all right stay tuned okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put one tablespoon in first then i'm going to put the eight ounces of water then i'm going to put the second tablespoon okay then i'm going to close it up and ignore that that's just my makeup and then i'm going to make sure it's closed and i'm going to shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it and that's literally all you have to do make sure this is closed clean everything up shake it up a little bit and that's that ready to go okay y'all so guess what i have put my um shirt up under the heater sounds like maybe while i'm recording the um other portion that it'll help dry a little bit it completely dry so if this will completely dry now i will say it's not soft like if i put in a dryer like i literally can feel where the poly is which actually is a good thing because now i know where i can lay my image so my first picture came out this is the asap paper today this is what we'll be using is asap today and this is the image it came out so good look at that that looks amazing right so and actually that neon remember i said it was ago it looked a little bit yeah so show me so anywho this image came out looking so good this is uh so i'm going to um dry the yellow shirt but we might as well go ahead and do this so let's do this one first so i'm about to go ahead and do it it's on 400 degrees 60 seconds if you missed it you can rewind it but i have poly acrylic i put two tablespoons um and eight ounces of water here i was safe i had my gloves so the shirt is dry it's completely completely dry this is that can you hear this so you can hear it so it's completely dry i'm going to go ahead and um uh put it under heat press for a couple seconds i'm so excited y'all then i'm gonna do it and see how it turned out then we still gonna do the gold one but we gonna do this one since we're here so let me go ahead and set this up and move in move you guys in closer all right y'all let's see how this turned out this is my first oh snaps oh my goodness oh my goodness now i just threw it on there y'all saw that look oh yo i'm so good look at that and this is 100 cotton shut the noise oh my god are so good oh mine turned out so good look at this y'all stop playing with me shut up this this image i just found on google too i literally just found this on google okay so let's rewind what i did yo i'm tsugi okay let's rewind [Music] poly acrylic mine was clean satin i got this from lowe's eight ounces of water two tablespoons of poly acrylic and then i put this under the heat press so i actually laid it up under the heat press while i was doing the other portion i think it was like maybe six minutes not even 10 i don't think it dried it completely and then y'all i'm sorry i have my sucker y'all know i always be whatever and then look at this so i'm gonna do a wash test i'm not gonna do it today but i'm gonna do a wash test so we can see what happens but we gonna do that gold but baby we gotta just let's take a minute to just admire this real quick i might put this on today so it was a success if you want to do this for just like a day for an event let's say you're doing a walk let's say you have something you want to use um as far as being toxic i did hear that because it's only two tablespoons and diluted in eight ounces of water and then we shake it up it's not a whole lot of the poly acrylic that's in here it's diluted with eight ounces of water right so it's two tablespoons eight ounces of water we shake it up so it's not like it's really harsh or toxic um do this on your own wrist i don't have anything you know i'm not a dermatologist or a doctor or anything like that so i'm not saying that you would do it i feel comfortable enough to do it for myself so you don't try this at home that's my disclaimer but for me because i didn't use that much i would feel comfortable putting it on myself even if i just had a undershirt or something on under here to make myself feel better but yeah so we gonna try this gold out so i'll be back oh why the gold is getting dry real quick guess what it's not hard no more so it feel it make a little bit it's not hard like how it was i don't know if the heat did something to it but it feels feels good it's not like crisp or crunchy or anything like that y'all okay we're gonna let that finish dry i'll be back all right i'm back yes i'm getting yes i did put it on excuse i got some makeup on there so excuse that that's just the makeup but 100 cotton size medium image from google shout out to whoever was the artist makeup by me messing up my list whatever so now we're just going to see this this might be a fail let's just prepare ourselves this one might not work but it's okay because this one did okay so we're just gonna see all right and you do want to put um butcher paper in the middle of it i ain't doing it for right for right now because i'm just not but you do want to put so anytime you sublimate you want to put butcher paper in between the images on top of it to protect everything this just for the for myself my i'm not doing it right now um i just ordered some more butcher paper actually from amazon and it just came in the mail today so we're preserving the butcher paper this is gonna be mine too so that's not 100 perfect it's fine does this just flow on me okay so recap while we wait for these 60 seconds um two tablespoons of poly acrylic two tablespoons poly acrylic mine was um clear satin i don't know if that matters or not that's what mine was eight ounces of water our gloves to be safe shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it spray it dry it i put that under the heat press it dry it dried the whole thing in less than 10 minutes but you can put it in your dryer you can use a blow dryer you could um use a fan hey whatever you air dry it whatever works for you i put it under my heat press though and um cosmos ink guild and shirts 100 cotton yeah i'm so excited y'all i'm like literally hyped over this that was 60 seconds let's see you see that's why i use that butcher paper you see that that's why you use the butcher paper okay and like i thought the gold shirt is different it went but the colors because it's gold it did it the black work but because all those other colors on the go it didn't it didn't go but now you know so people i can't do it on dark because i went in my group real quick i went live in my group request while i was waiting and um can you do it on dark so i'll tell them how it turned out for darker but y'all know what it is and that's but

side-by-side photo of these\nthree tees. Which one is the softest? This one is $1.50 this one is $2.50 and this one\nis about $3.00. How could you ever tell without touching and feeling\nthem? The softness of a shirt has everything to do with the little details\nthat improve the quality of the fabric. In this video we're gonna explain the\ndifferences between the different grades of cotton. What's the difference between\ncarded open end, ring-spun and airlume combed and ring-spun anyway? We're about to\nexplain why the type of cotton matters and which kind to look for in this\nepisode of our series Us vs. Them. If you like this series so far go on and\nhit that subscribe button. Let's start with the worst type of cotton. It's\ncalled Carded Open End or COE for short. This type of cotton is super cheap,\nmaking it the cotton of choice for the one to two dollar tees of the world.\nIt's scratchy, heavy, stiff... kind of feels like the love child of a burlap sack and\na T-shirt. Now let's move on to ring spun. As fewer and fewer people were willing\nto settle for COE, manufacturers started making ring spun cotton.\nPeople often throw out the label ring spun and combed and ring spun\ninterchangeably, but these types of cotton are not the same. When cotton is\npicked there are a lot of impurities in its raw form. It's a plant so you have\nsoil and plant matter and it's just all-around dirty. If cotton is ring\nsponge but not combed and ring spun it means that all those impurities are spun\nup into the yarn. Whereas with combed and ring spun cotton\nthe raw cotton goes through a refining process to get rid of those impurities.\nWhat ends up happening is you lose a lot of the original cotton, resulting in a\nsmaller yield and costing manufacturers. But in the end you get a much better\nproduct. For you visual learners, just compare this photo (which is like ring\nspun cotton) to this photo (which is like combed and\nring-spun cotton). If cotton isn't combed it results in a tee that is hardly soft\nand a print surface that's less than optimal. Wondering where airlume cotton\nfits in this mix?At Bella+Canvas we go a step further with our airlume cotton to\nachieve something even more premium than combed and ring-spun cotton. First, we comb\nout 25% of the cotton we start with because we have super high standards for\nwhat constitutes as clean cotton. With most combed cotton only a small\npercentage of the impurities are actually removed. Then using only the\nlongest staples of cotton we spin yarn that has less stray fibers resulting\nin the smoothest print surface possible. Bottom line there's no cotton that's as\nsoft as our signature airlume combed and ring spun. So next time you're\ndeciding between a few tees make sure to pay attention to the type of cotton and\nmake sure it's airlume, the most premium blend of combed and ring-spun. It's just\nanother thing that separates Us from Them. Next week in this series we're\ngonna unravel the mystery of why your shirts are shrinking and let you in on\nthe secret as to why ours don't.

sublimation onto and put it onto a dark colored shirt or light-colored shirt picked it up from tank by customs we just doing it on box and check it out we're gonna do press it on the t-shirt just to see how it works out see if it actually works sticks and if you haven't already like comment subscribe man I see Paris I see y'all in a second so cotton swabs cotton sublimation transfer material pick this up from tag bar customs what it is Oh smart invoice was uh $33.80 410 cotton side sheets so there's a good price listening there chance she's 33 or a 30 she's 1996 50 sheets for 137 81 so he's supposed to be able to serve on this and the other sub on cotton dark 11 only ordered the team's just to see how it's going to work out I'm not even sure what it is let's see exactly okay so it's a sublimation material so polyester feeling tell it all so this paper says this revolutionary technology now allows printing directly unto cotton material great for both light and dark colors with the supersoft field to the touch application directions pre-press the garment which a professional-grade heat press for five to eight seconds and to eliminate wrinkles and moisture step 2 place the cotton sub with the rough side down on top of the garment okay so yes definitely this is the rough side so you will place that down step three mirror print a design on sublimation paper if using step four if using a colored shirt make sure your design completely covers the cotton sub or goes a little outside of the material so no white is visible after application if using a white shirt make sure your design says inside the material to eliminate ghosting put the printed sublimation paper over the cotton sub press at 375 at 385 degree for 60 seconds any temperature peel is fine if using that he sub sublimation paper a delay peel is best wait at least 24 hours before washing turn inside out when you laundry for longer-lasting best results hand wash inside out after application do not iron on top of the cotton Sun directly and heat wool from solid I got my glasses on reactivate the ink if you need to press it do it inside as out as well if iron it on top of the material put parchment butcher or regular paper on top of the cotton sub and hiring as needed we're gonna have to get us a Tesla [Music] just wanna measure this out see how big it is so the size is 16 and a half by eleven and a half whether we go with it so I said the rough side damn and you can clearly clearly feel it what size smaller size rock so I'll just cut more straight down a middle just to see how it goes y'all know is going to work out but this is just a print but it don't work right but for the sake of practice and so I say that do we 85 for 60 seconds see what I do it works stretching it's not too bad you can really tell is just a piece on top of it it's kind so pick that up at our tech by customs yeah that's not too bad get it down get the right print going stuff yeah homework it's right there man it's not too bad pulling on his stress tone and look like it's gonna stick you know we're gonna see how I do I didn't use the best print I was a print I messed up on because the one I actually printed out was too small so I just had that one a print that came out back but anyway we just put it down and actually sub down there the material actually he pressed onto the shirt so that I got it from tagged by customs check them out I got 10 of those for $33 per day like coming subscribed man see parents $12 per LM go", "LI3GpG3STDk": "hello everybody my name is Jennifer maker tonight we are talking about infusible inks and what kinds of t-shirts so what kind of fiber content and what colors we can put them on I'm the great maker show and tell so ever since crickets and fusible links came out folks have been asking me what we can put them at now Cricut has a lot of official blanks they have t-shirts and they have tote bags and they have coasters but what if you are a different size than the t-shirts that are available because this the sizes I believe are small to 2x so what if you're a larger size or what if you like a different style of t-shirt but what if you want a different color or a whole lot of different things what if we don't want 95% polyester and you want in 5% spandex which is what the Cricut shirts are what if you need a little bit more cotton content right so tonight we are going to look at over 15 it's actually 19 different t-shirts that I have already tested and already washed so we're going to look at them we're going to look at them in some cases we're gonna be able to see what they look like before they're washed but we'll be able to compare what they look like after they've been washed so you can see how they held up and how they look in the first place and everything like that now if you have questions please feel free to shut your question now and I will do my best to answer it my team is here thank you guys so much for being here and we'll help out with questions to the best of their ability and I actually have a blog post that has links to the t-shirts that I found on Amazon and actually it's a list of all the shirts that we're testing tonight it's over on my blog at jennifermcguireink.com I tested and then show you what they look like before we wash them and after we wash them so let's head on over to my workspace and I can explain what I have done for you and also I can love them to check the screen and look for questions as well all right so let's head on over there and take a look okay so here is my stack of white t-shirts there's quite a few of them here they've all I have already put them put the image on I have used the exact same image and every single one so we can compare and look at the color transfer and everything I picked this rainbow transfer sheet that comes in this is the Shaylee infusible ink box so it's this one right here and I put this wing tart on every single one of these 19 shirts to show you and so this one here at the top this is the cricket shirt this is the one that is sold at Michael stores right now exclusively it's at Michael's stores and this is the one that Cricut guarantees that they're a fusible links will work on but as you can see there's a lot more shirts here that I tested with so we're gonna find out what else works especially in terms of the fiber content for these because these are all white which is like really the perfect color to use in fusible links on because in fusible links are not like vinyl where it just sits right on top of the surface it is instead an ink it's a kind of sublimation ink that actually infuses into the surface of the t-shirt so there's nothing here it just feels like t-shirt so it's really very awesome if you're not familiar with in fusible ink technology I have lots of videos I have an ultimate guide to it we did we've done several play tests on how this works in fact here's the quick little preview of me creating all 19 of these t-shirts using my Cricut ez press 2 and infusible ink now this is sped up a lot as you can imagine but you can see here how I am putting the in fusible ink transfer which is the heart with the wings that I created on my Cricut onto my t-shirt know that I'm using the paper underneath to protect my mat as well as two sheets to put your paper on top of my shirt to protect from scorching and that thing it's also important to note that I am preheating each of these shirts before I put my design at I am using crickets instructions so we are heating me my ez press is at three hundred and eighty five degrees Fahrenheit and I'm doing it pressing for forty seconds but do exactly what the Cricut ez press guide tells us to do now of course it doesn't know that I'm using all these different kinds of shirts so I'm simply following the same directions for all of the shirts so all the shirts are three hundred eighty five degrees for 40 seconds I also want to note that normally you want to wait before you remove at the transfer for the shirt you want to wait till it cools down I edited this video so you weren't just watching nothing while it I wait for it to cool down so it's just important again if you're not familiar with how to use infeasible ink please check out my tutorials I had a great tutorial on how to do t-shirts that shows you step-by-step exactly what to do and then putting that link for you right here on the screen so you can head on over there and check it out now let's look at each t-shirt that I tested with Cricut infeasible ink up close this is the cricut shirts this is what we're gonna compare everything to so this is the one that guaranteed that cricut guarantees will work with it's in fusible ink transfer sheets and markers okay so let's compare how this looks to the what it looks like before it was washed so we move that over there we go okay so here we go on the left you can see the pre-washed version and on the right you can see it washed and you can see it looks identical there's no difference at all okay next shirt so this is the one that hopefully everything will look as good as this this is I mean this is our goal it's not going to happen guys but this is what we would like okay now remember infusible ink really needs polyester or polymer to bind to and that's why it's so important what our shirt content is all right so here is 100% poly sir this is what look like before we washed it and this is what looks like after it looks the same to me and this is a shirt that I found on Amazon it is kind of feels like an athletic shirt it's sort of shiny rather than being soft right but it takes the infusible ink really really well and there's a link to that if you want to find this shirt there's a link to this in my blog and then my blog post okay so next one so this is the 92 percent polyester 8% spandex still looks the same to me 92% polyester is really really a high current polyester so this looks good so again the one on the left is the pre-wash and this one is after it's been washed okay so this looks great this shirt is a No Boundaries shirt and I got it from Walmart for I don't know like five bucks or something very inexpensive okay next shirt is 90% polyester so and this one didn't quite like something happens I've seen this happen once in a while and I haven't figured out what it is it's possible that it's just not a good shirt to start with I don't know so this is a Tara and Skye's shirt that I also found at Walmart 90% polyester 10% spandex and it's the color looks the same to me as I did before I washed it I don't see any difference in color just we have this kind of faded spot here again I don't know if it's because of the quality of the shirt which is certainly possible or if it's just a user error alright next shirt so this is an eighty percent polyester twenty percent cotton and now I think that we can see just a tiny little bit of fading maybe maybe I'm just seeing things they actually look really similar to me so this is a Fruit of the Loom shirt and it came like a pack for it was really affordable I got this on Amazon I believe and I had the link to this one in my blog post and but it looks really now the only thing that I see like looking at it with my naked eye which you guys might not be able to see like I I don't know it does look a little bit so tell me a bit faded you can see the fibers of the cotton kind of peeking through but it's not bad or anything it's it's not bad alright next shirt is a 65% polyester 30 percent cotton George brand and this comes from Walmart and I think it looks really similar to the one that we just saw just a little bit of fading not so vibrant and let's just to compare it let's get out the cricket one over here so you can see so this here is the cricket one you see that you see how it is a little bit more vibrant know if you see that right it's definitely the green and the yellow they're all popping just a little bit more but that bad and these shirts are really inexpensive now I want to note that the Georgia actually has two different polyester cotton blends one has a lot of polyester and one has a lot of Cotton's so you'll want to check the label and don't just assume if you go to Walmart looking for George that you got the right one okay so this is the 65 polyester 30 percent cotton alright so this here is now I can you guys can definitely see a difference here right so this is the 40% polyester 60% cotton George brands this is also from Walmart and there these are like based I found them really close to each other and they're like in the men's section by the way I didn't really find any of these in the women's section but but I think this is a v-neck yeah this is a v-neck so I mean it still looks like a nice shirt but you can see that fading here right you can see that that it's just sort of more washed out right now note that how it looked when you first did it and how it looks now right so thing is is that even though it looks really good when you first make it if you're putting it on something that isn't able where the inks not able to bind with it you're gonna get this fading okay maybe you're okay with that but this is after one wash I don't know how it's going to look in Ted and washes or 50 washes it could get really light okay so keep that in mind and let's look at the last one which is 100% cotton so this is a huge difference I mean this is like pastel now so this is a hundred percent cotton now on the Left we can see that it came and faded it started to faded right which it kind of looks nice it has a like a retro look right it's totally cool but this is after one wash okay this is like super pastel now this is almost like something a baby might wear but the thing is is that after I feel really confident that after a few washes we're barely gonna be able to say this it's just gonna look like a mistake at that point so 100% cotton is not going to be a good choice to use with an fusible ink even though it might look okay when you first put it on after washing it it's just going to be a disappointment I really recommend that you pay attention to your polyester cap the higher you go up the more vibrant it gets and the longer it's going to last when you wash it right I mean look these look really awesome I mean this one I have no okay it's amazing I mean look at how that look that good in fact let's just compare this one to the cotton I mean look at the difference here guys that is a huge difference this is they're both have been washed exactly the same they were washed together so big big difference the more polyester you have the better it's going to look so hopefully that helps you guys and of course you can see that there's a lot of different shirts because the thing is is that I know that the cricket shirts aren't going to work for everybody they don't come in all the sizes they don't even have they don't even have sizes for like kids right now they just have the small through 2x in the women's and the men's and at my Michaels I couldn't even find it to X's so if you can find them I mean I think these shirts are the cricket shirts are really really amazing because they're stupid they don't even feel like polyester this one feels like pilot this one here this would definitely feels like polyester this their cricket shirts don't they're very soft there's something about the way that they're woven and the type of fibers that they're using it's making a difference so if the cricket shirt is available in your size and style get that and if it's not then use one of these alternatives okay alright so do you guys have any questions about these various white shirts before I switch over to the colored shirts because I did all of those and I would love it to show you those ginger says can we use 100% polyester yes totally this is 100% polyester this is right here it looks amazing it looks great it will work I believe it's going to work just as well as the cricket shirts too and really add just a little bit looks amazing it's very vibrant Peggy says I have a 100% polyester sheet that's too big for my bed I'm gonna have fun playing and you know something Peggy that's a great idea I thought about going to the fabric store and just getting a bunch of fabric in different sizes to test but I wanted to be able to show you actual t-shirts that you could purchase like whatever store because I know that you guys are looking for t-shirts alright so I think that OH Alex asks where is a hundred percent polyester shirt from this comes from Amazon this is the Hanes cool dry and this is a woman's shirt but they have them in this woman's v-neck so it's really nice fitted shirt but they also have them in men's and stuff I really like this this I've gotten this brand several times it is polyester it's like it has very very smooth rather than soft finish but hey maybe that's okay with you okay cool all right let's move on to the colored shirts here is the stack of colored shirts I got a whole bunch of colors now you'll note that they're mostly pastel because this is eight it's not vinyl it's ink and it's transparent ink it's not going to look good on like a navy blue shirt and we're gonna talk about that later don't worry it's going to look if you're gonna put it on to a colored shirt because you don't like white or whatever it's gonna look best on these light pastel colors okay otherwise it's just not going to be visible because it's transparent ink alright so we're gonna start with them 100% polyester shirt this is a 100% polyester shirt it's the same cool dry Hanes shirt that I showed you in the white one okay I got this from Amazon exact same shirt v-neck women's shirt can you see this white outline here this is where my piece of transfer me see if I have one that can show you so this is the fusible link transfer so you know it was on here like this so see the marking here so I've seen this show up on a number of people's shirts that they posted and I don't know why it does but it's there even after we washed it so you need to watch for this because maybe you're okay with this maybe you're not okay with this right but the color looks pretty good you can see how the blue basically is there's like no blue because it's not a blue shirt everything that's significant and also because this is transparent ink a lot of the colors are changing from what we would see and white to you know like this is supposed to be yellow but it looks green right so that's something to take into account right this should be pink and it looks like it's purple right but it transferred pretty well and it washed really well okay so this one has that box around it all right this one oh my gosh I really dislike this shirt this shirt came from Walmart and it's a very vibrant color don't wouldn't you say so I did this let's see if I can even show you I can and you know when we do in fusible ink we need to cut me to cover our mats so that the in fusible ink itself does not bleed through onto our pressing mats well look what this lovely shirt did it was it's so vibrant I washed these by the way it was so vibrant that it transferred its own ink to my pressing pad and now I will forever have to be careful this yeah so this one this is not sure that I'm gonna recommend to anybody but I found it at Walmart and it's 92 percent polyester 8% spandex and it's got this annoying box around it again from the transfer sheet I don't know what this is cause fraud by but I personally don't like it I don't like the way it looks at all so I would say this is a no-go yes yes Alex they were all pre-washed okay so here is the 80 percent polyester 20 percent cotton Athletics work shirt I found this at Walmart it was in the clearance section I don't even know if they still saw this but whatever it's like actually a tank top or a racerback shirt or something so I can't really see a white box around this one of course it's got a different texture to it actually came out really well you know it doesn't look like it faded very much maybe just the tiniest bit but not much it's pretty good and the colors are vibrant and amazingly the pink still transferred to this one I guess it was light enough I know no it's interesting but this one was actually pretty good so this one came from Walmart again so Rhonda says maybe the design can be cut closer to get rid of that scare get rid of the square and apply heat and use it beautiful heat tape yeah I think that's a possibility you would have to cut all the way through or trim around it and that might be a lot of work but here's the thing is that you'll notice that on other shirts you can't see it so it's something about I'm thinking it's something about the way this shirt is colored but I don't know for sure just taking a wild guess here this here is 65% polyester 35% cotton this is the same George brand that I showed you in the white shirts which i think is actually pretty a pretty good I think he's pretty they're really inexpensive and I don't know I think four or five dollars per shirt and they come in a lot of different sizes a lot of different sizes and different colors so I like this this has a tiny bit of fading but it's it looks really good to me still so I think this is a winner and I actually got a bunch of these so we could look at how the color transferred to these so that's the purple one and I'll slide these over see we can compare this is a blue one same exact shirt just different color so again it looks a lot better on this purple than it does on the blue the blue is definitely changing the transparent ink in a different way and that's significant if you are you know what color you're trying to decide I actually this isn't pink this is purple I don't know what color I said this is purple just that's clear and this is like a light blue the George brand is from Walmart and again it's important to note that they come in different they have some that have more polyester and some that have more cotton you want the ones with more polyester it really is going to make a difference here is another one and this is a it's kind of a orange a pink color I guess salmon we would call it call that and it looks you know I can see fading here it might be hard to see in the camera I'm looking at it from a different angle and I can kind of see it like at a 45 degree angle so I could see the fibers of the cotton shirt better still looks really good though I think that looks really good I think this is actually a good shirt so after testing it what six times I think I tested it six times okay so here so this here is a totally different shirt this is a Gildan shirt that I found I believe at Michaels maybe it was at Joanne's it was at one of the craft stores and it's 50% polyester and 50% cotton and it's blue so the design didn't transfer as well as it might have done in a lighter color a more Pinker color but it did transfer pretty well hard to say how long and I'll contain a hold up in the wash but it looks pretty good right now all right so here is the George brand that is less cotton less re less polyester and more cotton and while this looks this design it looks pretty good because this is such a light color it's pretty faded I don't know if I have one I could compare we can compare it to this pink one over here set these aside so here is this is a 80% cotton sorry 80% polyester and this one here is the 40% polyester and you can see that this is quite a bit more vibrant than this right so you know I mean but maybe you're ok with it maybe you're ok wearing your shirt for a few times and it's not that big of a deal maybe it's a special occasion shirt right I mean there's always possibilities here nothing is ever really you know if you really really like cotton more you know just wear your shirt a little less or you use it as a save it so this is I think this is actually still pretty I think it's gonna fade a lot more as you wash it though just so you know all right and let's look at 100% cotton that's been washed it looked a little better when we put it put it out initially this is what it looks like when it's been washed you can't even see the color at this point it's just kind of like some green and some brownish colors and I think that if we wash this like five five more times I bet it would be just barely a shadow something that was here once ginger says a solid and fusible ink would probably look good on the Gildan blue shirt you know so they're all they all of the in fusible links they're all transparent so if we had used purple it would look like this right if we had used green it would look like this so you can't this is actually sorry this is pink that purple sorry right so this is orange this is pink this is like red this is purple here and this is blue so you know I mean it's still going to take on the color underneath it so remember our color wheel and when we mix colors we're going to get these we're going to get a different color than what you expect when you put it onto something that's got the base color is this dark so keep that in mind okay alright so let's see yes so someone mentioned the black shirt so we're gonna talk about that because of course we tested a black shirt guys I said I would here is our black shirt mm-hmm and yes I put in fusible in cactus when I move this so this is got the design let's see if we can see this at all it has been washed you can kind of see right yeah the guys probably can't see that but I can kind of see a rectangle there gosh it's not even focusing it's like just black let's put this back on and give it something to focus on there truly is feasible in care we show you about where it went it's probably right about I'm gonna match it up to this rectangle it looks like it was right about here okay this is where I put it the thing is though infeasible and gets transparent so what happens when you put transparent anything I'm black we get this we get nothing this is what it looks like just don't even bother don't do this because it's a waste of your infusible ink it's not it's there literally is infeasible in canvas but because it's transparent you cannot see it okay but if anyone saw my preview image then you saw that I did have something on a black shirt okay and by the way this if you're curious this is a George shirt with 40% polyester okay alright so let's flip this shirt over so I can show you now I tried some different things first off I tried white flocking vinyl that I got it's like a so you can find that yes here it is I tried Caeser strip flock Pro HTV just I don't know just for the heck of it just see what would happen and I put the white on first and then after the white was away I applied it normally but you would normally apply heat transfer and then over the top of the white I put my infusible ink and as you can see it did indeed transfer right it's not go in the dark now but it did transfer and this has been washed it's still there guys it is still there so that was my first test to see if we get this in fusible ink on a black shirt now you might be wondering why on earth would anybody care just use vinyl and I agree you probably just wanted you to find out but if you just love the use the feeding patterns you just really want to put this on a shirt of your choice then these are our options so this is using the strip flock Pro HDTV that I found this at Michael's by the way I think there's actually a better product I think it's called sub flock and I think it's actually better at absorbing the sublimation ink so I haven't I don't have my hands on it yet but I have heard about it okay so this is um flocking HDTV but then Miranda who is my Miranda is my customer service angel she said that she saw i'm youtube that people were using glitter a heat transfer vinyl so i got some of that and this is what happened so this is white glitter heat transfer vinyl Julie says that I spray that know that this this is heat transfer vinyl this is vinyl so is this these are both vinyl and they come white like this so here is the white glitter and here is the the flock the flocking is like super like soft stuff right from like this seven days right you know the wallpaper that kind of [ __ ] so this started as white glitter heat transfer and I cut out my heart in the same mean of the same heart and I put it on to the black shirt in the normal way that you put on heat transfer nothing special and then I took my my infusible ink transfer and I put it right on top of the white glitter heat transfer and I did I follow the normal directions for pressing it so I believe I did this at 385 degrees for 40 seconds which is what I did all of these shirts at by the way and this is what I got and doesn't this look amazing so this has been washed and it still looks to me as good as it did when I put it on it did not fade it on this one faded this one did not fade this one looks really really good I think that this white so if you really just really want to put invisible eight onto a black or navy blue or a dark purple shirt then this is what you should do put some white glitter heat transfer vinyl and by the way this is the cricket brand this is um we just got bought this down at our Joanne's that's five minutes from a house I actually said Greg a prank I need some white glitter heat transfer vinyl he's like okay he did it for me thank you Greg and then I put this on here and it worked so this is not my original idea I think that this existed long before we had infeasible ink because I bleach I went and looked it up on YouTube and people have been putting doing this for sublimation ink for years okay so this is not I'm not taking credit for this idea but thank you Miranda for letting me know about this so yeah so if you really want to use a dark shirt Becky says did the glitter show through yeah you can tell it's very pretty actually let me show you I said we can get this closer and then light here can you guys see the glitter see isn't that pretty I think it's really pretty is it really the glitter actually makes the colors pop a little bit more so and someone had concerns that it would wash right out but didn't for me the flocking did but not this this looks great so there we go alright so I'm gonna switch back over to me and I'm gonna see if you guys have questions okay alright awesome so let's see so Stephanie says I just joined this live stream and I've tried the infusible in kind of mint green shirt and it came out beautiful awesome I'm super glad to hear that I've been seeing a lot of people using pastel shirts that looks great remember the key is the higher the polyester count the better is going to look and one thing I want to note as we move down from into the higher cotton shirts I noticed more scorching going on the cotton does not like that super high temperatures at the at the links that we need to go to for in fusible ink and when I did the 100% cotton shirt I saw weird brown marks show up on my shirt and I want to see if they came out in the wash okay so this is a hundred percent cotton shirt you know doesn't really I don't really see looks like a lot of it might have washed out it doesn't look too maybe just a little bit I can kind of see on the sides just a tiny little bit if I wasn't looking for this I wouldn't be able to see any scorching so it actually would have the discoloration did come out when we washed it that's good so if you're seeing discoloration in your cotton shirts which probably shouldn't be using guys but if you want to use them anyways try washing them to see if you can get that out just keep that in mind so if it scorches it's too cotton just doesn't like it that hot for that lot Lutie says do you think it would work better on cotton with the glitter first yep yep if you really want to use have a hundred percent cotton shirt in but you really want a fusible ink because you love those patterns put that white glitter HTV on the shirt and then put your fusible link transfer on it one tip I have for that is I noticed that as we heat the fusible entry four sheets they shrink just a little bit so if you tape it down in the exact spot you want it to go your shirt kind of been shrinks along with it instead of it shrinking without the shirt and then it looks at mal matches up better and it stays in position better so definitely use the cricket heat transfer tape when you are putting the in fusible ink transfers on top of the white glitter htb yes I washed all of these shirts first because we don't want to worry about whether we have sizing in them or anything like that just it's so they're you know there's kind of like differing opinions about whether you should wash them first cricket by the way doesn't say that we need to wash these first for infusible ink so don't think that matters but you know it helps with like shrinking and stuff the only time that you might not want to wash a shirt forces if you're playing to sell it because it never looks new after you washed it right so instead of get ones that are pre sized you know so they're already black preshrunk and then but don't wash them and then you know it looks better that's what I hear at least I don't sell my shirts or anything like that necie says is there an easy way to weed the invisible ink I think it's actually really easy to weed I did all of these hearts and there's like Oh a lot of them superfast if you use the bend and crack method you know so you're just kind of bending it and making sure all the edges are lifting up it actually comes off really easily and if you watched my other videos you can see me actually weeding the the transfer sheets and how it's different right it's different than how we weed vinyl and I like it a lot better Vicky says does the glitter after the imputable ink feel like vinyl nope it feels like glitter it feels like um I mean just touch it again it feels you know so you know the way glitter feels it's got almost like a kind of like sandpaper II feel because it's got all the little glitter parts embedded in it that is what it feels like Janet says what time and temperature did you use for these shirts I used that I used crickets easy press heat guide for all of four bases you know I used it for cricket shirts so only when it gives me a time for so I use the exact same time and temperature for all of them which was three hundred eighty five degrees am i easy press two for forty seconds you could also have done your easy press one at what would it be three hundred and sixty degrees because it's the highest it goes up so probably a little longer I just don't happen to know what that is but Cricut has an excellent heat press guide that you would just use to determine what that would be thank you Joe I'm really happy that you like my testing I'm checking for more questions to see if you guys have any more questions before I wrap up tonight this is a great time to throw them out there for us Lori says what do you do with a different heat settings for vinyl and then infuse oblique so I simply followed the heat transfer settings for vinyl and once it was in place I let it cool a little bit so you know it was more you know wasn't like still you know in fact you have to wait until the glitter is cool to even pull off the backing anyways and when I put I didn't had no issues it worked I simply used the same settings for them fusible ink that I use for all the other shirts when I put it on top of the glitter so I didn't even worry about it because it was a test right it was okay to try it and if it didn't work then oh well we just try it again so but it worked so I used the normal settings for glitter heat transfer vinyl and then I use the normal settings for infeasible ink on top of that white glitter Megan says do we use the butcher paper so I made a lot of t-shirts I did not use two sheets of butcher paper for brand new sheets of butcher paper for each of these shirts so I found that my butcher paper wasn't transferring nothing was getting transferred to it I was having no issues and I I think I only ended up using like four sheets for all of these shirts so I reused it I always checked it to make sure that I didn't see any anything being transferred to it that would then transfer to one of my new shirts but it didn't so it was fine Ginetta says I was hoping it would test depends my experience there's no difference between how the pens and a transfer sheets go on to materials if you are curious about how the pens I have a whole video on that right so you can just watch that video but I've seen no difference and how they transfer they transfer the same it's the same ink it's just ones coming out of the pen and ones on a transfer sheet but it looks the same once we transfer it it acts we transfer it the same way it looks the same so it wasn't necessary to do all of the testing Gina asked if the white transfer the white glitter was stiff like final yes it is because it's white it's white but it's white glitter vinyl that's there the white cleared of metal doesn't go away so it has that same it's not super stiff but there's definitely something there it's not like the awesomeness that is in fusible ink where it's totally weightless right you still it feels like vinyl with that's been colored that's basically what while we're doing here all right let me just get that at the bottom let's see someone mentioned parchment paper no do not use parchment paper parchment paper has a coating on it what your paper does not if you use parchment paper or wax paper you can transfer that coating to your shirt I have seen it done and it looks bad don't do it guys don't waste your shirts use butcher paper you can get it on Amazon very inexpensively I have a giant roll of it let me show ya I will put a menu remember my team can put the link this is my big roll of butcher paper it's gonna last a really really long time it was really inexpensive you can get it pretty sure her people say they got theirs at Walmart or their local grocery store but you want white butcher paper don't substitute in this case it's going to be a disappointment it's not freezer paper either guys it's not freezer paper put your paper freezer paper has a coating at it in fact the most famous one has a plastic coating on it you do not want to transfer that to your shirt what's your paper it doesn't have the coating you want that yesthank right ginger says put your paper parchment paper and freezer paper are all different it's important that you use the right one because that coating will transfer I've seen it happen okay I think I have gotten everyone's questions just double-checking Ossie says can you use a heat press yes you can I just don't have one so I use my easy press so we use an easy press Mary says where would I find the video about the Pens well I'll tell you what if you go to my youtube channel at youtube.com slash C / Jennifer maker all of my videos are there tons of them and that's where you'll find my video about the Pens as well as my video about that fusible link tote bag and the infeasibility t-shirt and infusible inks in general like I have I think I have 5 or 6 videos on a fusible links at this point yep I mean that's I think I got them all so I want to remind everybody that we're still having our summer maker giveaway so we are giving away a Cricut

use dryer sheets nope no dryer sheets because that's what the instructions say the instructions say to turn them inside out wash them and cold inside out and then tumble dry low no dryer sheets no bleach and no fabric softener and that's what we did so Mal detergent right yes Gregg says mild detergent okay I think that's it thank you everybody for being here tonight thank you for your questions

make I can show you how to make it until next time you [Music]", "ekfcK5BfEdw": "[Music] hey guys and welcome back to another video here with crafty mama if you're new welcome if you're not welcome back um before we get started please make sure you guys like share subscribe all that good stuff hit the bell so that you get notified any time that i upload i try to upload at least one to two times a week sometimes more if i have time but at bare minimum one to two times a week um what we're going to do today is we are going to try sublimating on 100 cotton that's right 100 cotton um now i know like the first cardinal rule of sublimation is you have to have polyester but somebody not sure who to give the credit to created this solution um spray solution that you spray onto your cotton shirt and it allows you to sublimate onto the cotton basically the solution that you spray onto the shirt adheres to the cotton fibers of the shirt and allows the those fibers to be able to grip the ink so that you can sublimate on the shirt um is that's the information i got from the person that i purchased the solution from um that was the description that they gave and how it actually works so this is my first time trying it out with you guys i have not tried it on any other shirt before um and i felt like this was a perfect image to do i got this from a young lady in a craft group i'm in i purchased it from her um i can't remember her name off the top of my head i'm gonna have to look at my email and um i will leave her name in the description box so if you're interested in this image you can purchase it from her um but yeah this is the image i'm going to go ahead and use um i am going to mirror this because we know a sublimation we have to mirror i already have it have it sized out i'm going to be doing a 10 by 14 and a half and this is going to be on a large shirt i believe a large fruit of the loom um white 100 cotton shirt so i'm gonna go ahead and get this printed out i'm gonna come back and show you guys how i do it and we're gonna see if it works so stick around to see if we uh get it together all right guys so i am back here um i do have my image printed out here and then i have my this is my cotton t-shirt let me show you it's a haze i'm sorry it's a fruit of the womb platinum 100 cotton t-shirt 100 cotton um so that is what i'm going to attempt to silver on today um i do already have my butcher paper inside of my shirt to prevent any bleeding um okay and then i have my solution here i just put it in a spray bottle it came in a bottle this is the bottle that it came in and i put it inside of this spray bottle it's a hair um i've been using this for like just a water bottle for a while now but i put it inside of this to you know be able to easily spray it onto my shirt and i will link in the description box the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from so you guys can check it out if you want to okay so the first thing i'm going to do because this is cotton i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do a um i'm going to let roll it and then i'm going to do a quick uh pre-press [Music] make sure my shirt is straight okay i'm gonna do a quick like 10 second um pre-press just to make sure all the moisture is um out of my shirt okay and now because my image is so big i'm just gonna place it on here i'm not gonna cut it i'm not gonna tape it or not i'm sorry i didn't even spray it gotta spray it first i'm just gonna give my solution a shake and then i'm going to spray the whole area you don't want it to be soaking wet you want it to be a little damp and then you gotta wait for it to dry so i'm gonna wait a couple minutes for this to dry and i will be right back okay so my shirt is um completely dry now um yeah it's completely dry now um so now i'm gonna take my image and like i said i'm not gonna cut it or anything because it's just a big piece of paper here i'm gonna place it on my shirt and then i'm going to cover it with some butcher paper like normal my heat press is already preheated 400 400 degrees and we're going to press this for 60 seconds so i will come back in 60 seconds all right so it has been about 60 seconds here my timer is going off i'm really hoping this works i can see the image through the paper that's always a good sign okay so it went through is definitely not as bright though i know for a fact that if i would have done this on a polyester shirt these colors would be absolutely popping and um here's the shirt and the colors are there it looks it looks pretty good okay it doesn't look bad for this to be a cotton shirt it does not look bad but i know if this was on a polyester shirt 100 polyester these colors would be absolutely like shining bright like a diamond but it's not bad it's not terrible it has a little bit of a vintage look to it i don't know if y'all can see but it did take okay so like i said this is the shirt let me show y'all the tag again it is come on camera focus a hundred percent cotton i don't know if my camera is focusing it's a hundred percent cotton shirt this was the sublimation and i'm actually pretty impressed um and because this is like a 90s throwback shirt the fact that it looks vintage doesn't bother me it kind of goes with the theme of the shirt so yeah i'm actually really impressed like i said i will put down in the description box the um the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from um i only purchased a small bottle because i wanted to try it out but i mean if this is the results i'm gonna get then i might go ahead and purchase myself a bigger bottle um but yeah i'll put the etsy shop name down in the description box it's not gonna be a blue link for you to click on it's gonna be an etsy shop name underneath the materials that i put in the description box so yeah and i got this um fruit of the loom shirt i got it from um um i got it from walmart and it's 100 cotton for the loom shirt so but i will put all of my materials down below as i always do thank you guys so much for watching questions comments concerns drop them down below make sure you hit that subscribe button all that good stuff bye",

(bell dings)\n(Sidemen cheering) - Hello, I'm Harry. I'm the youngest in the group here. But when I was very young, my dad was driving a car, and he ran over a rabbit, and it didn't fully kill it. It was like... on the road a lot. So he went, he got like something at the back of the car and put it out of its misery. And so I've seen some when I was a kid, so I'm quite mature for my age. (Sidemen laughing) - Apart from the fact you're still wearing socks and sandals. - Yeah. - Bye. (buzzer buzzes)\n(Sidemen laughing) It's not a look. - My name's Vik, and I've heard that\nTinder's a numbers game. So can I get your number? - Aww. (chuckles) (Sidemen exaggerating) Yeah, I was always really\nbad at maths in school, so I don't really\nunderstand what you said. So it's that way. - [Harry] That sounds\nlike an English problem. - My name's Ethan. I'm 24. And you're very pickup-able. - Oh no.\n- Oh - Oh God. You've been here all day, haven't you? - You're struggling, mate. - It's been a long day, yeah. It has been. Yeah. - Do you know what? Yeah. - That's pretty cool.\nI appreciate that. (upbeat drill music)", "f4I0wJsCBNc": "[Music] hello guys welcome back to miss sugi lovecraft and today um what i'm going to show you is um how you could make your own spray for sublimation on cotton shirt and what i have here i use our 20 pound paper to print my image as you can see 20 pound paper to print my image i also got from the dollar store a bottle spray bottle um this is the mini wax poly acrylic um water base got this from amazon it's the eight fluid ounce i want to say it was eleven dollars i got some water it is eight ounce which is one cup of water and i got my tablespoon measuring um spoon what i'm gonna do is i'm go i'm not gonna put it in my um my measuring cup because this is what i use in my kitchen so i won't do that i mean you'd probably have to get one just for that but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pour let's first let's see let's make sure this fits in this bottle so here we go i didn't check that first but it does fit in the bottle then i'm going to get my poly acrylic let me probably shake it up a little bit get my poly acrylic and i'm going to put two tablespoon inside here all right two tablespoon inside there gonna close it up i'm gonna shake it up this is a way you could make your own spray for sublimation to put on your cotton t-shirt shake it up well okay i'm gonna spray the shirt and i'm gonna show you and i'm gonna spray the shirt here is the shirt that i'm gonna be using it's a hundred percent cotton okay a hundred percent cotton hopefully you can see it 100 cut okay i put a piece of paper in between because i don't want to have it soak through so i'm going to spray the area so guys i had to change the spray top on this dollar store bottle and i had another spray top so i kind of cut it because you want it to have a spray effect for you to spray out and the dollar store one wasn't working so i'm going to spray the area now and the white paper underneath kind of let me gauge to where i'm gonna spray okay so i'm gonna let it dry and then i will show you once i put the put my image once again like i said i um put this on regular 20 pound paper i kind of got a little bit of the the poly acrylic on there but that doesn't matter right now we just wanted to show you that it will work so you don't have to buy thirty six dollars for four ounce bottle you could get the poly critic mini wax poly acrylic and probably a dollar store spray um bottle a tablespoon to measure and like i said a 20 pound paper so all of this saves you a whole lot of money okay so i'm gonna get this and i'm going to once it's dry we'll be right back to show you the effect so guys here is the moment of truth remember 20 pound paper um printed um with sublimation ink and i am going to put this on the shirt you could um use your heat resistant tape and tape it down so it doesn't move i'll go ahead and do that smooth it out all right so i heated up my press to 385 and i'm going to press it at 60 seconds all right guys here's the moment of truth let's see voila well of course i didn't mirror the jamaica so it's upside down but guys the fact that it came out and it came out beautiful i love it um it worked so don't laugh at me i didn't mirror image the um the print i was so excited to try this out so thank you for watching once again this is miss sugee lovecraft don't forget to like subscribe and share [Music] you", "NBj8G6pXgDE": "[Music] hey y'all welcome to my channel for those of you who are returning visitors welcome back and for those of you who are watching for the first time welcome and i hope you stick around so today we are going to be sublimating a black shirt and it's also 100 cotton okay so we know that for sublimation you need 100 polyester and you also need a light colored shirt okay so when people say that you're sublimating on black shirts or cotton shirts it's not 100 percent accurate okay so what you are actually doing is sublimating onto something else or another product and then you're literally pressing the shirt so today what we're going to be doing is we are going to sublimate onto this paper now this just looks like regular vinyl but it is actually easy subli vinyl that is made by caesar and we are going to actually print onto this paper and then we are going to press it onto the shirt okay let's get started all right y'all so now we're in illustrator and i've already designed the image that i want to place on the shirt um i simply found this apple online by doing a regular search for a an apple a teacher apple png file and it came up it was free and i simply just input um the pattern that i wanted to use inside of each letter okay so we're going to get ready to print and let's go look at our settings it looks like this is a little off there we go all right so you always just want to make sure that your print settings are accurate or onto the correct paper and this comes just with testing honestly because everybody's printer is a little bit different we're all printing from different computers different models so you do have to do a little testing um to make sure that you get the right settings for your needs i just want to go into the print settings and i'm printing on premium presentation matte and remember we are printing directly onto the easy subway paper okay and we have it's going to print high quality i am using borderless printing because my image is a little bit large and i don't want any of it to cut off and what's also important is that when you are printing directly onto the easy subli vinyl you cannot mirror your image so usually with sublimation we're always image we're all always mirroring our images but when you're printing directly onto the easy sublet paper you do not want to mirror your image and i am going to look at my color options and it's perfect so this is exactly what i want to happen okay so we are going to get ready to print are y'all so now that we are about to print our image we need to make sure that we are inputting the easy subli into our printer the correct way okay so on the easy subway there's a side that is a little bit rough it's more matte i don't know if you guys can see it pretty well there and then when you flip it over you have a shiny side okay that shiny side is just the backing okay so if you print anything on the shiny side it will not be able to go onto the shirt you have to print it on the matte side okay this side with the matte finish and you will be able to feel the difference so don't um worry okay and you can also see the shiny side has a glare so we're going to print it on this side once we print it um we are going to weed it and then we will well we're not weeding we're cutting if we were printing it on our or if we were cutting it with the print then cut setting on a cricut machine or another vinyl cutter then you'll read it but we are actually going to cut around our image okay so remember make sure that you're printing on to the matte side all right guys so we all right so we are going to just get any lint off of our shirt and we will be pressing the shirt just to loosen it up a bit to get out any moisture for about five seconds all right guys so the image is printed onto the easy subway and it is still wet so what you want to make sure that you do is just stick it let it dry or stick it under your heat press and let that heat just get onto the image for about three to four minutes two to five minutes and then you will be able to cut it out and place it onto your shirt okay so i let it bake a little bit and we are now ready to cut it out um sometimes if you do the print then cut setting you just put this in your cricut and it will cut it um but we did it this way today so i'm just going to cut it out and i love doing um teacher shirts for myself because my kids love when i wear them and when they have like positive sayings or if i say something about them they love to um see my shirts and read them and i also made it a little bit easier for me because i made the letters touch like i made everything touch so it's a little bit easier for me so it's going to be one piece so i don't have to worry about like placing it correctly or it being uneven that's kind of why i did it that way or that is why and i see some lines in my print but it's okay i'm just gonna cut this and then i will see you at the heat press so we're all done with cutting out our image and i tried to cut out as much of the white from around the image as possible because i didn't want any of the white to really show once we press it okay so on the back side remember that shiny side that i showed you before we are going to just peel that backing away okay and so i just want to try to snatch it off and just be careful it's a little delicate you want to peel you want to be a little careful you'll feel it's pretty tough but you just want to make sure that you do not rip the vinyl okay so we've removed all of the backing from our image and so we are just going to place the image onto the shirt [Music] and just like with any other image you want to make sure that you are leaving enough space at the top and it's pretty standard to have your image start at the three inch mark from the neckline okay so we are going to just measure i usually take out my measuring tape just to make sure and that's kind of low so we can bring it up a little bit so it looks like that leaf is right there at the three inch mark okay and let's make sure the sides are a little bit we'll move it over just a tad all right guys so we are going to press this onto our shirt for 15 seconds our heat press is at 315 degrees all right so you can make sure that you put your butcher paper down because you don't want this ink to go onto the top plate all right you can just peel a little bit and look how nice remember we started out it was dull um and now look how bright that apple is that's why i did the apple in a different shade of red like a little more brighter so that you can see the difference but look how nice and bright that apple is so we're all done with sublimating onto the easy sublease and then pressing it onto our shirt it looks really nice and what i like about the easy subway is that it's very light so once you peel it away from that backing it's very light you don't feel it's not as bulky as um regular heat transfer vinyl sometimes and it pretty much almost blends in with of course it's not sublimation because it's not sublimated into the shirt but when you feel it it it there's a nice feel to it okay so remember this is another way for those of you who may not want to do the glitter um backing for your heat transfer onto black shirts or dark colored shirts and or cotton shirts easy suddenly is an option for you okay so i hope you all have enjoyed this tutorial i will have the information below uh where i got the easy subleaf from and yeah definitely i would go with this method um again and again so thank you so much for watching um if you enjoyed this video you learned something new or you were inspired to try sublimating onto easy subling please be sure to like the video and also subscribe to my channel where i will continue to post crafting videos using either the cricut or sublimation thank you so much for watching [Music]", "I_hvJVGMwkU": "What's up everybody, this is M at RushOrderTees along with Dan the man behind the cam. One question we get all the time is what t-shirt should I get? That's a tough one. This is understandable because there are literally hundreds of styles out there. Maybe thousands. I don't know can somebody check that? [beep] We're gonna help you decide by subjecting some t-shirts to a series of tests. It's science. So the fabric type of a t-shirt is its most important quality. So that's what we'll be testing Luckily, we can break these fabric types into four main categories and that's what we have right here. 100% cotton. 100% polyester. We've got the 50/50 cotton poly blend and we have a tri blend which is cotton polyester and rayon. Dan, and I will be ranking the shirts for each test and giving the best one a score of four and the worst one a score of one At the end will add up all the points and let you know the overall winner It's the t-shirt test [music] [swoosh] But first let's take a closer look at these test tees. Wait, that doesn't sound.... can we edit? [beep] But first let's take a look at the t-shirts we'll be testing. All right, I'm here with Dan and our first test is all about the feels. It's the feel test. [swoosh] Now what we mean by feel is the softness, the touch, the texture. This is often called the hand. Because you feel it with your hand. So we're gonna test these shirts by feeling them. You ready? [kazoo music] All right, so after some rigorous scientific investigation, we've come to a conclusion on the feel of these shirts. What did you think Dan? Um, I was just drawn with the tri-blend for some reason, you know, it was really soft. Stretchy. Very, very soft. Definitely the softest. Yeah, so I think the try blend is the clear number one. Lightweight, alright. So that's number one, I would agree with that. Number two is a bigger conversation. It's really a hard choice, but I almost think I want to say cotton. I would say cotton. 100%. Alright, so there's our number two. I think, I think poly number three. Alright we'll give poly number three. Alright so that means 50/50 is the last one. it's gonna finish in fourth place. Get outta here! The results are in for the feel test and we have tri-blend in first place taking a lead with it's super softness. followed close by cotton in second then polyester in third and 50/50 bringing up the rear. Okay for the next test we're calling it the wear test [swoosh] And for this test, we're gonna have Dan wear the shirts. Oh, really? Yeah. Alright, let's do it. [clap] Whoa! That was fast. Okay, so this is a 100% cotton. 100% cotton. Feels pretty good. Feels like a standard shirt, nice fit. Not too heavy. Next up will be a 100% polyester. Are you ready? Yup. All right. Let's do it. [clap] Wha--how are you...? It's just....we wanna move this video along you know what I mean? Okay, so polyester... Feels very light, very airy. I can definitely tell that. Next up we have the 50/50. You ready? What are you gonna do to me this time? [clap] What the? This is backwards. Sorry about that. [clap] Ah, okay. There we go. So this is the 50/50. Honestly feels a lot like the cotton. It feels really good. I can't tell if it's lighter or not. It might be a little bit more breathable, it feels like. You like the cotton better? Yeah, honestly, this might be my favorite one so far. Okay, favorite one so far. There you have it. You ready for the next one? I mean do I--? [clap] Whoa! Wow, okay, this one feels great. Really soft. Kind of like the best of what everyone else has had to offer. It's soft enough, it's very light. So what do you think? Hm, okay, so In terms of comfortability,  I'm think going to go with tri blend number one. 50/50, number two. Cotton, number three. And polyester last. But again, that's just my opinion Some people like poly, some people like cotton more. Well, science is all about opinions, so... You're right. That's very true. So here's our scores for the wear test It's tri-blend Once again in first place with its ultra comfortable wearability. Followed by 50/50 in second place. 100% cotton in third and polyester last because Dan said so. Next up We're gonna be stretching these shirts for the stretch test So we're testing the stretchiness of the fabric. And more importantly how it holds up after being stretched it's the way the fabric behaves when we stretch it Looks good stretchy. Let's stretch it up Here's your results for the stretch test Polyester getting the win on this one with its ability to snap back into shape, followed close by try blend in second then 50/50 and third and 100% cotton with a big loss here For the next test we're getting wet It's the wet test Actually, the shirts are getting wet We're gonna time how long it takes for each of these shirts to dry off in the hot Pennsylvania sun Polyester tends to be moisture wicking. So we're gonna see how that does. I have a feeling cotton is gonna lose this one, but we'll see. Let's do it Results of the wet test are in we have polyester in first place again with an easy win followed by tri-blend in second and a surprising third-place finish for cotton and 50/50 with the agony of a wet defeat. Okay, next up. We're gonna see how wrinkle-resistant these shirts are It's the wrinkle test We're both gonna take two shirts, put them on our chair, and sit on them for the rest of the day What? So we're gonna take each shirt and we're gonna ball it up and shove it in a sandwich bag and leave it for 20 minutes And see how it comes out after that 20 minutes later All right, so we got the shirts out of the bag and and they're pretty wrinkly except for this one. clear winner is poly. It was barely even wrinkled. The next one number two would be the Tri-blend here, not too bad at all, I bet these would come out as you wore it for a couple hours 50/50, Hmm Didn't do too well. Pretty wrinkly. pretty wrinkly gonna need an iron for that sucker and then cotton, oh the most wrinkly So that's a clear Clear 1 2 3 4 on this one. Looks like a topographical map. Here's the scores for the fifth and final test of this video It's polyester with another big win. This stuff just doesn't wrinkle it's kind of weird Coming in second once again is tri-blend with 50/50 coming in third and Cotton suffering a humiliating set of wrinkles. That brings us to the halfway point of this competition Let's look at our scoreboard and check the results so far Tri-blend is in the win column with a total of 17 points followed closely by polyester in a surprise second place with 15 points Cotton and 50/50 are tied with nine points apiece, and we'll have a lot of catching up to do in In our part 2 video of the T-shirt Test We will present the final five tests The screen-printing test the DTG test the mess test the wash test and the dangerous damage test, look for that coming soon Click on the items below to get more information about them or start designing on them right now Thanks for watching.

t-shirts and that sublimation printing on cotton let's not waste any time and get right into it so the first thing you guys will use an epson double you have 7710 printer this printer can easily be converted to a sublimation printer you guys will need the sublimation ink cartridges and sublimation ink and you guys don't need sublimation paper make sure you guys install the sublimation ink cartridges this is not gonna work on regular ink we're gonna go on a website called gypsy shirts and by our 100% cotton t-shirts here you'll need sublimation spray this is basically liquid polyester you can get these cheap on etsy so the first thing to do is mirror image with image image rotation click horizontally and they're gonna print image so the good thing about this printer is that it can fit 11 by 17 paper this is a large paper and is the perfect size to make t-shirts so when the sublimation paper is printed on the colors are not gonna be bright don't worry about this when this transfer onto the shirt is only perfect so the first thing we're gonna do is preheat the shirt after that's done we're gonna spray the show with the sublimation spray I'm gonna let it dry for around 20 minutes make sure you guys spray the entire area where the image is and if you transfer also don't worry about spraying outside of that area anything that sprayed outside is now going to be visible when the shirt is done next one alignment to the t-shirt to make sure it's straight you guys can tape it if you want just make sure the tape is not go on the heat press we're gonna place the image onto the heat press we wanna put the silicone paper on the heat press and we're gonna press it at 350 degrees for no less than one a minute also make sure you guys add a decent amount of pressure will present with sublimation you guys have to press it for at least a minute because if you don't the full image is not going to be transferred and it's going to look Peyton if you want a bright vivid image you have to press for at least a minute now we're gonna move the silicon paper remove the sublimation paper and our shirt is finished take a look at how bright and perfect and vivid the shirt came out so because the shirt is seldom mated the colors will never wash out so this shirt costs around $1 80 cents to make if you guys want to slow show it's online in my opinion this is the best way to do it you guys can easily sell these for over $10 also make sure you guys have Ward the Amazon sublimation sprays these are complete garbage the image quality is gonna be horrible and also this fray when it's dried out is gonna make the image surface hard so definitely make sure you guys award these another thing you guys should avoid is these sublimation powders the whole process is super messy and the end result is garbage also it's a hustle because even though the powder is cheap you guys cannot sublimate on regular sublimation paper you will have to buy special silicone paper otherwise it's not gonna work and these silicone papers for 11 by 17 they cost around $4 per sheet so again if you guys want high-quality results use the Etsy sublimation sprays and you're good to go

channel dedicated to helping men dress better and feel their best and in this video I'm going to be reviewing Yoona clothes two people cotton t-shirts stay tuned so you know clothes - pima cotton t-shirts have a bit of reputation in the menswear community in fact any discussion around you know the best t-shirts for men is sure to include this highly regarded tee and some men swear by them while others just don't really understand the hype I bought four pairs of Yoona clothes supima cotton tees and so you know you kind of know where I stand in that camp but we got grey we got heather gray white and navy even with all the high praise nothing is perfect and so let's dive right in with this Uniqlo supima cotton tea review in this review i'm going to cover the t-shirts of style and fit shirt quality comfort and durability how well they've held up over several years of wear you know the pros and cons and as always if you want a deeper dive head on over to gentlemen within i'm gonna link that down below and then you can read more about it cuz it just showed I own four unit clothes - pima cotton tees for reference I've had the white and navy shirt for around four years now and the two grey shirts for about two years so exactly what is pima cotton well it's a type of cotton that's actually grown and sourced in the United States it represents less than 1% of cotton grown in the world and it's a unique sort of cotton due to the extra long fibers that contribute to its premium properties of strength softness and color retention the facts pima cotton is lighter and 45% stronger than regular cotton and it provides superior comfort durability and softness for the shirts style you know clothes pima tees are as clean and minimal as a shirt it's going to get it has zero branding no logos on it except for on the back tag where it's printed you know where it's made in the Uniqlo logo they come in all the basic neutrals of white gray Navy and black all in all you're going to find 14 different colorways but the wide ranging shades from olive green and yellow to red and cobalt blue there's no shortage of options to choose from here in terms of the shirts of fit you know I've said it before and I'll say it again Uniqlo the pima cotton t-shirts are some of the best of fitting t-shirts that i period they're fitted without being skin tight and have an overall clean drape the body length is spot-on hitting around mid fly and the sleeve length is also perfect landing around mid bicep the sleeves also hug my biceps just the right amount without being restricting I can't say it enough but Uniqlo supima cotton tees were actually the first t-shirt to actually fit me pretty impeccably off the rack before discovering them you know I was wearing these cheap-ass H&M tees for like $5 and the sleeves way too short and so they were always riding up and then you can see my armpit hairs and when I put them through washes the fabric just kind of got all distorted and it just did not hold up over time and so when it comes to the fit of these shirts I can't speak more highly of them some of the product details that actually comes in double x-small all the way up to triple XL and so you know there's a wide range of sizes here however they don't carry any tall sizes so if you're a really tall guy you know over six-foot some you might have some trouble with you know clothes shirts which is you know something I encountered when I was you know doing some research on forums a lot of guys on reddit some male fashion advice the taller guys were saying that the fit just you know wasn't there for the product details Uniqlo says that it's you know hundred percent supima cotton and it has a glossy Sheen with a premium feel there really is no glossy Sheen this shirt is not shiny at all however it does have a premium feel under percent supima cotton and these shirts are made in Vietnam not us which is kind of weird because supima cotton is sourced in the US so I'm not sure you know what's happening there now let's dive right in with the shirts Comfort so Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really soft and they actually get softer and softer after every wash it's a nice mid weight cotton and it is not see-through by any means you know comparatively it's not as thick as you know Banana Republic pima cotton t-shirts or ask it but it's thicker than brands like Express ever Lane and even the mountain bowed rigs t-shirts that I reviewed in you know my best t-shirts roundup in terms of where the shirts have been through dozens upon dozens of wears over the years I can tell you that they've held up supremely well they've gotten softer over time as I mentioned before and you know there are no holes in the shirts so that goes to show you that even a ten dollar t-shirt can withstand the test of time and get better over time and so price isn't always going to be a factor when it comes to finding quality comfort we're just gonna get right into the durability of the shirts had them for a couple of years now plenty of washes as I said before and the shirts have no holes in them they're not weirdly distorted or warped through many washes the shirts still have a clean drape and a nice fitted aesthetic I would say that the durability of these shirts are really good and they've held up really well over the years but it's not all perfect though and assurance actually do fake considerably over time especially the colored shirts and so my Navy shirt I would say more saturated colors are gonna fade over time with washes and dry cycles so the Navy is not as saturated as it was before that's going to knock it down a few rounds all in all though Uniqlo Supima cotton tees have proven to be immensely durable over the years where you can buy them you can shop online at Uniqlo comm or you can hop into one of their brick-and-mortar locations they have locations all across the US and so you know if you have one near you go in get fitted and see how the Uniqlo supima tees fit on your body all right so let's finish it up with some of the pros and cons for the pros best bang for your buck at 990 a shirt crafted with long-lasting high-quality supima cotton one of the best fitting t-shirts that I own period classic crew neck and v-necks in a myriad of colorways can conveniently shop online or in-store for the cons not the best for tall guys you know no long sizes and color shirts they're gonna fade quite a bit over time and it may be too sheer for some people it's not really thick material here if you have any brands that you feel are a better value you know leave some comments down below and let me know but yeah in the end Uniqlo supima cotton tees have a reputation for a reason with a price point of $10.00 and high-quality long-lasting product Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really hard to ignore and so it's definitely one of those staple pieces in my wardrobe by under $10 it's hardly an investment piece and so feel free to go crazy there with all the colorways and yeah it's all I got for this video if you liked it smash that thumbs up and if you're new here consider subscribing put out new videos like this weekly that's all I got for this video cheers to your style and I will catch you on the next one pigs", "TU5rGP10SNE": "if you're curious about the next level 3600 like this one right here then this is a video you do not want to miss [Music] in the last video we talked about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 and today in this video we're going to talk about the oh so popular next level 3600 [Music] there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from and this is the second in our shirt review video series there are a few important things you need to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options price and print ability let's start by talking about comfort this shirt is made out of 100% combed ring-spun cotton what that means to you and I is this is an extremely soft t-shirt because this is a cold drink spun cotton t-shirt it's softer than your standard cotton which you'll find in like a guild in G 5000 and also your ring spun cotton is like your gilding soft style t-shirts the next level 3600 t-shirt is comparable to the Bella canvas 3000 won and the American Apparel 2001 t-shirt which are all combed ring spun cotton and what that means is they're all extremely comfortable t-shirts now it's time to talk about styling this shirt is definitely a fashion fitted tee which is why it's really popular with clothing lines and band merchandise this shirt has a baby ribbed collar it's got side seams and a tearaway label one thing that I've noticed after wearing these shirts for a very long time is after extensive use the bottom seam of the t-shirt can actually start to come unraveled so that's just something to take into consideration this shirt definitely wears a lot longer than a lot of other t-shirts so if you compare it to like the Gildan soft style G 64,000 it's gonna be come down lower on your body this is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts at Twin City tees and also one of our most recommended this shirt comes in extra small through Forex l when it comes to shirt colors the next level colors are definitely limited compared to your Bella canvas and gild and t-shirts although the shirt colors that they do offer are very good ones as for price this is definitely one of the most affordable fashion fitted combed ring-spun t-shirts on the market it will of course cost a little more than your ring spun cotton and standard cotton t-shirts as you can see here on our chart this is our price here at Twin City tees this is for 50 t-shirts with a one color print and this is just to show you where this shirt lines up among a lot of our other popular t-shirt options I want to make it very clear that these prices are subject to change okay next let's talk about screen printing when it comes to printing at Twin City tees we use water-based and discharge inks primarily and because of that the dye lot of the t-shirt is extremely important and what a dye lot is is where they actually dye the fabric of the t-shirt to give it its color next level dyes their t-shirts and multiple factories around the world and because of this they're starting to show a little bit of inconsistencies and dialogues here I'll show you an example right here as a counterexample Bella canvas actually manufactures their shirts all over the world but they dye them all in the United States which gives them a lot more control among their dialogues as a customer you shouldn't have to concern yourself with this too much I just bring it up to let you know that as next level has grown some of their quality control has fallen a little bit so that's something to pay attention to in the future but when it comes to dye lots at Twin Cities it's our job to make sure that you guys get a high quality product with consistent printing so we'll take care of the dialogue issues so you don't have to worry about anything as mentioned before the next level 3600 is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts we print thousands of them a month they're soft they're stylish and they come in a great price point so if you're trying to choose which t-shirt is right for your business band or group consider the next

and sarah's channel today we're going to be sublimating on some dark colored shirts that consists of more than 40 cotton so we're going to see how we can make this work i got this bright spray off of etsy it claims to make your sublimation images brighter let's see so here on the left we have our 50 50 cotton and then over here we have 100 percent cotton and this is a green shirt so you know we try to sublimate it it's not going to show up but i have a special trick all right so the spray brite i did buy the more expensive stuff because it comes with a spray bottle being super lazy and not going to the dollar surplus i didn't want to mix it with my bleach i have no idea what is inside of this liquid i got this stuff in the mail it does not tell me what the ingredients are it just tells me to shake it very well shake shake shake spray it over where my image is going to be pressed and also they recommend you know squeegeeing it in to the fabric however i did not have a squeegee so i ended up using the rubbing material together method so you'll see that again it was pretty expensive so what i personally did a little pro tip once i'm done using the spray i actually pour it back into the bottle and save as much as i can obviously we're not mixing it with anything else so that's okay you know we added water and diluted it we don't want to do that but since it's just a straight chemical concoction whatever you want to call a potion um we just poured it right back in there to save every last drop i think i've done maybe five shirts total and my bottle is almost empty because you really have to saturate saturate it in order to get it to do what it needs to do so this is not how you want to spray the shirts now these are my very very first times i wanted to see you guys i wanted you guys to see me making the mistakes so you don't have to so here i am just spraying it like a mad woman it's going all over my shirt this is almost like a glue it's very adhesive so as soon as i open the bottle all i smelled was like a glue scent um so as you can see i'm spraying it all over the shirt and that means that my shirt is gonna have that dried glue texture exactly where it landed and that's not what you want like fortunately the shirt on the left i end up giving to my mother and then the shirt on the right i'm actually making for my husband so it's not a big deal but if you're looking to make money from your t-shirts your sweaters whatever you'll want to make sure that they're very nice and you don't have little mistakes like this because if you're going to upset somebody especially when they're paying 25 plus for a t-shirt you know you don't want to upset anybody or waste their money and you don't want to waste your time so learn from my mistakes learn from this video do not sprite like a mad woman get a nice spritz instead of the stream you want a nice little mist spray just where your image is going i've also after doing i think like my fourth shirt i did just a pretty block image with some lettering and i sprayed very large and the whole area was hard but really i just needed where my image was going to be sprayed and dried um so i actually would describe the texture once the glue dries i'm gonna call it glue because it's more of like a glue after it dries the texture is just like dried glue think about if you get like glue on your fingers and it hardens up that's kind of what's gonna happen to your shirts so think back in the 90s if you're old enough think back in the 90s when you were a kid and you had those sweatshirts the non-hooded sweatshirts and they had the barney image on them and barney was kind of hard it was kind of like that was like cardboard not that hard but it was very stiff the rest of your sweater was nice and comfy but right where the image was was very stiff and that's what's happening with these shirts wherever you spray it's going to harden so you want to make sure that you're only getting where your image is you don't want your shirt or sweatshirt to be harder than it needs to you want to be comfy and wearable so here i am spreading in the glue concoction potion whatever you want to call it i am spreading it in trying to make sure that it's attaching to the fibers as instructed by the bottle again don't have the squeegee like they recommend so i'm making do with what i got here you know we're kind of low budget so i am rubbing it in there i know that the image i'm going to use on the sweatshirt is a little bit longer but so i'm trying to make sure that my image is going to be placed all over this concoction i don't want to waste any more than i need to but at the same time i want to make sure that i'm covering my workspace so that way it has a chance of working so you'll see you're going to learn from my mistakes that this video is me making and wasting shirts so you don't have to i'm trying to save you money by wasting my own money but yeah and also pro tip i ended up saving the shirts anyway thank god i have a husband who deals with my craziness and whether he wore the shirt you know on the right regardless he would have taken it regardless of what it looked like and on the sweater we're able to save so i'll show you what happens once i press this and you'll see why i had to do what i had to do all right so here we go we are layering our press we are giving it our 60 seconds um so just a little fyi i did not put any butcher paper or parchment paper whatevs in between the layers of the shirt inside of the shirt because it is a dark color and because it is thick i've never had an issue with the with the ink showing on the opposite side of a sweatshirt hoodie or anything like that so we do not put anything in the middle that would be kind of like an unnecessary step all right here goes the big reveal let me uh let me stop talking for a second so you can see this baby it's cold outside and here we go so it's kind of a womp womp did it work on a sweater 50 50 material no did i think it showed better than it would have if we did not use it no no how did i save it i bleached it you know i love bleaching i love bleaching my uh sweatshirts and t-shirts so yeah i ended up taking this down in the basement just bleaching it out to save it it was hard i ended up washing it two times to try to get the adhesive out of it but yeah so that's that's how we fixed that bleached it um it did still have kind of a brown line around it to where the glue was but that's okay it's a gift to the bomb so and here we go this is our 100 cotton shirt green shirt dark color and as you can see so far not so good all right so to answer the question no it does not work on dark colors do i think this showed up better than it would have if i did not use it yeah probably i don't think we could have sublimated this on 100 cotton at all but is it vibrant and clear no no it's not so that's it guys i made some mistakes hopefully you learned from them thank you so much for watching hit that subscribe button and we'll see y'all on the next project bye guys", "3vuQseWRksw": "hi everyone thanks for joining me I'm excited today I have partnered with a dye press and they are a company that has a product that allows you to use sublimation ink or your infusible ink on 100% cotton t-shirts yeah hundred percent cotton t-shirts we're no longer limited by the t-shirts that are available in the infusible ink line or the t-shirts that are available in the sublimation line so now we can use 100% cotton t-shirts that's what I did for this this is a 100% Gildan t-shirt just like you get at Joanns we've all had some of these and look at those results that's 100% cotton t-shirt with sublimation printing this is permanent washable dryable not going to go away this is a permanent design it's not going to crack it's not going to peel you can see if I spread it apart it's part of the fabric it's not laying on top it's not a transfer like an iron-on this is 100% cotton t-shirt with a very permanent result this is in fusible ink on a 100% just a plain old fruit of the line 100% cotton t-shirt in fusible link I used this in fusible link this one 100% cotton shirt you can't feel it this is permanent it's not going to go away you can wash it dry it again permanent I also tried it on a colored shirt now keep in mind anytime you use in fusible link or sublimation ink on a cotton t-shirt it's a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through but it still worked on this fluorescent pink shirt I got a transfer and you know of course it's colored or kind of changed color by the color of the shirt because it's a translucent ink but this is permanent so we can now use in fusible link on colored t-shirts we can use sublimation ink on colored t-shirts we can use our favorite cotton t-shirts I mean come on the possibilities are endless and I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product this is the product that are talking about it's called Die Presse this is poly T plus it comes in a concentrated bottle like this you you mix this with water we'll go into all of that in the next part of the video but you use the concentrate you mix it with some water you put it in the spray bottle and you treat the shirt and then you can treat it just like any other iron-on or any other sublimation transfer or confusable ink transfer it does something to the fabric there's something magical in it but it does something in the fabric that allows it to take the ink so this the beauty of this is that you can't feel this it's washable it's dryable not gonna crack not gonna peel it's on there for good and why not I love it so let's get started into the video and I'm going to show you how I made each of these projects so let's take a look at the instructions here so it tells you for one ounce of poly t+ mix it with three ounces of water and that will give you 4 ounces of spray or you could take a quarter cup mix it with 3/4 cup water and that makes eight ounces of spray for this particular spray bottle they've got it right on here I need 2 ounces of the poly T plus 2 6 ounces of water and it's going to make eight ounces of spray so that's what we're going to do it goes on and has more information if you have a bigger or smaller spray bottle or you just want to mix up a little batch so one bottle of this is going to go quite a ways so the first thing it tells me is 2 ounces of poly T plus so let's put two ounces of poly T a plus in here and I have a little funnel just to make sure that I don't make a mess I haven't opened this yet so let's see I don't know if we have to open a tap here yep so we need two ounces of this got a measuring cup here two ounces of poly T plus now we're just going to put that in our spray bottle and it's telling me to add six ounces of purified water so I'm going to fill this up with six ounces there we go so that's it that's all you need I think it's pretty cool that they let you mix it themselves I watched her video and she said why should we why should you as a consumer pay to ship water when you all have water at home so they've made a concentrate which makes the product go much further and saves on shipping cost we're almost there all right we've got six ounces of water so I'm just going to go ahead and turn my spray bottle into mix shake it up and it looks like that so let's make sure we've got it primed must be a oh there's a little stopper right here you just need to turn that to the side to get some bottle to work oh we're already primed so we're good there okay so you can see I have a Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt right here this is 100% cotton now if you want a more vibrant print the more polyester that's in it the better so even if you had a 40% it's going to give you a little bit of a more vibrant result but we're going to go with 100% cotton because I want to see it actually works so I'm just gonna put a towel on my surface just to absorb some of the moisture all right and I have a design that I'm gonna put on the shirt that's this so it's about an 8 and a half by 11 size so I'm just going to use a piece of card stock just to kind of give me a guide and I'm gonna spray the corners just to give me a guide of where I need to spray and we're just going to begin spraying the shirts within that area the white a little bit harder to tell when it's wet I've got it pretty wet she suggests that you use a foam roller I don't have a foam roller but I do have my cricket brayer so I am just going to break it push that moisture down in the shirt and I can see now that blue behind there that I need to add a little bit more spray you want to get it pretty saturated but not sopping wet I'm just gonna push that down into the fabric so we're going to press it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees that's going to dry the poly t+ and it also removes any site and you'll probably see a little bit of steam coming out of the press that's the sizing and that's exactly what we wanted to do so we've got about ten seconds left and then we're going to give it a second coat of the poly T plus I'm just going to do that right on the press according to the directions it does not need to be as heavy of a coat this time so we're just going to take the poly key plus so we're gonna get to see what it looks like on a colored shirt I'm gonna take my roller and just roll it into the shirt place it with my parchment paper and again 330 degrees for 30 seconds now if you have the first version of this product you might have gotten a separate product to remove the sizing this new poly t+ apparently you don't need that it takes care of everything all with one product now this is the second shirt I've done you can see I've only used this much this jar is still full up to here so you can just imagine how many shirts I can do with one bottle of the poly T plus alright we're coming up on 30 seconds for our second press and we're going to open the press now the next step we need the press to be at 385 so I'm going to go ahead and raise the temperature to 385 and it's going to be at 70 seconds so while that is preheating I want to show you what the shirt looks like all right so that's going to heat back up to 385 so here is our shirt so it feels kind of starchy like it's a little bit stiff but the first time you wash the shirt that's going to come out but it as if you would put spray starch on something and then iron it kind of feels like that but it's totally dry and that is the poly coating that's going to make this so that we can sublimate again this is a 100 percent cotton Gildan t-shirt pick this up at Joanns nothing fancy about this whatsoever we're going to try it on a colored t-shirt but I want to show you this one which I look gun I forgot to turn the camera and this is the white Gildan 100% t-shirt that I was just working on and just look how good that transfer came out now again it feels kind of stiff but as soon as you watch this it's going to feel just like the t-shirt because it's now the ink is now in to the fibers of the fabric it's not laying on top so it's going to feel just like a t-shirt once you wash this but that's amazing there's not one ounce of polyester in here and we have a polyester or we have a sublimation shirt so really really believe in this product I'm really interested to see how this pink shirt does now the next step tells us to raise the heat to 385 and then pre-heat for five seconds we no longer need this on here because this has no moisture in it so I don't have to protect the press anymore so I'm just going to put this down back on the press just like it was and as soon as this hits 385 I'm going to replace my parchment paper and press it for five seconds at 385 again all of the instructions are clearly printed out for you so that you can be very successful they've taken the extra initiative and made sure that you have a good experience with this product it's not difficult at all and again she walks you through every step if you want even more instructions this it's included inside there is you can just if you put your camera on your phone on camera setting and just scan this it will open right up to their Facebook group which you can join which is called dye sublimation or you can scan this and it will take you to her YouTube video which again walks you through this step-by-step so that you are successful with this product it is I'm totally totally wild and amazed by the outcome I mean that that is just a plain white t-shirt there's nothing special about that so that means I could now open up sublimation to a whole wider variety of products so for our next design I am going to send a another picture to the Sawgrass printer there we go that should be printing out here in a second and we are almost up to 385 it's at 375 so we're gonna wait just a few more seconds one question that I wanted to address that I keep getting in the YouTube comments and on my other sublimation videos and getting messages on Facebook there seems to be some confusion about the sublimation ink and using a inkjet printer the magic is in the ink it's not in the printer it's in the ink so if you are using an inkjet printer you have to convert it to sublimation ink you can't just use regular inkjet printer some people are under the impression that if you use sublimation paper printed it out with an inkjet that that's what was happening and that's the magics not in the sublimation paper again I'm just using copy paper the magic is in the ink so you need an inkjet printer that can be switched out to sublimation ink if you're going to go that route this is a dedicated sublimation printer by Sawgrass this is my what I prefer to do I didn't want to convert a printer once you convert an inkjet printer you really shouldn't convert it back to ink jet so it's you know you you can't just go back and forth and switch it anytime you want unique because then you would have to clear out all that ink out of the lines so a sublimation ink comes out very dull you're not gonna want to use this for everyday printing plus it's going to be much more expensive so if you're going to use an inkjet printer keep in mind that once you switch it to sublimation ink you're not going to be switching it back and forth again and so you can't use regular inkjet and do this method that nut needs to be sublimation ink all right so we should be up to three eighty five we are we're going to press it for pre-press for five seconds there we go I am going to add my design facedown right on top again this is not a pink shirt so remember when you're doing sublimation on colored shirts it's not that it won't work but your ink is it's a clear ink so if there's not something white or light behind it it's probably not going to show up as well as if you were to put it on a white background so keep in mind that the ink is transparent so when you put it on a color the color is going to show through the color of the garment so we're pressing now for 385 for 70 seconds and again it's all in the instructions you can't go wrong with this process you make sure that you have all the information you need so that you have a great press all right so we're counting down we are at 7 seconds so that parchment paper is no longer any good again I press I printed this on regular copy paper so there you can see what's left and you can see this is just plain copy paper and again this is on a colored t-shirt so it's not going to be as vibrant but still absolutely gorgeous result a gun it's still a little stiff but once the first time we watch this then it's just going to feel like a regular cotton t-shirt here it is on white so you're always going to get a better result on a white or a light-colored t-shirt but I really wanted to put this to the test and see how it looked on a this is live like a fluorescent pink t-shirt I'm not sure how well it's coming through so it's kind of on the medium side as far as a darkness so I've prepped one more shirt with the dye press product and this time we're going to try the cricket in fusible ink I have cut the words be kind out of the infusible ink course it's weird and we're going to try that this is a hundred percent cotton Hanes t-shirt just a plain old t-shirt and we're going to try the cricket and fusible link with the dye press treated cotton t-shirt so let's see how this goes I've already done the two layers of the poly tee I'm gonna go ahead and put the words on we're going to cover it with our parchment paper three eighty five seventy seconds and let's see if cricket infusible ink also works on a cotton t-shirt I enjoy finding new ways to use this cricket and fusible ink I know some people are limited by the fact that you could only get the white or the gray t-shirts now that's not going to be a problem we can use cotton t-shirts in fusible link and get some really unique projects just keep in mind that just like the printer ink this is a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through the design just like it did on this but if you use a white cotton t-shirt you're going to get the more vibrant result so let's see how I did on a white t-shirt take off my parchment paper wow so here is the transfer after the ink has been lifted and here is your fusible ink on a white t-shirt I don't know if you can see the label but this is just a plain Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton t-shirt and look at that result so let's take a close-up look at some of the shirts that we made today I am so impressed by this product to be honest I thought it would work but I didn't think I would work this well and you really cannot tell that this is not a hundred percent polyester shirt everything is vibrant everything looks amazing and the transfer is solid so very very impressed I hope you guys enjoyed this video and you're enjoying the sublimation series if you did please like subscribe and share click that bell so that you're notified every time there is a new video and if you like this video stay tuned I've got a couple more linked for you thanks I you", "KfHYSecLFlw": "now normally you cannot sublimate or do sublimation on a cotton t-shirt not until now we've got a new product to look at let's have a look at it right now those of you who do transfer printing like I do and vinyls and stuff like that onto 100% cotton t-shirts the reason why we use concierge is because they're basically half the price of sublimation t-shirts for those of you who actually are in the know now we've got a new product here where I can now sublimate or use sublimation to print onto a cotton t-shirt let's check it out Robin I've just got this test batch of a new product that's out and what they do is provide you with a special transfer paper and some special powder which you put through your sublimation printer in this case it's the year Rico print which we are using and you use the sublimation inks on the transfer paper and then you apply a powder over the top which is like a polymer powder and that then gets pressed onto a 100 percent cotton t-shirt and it's supposed to leave the sublimated image permanently fitted onto the t-shirt now I've not used this before so you're using it for the first time with me so let's give it a try I'm going to get our cotton t-shirt now it's basically for white t-shirts and light-colored t-shirts is this a product by the way it's not for dark t-shirts so let's just get a t-shirt now give it a press and then we'll see what happens right so this is the paper and I know if you can see there it's from a company called subway to cotton comm and again this is just a sample sheet here it's a little bit thicker than the normal transfer sublimation paper so what I'm going to do is to open the tray and you place this facedown in your Rico sublimation printer like that I'll turn it on first obviously and I've just pulled up a color print here of an image it's Lightning McQueen me grandson loves that I'm not going to sell this this is purely to get a good sale good the color definition is in this so I've never tried this before once it prints out the image what you have to do then is to lay the image on a tray and then you sprinkle this polymer powder over the top of it which again I've only got a little sort of bagful here so we plan to do that and cover the ink up that as it comes out of the printer it's obviously still wet and sprinkle that over until all the inks come and then we can actually press the air t-shirt with 100% cotton t-shirt so let's give that a go now and again all I've done is pull up a graphic here of a lightning McQueen cars and the image should come out here wet right as we can see it started to come out now so I'm going to bring the image black straight down in the tray like that and I'm just going to get this white powder now I'm just empty it onto the tray I'm not going to you gotta be careful not to smudge this as well apparently so I'm just going to put the whole lot on for the moment and I'm just going to swish it all about so again I've never done this before so you have to bear with me on this so I'm just going to sort of just try get it all over the top of the image this is all brand new to me and just make sure literally that the whole of the image is covered which I can see there that it is there you go so now we've done there I'm just going to pick the paper up carefully dust it off like that as I say there's no cutting around the shapes either so as you can see here it's just literally just drop it all off and I can see there that everything is actually covered and there's only this residue which is actually just stuck to the image itself I'll just lay that there for a second I've already pre pressed our t-shirt as you know what we always do there and as I say the temperature which I'm pressing it here is 180 degrees and I'm going to be doing that for 30 seconds now you've also got to be careful that when you put this down face down that you don't move it about so you want to be in the correct position really right from the beginning so I'm just going to place that down there like that and cover up with me cover sheet as you can see there now don't forget this is a hundred percent cotton t-shirt which normally you cannot sublimate - so let's just press that down there and we're going to be counting down for 30 seconds now so I've never used this before myself it might seem a bit of a faff but again it's a learning curve and it could be a way of producing I mean the biggest thing about sublimation t-shirts are they normally double the price of these cotton t-shirts right here we go so I'm just going to take it off like that we've had it under for 30 seconds I don't know what it's going to do what it's going to look like and I'm just going to pull this straight off and this is a set view is 100% cotton t-shirt using sublimation inks now look at that first of all I'm going to say to you but then colors are absolutely fantastic look at this look how about that can you see how vivid that is and there's no seams or anything whatsoever there now that looks really nice I'm very surprised by that and look at the depth of the colors as well I'm sure you can see there and as I say this isn't a transfer this is sublimation ink on our Gildan t-shirts which as you can probably see on the sign they're 100% cotton using sublimation inks how about that well all I can say is really that that's erm that's really surprised me I'm a little bit taken aback by that to be honest with you I've never used this before I've heard of the product as I say but this is in the UK at the moment I don't know if you've got it in any of the other countries at the moment I think this the price of these as compared to the normal sublimation or transfer papers I think it's about double the price at the moment but apparently the manufacturers are trying to work to get the price down so it can compete favorably with the the transfer paper market and also you know you'll be saving because these t-shirts are literally dirt cheap as well so I'm think you'll find there's no you can fill a surface there obviously but it's like a polymer surface which you get with any sort of printed surface but that ink is been taken by the polymer power that which is obviously sunk into the actual world garment as well so that's why it's actually part of the garment as well there so well there you go that's a new one on me and if you probably see I'm trying to stretch it there look can you see it's actually stretching because it's actually part of the garment as well there we go look there's no sign of any sort of degradation when you stretch it and well please wait I think I turned that lovely and look at the vivid colors as I've said before well that's just something to looking out for and that is from a company called sublet ooh cotton limited a brand new product here in the UK although I have heard of it before maybe in different guises and it is a polymer powder to be used on top of your sublimation ink with your sublimation printer so that you can actually print on 100% cotton t-shirts there you go I hope that was of some interest to you it will be to me because I'll be running it through to watch many many times and we'll update you obviously somewhere further down the line in a different video there you go hope you enjoyed this one thanks very much for watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel share my videos and we'll see you again in the next video till then bye for now you you", "Kw5NZnJeOBM": "[Music] do [Music] hello guys welcome back to my channel this is my sugary lovecraft and today i'm going to be doing a test uh with dye sublimation ink i'm also um going to be testing it on not 100 polyester but 65 cotton 40 polyester and then what i'm also going to be doing is i'm going to be testing it out on three different types of paper i'm going to be testing it out on 20 pound paper and of course you know like i said i printed it with the dye sublimation ink i'm going to be print i printed out also on the sublimation paper as well as you can see tell the difference and i've also printed it out on 28 pound laser paper now this should not be working according to um you know what they say about sublimation ink um they should not be able to transfer to cotton shirts without adding or removing the coating with a certain type of um formula but let's try it out let's see what's going to happen um i've already heated up my um piece of material like i said it's only 65 cotton 40 polyester i'm gonna put a sheet of paper underneath just because like i said i'm just doing a test and i don't want it to bleed through because i'm not sure what it's going to happen so this is live i'm going to put this sublimation shout out to my jamaican family now it's mirrored so that's why i can't tell what it really says um so i'm gonna put the sublimation paper at the top then we have the 20 pound below 28 pound below and then followed by the 20 pound all right um i've already heated up my shirt but you know what let me heat it up again just to make sure to take that moist just out double check and i'm just gonna heat it up for a little bit all right um let me go ahead and place these back on there exactly in the same order that i talked about and what i'm going to do is i'm going to tape it down just so that it won't shift or move of course i didn't line it up you know real neat because that's not the purpose the purpose is to see if it's true that only the sublimation ink is going to i mean the sublimation paper is going to transfer to the material and also to test to see if it does work on not 100 polyester all right i don't know i just don't like polyester shirts they just look shiny to me but let's see why not let's try it out all right and i'm also going to take some black sheets of paper um and put it on the top as you can see i've already have my teflon sheet on the top here so i'm gonna still use just in case it's gonna bleach okay all right here we go i'm gonna be putting it down for 60 seconds now according to um like i said um it's stated that you cannot use um the dye sublimation on cut on cotton it should only be on polyester and that it has a special coating that releases the ink into the shirt um of course the other two paper that i have which is a 28 pound and the 20 pound copy paper um they don't have any special coding so let's see first of all it should be blank when we lift this up because apparently it shouldn't be working on cotton right or not blank but it should be totally faded um on all three so let's see what happens so as you can see the ink so i'm glad that i did put something over it the date the ink did come through on the 20 pound paper it didn't come through that much just a little bit on the 28 pound paper and of course nothing on the sublimation so let's go ahead and kind of take it off wow looky here [Music] wow so i honestly i'm not buying any more from sublimation paper i could buy a pack of 20 pound paper 20 pound paper and make a brighter color i'm like look at it it is i mean awesome i mean even on the the 28 pound itches it is much brighter than the sublimation paper that i paid 17 for wow and like i said it's not 100 cotton it's um 65 it's not 100 polyester 65 cotton 40 polyester um i cut it from this shirt and i'm just going to show you exactly what it says 60 60 cotton 40 polyester and guys as you can see so for those of you guys who are out there doing um dye sublimation just make sure you test it out because this is awesome i love it once again thank you for watching my channel this is miss sugee lovecraft don't forget to like subscribe and share [Music] you", "I0dYWtua97Y": "Welcome back to the gentleman's Gazette! Today's video is all about cotton. We discuss what it is, what it's not, the\ndifferences in qualities, the impact on the environment, what you should look for when\nyou buy it, and what to watch out for. Cotton, you might wonder, isn't all cotton\nthe same? No, it isn't. Even if it's a hundred percent cotton, there\nare huge differences and today, about 75 percent of men's wear garments have some form of cotton\nin them. It's very affordable, versatile, and accessible,\nand it can hold up to 27 times its own weight in water. It is grown on two and a half percent of the\nworld's arable land and overall, it's a fiber you should know about. So what exactly is cotton? It's basically linked from the cotton plant\nwhich is part of the Gossypium family and the fibers were meant to protect the seeds\nand are comprised entirely out of cellulose material you often find in nature, such as\ntrees. Outer fabrics such as viscose, or bamboo fabrics,\nare all based on cellulose as well. Cotton plants are actually shrubs and they\ngrow wildly but today, they're cultivated most of the time. Looking back, cotton was found in garments\nup until 6000 BC and it was mostly found in the Middle East. Today, the commercially for most grown cottons\nare all derived from that ancient cotton plant. Columbus noticed that when he came to the\nBahamas, it had a huge impact on slavery which was perpetuated by the growth of cotton itself\nand to learn more about it, I urge you to check out our in-depth guide on the website\nhere. Today, most of the cotton comes through US,\nChina, India, as well as many countries in Africa, and South America. In the US, commercial level growth of cotton\nis heavily subsidized while developed nations hugely rely on machines to harvest cotton,\nit is still picked by hand in Africa, or in Egypt, in India, and developing countries. Ofcourse, picking by hand is much more labor-intensive\nand the people who do it or not paid very well. At the same time, you get a pure fiber simply\nbecause you don't get any impurifications into the fiber at the picking stage. When cotton is harvested, they usually select\nthe seeds and so after harvesting in the country of origin, as well as the country where the\ncotton is spun and woven, it goes to many gins that make sure to remove all the seeds,\ndirts, and impurification from the cotton. Because the purer the cotton, the better it\nis. Not all cotton fibers are alike, the better\nones are longer and you can get them in five or six centimeter lengths which is like two\nto two and a half inches. Lower and cotton has shorter staples and it's\nharder to spin them into yarns at the same time, it is usually softer but you will see\npilling much more quickly and it will wear out prematurely. For that reason, all quality cotton products\nrely on long staple cotton. Once the fiber is cleaned, it is spun into\na yarn and sometimes you have a 2 ply yarn which means two strands of yarn apply together\nwhich helps to create a more resilient yarn that is at the same time, more consistent\nand long-lasting. Another process to improve cotton is called\ngassing. It's used to brighten the fiber, smoothen\nit which gives it that typical quality Sheen you may know from higher end cotton shirts,\nespecially in the twill weave. Once the cotton is woven, there's a number\nof different finishing steps that are sometimes proprietary to the manufacturers and it will\nhelp to really get the best out of the cotton fabric. Now that you how it's made, let's talk about\nthe environmental impact. Cotton is very resource-intensive in the growing\nstage, as well as in the manufacturing stage, and it uses a lot of water and the chemicals\nused to process it can be ecologically very damaging. As a crop, cotton likes warm\nclimates and as such, it is oftentimes grown in areas where there's not enough rainfall\nso it heavily relies on irrigation such as in Egypt. To keep pests at bay, you need a lot of chemicals\nbecause of that, genetically modified seeds have been developed that keep pests at bay\nso you don't have to use as many chemicals, but you still need a lot comparatively. Because of rising levels in cotton that gets\nto the end producer, the whole movement of organic cotton was started which is ever-growing. By definition, organic cotton neither has\nchemicals or pesticides and it doesn't rely on genetically modified seeds. Apart from cotton using a lot of water, it\nhas to be linked to desertification in parts of the world as well as solidation of the\nground. The absence of cotton art is an organic material\nthat will decompose unlike things like nylon or polyester. In terms of cotton quality, it all starts\nwith a staple length. Short staple is considered three quarters\nof an inch or about one and a half centimetres. Medium staple cotton is considerably about\nthree quarters of an inch to one and a quarter inch; and a long staple cotton is anything\nfrom one and a quarter inch all the way up to two and a half inches. While the majority of cotton in the world\nis a short staple and then some medium staple, you will only see the staple infused in marketing\nfor higher end cottons. Sometimes when you see labels of higher-end\ncotton, you will see the term sea island cotton but what exactly doesn't mean? It is an extra-long staple cotton grown on\nthe sea islands outside the South Carolina and Georgia. In theory, the sunshine and the level of humidity\nprovide the perfect conditions for a high-quality cotton. Even higher form of cotton is a so-called\nWest Indian Sea Island cotton which is legally only allowed to be grown\nin parts of the Caribbean. Even though the output is limited by the size\nof the island, there are a lot more products labeled as sea island cotton western Sea Island\ncotton that is actually made in any given year. Obviously, there's a lot of fraud going on\nin that part, however, if we can get your hands on genuine West Indian Sea Island cotton,\nit's almost like touching cashmere. Sometimes, shirt makers also advertise Egyptian\ncotton and basically what they mean is it's the longest staple cotton from a batch, it's\nnot necessarily cotton that is always from Egypt. You'll also\nfind Egyptian cotton in towels or anything that touches the skin. Usually, it's used to demand a higher price\nfrom the consumer. A subgroup of Egyptian cotton you see so-called\nGiza cotton which is more high-end. Each giza quality comes with a number. With giza 45 con being the most luxurious\nand high-end Egyptian cotton on the market, its extra-long, has superior fineness, and\nis very consistent. To guarantee the highest quality of the longest\nstaple giza 45 cotton, it is hand picked and hand combed so there are no impurifications\nand you get the finest cotton there is. Sometimes you see pima cotton or american\npima which is named after an American Indian tribe, it is also considered to be a extra\nlong staple con and it came about in the 1900s. You may also have seen supima cotton which\nis short for superior pima cotton and while it's not a grade, it's an organization that\ntries to promote pima cotton. Like organic cotton in itself is not a description\nof quality, all it tells you that no chemicals or pesticides were used and it's not genetically\nmodified. It doesn't tell you anything about the staple\nlength, so if you pay more for organic cotton, you do so because of the impact it has and\nthe pesticide freeness, not in the quality. In my experience, West Indian sea cotton is\nreally the cream of the crop and I would even place it above a giza 45 cotton. For dress shirts, Ialways go for a two ply\ncotton and make sure that it's a hundred percent cotton and it's not stretch with polyester\nor nylon. While it makes it more durable and it's may\nbe appropriate for uniforms, work wear, maybe for chefs in the kitchen, it's not something\nyou want to wear on your skin because it's rougher and not as comfortable, also it's\nnot as absorbent. If you're lucky, you can also sometimes find\npolo shirts made at a pima cotton, however, most of the time, it's a lower grade cotton. Interestingly, thread counts or gsm grams\nper square meter are units used usually for linens and towels, not for garments. In my experience, there's a lot of fraud going\non and I wouldn't rely just on a number that's presented to me. So how can you find out if the cotton is luxurious? The problem is that you have a soft cotton,\nit can feel very comfortable on your skin, but it's in fact soft because the staple is\nso short. Higher-end cotton is usually very fine which\nmeans you can have a very fine weave and you get a very nice Sheen. For men's shirts, probably Albini is a largest\nkid on the block and if you want to learn more about that company check out our guide\non the website here. At the same time there are other good cotton\nmanufacturers out there but sometimes the problem with relying on brands is that they\nmay change the quality over time without you noticing it or without them changing your\nlabel. For example, I own Polo Ralph Lauren sweaters\nfor over ten years and the quality has gone downhill by a lot. The sweaters have gotten softer but it's because\nthey used shorter staple cotton that pills much more easily and looks old and the colors\nlook washed out much more quickly than the older sweaters I have. So what are their cotton buying do's and don'ts? Don't believe that all cotton is created equal. Quality cotton is usually softer, it is shinier,\nit is finer, and it has a smaller impact on the environment because you can wear it for\nlonger periods of time. You should always expect more from a higher\nand cotton retailer; they should be able to tell you what specific kind of cotton is used,\nhow many plys they are, how heavy the fabric is, and where it was sourced. At the same time, don't believe all the labels\nthat are not backed up by a trusted industry Authority such as Albini, Thomas Mason, or\nTessitura Monti, or other famous cotton makers which are known to produce a quality product\nmade out of long staple cotton. So how shouldyou care for cotton? Fortunately, it's one of the more easier items\nto take care of. You can machine wash it, you can hand wash\nit, but machine wash is totally fine, the only time I'd stay away from machine washing\nmy cotton is in a suit such as a seersucker suit or another cotton suit but mainly because\nof the canvas and the things on the inside not necessarily because of the fabric itself. Ideally, you should always follow the care\ninstructions on the label because if you wash it too hot, the color may come out and I also\nwould urge you to wash it with light colors, otherwise, the chances of it looking duller\nis much higher. To keep colors vibrant and cotton in a good\nstage, it's best not to wash the pair of jeans after every single time of wear and if you\ndo, you can pull them inside out just like with the sweaters to try to prevent pilling\non the outside which is visible. Also, it helps your cotton if you don't over\ndry it so ideally, air dry it. If you have to use a dryer, maybe partially\nput it in a dryer and then hang it to be air dried, otherwise, if you fully put in a dryer\nyour garment won't last as long. When it comes to dress shirts, should never\nput them into the dryer because of the interlining that may come lose, it's harder on it so always\nair dry those. You can either iron a dress shirt when it's\nwet so it's relatively easy and the wrinkles come out. The problem is it takes a lot longer and so\nyou have to figure out what makes sense for you. Ideally you put it on a hanger and let it\ndry. When in doubt about the temperature you should\nwash your cotton on, go with a lower temperature or wash it on cold because it will make sure\nthat your colors last longer.

In today's video I'm wearing a rather casual\noutfit made of a polo shirt from Uniqlo out of 100% cotton. the collar is made like a shirt collar and\nit's not so flimsy like usual polo shirt collars because of that I really like it because. I'm wearing it untucked it's not longer in\nthe back than it is in the front and the shorts I'm wearing are by Polo Ralph Lauren made\nout of a soft cotton this is an old pair of shorts that is still made out of a higher\nquality cotton in my opinion than the newer shorts you can buy these days my shoes are\ncasual summer shoes called Alpergatas from Spain they are made out of a checked cotton\nfabric on a u2 soul with rubber it's a very summery shoe and it doesn't give you a lot\nof structure yet it's breathable and I find it perfect for outings at the beach or just\nvery summery resort wear outfits that don't really care about formality.", "pgBfew1-YqY": "hey everyone i hope you're doing well just wanna do a very quick video showcasing some really nice technical and basic tees from uniqlo i have a handful of uniqlo tees that i've been wearing for more than a year and they've held up really great this particular shirt it's the alexander wang aries mt collab that they did a while back and it's held up absolutely great so i did notice that uniqlo added some more colors and a couple different cuts of the arizona tea to the website so i thought i would go ahead and pick some up just because there's such a good basics and i also picked up two supima cotton tees from there because i wanted to try those out and then each t-shirt i'm going to show you guys i'm going to give a sizing reference for them because it's a different cut or it might be a different size or anything like the supima cotton teeth i got one in a large one in medium and then i would showcase the different styles of other t-shirts as well i'm gonna go ahead and talk about what makes arizona so special so if you want to skip that skip to this time right here to go ahead and get to the t-shirts and if you want to see how i style it with some very simple fits go ahead and skip to this time right here by the way if you guys are into fashion at all i highly recommend you pick up a tape measure it just makes buying clothes online so much easier it just makes buying clothes online a little bit more worry free because you can measure the clothes based on the size charge to something else you already have in your collection just for a sizing reference i also sell stuff on grailed and this comes in really handy just to give a potential customer an idea of the size of the garment i'll go ahead and link a super cheap version of this down in the description below highly recommend it so four out of the six shirts i'm going to be showing you today are the airism fabric which does have a lot of cool technical features in it such as it's anti-wrinkle especially after washing it's antibacterial just to help stop odors it's cool to the touch and of course it's quick drying and very breathable as well really interesting feature that they have with some of the uniqlo errorism tees are that they are uv protectant so i wanted to look into that a little bit more to see like kind of what that was and i couldn't find anything super concrete on what they do to errorism to make it more uv protectant than a normal piece of clothing but i did find some general information on the internet regarding uv protective clothing and then taking the knowledge from there and then comparing it to what uniqlo does release you can kind of theorize on what they do so basically darker colors protect you a little bit better than lighter colors the denser the weave of the fabric obviously the more protection you're going to get from the sun which is pretty intuitive you know if you have a fabric that's super tight it's not going to let as much sun get through treatment and dyes can be added to a fabric to either reflect or absorb uv rays i suspect this is what uniqlo does with their arrows and tees because aerism is a very breathable fabric so it does let air through so it's not super dense they do say on the tag of some of the errors and tees that uv filtration has been added to the fabric to a rating of upf 40 plus which i looked it up and that rating means it blocks 97.5 or greater of the uv rays shiny polyesters and satin silk type fabrics do a really good job of reflecting uv rays as well which i think this plays into airism because depending on the t-shirt it's either 27 to 47 polyester however these heirism shirts don't really have like any shine to it like with a lot of athletic tees so they're all really subtle and look nice for just everyday wear anyways enough of that i'm gonna go ahead and get into the t-shirts so the first one i got this is the uniqlo u arizum oversized boxy tee and this one is definitely the most unique cut of all of these shirts i was going to get this back when the uniclo u collection initially released but upon the day of release there must have been some logistical error because it wasn't available until like a week or two later so then i just kind of missed out on it but luckily they are still in stock the thing i like most about this tee are the elongated sleeves they come about right up to the elbow and it does have the dropped shoulders and a much tighter collar than a standard t i mean it's not like too tight where it's uncomfortable but it is a little bit more snug up so it does have a very unique silhouette i think this looks really good with like some techier fits maybe some pairs of pants that are a little bit wider or a little bit baggier just to kind of match the oversized proportion of the top this does come in a lot of different colors but i opted just for black just because it is more of a unique cut of tea so i just wanted to play it safe and go with a subtle black instead of a really bright color but again that's just my subjective style opinion because this is oversized i did size down to a size medium now just looking at the size of this tee here the rough measurement shoulder to shoulder which i measured from the hem to the hem it's 52 centimeters or like 21.5 inches and then the total length from top to bottom is about 70 centimeters or like was that like 27.5 inches i think and then the shoulder to the end of the sleeve is 26 centimeters or like that's like 10 and a half inches i think so it's definitely pretty boxy um however the the shoulders are like i said earlier the drop shoulder so they are supposed to go off your shoulder so that's why it's so wide in those measurements but again that's a size medium for wrestling i did pick up one of the basic airism cotton crewneck short sleeve t-shirts and this is just a normal cut t-shirt that i picked up in this really nice dark gray and this dark gray in the arizona fabric kind of gives off a really cool kind of industrial metallic metal like vibe to it that's kind of weird to say but i don't know it has a more athletic cut to it but it's not too slim and they do have normal length sleeves but a lot of times with my t-shirts i do like to cuff it two times just to make my t-shirts fit a little bit better or maybe subconsciously i'm trying to make my noodle arms a little bit more buff looking i don't know i did get this in a size large and the rough measurements of this are shoulder to shoulder it's 47 centimeters or like 18.5 inches total length from top to bottom is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches so again a little bit longer than the boxier cut one and then the sleeve length unrolled of course it's about 22 centimeters which is like nine inches right right now it's just kind of wrinkled because it came packaged up all folded up really close so i'm trying to get that out of here so the next two shirts are of the same cut these are the arizon uv protectant long sleeve and these are an online exclusive so i got one in black just to play it safe can't go wrong with a very basic black tee and i also got this one in dark gray which it almost kind of has like a brown hue to it depending on the lighting in this camera it does look pretty gray um but in some lighting it does kind of give off some brown undertones which i think is really cool and i think this one might be my favorite tee of this whole like mini haul but it has a really nice earthy tone to it it's very classic fit but it's not too boxy being a basic long sleeve there's not too many cool features with this but there are like a small slit on the sides of the waist and then of course you have a nice cuff and collar as well i did get both of these in a size large and the rough measurements from shoulder to shoulder are is 47 centimeters which is like 18.5 inches the total length is 72 inches or 28 inches just like the last tee and then the sleeves are 58 centimeters which is about 23 inches these errors and teeth just have like such a great feel they feel so comfortable and i really really like the texture of it as well it's not too shiny and soft kind of like more typical workout gear but it still remains to be very soft and kind of a soft like cool touch to it but anyways lastly i did pick up two supima cotton basic tees and i am quite impressed with the feel and quality of these t-shirts now just comparing the supima cotton to a standard cotton tee from uniqlo is the supima cotton tee is noticeably more soft and it almost feels like errorism it's so smooth whereas the other one it's a little bit more coarse and granded this one is older but if you're thinking about getting one of the t-shirts i would just go ahead and opt and pay more for the nicer quality tea so anyways i did get these in two different color ways i did get one in a dark green and then the other in a dark brown now the dark green is a size large and the brown is a size medium this season they did design these to be a little bit of a looser fit just so it drapes more on the body both the green and the brown do have undertones of gray in it which makes it very very wearable just for every day and then being 100 con these are much more of a matte color than the arizontes not that the arrows and tees are shiny at all these are just noticeably more of a matte color so the large measurements are roughly 44 centimeters from shoulder to shoulder or that's like 17 and a half inches total length is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches and the sleeves are 22 centimeters long which is like eight and a half inches now comparing that with the size medium tee the shoulder to shoulder width is 47 centimeters or 17 inches so you lose about a half inch in width so the total length is 68 centimeters or 27 inches so it's an inch shorter than the large roughly speaking and then the sleeves are 20 centimeters so it's straight eight inches so not too much more terribly small than the large but it is noticeable and in hindsight i probably would have got both of these any size large just because i like a little bit more of extra room in my teeth just so it drapes a little bit nicer on the body and it's a little bit more comfortable anyways here are some outfits that i put together with these again very simple because all these tees are really great basic building blocks to construct an outfit off of so i kept everything very simple and with the aries mts i put together very basic like techware fits whereas the supima contest put together very basic street road looks but anyways here they are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i will go ahead and link all the t-shirts i got down below in the description i do use an affiliate link it doesn't add anything to the price but if you do choose to buy one of these t-shirts i get a very small cut of it so it's a nice way to support the channel if you want to pick one of these up and they do have these in tons of different colors so whatever fits your taste they should have it anyways guys i will see you in video pretty soon thank you for stopping by and thank you for subscribing i really do appreciate every single one we're almost at 13 000 which is really insane for me to think about but anyways i will see your video pretty soon", "Ue0_AsqOEA0": "hey this is Tom with the father's workshop screen-printing and what we're gonna do we've got something in the mail that we want to check out and it's for putting sublimation on t-shirts not Polly t-shirts but gah so you don't come back right after the intro [Music] [Music] hey Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and we're here again and we're making another video and I don't know if you like him or not if you like to mother to that we made but anyways we're not real big on videos but anyways we're gonna we're gonna do something today we got some stuff from a company and we're not advertising unless you want to sanitize for you but we we got some stuff and it's it's from a company called Dai France and we we bought some stuff because we're curious about sublimation on garments now it's nice when you can put a nice graphic on garments by just using your heat press because I mean I have I have I have other graphics and stuff that you can actually heat press on to the car but this is something that we can print with our printer with the sublimation ink and be able to have a nice graphic and hopefully it would come out nice on shirt now I have heard that it really worked good now this is a little bit of a process because first of all you've got to use the the Desai's are on white and gray shirts to get the decides are out of it that they put into it it has to do with something when they when they're doing this church when they're making the shirts knitting the church or whatever it is it has something to do with with with with that process but they take the D sizer out it is it's removed when they put the ink in them so your your blue shirts and your yellow shirts and your orange green all your colored shirts don't have the D sizer and I'm so you don't have to go through this process but then once you've done that once you if you're gonna do a white shirt once you gather these sides are out of it then you have to use the the other chemical that you spray on there let it dry put in your heat present cure it spray it again cure it again and then you can put your sublimation graphic on to the garment onto the cotton garment so this is sublimation ink on cotton shirts and I have supplemented on cotton without you know without without this stuff and I know what it looks like and you got to be particular when you do it you can do it you still put that on yours on the shirt but it's it's it's it's really kind of blurry faded it comes out but it just it's not crisp but you know hey that you want say a nice clean crisp image it's not like that if you don't use this stuff I guess because I haven't used it yet and what I say haven't used it yet is is it's this stuff right here still on a package haven't even open it yet now this is the B sizer this is what you use on the white and gray shirts you put that on there and there's a process to make sure that you do that then once you've done that and you finished that process then you use what's known as this and it's the poly tea spray anyways just a bottle without a sprayer but this is a probably teach spray anyways and this is it's as concentrated so it'll make up as it's eight ounces should make up to 64 ounces I think it's seven ounces per ounce so that's the way it works what we're gonna do that so come back let's see how it does let's see how it works [Music] [Music] [Music] everything's gonna go [Music] it drops of spray on there now today we're back in this morning time and my Chinese food was great all right we have the heat press getting warmed up and we've went ahead in time to 10 seconds because we need to press this shirt now now that we wet it last night we let it dry overnight come back out here to the shop and I'm going to do now is let the heat press get hot when it gets hot we will press it I think it says for 10 seconds then I've got my he press yet for 10 seconds once it goes down and then we'll bring it back up and we'll take it back over to the platen over here and spray it again and maybe we'll go throw it out in the dryer and let it dry quicker so we can get that second coating on there and you know going to get the second Curie and then we can go ahead and see how this stuff works we're gonna print some up on our printer [Music] only say what said sure did you do yes last night I didn't do front of the back battle I'll just press both sides and I'll have to spray both sides I'm just kidding [Music] [Music] way and then we know that we've sprayed all of this so we'll take these depressed and it is set 385 degrees and we depress it for 10 seconds [Music] offensive ten-second charity thing not again anyway I went a little funk see that smoke I'm assuming that that is the D sizer not the sizer for that is the puck I seem that the smoke there is quality I don't want a bunch of spots all over my shirt [Music] that means we have to [Music] now we're gonna take the shirt we gon spray it again again now what I need to do now that I've done the two cures I've sprayed it let it dry now I'm doing then I did two cures what I'm gonna do now is we're going to put our picture sublimation ink and I did this I run this put together there on the computer there is we gonna put it on the shirt and it says to use butchers paper I'm I don't get that yeah I know I know I need to put something in between where the shirt is here so when you open up the inside of the shirt because that's what's gonna happen is it breaks into a gas so it's naturally gonna go through the material now I don't know if this poly tea is supposed to stop that but I'm gonna put something in between there anyways just to check and see maybe that's why the butchers paper for I have I have some Teflon paper I have up sheets that I put on and so we'll go that route on as far as put it over the top so anyway let's let's just go ahead and work with this thing and see what it looks like so I'm dying to see how it's gonna look now that I've got it it sure twice let me take these glasses off now I can I can see them reading glasses okay so we're gonna go ahead and put this on on the shirt put it on the shirt I think all we're gonna do we're not let me let me let me get the camera set up and we'll come back just hang on okay we're back you had to get the camera set up I hate that's over the cameras and and I'm using a cheap camera anyway so anyways what we've got here now me let me direct down here [Music] [Music] [Music] now this says this says we're supposed to [Music] get our feet press in a 385 degrees and we're supposed to press it for 70 seconds so I'll get that ready in just a second what I'm gonna do open this up [Music] [Music] I went to break into a gas it doesn't bleed through and [Music] [Music] thanks but when you got pictures like this it's kind of crooked anyways so if you put it on there little bit crooked it ain't gonna make any difference [Music] try to get a straight from cans [Music] I do what I need units I need to set this 70 seconds [Music] [Music] here we don't put it on there upside down set it up on shirt [Music] [Music] drop this all for 70 seconds [Music] I can notice temperature dropped you see that [Music] and that's gonna happen who says 70 seconds is up that seemed awfully quick only a few more seconds because the heat dropped and when it did it didn't maintain that no that's really why I set the temperatures a little higher can see it still it's 372 degrees and so it we didn't exactly press at the temperature so normally I set my temperature is higher so one actually is it cools off but it still does all right here we go [Music] when they say 385 and I'll tell you what man I normally go about 400 degrees [Music] not a real of course it could be mine my friend maybe I didn't turn it out as perfectly as I shut it that was treated [Music] treated a couple of times and like I said it's not supposed to be straight it's supposed to be crooked like that his head supposed to be straight got a nice feel to it where you can feel the regular shirt here the softness this is 10 of May today yeah that's pretty good like I said the purple see this one's got left over after after all that it could be the either idea I left it too long and the purple started to burn which is what your red and stuff will do that they'll actually start turning brown and this did turn a little brown instead of purple so maybe I'll do it again on another shirt and see what happens with that because yeah my my Reds turned a little but I mean I got the donut here but I think that dome that was supposed to be pink and it's red so I think it got too much heat for too long so seventy seconds and the thing about it is now these presses are not always accurate either something else too I wanted you to notice that remember when we put the paper in the middle and put the paper in the middle there because we worried about bleeding through [Music] you look after treating it twice it didn't even bleed through so that's good and actually that's my my purple turned brown and I think like I said because of too much heat but actually I kind of like the brown wool over there because it Ronnie coffee coffee face that's your coffee face I got the face so that's pretty neat I think what I'll do is I'll treat the back for Manila face on now put donut faizon sir that's uses sublimation ink and using a product called poly tea by company : Die Presse and next time next time what we will do we will and this is it this stuff here mixes one ounce with seven ounces of water give you eight ounces of spray and I imagine you can do a lot of stuff with that that's a lot of spray and [Music] stop father's workshop screen-printing and there it is who is what you think get the product spray on the cotton t-shirt let it dry cure it with the heat press doing it to do this repeat that over again and then put your picture on there I'm only experiment with some more I'll get them and sell em on eBay I'll experiment the ones that I experiment with you're still good-looking shirt I'll sell them on eBay so be looking father's workshop screen-printing TF w is screen printing I think it's pretty neat anyway that's that's all for this video so thank you for tuning in and yeah we had to little naughty sometimes but that's just where we are some folks say that we're handicapped from the neck up maybe they're right this is Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and thank you for tuning in and again god bless so until next time [Music] [Music]", "Y32SKBL281U": "what's happy YouTube that was another video so y'all know me I want to try everything right now I just want to do everything I can make everything I can I'm just trying different things right so I'm trying to date I got for y'all Caesar sizer have you seen it does anybody know how to say that anyway I have sizer easy sub ly what is that right easy sub leap is gonna allow me to sublimate on a hundred percent cotton shirt dark shirt whatever did you know sublimation you can't print on a dark fabric or cotton you need so it's a product it's just called a easy sub Lee and I got it from Amazon I wear like five sheets of it like seriously they came just like this like you know in a in a plastic wrap and some cardboard MIDI it came just like that so well anyway come on date though you know you do the UH the transfer papers and pretty much it ain't Jaden it kind of it feels thicker than that actually but uh let's see how soft they go on I heard he goes on pretty song wait it don't feel like it right now so we also yeah I work out you want to see how it turned out quick method an intro with in the meantime Glee and then like comment subscribe pound that might live for me Edie [Music] so first things first we gotta chat down just a whole sheet this eight-and-a-half by eleven sheet of easy subtlety it did come with no direction so I'm waiting it you did I've seen a couple videos but

some money for me the difference make up your mind you did till next time", "2ycQPHTTElA": "hello beautiful people i'm here to review the cotton men's banned tea i don't know why i'm doing that but i am i was randomly searching for nice quality white t-shirts since i do love a good quality white basic tee and i stumbled upon a gq article referencing cotton and i looked it up i liked it it was inexpensive to my delight it's also canadian the company is based in toronto and they have a store in montreal in toronto another part of their company about making a better product for the planet for the people they work with egyptian cotton which is finer softer and stronger than any other cotton in the world and according to their website since they work directly with the farmers that ensures fair prices for the customers so good news for me and you and it reflects quality as well as providing farmers with better prices and business practices and then the next five years they are planning to ensure that 100 of their natural fibers are certified organic cotton also supports local ngos and with every purchase helps to fund the build out and operations of school infrastructure salaries for teachers and all of the necessary equipment and education to those in needs in rural communities the shirt comes available in white and black which i bought both of because you can never have enough white and black t-shirts literally my wardrobe is white and black when i do laundry it's white or black and if i have one color item i don't know what the hell to do with myself this is a very thick weight shirt t-shirt it's got a nice little ribbed collared pattern here nice quality good build i love the way it fits and feels there are two stores one in toronto there's one in montreal they run out of stock the times i've been there so if you want to try different sizes that's been a problem also for the band t for the men's i found that the sizing was completely off i would just like to pause this right here because this whole segment that i filmed about their size chart being wrong and inaccurate they have updated their size charts from october to now they used to show the garment size and now they're showing suggested measurement sizes to follow so in my experience what i had measured pre-wash and after wash is as follows feel free to pause if you need to the items are not pre-washed i would say try one size up and then factor in that it's gonna shrink about five percent because it will shrink even if you wash cold and you hang dry it will shrink so what i tend to do when it's out of the wash and i'm about to dry give it a little bit of tug in all directions and then let it air dry definitely don't wash it with hot water warm water i don't even know what will happen you'll end up with a t-shirt meant for your like chihuahua or something trying one size up i would basically get that result after i washed the t-shirt so this is why i have a medium because i like my shirts a little bit loose fitting it's really nice thick t-shirt as well um if you're a woman and you wear these kinds of tees you basically don't have to wear a bra with these because no one's gonna see anything because it's so thick but i mean probably most people that are watching this are going to be guys so that's not something you have to think about although i think that you guys were undershirt so no nipple showing there okay this is getting into a weird place let's move on from that like i said this is a really thick t-shirt which is really nice keeps you warm keeps nice shape feels like quality hopefully will be more resistant to little holes that you get in other t-shirts i found that the women's tea when i put them on top of each other in the store the angle of the the sleeve was a little bit more like sticks out a little bit more like upwards and it was a little bit shorter by like about an inch the large women's was the same width as the medium men's just just give you a little bit of an idea of how that is for the women's versus the men's men's tea this is like 38 canadian which for some people might be expensive but for me i will pay i'll pay like up to 80 bucks for a t-shirt i don't think i ever have though but i will because if it's quality that's the one thing that's gonna last in your wardrobe there's a good white tee a good black tee those are basics and uh pretty much takes up my entire wardrobe now i just don't do color i just can't do color because my personality is colorful enough moving on quality value price is really good i'm happy with that egyptian cotton which has really long quality fibers which translates in a better durable better quality nice soft t-shirt i've watched it a few times there's been no pilling so far that was just a brief review of cotton i really like their t-shirts now that i figured out the sizing thing which was very annoying at first i heard that the bottoms don't have that issue i heard all of the tops have that issue if you go on reddit you'll see other people noting the same problems but once you've figured out the size that you need it's pretty easy just like you can get any you can get all the other products which i haven't explored yet i know a few people that got their sweatpants sweatshirt ensemble which is like the quarantine uniform these days and they they are very happy with it so that would be my review of the cotton tee i just made this really quick and dirty review because i've heard about this brand and i feel like a lot of us are buying these staple basics now and we're more interested in slow fashion and more classic long lasting staples and i didn't see anybody really review these t-shirts so i figured i would put this online for all of you since this is a t-shirt that i've been wearing a lot a lot lately it's um very comfy very different looking it has a nice structure to it which i really like so that's it i hope this helped you out comment like share all of those stuff subscribe if you want to see my face and more and that would be it if you have any questions let me know below i will do my best to answer you peace out", "maoUzT6aYqc": "hey everyone I'm Brittany with heat press nation and in this video I'm going to show you how to sublimate a t-shirt [Music] if this is your first time with us on YouTube please subscribe to our Channel and click the notification bells so that you're up to date on new tutorials live episodes and more from heat pressed nation if you're looking for more details on sublimation we have our sublimation starts here playlist which can be watched right now by clicking the card above let's get started one of the top reasons for sublimating onto a t-shirt is that you get a photo quality image with super vibrant colors not only that but since you're dyeing the shirt the transfer doesn't feel like it's there at all also making it very light to wear lastly sublimation is a permanent solution and has fantastic wash ability if you're new to sublimation are doing your research on it here's a quick look at what you'll need to sublimate a t-shirt first is a sublimation printing system which is a specialized printer ink and paper made specially for sublimation if you want more details on these systems check out our category page at heat dot press / sublimation for this video shirt a print out my transfer with a sawgrass printer with sublogic HD ink you'll also need a heat press I'll be working with our 15 by 15 inch craft pro and of course we will need a t-shirt I'll be transferring onto a hundred percent polyester t-shirt because of the nature of the sublimation process you can't use organic materials like cotton the dye simply will not stick to it for the best most clear and vibrant results go with a hundred percent polyester I'm going to print up my design on the Sawgrass printer using the Sawgrass print manager this program optimizes my printers output so my colors will be true once sublimated it also mirrors the image by default and has a lot of other helpful functions as well notice how my printout looks a little dull and washed out this is totally normal since sublimation inks don't reach their full brilliance until heated up so once we sublimate this transfer onto our t-shirt the colors are really gonna pop we recommend using a pressing pillow for sublimation as I'll help prevent press marks from being left on polyester shirts for the sake of demonstration I'll go ahead and press my shirt without one for now we're first going to Center our shirt on the lower platen and pre press for about three seconds pre pressing the shirt helps eliminate any moisture in the shirt and also gives us a smooth flat surface to work with we're going to place our printed sublimation transfer ink side down on our shirt I'm going to eyeball the center for this demo but you can use an alignment tool like a t-square to get more professional results when placing your transfers before pressing be sure to cover your transfer with the piece of parchment paper to protect our heating element from any out gas dye or bleed through if you're using a thinner t-shirt you may need to slip a piece of parchment paper inside the shirt to block any bleed through to the back or onto your pressing pillow next I'll slide the lower platen back in and press my team for 50 seconds at 385 degrees Fahrenheit the sweet spot for sublimating garments is between 385 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 45 to 60 seconds for this particular graphic on this shirt I found that 385 degrees for 50 seconds works perfectly depending on your heat press t-shirt ink system our local climate you may find the need to use more or less heat and our time we always recommend performing several test presses with different settings to see what works best for you all right so our shirt is done since I didn't fix the transfer in place with any heat tape or adhesive spray I want to avoid shifting the hot transfer on the surface of the shirt if the ink on the transfer paper is still hot it may still release onto my shirt so if it shifts it may leave us the imprint on the shirt this would result in a blurred look that's commonly referred to as ghosting so I'm going to remove the parchment paper carefully and I'll usually give the transfer a few seconds to air cool before I pill it off and again we want to avoid the transfer from shifting so I'll just pull it off quickly like a band-aid pulling up and away from the tee and there you go we have a gorgeous sublimated t-shirt I wish you could reach into your screen and touch this shirt because it's super soft you literally cannot feel a thing this transfer is soft vibrant high-resolution permanent everything you want in a

"ZhkEmQ9v6oY": "hey guys look at what we got black and white buffalo plaid okay so you're probably thinking oh you guys had these in before but this one's a little different so this one is sherpa lined it's so soft i love it um the sleeves are not sherpa lined it's just the body um so it's nice and warm and cozy um the sleeves there's no stretch um there it's like a thicker material than the other ones the other ones are a little more lightweight um these ones are running a little bit bigger so i'm in a size small and usually i get these in a medium and i can button it up and as you can see i still have lots of room so i would say size down or if you like you know a loose comfy flannel fit then just wear your normal size um we have all the sizes guys so we have a small through 3x which is super exciting so snag these up if you missed out on the last ones and these ones are a little bit warmer for winter and they're so so cute love it so small through 3x order online or come see me have a great day bye guys", "caUlh9mGySo": "[Music] hi guys its Cristo welcome back to my channel today we're going to be sublimating on 5050 so poly-cotton blend as well as a hundred percent cotton yes you heard me correctly a hundred percent cotton I've got a onesie and we'll talk about shirt that we're gonna do a hundred percent cotton on we're in a short with the 50/50 now I don't know if you guys have heard of this or not but there is a company that is called dye press now what they have invented this has been out for a little bit I've been watching some videos on it and I finally reached out to them a while back and asked if they could send me some of these to try out on the channel and they totally agree right away they had them in them in the mouth so we're going to be not only trying today's going to be cotton but not only are we gonna be doing cotton shirts or cotton material we're going to be doing poly gloss so this is going to be four glass metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic white board and wood so we could get those Dollar Tree cups and coat it with this stuff and be able to use those in our press instead of have an order and then also they carry poly natural this is for coating wooden stone so you can get some of those nice wood you know to make some coasters and stuff coat those and be able to sublimate on those as well so any type of cutting boards so no longer having to special order anything you could run down to Walmart and grab some cups or shirts or whatever it may be and do this okay so let's start with today doing the cotton this is gonna work if you're working on white grey or colored shirts that is oatmeal she has created videos on this so I'll have those linked down below there's three different videos so you can check those out so you can learn what the Desai's are all about and all that I'm not gonna get into it just to save a little bit of time but if you have a white shirt a grey shirt or an oatmeal you're gonna want to put decider all the colors you're not gonna have to worry about this alright so first step on those will be the decider and then the next step is going to be the poly teeth this is what's gonna give us that coating like the polyester type coating and that's what's gonna make us be able to sublimate on a hundred percent cotton is we're gonna go in and I'm going to show you how to mix it up and everything walk through spraying it and we're going to press it today we're going to press it with the cricket easy press you can do the same thing with or heat press she sent me two bottles that are already just like this these are 8 ounce bottles because you want to mix 7 ounce water to each ounce of these so you need 7 ounce water 1 ounce this dirty has them so this bottle right here is the Desai's or hopefully you guys can see these so we're going to mix our the sizer in here and then the poly tea and the other one so let's get started so we need 7 ounces of water and you need to use purified water so I just I'm using bottled water from Walmart ok so I've got my bottled water and I'm gonna fill up my cup here so I've got a little measuring cup to 7 ounces all right there we go but it use a funnel these funnels come in like three in a pack I think it Walmart $4 where I got these long time ago so I'm going to pour my water in here alright just like so and I'm going to go ahead and Robert a date and pour the water in the other one do what we need to do now is I've got these little measuring cups even sent me the measuring cups into everything so I'm going to take some of the Desai's are here I'm gonna kind of mix it around just a little bit I don't think I need to but doing it anyway we need one ounce of each one so I'm gonna find where my once's are on here yeah seal on top so get that off and pour this in very carefully pour that over here all right and then what we need to do is put our lid on here and shake it up now she showed on her channel just kind of going like this a little bit and not just vigorously shaking it so that's what I'm gonna do just do this a few times and we need one else same thing we want to get this in here and then same thing she just kind of showed knocking it she just kind of showed going like this back and forth she didn't show lime vigorously shaking it so I'm just gonna kind of do what she did and if you guys notice this you guys probably noticed this right off the bat I put them in the wrong container because that's what I do so what I'm gonna do right away is I'm going to I was gonna fill that off but that's not gonna work I'm gonna have to mark them out I'm gonna have to just kind of you know scribble this I'll get some vinyl and vinyl this later you know me it's gonna be vinyl so I'm gonna go ahead and put poly T on it and then do the same thing because I already know I'm fixing me messing that up alright and then I'm gonna put D sizer there we go and all like I said I'll just put vinyl on them later but try not to do what I just did but just wanted to show that really quickly because you don't want to do these backwards obviously okay so let's go ahead and get started we've got my shirt ready to go and so I'm doing white so we need to use the B sizer so I'm gonna take a piece of cardboard I'm gonna protect my Cricut make her back there by the way so this cardboard is actually just from by those inserts that come in our chocolate or packages so I just been saving them for stuff like this okay so what we need to do is you need to spray around the area that you're going to be sublimating because obviously that's what we need to take care of right and in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and get our keys II press ready to go I'm gonna move my design out of the way we need to get our easy press to three eighty five so I'm going to push the temperature there and go all the way up to three eighty five now this first press is not going to be timed we're just doing steam so I'm gonna have that ready to go so the first thing we need to do is the decider so making sure I got the right one so what we need to do is you want to spray about where you're sublimating so go bigger than the area hopefully you guys can see all this I may have to zoom out so you want to go ahead and spray within the area where you're going to be sublimating or obviously it defeats the purpose so I'm going to spray a big enough area is what I'm just gonna do to make sure soda size there so I'm just going to make sure so you want to make sure you're coating everything very well and then she showed just kind of patting it down to kind of get that moisture in there so just want to get it nice and wet obviously I don't think she got a drench so we're just making sure that everything is getting cutted because when you look at it in person you can kind of see what's wet and what's not wet so I'm just kind of pushing that in okay and I think I'm going to go over it one more time I'm gonna press that in there so now I'm just kind of going and patting that down a little bit just making sure everything seems pretty nice too wet all right so what we need to do in our easy press is almost there I'm gonna go and get my shirt off of this and kind of rub it as well and I think she only really showed that with the poly tube I'm doing anyway but it kind of helps get that you know even on there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread this out now for this next step what you need to do is you need to take she said a piece of cotton but it has to be washed already it has to be used because if not it's got decider in it because it's no so you're just putting right on top so I'm using my husband's old white t-shirt ignore it because it looks really old and dingy so you can use a hand towel whatever it may be but you want to use a used so now what I'm going to do is we want to give that out of there so I'm going to go ahead and press until we see steam coming out okay good so once you see that steam coming out you can lift that up and move this out of the way go ahead and I'm gonna do it one more time just because sure that I'm coating the whole area where my stuff's going so I'm just going in the area where I haven't done yet so just over here on the side now if yours completely covered that area you would not need to do this again so I'm just kind of waiting for that steam to come a little bit just being super safe alright so now for the next step is we're gonna need our cardboard back Harper back in here and this time we're doing 385 for 70 seconds 385 for 70 seconds so before I forget I'm gonna change my deal over here to 70 seconds now what we need to do is spray our area and I'm gonna measure down three just make sure okay we're gonna spray our area where our image is gonna go once again so we're gonna take that poly tea this time so we're taking the poly tea and we're going to spray and coat where our image is going so we're going all the way around she shows kind of you can use your image to poop it over and spray around to get like a an area but I pretty much know I'm going to be right in here so that's just what I'm doing so I'm just making sure everything is getting nice and coated alright so that looks good to me in half like I showed a while ago and we're gonna go ahead and rub these rub this down to get that fully coated once we have it ready to go we're going to want to air dry this or you can dry it with your blow dryer or your heat press or your ez press the way that you're gonna want to do this is to get this dry a little bit I'm gonna go over just hovering over it with my iron so I'm just kind of hovering just to kind of help dry it a little bit I don't have it on there now you wouldn't want to sit here and do these one after another like that I wouldn't want to what I would do is I would a head of time Desai's my shirts and then I would come back spray em with the poly coke that way they're all ready to sublimate and then you're ready to go that way you're not back and forth back and forth with each one so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to put my image down where I want it and I'm gonna actually to kind of avoid these harsh lines I've showed you before is to kind of tear it like this I'm bringing it down so I can see where I'm putting my image all right so what I'm gonna do is come down three I know where I'm going here and you know me I can eyeball where I'm at all right so say I'm happy with where that's at she shows that you need to coat it with two pieces of parchment paper this time so we're doing 385 for 70 seconds so we're gonna go ahead and get this down remember you want to stay completely still when it comes to sublimation so I'm just going to give it some firm pressure and hit go you all right there we have it so now I need to carefully pick this up so we don't get our ghosting and there you have it so you can hear that kind of stick just a little bit and now you can see how vibrant that is now I've sublimated already before on 5050 so it's nothing new but you can see how much more vibrant that is all right so now for our last step is you want to go over this one more time with your poly T and that's gonna give it a final top coat so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put this back underneath here to protect everything got my cardboard back alright get my shirt up here and we're going to spray it with that poly T one more time just coating everything so you're just gonna go over with a nice little thin layer just like that that's gonna help hold that ink in you need to do is just press this for 10 seconds at 300 she said if you press it again at 385 at a high temp you're sublimating again so what we're gonna do I'm gonna change the temp to 300 so we're gonna hit temp come down to 300 all right now while the temperature was dropping and I need to change my time hold on now while the temperature was dropping what she did was hover again don't stick it directly on there I'm just hovering on top this is how she was drawing it as it was going down except for she was using heat pressing obviously but you just take your easy press and you're gonna hover over it as that heat is dropping plead this dry before this finished I'm dropping and that's totally okay so I don't have to hold it the whole time so I mean that's gonna get heavy it only took me about 10 15 seconds to relieve that dry so I didn't take no time at all so this last press all we need is one piece of parchment paper and we're going to go down for 10 seconds so we're gonna hit go so I've got it at 300 for 10 seconds all right there we have it now this shirt is completely finished so it's completely done now the only thing that I do notice with this is whenever you do this whole process here hopefully you guys can see this there it is and it says this heifer needs a vacation this is an image from Etsy I will link you down below the one thing I am noticing is it's given like a almost like a different right here and it feels like now it has almost like a like this is just hopefully you guys can hear this now it's not like a thick plastic or anything but it's got a coating you can tell it has a coating there I want to say because she does have like a whole group and like a Facebook page and I'll have it linked down below as well as to where people talk about you know how to use this stuff you know just basically kind of like one of those like a Facebook gun like a cricket group so anyways but there is one for this die press where they give tips and tricks so I'll leave it link down below but I think somebody said once you wash this that that all goes away so we're gonna find that out I'm gonna do that before I sell this because I'm gonna sell this down at my booth so I will let you know how that works out so there's that isn't it awesome how cool is that and this is about 50/50 because 50-50 doesn't usually come out this bright so I'm really excited about that now let's do some hundred percent cotton this cute little tee here this is another one of those wonder tees I got from Walmart I told you guys the other day this is a hundred percent cotton and I'm gonna show you guys this is that one donation higher percent cotton I'm gonna bring it up hopefully you guys can see the information there 100% cotton we're going to take our cardboard once again I'm gonna get our cute little shirt down and the first step that we're gonna do is cover it with the Desai's or making sure I'm grabbing the right one and we're gonna cover the area so I know about where this is going so I'm just going to go over it again and like I said she was kind of padding which is just kind of pushing the the Desai's are into the material you know how if you get something wet it kind of wants to hover on top for just a second so until it soaks just to kind of speed that up a little bit pushing right in now like I said I'm probably going excess with the Desai's er you really don't need to use this much but I'm just making sure I want to coat everything so obviously I'll get the fill about the more I play with this stuff all right I cannot wait to play with the other ones and get some dollar tree mugs okay so same thing I'm gonna fold this in half and kind of push on that just a little bit to kind of really get that in there now we need to bump our temperature back up to the 385 all right and this one we're just doing the steam and this one we're just pressing until you see that steam I think it took about 15 seconds last time I had a cleaner spot so you guys aren't having to look at that ugliness of it all right so I'm gonna press and oh I don't know why I hit the timer I didn't need to hit the timer but I hit 10 seconds so let's see if it does it in 10 seconds I guess if not we'll hit time again I guess we could kind of figure out how long it takes I'm gonna hit it again all right so about 30 seconds is what that took to get that steam out okay you bring our cardboard back in all right just like so and we need to do that 70 seconds again I'm gonna take our poly tea and we're going to coat it so we need to coat it to where whoever our image is going to be all right so once we've got that coated I'm gonna fold it in half and rub that in and I'm gonna go ahead and move this out of the way rubbing a little bit easier and better try not to stretch my shirt obviously there we have it so what I've been doing to protect my my mat I didn't mention that before is I've got down a piece of just paper is what it is this is just butcher paper I've got that down and then we're going to take our image for this one here we're gonna do like a fourth of July theme so it's gonna be America alright so we need to make sure and cover this until that's pretty much dry you really would want to do this stuff just ahead of time so you're not sitting here having to individually dry these because you can air dry them and that way they're just completely ready to go and the last step you're having to do is cover them with the Polish brain one more time all right so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get this down just kind of making sure it's where I need it to be I didn't do this on the last one but I want to try it on this one is I want to use that die trans pro-spray that's gonna help hold this down I know it's not going to shift and you can use the tape as well but let's try it and see if it works with this product are you giving it a second all right so just making sure and going where I need to be all right so say that looks good to me now I've got that in place I also mentioned and I want to try it this time she used a piece of just regular copy paper but I'm gonna use butcher paper and then she used her two pieces of parchment paper just to protect the parchment paper so you can use them more so they don't yellow right so or get the ink coming through so we're going to hit go 70 seconds all right pull all of our paper is here and now we're going to peel this off there you have it this is a hundred percent cotton so hopefully you can see that there it is sublimating on 100% cotton how cool is that 100% cotton so let's see if I can see the ring on this one I don't really see the ring as much as I do now obviously you can see where my press was setting but I don't see it like I did on the other one so I don't know if it's because it was a blend but this is 100% cotton and I'm not having that now you can feel the difference so this is you can hear and this is t-shirt and then that I brought you over to my mic so you guys could hear a little bit better so anyways but look how cool that is 100% cotton so you can go down to Walmart and get some of these t-shirts you can go down Target wherever it may be somewhere locally grab some t-shirts and make them and so wouldn't that be awesome to be able to have on hand so I'm really excited about this stuff and I mean look at how much I have less so far from doing two t-shirts oh really don't take much if you guys can see that there's still pretty much full it's hard to tell you but I just I've used a lot of decider I think I've used too much all right now let me go ahead and quickly the last step that we have to do is protect this with one more top coat of that poly tea but I'm going to set this aside and let's go ahead and do two baby onesies really quick so these are 100% organic cotton from Walmart and we're going to be 282 different design so I'm gonna go ahead and cut these down cut them in half just really heavy and then we're gonna start on our process really quick just so we have these I want to make sure they're gonna fit because I haven't double-check those you know I've already printed these once again all these images I got from Etsy and I will have them linked down below so that's gonna fit on there very well and then same with this cute little cat one okay so let's go ahead and get going so two little onesies and I'm gonna spray them at the same time so I can be do them together get our onesies and I'm gonna get both of them up here hopefully you guys with us and both and I'm gonna spray em both at the same time okay one is the 12 months 1 2 3 to 6 months so remind me unifor and over here cow cuz we're gonna forget you I'm already gonna tell you this size our first so we're gonna go over both of those so just kind of spritzing those just making sure wherever that image is gonna go that we've got it spritzed pushing that in I'm gonna go ahead move over to the next one and it's super hot in my she shed right now because I'm waiting to get my I'm still working guys another lot of you guys have questions what's going on that I have so much it's just been crazy we saw have everything to do basically I mean just well basically I've got to go to Ikea and we're gonna do that at the end of the month and I need to put my floors in and that's pretty much it but um my I've got to get my mini split you know my air conditioner but I can't turn on my fan because it's super loud for the video and I'm dying right so anyways I'm gonna finish spritzing these really well alright am I gonna fold these in half this I'm not gonna worry about it all right we're just gonna make sure they're spritz okay so what I'm gonna do well actually I'm gonna fold them in half I'm getting them off of here so there we go so you can see how we're protecting our workspace get this down now I could use my 6 by 7 and I think that's what I'm actually gonna do I'm gonna move this guy out of the way and let's use our 6 by 7 to sublimate all right now this one's gonna be the same thing where we need the cotton t-shirt as you guys can see me and my husband went out on the boat this weekend and I got super sunburned so it's been great we're gonna be pulling out the steam what we're using for this one is the cotton t-shirts I'm going to cover up our onesie and I'm gonna go ahead and press now this one there's no time we're just pressing until that steam comes out giving it firm pressure steam coming up so now I'm gonna pull this off and this one is ready to go let this one aside and press the next one we're ready to go so I'm going to spray it again now with a poly tea so we're gonna grab these cut down our cardboard here and I'm gonna spritz both of these with that poly tea so I'm gonna go ahead and get these on here you may not be able to see them both but they're both here okay well let's go ahead and get that poly T so for the pointy once again you're just spritzing where you're working all right so same thing you're gonna want to fold them in half fold them in half and I'm gonna move them over to rub them Medwin rub it so I can make sure that's nice and even try not to shake my camera everywhere for the 12 months we are going to have the unicorn right ahead and dry this I'm just hovering it over now this one I'm not going to use the spray I'm gonna do it without and so now we're gonna go ahead and get our image down about where I want it to be so say I'm happy with that I can see it you guys I think you guys can lightly see it so I can kind of see where I'm going with this just stick it down just like that I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing where I've got the I've got three layers here so I've got the paper but put your paper and then the parchment paper I'm gonna get these down and then I'm going to go ahead and get my iron down on here so just like this and I'm gonna hit go 70 seconds all right with this out of the way movies and pull this up there we have it super cute 100% cotton organic cotton it's that if that it's 100% organic cotton look at that on a percent cotton how awesome it's hot so I'm trying to hold it here and with a crooked easy breast um once again I don't really see that outline like I did on that first one so I must have overdid maybe the desizing or even the spritz I'm not too sure but there you have it how freaking cute is that it says whatever I do what I want in that cute with that uniform we put this on that cup a while back okay so I'm gonna set this out of the way already got it ready to go so all we're gonna do is let's dry it just a little bit um same thing once again you wouldn't have to go through this if you pre did this and let them air dry I think that's ready to go this one is going to be new to the herd with these foot with cows I know it's backwards until we press it but look how cute so what we're going to do is line this up once again I can see through it y'all may not be able to and we're going to get this down I'm gonna go ahead and do the pro-spray again alright so I'm gonna go ahead and get that about where I want it so say I'm happy with it here making sure my shirt is flat same thing I've got my butcher paper and my three pieces my three pieces no two pieces of parchment paper I'm going to be making sure I'm staying right between where I need to be and just get this down just like so and hit go first so we're gonna pick this up alright and we're gonna put these out of the way now one thing I want to mention too with this spray as well as this because it sticks down you can always test so in case I didn't get over here over here you could always test it first and take a little peek so say you see how peaking like that I can actually lay it back down and go again and I wouldn't have to worry about ghosting because it's got such a strong grip on it now I'm going to kill this off and there you have it super cute look at how cute that is new to the herd Oh cute look at those colors 100% cotton organic cotton I'm gonna show you guys really quick um organic cotton is what it says Gerbert organic cotton there you go I don't maybe a little bit blurry this one's a three to nine months but look at how cute once again on this one I can't really see the difference on here you can see where my iron was but you have a little bit of that scratch hopefully you guys can hear that bringing it over and compared to the shirt not as bad I really think I just overdid it on my first shirt but there you are I love it so cute awesome okay so for the final step all we have to do is we've got these last three here we just need to spray them one more time with that poly tea now what you want to do is you want to air dry these first because know they need to be dry and then we're gonna press them at 300 for 10 seconds so I'm gonna go and change my timer but what I would do once again if I was doing a bunch of these at once I would go ahead and let them air dry and then come back later and get them all at one time so I'm not having to hover over these or blown with a blow dryer so I'm gonna go and bring my temperature my temperature I brought my temperature down to 300 now I'm bringing my time down to 10 all right while that temperature is dropping I thought I go ahead and talk about these one more time they're you know eight ounce bottles so like you could get them bigger though you can get them in bigger bottles like this like the 16 ounces and stuff but the 8 ounce bottles you're gonna need the decider and you're gonna need the eight outs now if you're doing colored shirts don't worry about this just spray it with the poly tee and then you're ready to go with that if it's colored but if it's white gray or oatmeal color you want to push the potion put the v-slicer but think about it this way with eight ounces it takes one ounce of this for each bottle and then the water so you're gonna get eight bottles each of this stuff right here so you can see how much I've used hopefully you guys can see that I've barely used anything hopefully I'm trying to hold it cuz if I hold it sideways it's gonna go this way so let me put right here so I'm only used to right about here where my thumb is on this one I've probably excessively used that I've went to right about there but you're gonna get eight of these eight ounce because each one's gonna fill up to eight ounces you're gonna get eight of these so that's how much clothing you can do I mean quite a bit and like I said I go ahead and and do all the ones that you need but you do not need the decider so if you weren't doing the on the colored shirts you're only gonna need this one bottle which is decisive but remember I marked it out and put poly tea crystals can a vinyl that so you would only need one of these if you're gonna be doing just colored shirts so it's pretty awesome and then like I said they've got other stuff too so you can do the poly gloss which you will be seeing very soon I'm fixing to be going and I might get some Dollar Tree cups I'm gonna get some Walmart cups and I'm gonna get maybe some like the glass cutting cutting trays and stuff like that and then with the poly natural maybe I'll do some tiles and stuff - I'll get several things because like I said it is for the gloss let's say it one more time it's metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic whiteboard and wood so I will have a bunch of these items to try with that when we do that video very very soon with the wooden stone you can do it on those awesome pieces of wood you can do it on the cutting boards stone stuff like that and so I will have some of those to work with this so I'm pretty excited now with those two so the decides are you're gonna need this stuff here it is called catalyst I'm gonna take it out just yet but there it is by press catalyst and this is when you use the poly gloss or poly satin or the poly natural okay so you add one milliliter shippable of measuring things in there she's just like really I mean was a she made it perfect for me to be able to fill it up with the little measuring cups to display bottles gonna send a huge shout-out out to die press for sending these to me to try and like I said for the quick response and the fast delivery I asked and you guys delivered quick so I really truly appreciate that and so here we go so let's finish up these shirts last things we need to do is add the poly tee one more time lightly Kellie make sure everything gets its moist with it right this again protection everybody and everything alright alright there we go alright this time I'm going to show you just using your hair dryer to speed this up it's like that you're done it's really fast move that guy out of the way and I'm going to point this out it doesn't matter what drop blow-dryer you use this one's more expensive so don't go buy this one but the point this is just what I have it's just became my craft tool I've taken it from the kids my point is if you if yours has this nozzle or if you can make by this attachment separately super cheap I highly recommend that you use this nozzle because it it directs that air perfectly so when you're using this in the craft room it doesn't blow anything anywhere and it really directs that heat so highly recommend whatever dryer you get whether it's a ten dollar dryer make sure it has one of these or if you can attach one that way you can direct this however you want to you thing I'm gonna point out really fast is that I just now noticed when you spray that final coat of poly tea and don't over spray or you're going to make that bleed okay so you're going to end up making that blade you see where you can kind of see around that so don't over spray it with that poly tea now this one you can see nothing happened because I didn't know where spray that so be careful not to over saturate and I could tell you because this was really wet so just a tip alright so we just need one piece of parsnip for these and I'm gonna just go over it for ten seconds just like that so all the shirts completely done and ready to go toss that out of my way and bring in this one here cover it up here it go alright so there we have it's completely done so once it's not ten seconds you're good to go like I said be careful not to over spritz I'm going to slip it out of the way and we've got our last one here so America what I'm gonna try to do with this is turn it this way and put my press on there this way I'm gonna you can see I didn't know I didn't know where spray on that one either so I'm gonna hit go oh gee so there you have it so you have America and actually it looks like it did use so tiny bit there on the sea so just try not to over spray on that so there's booze and then here's this one there we go super cute love it and then while we're trying here's our first one we did and you can see how obviously did not overspray on that one I did really good look how vibrant that one now this is 50/50 so if you spray on 50/50 you're gonna get even more vibrant than before so basically when you're spraying on hundred percent cotton you can see that's a little bit lighter and I know there are two different images but you can see this is 50/50 so half polyester half cotton and before if I did it without the spray this is the color tone you would have had with this so basically these kind of are now like 50/50 cotton if you if that makes sense but before you could not sublimate at all on cotton and make it stay without washing it out but this type of color tones is what would have been in this but because this was without spray look at how vibrant it was like BAM so I'm pretty excited about that so huge shout out to die press for sending this stuff to us and letting us test it out super exciting about that highly recommend that you check this stuff out maybe we can sublimate on 100% cotton and so I'm really excited we can do dish towels all kinds of stuff possibilities are endless so stay tuned we got two more trials to do with two more different type of videos for the poly gloss and they're probably natural so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "dFRQ_zgNT7o": "i ordered a 3x thinking it was going to run smaller as most shirts purchased online do well i was wrong this is definitely a 3x wide but i'm not dissatisfied at all i love the bold writing although i'm not a football fan my fiance is a huge philadelphia eagles fan and hates the cowboys with a passion so i bought it for him one thing he doesn't like about the shirt is that nowhere on it says eagles so people keep asking him who he roots for all in all he loves the shirt so i'm happy with my purchase my fiance is a huge eagles fan so naturally i had to buy this for him it fit great he's 6 ft 4 and i got him an xl the quality is great and it doesn't do much shrinking must have for any eagles fan that are cowboys haters they have others i will definitely be getting great shirt for football sunday with friends the real fun is when only half of the shirt gets read only the back or only the front they eventually figure it out i love the shirt bought it for my boyfriend a die-hard philly fan can't wait till he sees it thank you so much i bought this for my dallas hating stepmom last christmas it is hilarious and she loved it was a gift for me eagles loving husband he loves it fits him perfect my fiance love the shirt it was a christmas present funny and appropriate for my son since he loves the eagles and hates the cowboys [Music] you", "ged7YDadVCg": "hi i'm jessica welcome to my channel today's fashion video is going to be some graphic tees from target my target was very picked over last time i went there but i did find some graphic tees that i love and i want to show them to you so let's go ahead and jump into the video [Music] first up is this pink floyd t-shirt i really like this one it is 60 cotton 40 polyester it's a really soft material now the color is really like a dark dark blue almost like a dark dark navy but blue black kind of color it's really flattering i really liked the color and a lot of you guys really liked this shirt on instagram so i already have this linked on my like to know i will link all the t-shirts here that i'm showing you but i wanted to go ahead and show you how i actually would style this if i just wanted it a little bit more than just a t-shirt and jeans so i just picked out my flannel shirt and on cold summer nights i i have cold summer nights or chili at least i would wear this and then during the day i would just wear the flannel around my waist i've seen a lot of people do this this is really a popular look and i also have it on with chucks so i really like this look like this another look that i like would be great for like a ballpark kind of night would be just a hat jeans and the checks again now moving on to the next shirt this is the rolling stones t-shirt that you've seen on instagram a lot it's 100 cotton and they've had this at target for a while so i don't know how long that they'll keep this in stock but right now they do have these at target and online so this is like a really good t-shirt material it's 100 cotton so it's gonna get softer in the wash the more you wash it and it's going to get that faded look and i really like that about my t-shirts now here is a different way to style this other than just jean shorts just throw on a skirt and if you're going out and about you could just put on some some chucks but if you wanted it a little bit more fancier you could also dress it up which i'm about to show you here so i threw on my open toe booties i did find a similar pair to these but these are like two years from target and i also have this leather jacket or a faux leather jacket that i got from target last year and i have a similar link for that as well moving on to this palm trees tank top i really like how high this is this would be this would be a really good swimsuit cover up but it would also be a really good piece to wear to the gym actually all these t-shirts would be really good to wear to the gym but it's got a nice length i like the cut on the sides like that v cut i find that really really flattering on a lot of women and you could tuck it in you could untuck it but you could also wear it with your mom jeans now you guys loved these mom jeans you guys loved these and i love them too as well but i have these on with some fake birkenstocks i actually recommend going on poshmark to find birkenstocks because they will be cheaper now moving on to the next one this is the sublime t-shirt this is 50 cotton 50 polyester now i really like this shirt but my son was like that is really scary but anyways i have it paired with my lululemon um pants that are really really comfortable to hold you in they are really great for working out because they are very squat proof i have also my black adidas on i could not find a link for these but you could probably find them on poshmark and another way you could wear them is with some black denim shorts and i have my cheetah shoes on these are still in stock and they also have girls sizes as well now moving on to the beach boys t-shirt i really really love this t-shirt because it has the frayed look at the collar and it was really comfortable i really loved this shirt and if i hadn't kept a different shirt you'll have to watch my instagram to see which shirt i kept then i would have kept this one and this one is 100 cotton so it will get softer and more worn in the more you wash and dry it and but just be sure when you're you're dry for the first time don't dry it on high heat because it will shrink now i have this paired with those same black denim shorts and a hat and some chucks so i really like this look it's like kind of like a beachy california look to me i don't i don't know if you guys see that or not but yeah it's one of my favorite looks i love those black denim shorts and then on the cool summer nights you could throw on a denim jacket and you're set i wanted to also show you guys my jewelry collection here these are from the same person my friend june she's a mother of four and somehow in her spare time even though she doesn't have that much spare time she makes these earrings and a part of her proceeds goes to help women in need i love these and these you know i just love all of them and she has so many different styles textures cuts i mean these are knots these have little gold on them and yeah all kinds of things that she likes to um all the time all kinds of textures and colors and stuff this is what i'm trying to get to um but i will leave her instagram here and you can contact her and see what types of earrings she has at the moment let's see i think these three are new to me so she might still have those but i'm not sure about the other ones she might have one or two left but for the most part i think she has these right now okay guys that's it

forms of printing sublimation and did you know that you can now sublimate on our Caesar glitter stick around and I'll show you how all right now we're on the application portion you'll have your sublimated prints ready to go cut down we're gonna have our cuttable glitter cut down weeded ready to go we're gonna have our heat press set to 180 degrees Celsius or 365 degrees Fahrenheit you're going to be at a medium medium to firm pressure now the big perk about sublimating on to glitter is you are not only restricted to polyester you can also print on cotton and dark garments so now we're gonna get these ready to go for upcoming trade shows so we're gonna start by preheating our cotton t-shirt we're gonna do a front and back can use our heap heat transfer pillow in case you have any kind of obstruction in the way so we can get even pressure which is very important in this process now we're going to preheat for two to three seconds okay now the first step is taking your glitter finding your spot where you want to place it now normally you'll be at 320 degrees if you were just working with glitter but since we're doing sublimation we're gonna keep it at 365 Fahrenheit we're only gonna tack this for 2 to 3 seconds hot peel okay now we're going to be going on to the sublimation portion so we're going to grab our sublimated transfers line them up over our glitter pieces now if you think it's going to shift out at registration you have your heat tape that you're able to apply directly on to your sublimated transfer and what this will do is keep this in place when your Heat pressing and avoid shifting so you don't get ghosting or anything like that just apply two small pieces in each corner now we're going to go back and hit this for a full 60 seconds alright just peel a cup pieces off now we're gonna go back and do the front and now since there's buttons on this shirt we're gonna make sure they're off the press because with the amount of temperature and time these will potentially melt so make sure you have the opposite side with the buttons hanging off your press we're going to take our heat transfer pillow preheat it for 2-3 seconds grab our glitter cut piece we're going to hate it for two to three seconds take our sublimated cut piece find a registration and to keep it in place we are going to add some heat transfer tape now we're going to go back and hit it for the full 60 seconds we're gonna peel that hot that's a pretty awesome process isn't it you can do the exact same thing today now Caesar doesn't manufacture the printers the Pink's or the paper but if you want to find out more about the cuttable heat transfer vinyl glitter please contact us at cesar na komm or visit your nearest authorized caesar distributor for more information

"into this video I'm gonna show you guys fight each it's at four different price points and then in this video I'm gonna break down completely to show you guys how much you need to spend on a t-shirt not just a normal t-shirt a good fitting well durability shirt here in India what's up my stylish people via sham welcome back to the channel the best place for shopping hauls output inspiration shopping and styling tips for men yes you can see all black t-shirts here and in this video we are going to compare for different price points one at 99 rupees and other at 399 rupees third price point is at $7.99 and forties at $12.99 going to the first price point in the t-shirt number one this I got it from DeMott yes demet is not an appropriate place to buy a t-shirt but I got this in d-mat and if you see this very closely it is from a brand called mark and if you see this it is priced at 125 rupees but I got at 99 and the size is XL my general t-shirt size would be medium but however don't go by the sizing what's written on the label here when you go for d-mat or something like that specific stores for shopping just try it out I tried it out and it fits well even though it is exercise it fits well to me which generally a medium size should fit me I'm not XL for sure in this complete video I'm just gonna break this down into three components one is durability value and fit coming to the fit it fits incredibly well I tested the durability by watching it twice it's durable but however I have to mention one important aspect of this this is not it pitch black color here if you see they have used the die of very poor quality so that is the reason when I bought this itself it's not a good quality you will be good to go if you want to wear it once or twice or you want to layer it under your check shirt or jackets however if you want to wear it cap for a casual outing or if you want to go outside it's not of ideal quality guys when it comes to the value yes if you can see the fit it is a good value however if you consider the quality not so good I just don't want to take my decision on the rupees 99 price point just with one t-shirt so I have included the second one as well this I got it from Decathlon this is also priced at 99 and I got this in a size of medium yes even though it is medium that t-shirt XL fits like a medium size this one even its medium it fits me like a large size so but however fit is not that great but the quality is great and they use the hundred percent cotton one and the material is so soft for the price point what you are getting I feel that if you have to go for the 99 rupees and if you don't want the best fit or you can size it down this one as well I think this is the best one to go moving on to the next price point here we are entering the three 99 rupees price point and I wanted to go with a well known brand even I can get the t-shirts from different brands I just want to go with the well-known brand in the form of jockey and here I have gone with a v-neck t-shirt I dread getting the round neck for the black t-shirt but unfortunately I couldn't so I have bought the v-neck t-shirt in black color there are only subtle differences in terms of suede when it comes to the v-neck t-shirt as well as the round neck t-shirt so I have gone for this day I have the jockey t-shirts in many colorways so durability I can give 10 out of 10 when it comes to the plate it fits incredible guys for example it will make a normal guy like me to look like a well-built guy when I'm wearing these t-shirts if you have a decent build these t-shirts which you so well I feel that for the price point of 399 you are going to get the best durability as well as the best fit with this jockey t-shirt and anyone if you want to buy a t-shirt at this price point you can just blindly go for this moving on to this price point number three and we are entering the loop is $7.99 price point in this price point also I do have multiple options but however when we are entering or when we are crossing that 800 rupees price point I always feel that the fabric materials it should be differentiating with the normal hundred rupees or 350 shirt I have gone with the bamboo cotton t-shirt I've got this from a brand called Allister brat and I got this in a size of four small durability wise this brand it is a hit or miss I have the maroon color as well as the olive green t-shirt grand guarantee on the durability of this particular band but however but this material feels so good on your skin during the summer season when it comes to face these fits so good it fits just right and when it comes to value I feel for a price point of 600 or 500 desirable value but even the bamboo cotton is a little bit premium but still I don't see the value of 800 rupees for this t-shirt and if you consider the next one what you're going to see at the price point of 1300 you don't see the need of spending 800 rupees on this t-shirt moving on to the price point number four and the last price point for this video is this $12.99 yes it is a little pricey for a few of you guys to spend more than thousand rupees for a t-shirt however I assume that all the t-shirts are on the retail price and you may get these t-shirts on discount during the sale times but however I don't see much of a discount on that this t-shirt as well as the iris to Brad but sometimes you may get it on discount and I got one of the olive green t-shirts of the previous brand for 300 rupees for the price it's a best bargain but however I'm considering that I am reviewing these t-shirts on the full retail price whether they are worth it or not this is the t-shirt from Marks & Spencer in a size of medium it's a David Gandy collection and this is the premium line of t-shirts which uses the modal fabric and this fabric it feels so smooth on the skin and it fits next to your body with best fitting at your arms exposing your triceps and making your arms look big as well as fitting snug at the chest area with enough room at the waist area unlike all the t-shirts in this video the t-shirt to length is also perfect for this t-shirt however for $12.99 it is a hard sell but if you want to see the games on a longer run please the best by coming to my opinion I have actually two winners here but I have to finalize on one so I am going with this jockey t-shirt at 399 you can get a best fitting t-shirt with the best value for whatever you pay and with good durability however if you have the money if you want to spend anything more than thousand rupees on a t-shirt my simple recommendation would be go for modal fabric t-shirts like a David Gandy collection t-shirts from ox and Spencer you will not regret and you've got the answer how much you should spend on a t-shirt here in India prope 399 and you are good to go I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did so please click the like button and subscribe to this channel

before you do anything hear me out i have been thinking about starting a series where it's like back to school outfits something aesthetic so today's video is gonna be back to school outfits comfy aesthetic what if i did multiple videos like this but different aesthetics that you guys suggest whether it be like 90s y2k indie just comment it down below and i will style back to school outfits for you thank you for hearing me it's been a while i feel like i start off every single video with it's been a while i feel like i wasted so much of my youth wearing a school uniform every single day so then when i went to uni i would wear whatever i wanted but some days i just wanted to be comfortable so today's video is all about how to be cute but comfortable like i just rolled out a bed but you don't know that because i look so good right so i've got a oversized hoodie on that i got from brandy melville and then i'm literally just wearing it with like a cropped singlet i'm gonna pair it with some airforce ones like does anyone else just like not tie their laces i literally just tuck it underneath and i'm wearing a pair of jeans from princess polly [Music] it's so cute it's also really nice and baggy so you can zip it up if you want oh it's cold let's zip up the hoodie oh it's hot let's take it up if you ever just want to roll out of bed and like just not bother with anything a bright colored hoodie or any colored hoodie or even just like a gray hoodie with a pair of jeans and some sneakers my personal fave oh that was right my face if there is one staple shoe you need in your wardrobe it's these ones i wear them with anything and everything a pair of baggy jeans [Music] and i love the champion hoodies just because they're like the perfect oversized fit so i would probably pair this outfit with like a necklace maybe i just bought like a chunkier chain and it's not here yet so i probably would have worn that with this outfit but for now we're gonna have to stick with this little dainty baby this is literally one of my favorite outfits i have to say so what i've got on is just a random white t-shirt collar's peeking through and i got this vest from uniqlo it's like a black vest and i'm wearing it with a pair of gray track pants i saw danny sierra wear this and she looks amazing so i'm gonna wear it [Music] so let me show you what it looks like with jeans i don't have enough space in my room to like film easily so we're just gonna have to stick with the poses i actually don't know what season i'm dressing for but switch out the jeans or the pants with like a short a pair of shorts or a scarf it's really hot or if you're really stupid like me wear this outfit in 30 degree heat i do that all the time and i go outside and i regret it instantly wear a sweater of some sort oh my god the sweater has a logo what color is the logo it's purple match your bottoms to whatever is on your your sweater if you can and you've got like an outfit that's comfortable what else is comfortable flannel pants hey [Music] we so this is probably my favorite outfit ever and for my summer people this is perfect it's an oversized tie-dye tee so this is a size extra large i got it from butter goods from lo-fi store again and this is my favorite part [Music] these shorts and they're lavender and they're the softest like sweatpant material with some blue jordans yes okay so this outfit's actually cute as hell if i do say so myself i bought this colored shirt from the school uniform section at a shop called target i bought it and i cut it so when i wear under like sweaters it doesn't get overly hot and then i bought this sweater from uniqlo and it's the perfect shade of blue and then these pants are from a store called oh hey girl store i'm not sure if they exist anymore but i will find a dupe this one's kind of got like a school uniform vibe to it because there's a lot of schools here that have like this kind of blue uniform you know what i mean this is a really warm outfit so if you want to make it a little bit like summery i'm not sure if you can call a jumper somewhere but let me show you what you can do this is also one of my personal faves i'm literally wearing the exact same thing i wore before except i've swapped the jumper for a nike one i got off a sauce and i love this one grab any flannel your singlet and i got these pants from uniqlo i feel like uniqlo has so many good basics at a really good inexpensive price this is what i call my madison beer outfit because i feel like she wears stuff like this all the time so i'm just wearing like an oversized jumper the collar's attached kind of wish it wasn't because i would have preferred like a white collar maybe i can bleach it and it's got like pockets right here and i'm pairing it with a pair of black shorts but it's just like a simple fit that i that you can pair with any shoe because it's just like great you know how far can i bend so this finishes up my video if it's too hot switch out the sweater for like a t-shirt or something like that i love oversized t-shirts during the summer just because so much air so much air just comes through it's like your own personal aircon these are all my outfits that i would wear to wherever i'm going whether it's school uni or college if i just wanted to be comfortable and cozy you know i hope you guys enjoy and again if there is any aesthetic that you want me to try and style for like school outfits or whatever comment down below see you guys hopefully next week bye does anyone ever just smell their cat

[Music] [Music] it's going on what's going on what is going on we are back with a late night show and I am doing this late night show for a couple of reasons one I wanted to address a topic that is very very sensitive okay and the reason I chose to do it late night is I wanted late night shows tend to be a little bit more calm you know a lot of silliness tends to have gone out during the day all right a lot of the trolls tend to be gone to hell on about their business and when you're discussing something like this you know man it could be triggering it can be triggering because you know as an image consultant I know one thing the subject of weight is touchy touchy at best but we got to talk about it we got to talk about it because it keeps getting brought up okay it keeps getting brought up I even had a someone earlier today super chat me this question and I'm gonna put it in the chat room I'm gonna no I'm gonna miss that person's name but the name but the question was this you see the name you see what it says I'm 27 year old female 27 year old female educated but I have a hundred pounds to lose never had a boyfriend you inspire me and I ready to make change but I'm fearful that my sexual market value in time running out as I get my life together to prepare for marriage any advice all right so let me say this first off do you the woman who wrote that there are some things about this country and in the kind of food we have in this country that lead to some very passionate discussion you know very passionate discussion in the comments section I actually wrote down included a link talking about Spelman College and how Spelman College got rid of its entire college athletic program in 2012 what the what they notice that Spelman is the incoming freshman classes the incoming freshmen women we're coming in overweight now if you've ever been to college you've heard the freshman 15 the freshman 15 it says every freshman is gonna gain 15 pounds their first year in college because you're away from home you're staying up late night you eatin snacks and candy and junk food I mean you're just out so everyone assumes that the freshman year someone's gonna gain 15 pounds all right let's take a snapshot back in 1960 their average height of an American male was 5 foot 10 and he weighed 165 pounds female counterpart was 5 foot 4 and weighed 120 pounds fast forward to 2010 the average height of a man is still 5 foot 10 and he's moved up 3 pounds the average woman is at 5 foot 4 yet she's moved up to 166 pounds women have moved up over 40 pounds as a whole on a whole women have moved up 40 pounds and then when you adjust that for you know like the black community it's even it's even more so it is not uncommon to just take a this go out if you think I'm lying go out and prove it to yourself it is not uncommon to go out and see women of a certain women of any age 60 weighing as much or more than her male counterparts okay we said it again it is not uncommon to see women of any young women in particular weighing more as much of more than their male counterparts and you got to know one thing this is definitely having this is without a doubt in an already competitive market being overweight and obese does not help your chances something I personally have noticed is that as overall weight has gone up the murder rate has gone down and I'm not saying this causation I'm just saying I've noticed a correlation and it's no secret that men especially higher value men value a woman's beauty and when and bottom line is ladies a lot of about your beauty has to do with the weight that's why you hear to refrain height weight dress size it's not meant to embarrass you it's meant to crystallize so we got to talk about it shut up to obsidian cuz he keeps asking this question what comes next for Generation X women over 40 this whole gender war back and forth blah blah blah blah blah we've had 20 plus years to do this the game is over what's next what's your hospice plan what's the end-of-life plan if you're 45 plus you don't have time to be playing games it's 20 year olds play it's over you got you better start making plans and what are you going to do the question is for Generation X Millennials and venules is your weight keeping you single and I took this part of the video off because I knew YouTube would likely flag the video the second part of it is it's your weight single keeping you single will you die alone it's in the description but I took it off because I didn't want to trigger anybody unnecessarily but that's what we're gonna talk about is your weight keeping you single and if so are you headed towards living and dying alone alright so here's what we got to talk about here's what we got to talk about Zoom Zoom Zoom is going to be available yes but we got to get into this the average American woman is 5 foot 4 and 166 68 pounds that's true so I need you ladies to understand something that whatever your race is there is no racial component that says this particular race is thicker weighs more especially in the black community we got this thing about you know our body types and all this other stuff those differences have nothing to do with what we're seeing with people it has more to do with diet and lack of exercise sugar sugar fat sugar fat salt the three components of the Bliss point now I know a lot of women will come back and say well Waldo there are a lot of overweight and obese men too and you won't get an argument for me but here's the difference men are judged the same way as women an overweight man can land a beautiful guy an overweight man can become rich and land a beautiful swimsuit model for a wife a rich overweight woman cannot necessarily do the same so let's we can't talk about the comparisons yeah well this this is something you're gonna have to firmly look at in your situation so let's get into it you might want to raise their hand who in the chat room is really dealing with being overweight and if you're more than what is it and what does it mean to be obese let's look at the definition of obese before before I start talking about it what is the definition of obese what qualifies someone for being obese body mass index is a measure body mass index is a measure which takes into account to toast the person's total weight and height someone with the BMI of 26 or 27 is about 20% overweight which is generally believed to be a moderate health risk a BMI of 30 or more is considered to be obese if you have a BMI of more than 30 you are obese so let's say you are 5 foot 4 let's let's say you like some of the women who called into the show you're 5 foot 5 and you're 170 pounds okay now five foot five no no what's wrong sorry 5 foot 4 and a hundred and seventy pounds Wow and I'm gonna be honest man I don't believe if you're five foot four and you weight 175 pounds that gives you a BMI of 30 that means you are obese okay if you were five foot five and you weigh 180 you have a BMI of 30 you're obese so understand something five for 175 obese no matter how you slice it but let's go ahead and say you let's go ahead and drop you down to the godfather' standard five for 120 pounds congratulations yo but BMI of twenty point six so we got to get into it there's no it really shouldn't be surprising that let me say this as gently as possible if 80 percent four out of five women are overweight and 80 percent of that number is plus 30 plus percent BMI or obese that's not good and especially is not good if you're a woman under 27 years old well a woman under 30 let me just back it up if you're a single woman no children you have absolutely no reason to be overweight or obese unless there is something medically wrong with you and my ex-wife had grave disease she had that thyroid condition I'm going to tell you it is exceedingly rare my mother-in-law had lupus so when I hear people talk about thyroid and also the kind of stuff I'm sorry I've only known three women in my life to actually be diagnosed with Graves disease I find it impossible that I was sitting on YouTube we find so many people with thyroid problems if you are now understand something just because you maybe not because you may be 5 foot 4 and under ooh under 30 BMI that that ain't nothing cheerful let's say somebody you know said they was 5 foot 4 or 160 pounds let me let you know what your BMI is their BMI is 27 you're you're overweight anybody over 20% hold on someone was a 26 or 27 it's about 20% overweight so you were overweight a healthy weight is considered to be a 24 or less on the BMI standard so to be a healthy weight you need to be five foot four and a 135 pounds or less if you're over 135 pounds you're overweight how is this affecting your dating life is it affecting your dating life well I will say from an image standpoint it most definitely does first off popular designers popular designer and dressmakers and things like that do not make their sizes size runs don't go larger than an 8 or 10 you may find something to go to 10 but the typical size runs don't go that high the typical men's size is 40 see me I'm a perfect size I'm at 40 I come on my straight 40 and in the European that's 50 40 regular is the straight man I mean the lead the typical man sighs I'm alone just because you can go to just because some stores carry things that are 16 18 ladies bottom line is I've said it before if you want to do yourself if you want to have a chance you want to give yourself the best option to no longer be single you need to get your weight massively under control for your life just because somebody will have intercourse with you does not mean they are going to take you seriously and marry you what I want you guys do I'm just looking at my chat room to see what's going on Oh Lord 210 pounds after pregnancy well I would say this that human beings don't typically do that the reason that happens over here is because of a lack of exercise and poor diet the human female historically would put on about 20 to 30 pounds on the on the high side in pregnancy weight and that will come right off in breastfeeding yeah so roll tide 504 are you a female see when I hear people come and say I don't want merit good it's not like but here's the thing not wanting it and not having the option for it or two different things it doesn't matter if you want it if it's not available to you it doesn't matter if it's if you can say I don't want any of that it don't matter if it's not available to you so for the young woman who hit me ups and she's 2,700 pounds overweight I go back to what I said earlier yes marriage is not on your radar you need to get because if you're a hundred pounds overweight that tells me you're close to 300 pounds what makes you think I'm not available well because I'm about to take you put you in timeout because I asked you a direct question I asked you if you're a man or a woman if you say anything other than what your sex is I'm gonna time you out you won't be talking see just how this goes over here so roll tide I already got the trigger pull don't you say something crazy and you will get a 300 second trip to the corner if you are a hundred pounds overweight your thing is you need to go see a doctor need to get a personal trainer and you need to get a counselor whatever is going on with you mentally that allowed you to eat yourself into this condition needs to be addressed husband's marriage sexual Marketplace value that's not in your vocabulary now there will be no different than me telling a man who's living at home with his mother a mother and father talking about he wants to start up a a thriving you know multinational business with when he got you know $50 in the bank you got to be rid you got to understand where you're at now see in that situation it may seem easy to diagnose but look at how many women we have under 27 under 30 years of under 25 years old who are just overweight obese yeah anyone who calls you thick is trying to spare your feelings let me be the first to tell you thick is not a word you are fat we got to start calling things what they are it's not it's not big beautiful women its obese see not calling things by what they are softens it I mean seriously what do we call a man who's living in home with his parents at 30 years old he's called a loser this is insisting general society cause that guy loser now here's the here's that I need you guys to buckle in you already know you are overweight and obese you already know this you already know this what you need to ask yourself is are you going to live your life this way and die alone and that's a question I've been starting to ask a lot of women see many places to go and kind of soothe your emotion but if you keep going this way you're going to live this way until you stop living which we call that dying and if you are not married have no serious relationship that means dying alone or if you have no children that means dying alone and I don't think many people really have started to plan out what this really means I think that people just believe I think a lot of people just believe that hope springs eternal that it'll just work itself out that one day we will get myself one day you'll get yourself together and just you'll drop the weight and all this other stuff and then all of a sudden you'll open the door and 50 11 million men I'll be waiting to marry you know look at Generation X women and understand they were told that to put off marriage go get your degree your grad degree your PhD go do your career travel do this do that do all this stuff Generation X women we're told all this and they were told and then when you're ready come back and your 30s and get married look at how many where Generation X are not married have never been married and are in the process of dying alone learn from our generation you need to get yourself together before you turn 25 first though you need to start let me say this first off you need to start telling your your cousins and your sisters your young women you need to start telling your sisters and your cousins ladies you need to start telling these young girls to drop the weight stop talking about how cute and thick it is you need to start Shan works yes Shan works for women I would rather than feel shame and I don't want them to develop some sort of eating yeah I would rather that happen you know we got a you know we were in a black community we always talk about this don't say anything else because you don't want him to develop a phobia oh so you rather them develop diabetes I understand something I want some up and guys understand you're not escape from this tomb but it hits men differently it hits men differently me and it hits you differently it hits you differently because a lot of you guys end up being virgins or in cells lacking real sexual experience it starts hitting a lot of you guys to where you know you're not able to perform I will also say there is definitely there is a cap there is a there is a weight limit on promotions you have a look at look at look at executives look at corporate just just going to LinkedIn and take a snapshot of people who own company I mean people in corporate America you don't see many people who are in middle management upper management who are

sheltering in place there is absolutely no reason for you to be eating poorly now you don't have to be you know you all you have as on your time when you were at home for 30 days you should have been losing weight you should be drinking water eating better not eating fast food not eating junk food and I write Hot Lips Hot Lips sake yeah sure come on we need fit emo fit emo how lives is like yeah you should be looking good by that time you should be looking good and understand something that your weight you being overweight has a definite impact on your on your personal career - on your on your career I should have said this - uh members-only check your weight has an impact on your career that's right it has a definite impact on your career what impact does it have on your career well I understand something companies they don't talk about this stuff but I'm going to tell you companies look at the age they have actuary ins come in executives look at the demographics of the workforce that means everything the sex the age raise the weight an overweight staff cost companies more in insurance benefits insurance premiums higher premiums companies experience more worker outages and honestly they do not promote people who are overweight or obese into high stress positions this is why you don't see a bunch of executives who are overweight and obese working long hours stressful

drive to wait for themselves alright guys until next time talk to you later peace and hair grease is you [Music] [Music]", "Y-4P1TSIsPA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "MC9fPQatoVE": "[Music] [Music] uh uh [Music] you", "i9owQ5gh168": "what's up guys my name is Dan McCready I'm here at twin cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about cotton t-shirts if you've ever looked at t-shirts you'll probably notice that there are a ton of options in this video I'm gonna help you decipher what kind of t-shirt would be best for you by giving you a few details about each of our favorite cotton t-shirt the first t-shirt I'd like to talk about it's no frills it's your basic t-shirt it's the Gildan G 5000 this t-shirt is made out of standard cotton it's affordable it's got a boxier fit and it's got a ton of color options to choose from the next t-shirt is the Gildan soft style G 64,000 this shirts a little bit nicer than your G 5000 it's got a semis fitted feel to it so it's not as boxy shirt was made sure where it still has a ton of color options and it's a little bit softer and more durable because it's a ring spun cotton next we'll move up to the anvil 980 this t-shirt is also made by Gildan who owns anvil this shirt is a comb ring spun cotton t-shirt it's a sin I fit it as well it's very similar to the soft style but it's kind of in-between the soft styles and then the later shirts I'm going to talk about alright next I would like to talk about the next level 3600 this is definitely one of our most popular fashion fit t-shirts the next level uses the combed ring spun cotton so it's a very soft durable t-shirt this shirt is going to cost you a little bit more it's also got less color options and the other shirts we're going to talk about today next level they run a little small you definitely hugs me real a lot tighter than the other shirts so this shirt I would maybe consider going up a size another fashion fitted t-shirt that's very popular is the Bella canvas 3000 one one thing that's really nice about the Dahle canvas is although they are also manufactured overseas like all of the shirts were talking about today the dialogues where they actually dye the colors of the shirts are done here in one factory in California this helps them keep a very consistent color between all their t-shirts the Bella canvas is another fashion fitted tee they come out with all kinds of great colors all the time they're very soft it's a cone ring spun cotton or they call it an heirloom combed ring spun cotton and it's another great option if you're looking for a fashion fitted t-shirt and finally we'll talk about the American Apparel 2001 they got two options one of them is made overseas the other one is made here in America which will cost you extra with American Apparel you're paying for that brand name even though Gildan now owns american apparel american apparel is another fashion fitted teeth it's a combed ring spun cotton supersoft they've got a lot of color options so of course they're very nice shirts as well the point is there's a ton of different options to choose from so you've got to decide what's right for you it depends on your fit what kind of feel you're going for and of course your price point and if you're looking to have t-shirts made stop over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up as always thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video [Music] I'm sorry Dan it's really hard when you're not here you stupid stop", "ZV8VouSkfjE": "[Music] [Applause] YouTube family welcome back it's your first time here my name is Devin on deck I discuss fashion and tech here and today we're talking about or rather on a journey to discover the perfect black t-shirt now if you already know this channel you know my favorite color to wear is black especially when it comes to my basics and over the years I have tried the hell of different t-shirts and I feel like I'm getting really close to find the perfect one but I would love your help in deciding so in this video I have six different teams from my closet from my drawer he's all been washed and dried from $5 all the way up to 95 I'm gonna try them on for you we're gonna go over talked about fit weight how things feel and the quality points and then hopefully by the end of the video we have a verdict [Music] now first up we have the unique little dry package teeth this is gonna cost you about five or six us and it was my favorite shirt up until recently now starting with the good things the price point is good the weight is great it's kind of like a poly-cotton blend so if you're really hot and run hot like I do when you sweat it dries up really quickly but for some reason recently they've been getting a little sloppy with the sizing like this is supposed to be a large on me and usually again I've been buying these charts for years but for some reason this one fits like a medium and a half like when I first put it on it was a tiny bit sluggish but it was fine but after watching and drying it it shrunk up on me so you see it's too short the sleeves are hella tight right now and it just doesn't fit me comfortably so I haven't really worn this shirt in a while but it used to be that you can wash and dry this and then fit fine so I don't know what's going on with these but they definitely are being replaced coincidentally by another shirt within the same company and that leads me to our next t-shirt the UT from Uniqlo it's gonna cost you about $10 USD but it's a total upgrade from the t-shirt from before the weight is amazing I love how this shirt feels when you have an on is very substantial you can tell a huge jump in quality from the dry package one from the previous shirt - this one right here the banded collar right there on the tee is a great touch you just like a fold over piece of fabric that makes a world of a difference as far as the collar goes it's nice and tight but not too tight and the only feedback I have is that the sleeves are a little bit loosey okay even when I cuff them there's still a little loose for me but I think this is a good trade-off to have a way heavier tee way more substantial tee and I would also say it's a little long ish but again not a big deal for me this is a great shirt everything's being consistent so far I've been buying these for the last few months and all the sizes are consistent and it stays black for a long time with the color fastness is really strong so thumbs up on this t-shirt I'm liking it so far now moving on up the price here we have this texture t-shirt by Zara now this is gonna be something you'll find here throughout the year they have different ones all the time and they'll run you around like 30 bucks and I love these t-shirts because they almost add a sophistication to your outfit so if you do want to wear a t-shirt but you want the same appeals like having a thin sweater or something a little bit more refined on then throw one of these on it's gonna look perfect and a little bit more dressy winter time I put an overcoat over it and it looks great or the spring summer when it's too hot for a jacket I can throw that on with like a pair of chinos or some slacks and like some minimal sneakers and have a great smart casual look that again it's a little bit more sophisticated than a regular t-shirt now I would say right now after watching like it's barely long enough before I actually watched you like the first where they fit perfectly bend is shrinking a little bit after washing and hang drying it but the sleeves are the great lip you don't have to really roll them but also it's a great t-shirt off the rack I suggest you look into them if you want something a little bit more elevated now this next t-shirt is in the premium category and it's by a brand called a sketch this is gonna cost you about 45 bucks but in my opinion for a premium t-shirt it is worth the price one of the first great things about a sket is you can pick a various sizing when you pick your size meaning that when I got a large I can pick a short a regular or along it since I am 6 1 then I have a long one and it fits me great now the sleeves are a little bit longer than I would like but I'm already asleep rolling guys so that's fine when you roll them they fit perfectly as far as like looseness and width around my arms it's great and if you look at the neckline I have that same overlapping hem similar to the Uniqlo you t-shirt but it's a little bit thinner and again it makes a shirt feel a little bit more substantial and elevates it in my opinion the fabric weight itself is kind of uh I would say medium heavy kind of a medium and a half as far as weight not super heavy and thick like I would like it like the Uniqlo $10 you shirt but it is very substantial and it does feel like a premium t-shirt so when you spend 45 bucks us on it you don't feel like you spin it much money so I will at least try one of these if you have Tim t-shirts in your closet maybe these are like two or three of them but I do recommend that this would be a good staple to have now as you move up the price tiers in the premium category we have a brand called Vince with your t-shirt coming in at $95 and the reason why I put premium in quotes is because the only thing premium about this is the price point this is a regular shirt it doesn't fit any different from any other insurance this list the weight is similar to the five dollar Uniqlo one it's like kind of a light medium ish weight so it feels a little I don't know not ninety five dollars it's kind of faded now and it's more of a gym shirt it's not really special everything else on this list right now I recommend way more than this t-shirt so now that we're double all the expensive shirts you're moving on to the very last one that I really believe belongs in a category all of this home it's from a company called lot it's more of a like a subscription service what I love about the subscription services you not only give me clothing you're getting accessories you're getting self-care items and everything is black black tees black crude names black pants black shoes and even black tutu brushes but as far as this t-shirt goes one of the best things about it that I love that is personalized with my name on it look at this it's a beautiful thing and the quality of the t-shirt is also very awesome I would say the weight of this t-shirt is probably the same as a premium weight from the skin team and I will say the only thing that I don't like about these is that I get it only once every other one instead of every month because I really love these t-shirts I wish I got I can give more I can get them in bulk but I just can't only can get one every other month but as far as thing and everything it's very comfortable I'm a big fan of it so I had to put it in this video but I would love to know from you what do you feel like is the best one on this list I would love to have been asked it cut but in the Uniqlo UT weight I love the heavy team but I would like a less Lucifer arm and more customizable when I pick it if you enjoyed this video please hit that thumbs up button it does help on my channel

subscribe thank you so much for your time and I will see you on the next one peace [Music] you", "AcXIhqvssdE": "[Music] answer me there i beat you to it people throw the word grifter around a lot so i figured it's probably best to actually talk about what it means from a historical point of view the root of the word comes from graft which appeared around the 15th century in botanical context you know like grafting plant shoots and such through the botanical influence by the 19th century the maximum amount of soil you could dig up with a shovel or a spade in one scoop was known as that tool's graft and shortly thereafter the act of digging was known as grafting this later generalized to any kind of hard work by 1865 graft was considered a slang term for obtaining profit or advantage by dishonest or shady means especially bribery blackmail or the abuse of a position of power or influence the shift from honest hard work to dishonest tactics that nonetheless still may require hard work to pull off is also attributed to the terms origin in botany grafting techniques of that era often created extra senses in the plants an excresence being a distinct abnormal outgrowth of a living organism that is malformed or diseased in some way the implication is obvious while a graft may require as much effort as honest work it is not actually honest work by the turn of the century grift was considered a diminutive form of graft which is commonly done in the english language by replacing a word's vowel with the letter i a grafter was considered to be somebody who engages in political corruption and a grifter was a small time confidence man or a carnival swindler and while grafter's usage in this way has fallen out of popularity mingling with its botanical and hard-working variants grifter has remained to the present day it currently refers to a person who is willing to say or do anything to make money but not in a positive hardworking context rather in a negative dishonest context they have no problems with lying cheating or stealing they will say things that they explicitly know to be false or they will completely abandon the idea of consistency in their pursuits to be a grifter it helps to be a sociopath but it's not exactly necessary you just have to know how to manipulate people and to make them think they want to give you their money at least long enough for them to actually give it to you boy i knew that english degree would pay off one day uh hit up my subscribe store if you wanna help me pay for it unless you actually consider me a grifter then i guess it's okay but that's the rub isn't it if i were a real grifter and as part of the grift i was trying to create a reputation based on honesty and voluntary action i would say things like here's my donation links guys you don't have to donate if you can't afford it though who knows if i'm being compassionate towards my viewers or i'm just cultivating an image of compassion in order to get paid without actually meaning it who knows what level of the game each of us are playing at the truth is you can't really know a perfect grifter will never let you nowadays if you hang around political youtube you'll notice the terms grift or grifter tossed around quite a bit there's a commie channel called the serfs fitting name considering that's where their ideas lead that really seems to love those terms let's analyze a few examples it's simultaneously hilarious and rage inducing that anyone threw money at this grift said in reference to the lincoln project which is an organization that appeals to the broader left and democrat voters for donations in order to combat trumpism from a righteous position they did so by supporting republicans that while they were anti-trump were still not democrats or leftists are these people grifters i mean maybe they did take money from left-leaning sources who were too dumb to think beyond orange man fascist and never really made it clear where that money was going until they started endorsing anti-trump republicans just a friendly reminder that the free marketplace of ideas is a complete grift set in reference to dave rubin blocking them over some twitter trolling i don't really know about dave rubin being a grifter although joe rogan seems to think he is nowadays kanye was the wrecking machine but i actually think i think in the grand scheme of things candace is much bigger i really believe that in terms of because i think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she decides to go that route because i think she could i think she could run for senate or what yeah you said you watched the podcast i did with her yeah okay yeah i watch i don't maybe at least an hour and a half of it or so okay yeah why why what well i don't know why are you saying it that way i mean i don't want to name any names but there's a bunch of people that do it blatantly you see them and i've even seen them switch teams and you see them switch teams and i don't buy their rationalizations when it comes to ideology what i think is what they're doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an inn on this team right and they can just say this is the problem with the team i used to be on those [ __ ] losers and they're really benedict arnold right and like like they probably have as much of an affinity to the ideas of one side as they do the other side they just go all in on one side to get acceptance from the group will you go on joe rogan's podcast and will you have libertarian presidential vp candidate on your show before the election um will i go on rogan's podcast i asked him and our pr people asked him about a bajillion times to go on for my book we did not get a response as far as i know so i don't know what happened there it's a little weird for me to say that publicly i don't know what happened um even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things it doesn't mean you can't be their friend it doesn't and i'm telling you we got it wrong here's what's important what's important is whoever that person is they got to be sincere now as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter yeah you've got to cast them out right you've got to cast them out because they're going to figure that out on their own and they got to apologize that's cool man you got listen you can be wrong but you have to be honest and if you're just bullshitting then i can't hang out with you and i gotta say it is kind of funny to see lance regurgitate a repainted so much for the tolerant left style argument so your platitudes were utterly meaningless and you were a grift all along thanks for clearing that up said in anger out of andrew yang supporting biden over bernie so is making moves out of political pragmatism a grift because that's literally what you and every other bread tuber and nearly every other leftist ultimately did when you decided you were riding with biden a few months later i think it's probably funniest to juxtapose these two examples though the joy of being a leftist is wearing your values like a badge instead of a grift in response to tim pool's assertion that some moderates are afraid of speaking about their values publicly due to the far left and your woke grift is tired when paul joseph watson talks about the dominant religions of countries most likely to stone gay people to death i'm sure you've noticed by now the obvious what stands out like a sore thumb when i put these two tweets together according to lance it's a grift when it's somebody he disagrees with politically but it's wearing your values like a badge when it's a fellow lefty nowhere in that extended definition of grifter that i armed you with earlier in the video did i say that its definition is somebody you personally disagree with and yet that seems to overwhelmingly be the way that radicals use the term most of joe rogan's top viewed interviews are grifters now you may disagree with alex jones ben shapiro jordan peterson or stephen crowder but are they really grifters ben shapiro and jordan peterson seem to genuinely believe what they say even if you might disagree with them while alex jones and stephen crowder on some level though obviously not entirely are exaggerating some of what they say for comedic effect when people take sponsorships sell products or plug their patreons is the only criteria for them being a grifter whether or not the accuser agrees with their point of view not if the creator thinks they're telling the truth not if they actually provide the good or service they're selling but is it really all just politics to these people sargon is an excellent example these accusations are a dime a dozen ella will sargon has such an unbelievable grifter all right let's see what they're talking about joe biden likens ted cruz to nazi propaganda's goebbels for helping trump spread big lie about election fraud he's mad that's mad biden not even in office yet he's already calling trump and his administration nazis trump can't even speak back on the allegation because they've torn out his tongue unreal this is this is genocidal rhetoric this is terrible there is it is awful awful what the democrats are doing right now and the thing is with so much power you would think that they would have some kind of grace but instead they've gone into full-on vicious absolutely crush our opponents mode and that's quite terrifying and it shows that it is the left that has been the problem it is the way that they operate in politics they are not tolerant and the problem with not being tolerant is it means you can't run a democracy what is so objectionable about this clip okay you may disagree with what sargon's saying if you think he's wrong fair enough but clearly he believes it and clearly he's speaking to an audience of people who also believe it so if he's delivering the product they're paying for how is it a grift this is like a radical christian saying that an lgbt youtube channel catering specifically to people interested in lgbt ideology is a grift for delivering a product they're advertising that people actually want here's a lengthy criticism of sargon from the now defunct subreddit of chapo trap house and it's clear that they're trying to turn i disagree with sargon politically into some blanket statement about his character and his business this is a man who dropped out of college to scam people out of a video game kickstarter and use that money to run a five-year right-wing grifting project that consists of him [ __ ] on feminist while calling himself a classical liberal not only is this factually inaccurate sargon refunded the money and posted the receipts last i heard it's also one of the most try hard things i've ever read right up there with lol i have more subs and views than you internet clout totally matters you guys let's take this caption remove all of the personal attacks and statements of political difference and see what criticisms actually remain nothing he said ever provided an idea concept or solution to modern problems he's never said anything useful besides sjw's bad he's never provided a radical idea that can change the world unlike reuter bregman and richard wolff on the left or jordan peterson and andrew yang on the right andrew yang on the right nothing he said has provided valuable discourse etc etc it basically boils down to two points one sargon has never proposed a solution to the problems he points out and two all the problems he points out are sjw's bad even for back when this was written i don't think this was the case but nonetheless if you are legitimately an anti-sjw individual selling anti-sjw content and your viewers are all anti-sjws looking for that content how is this a grift when a radical calls somebody who's in the mainstream center you know the liberals the conservatives grifters they're generally not saying here is a person lying cheating and stealing saying things they know to be false being hypocritical in order to get paid instead they're saying here is a person presenting ideas i think are false and because i'm obviously correct about everything they are taking money from people for reasons i don't approve of let's swing back to the serfs for one final chuckle anybody who says they're a socialist but isn't comfortable forming a worker co-op or as a progressive who has stole the virtues of worker rights and refuses to let their workers unionize is a grifter why yes i do agree lance this is why literally everybody laughed when vosh said his business did not have to be a worker co-op including myself check out my old eat the rich video on that topic if you like now i don't believe the serfs are grifters they might say a lot of dumb [ __ ] all the time but i actually think they probably believe it however who knows if they're actually living it in general if you're a radical you're also more likely to be a hypocrite yes the number of male feminists who are forcefully respecting women with their penis is truly astounding yes the number of cult leaders and mega church pastors who live hedonistic lives seems to be basically 100 and yes progressives and neo-socialists who spout rhetoric about wanting the workers revolution while exploiting everybody around them as hard and fast as they can just seems to be the thing that bread tube does this realization was the center of the most recent debate between vosh and destiny where philosophy tube was raking in [ __ ] tons of money online keeping her income private when a common lefty line of thought is that the expectation that incomes are kept private is one way that bosses keep workers in line by preventing them from comparing their pay all the while encouraging people way less well-off than her to go on rent strikes and other stuff like this if it sounds hypocritical that's because it is and vosh defended her in such a way that he basically revealed himself to be somebody not interested in truth or even socialism at all on some level but only raw power no really listen to this i try to live my principles and i think that it would be unethical for me to maximize my existence in a capital society i've turned on a lot of money for stuff that would maximize my existence in couples because i think it's unethical to do so i don't agree that like because it doesn't further what i believe in and it doesn't further what turned down i've turned down a ton of [ __ ] gambling sponsorships there was so much money flying around and the cs go skin days there was so much of that [ __ ] that i [ __ ] turned down so you've turned okay good and you've turned down and i for my part have turned down every sponsorship because why it's not a part of my aesthetic i don't want to okay wait then don't make those things the same don't don't wait wait don't compare that to me okay you're on a lower level there okay i intentionally no no no no no no no no no no no no no hold on hold on hold on hold on i intentionally have foregone money that i could use otherwise because it is in accordance with my principles okay you're not doing it because it doesn't fit the aesthetic that you sell on your youtube channel that comparison to me was insulting because i don't not take certain sponsorships because of my aesthetic i do it because of my principles those two things are very different that's what upset me do you understand when i said when i said aesthetic i suppose you wouldn't buy me saying as a lefty i don't like the idea of um doing leg work for corporations to advertise products that i don't give a [ __ ] about but you would say that's walking back because what i actually believe is that it's purely an aesthetic flourish and me flushing it out now that i realize you've been made upset by my language is the thing is is what i would say is i wouldn't believe you i don't believe that i don't buy that okay i know i know you do but that's no it's because the first response is the is the most likely to be the honest one and this there are plenty of like higher order things that could be [ __ ] with our ability to understand yes that's true right okay so if you acknowledge that and you're a moral anti-realist so there is actually no choice of the matter which theory of truth is right then you also acknowledge that any empirical statement i make is also arbitrary um i mean i think it would be arbitrary insofar as we would have to disagree on like the meaning of truth but i think that most people have subscribed to the idea that truth means something that could be empirically verified if a person disagreed with that i would have to kill them there's no truth that they're nothing is objective nothing is true or it's all relative to what someone wants yeah everything but i do think you can make an empirical statement about that depends on you wait yes the morality of the holocaust depends on your subject whether it happened sure if you have a different definition of truth then yeah but if a person can say that they're wrong they're just oh no well i don't have to say that they're wrong all i have to do is convince them right now you are basically saying that uh i would disagree with them i would try to convince them you would disagree with them but you have to acknowledge from this you know yes i acknowledge that i've always acknowledged that yeah it's about power you are so you are you're in a state of complete nihilism about the world no one's positioning is more specified than another inherently no correct wow okay so you're literally incomplete so actually right now if i wanted to i could flip a coin and if it lands heads or tails i'm correct about this issue and you have no way to refute what i just said empirically no but i could argue that that's dumb wow well it doesn't matter i mean if you just acknowledge all you do is just scream at people to make you feel good wait yeah wait fine wait no i don't wait i don't scream at people so you don't you don't care about truth in the world i guess wait yeah i do i care about my truth in the world yeah yeah you care about how you feel yeah yes because all moral positions are downstream of our subjective emotional preferences how many times do i have to refrain this no no i just it's crazy to me hearing you say it like two plus two equals four right there there are multiple theories of truth something can be true because it's actually existing in the world right which is probably what you view truth as you know the cup is read is true if it is actually okay there's another theory of truth it could be something is true if and only if it makes me feel good right my question to you would then be well which of those theories of truth should i adopt it depends on which moral system you subscribe to if you subscribe to a different one and that causes me that theories of truth are moral statements all of thought is just power grabs between people who can decide subjectively whether or not their positions are better than all power grabs unironically wow in some cases of whether the holocaust happened a paragraph yes and this the thing unlike mob rule i don't believe i can't believe you think that there's no way that you do not feel i've applied a consistent standard where i think it's more moral to just submit yourself to the mob that it is to just kill everyone who comes for you i if i've submitted a consistent standard i don't think it's fair for you to accuse me of being in bad faith it is consistent maybe that's how people feel when they argue against me and i'm consistent or something maybe you genuinely do believe that i guess it's possible but yeah obviously in the future because because i can think of a lot of scenarios that are really sweats to the where [ __ ] black dudes have been lynched by white people thinking they were in the right where saying that like well but then you even said earlier maybe the black guy should just submit himself to get arrested and then they can happen yeah wait wait if people are coming to arrest the black guy then yeah i think that he should submit to arrest rather than gunning down a bunch of unarmed white people not submit to arrest but like a mob of white people approaching him really depends on the context there and how legitimate the lethal threat is and this let's say that there are 10 people okay they're gathered on the beach unfortunately today there is a lost soul okay he's a hundred meters out this guy is [ __ ] and none of the people on the beach they're not good enough swimmers to go get him okay now let's say another guy walks by okay this guy is called chad marks okay some people call him charles marks okay this guy is a [ __ ] state champion swimmer and he walks by and he sees that kid out there do you think that that guy with his additional means with all that he has available to him do you think that it would be just as morally neutral for him to stand by and watch that person drown as the other 10 less capable people on that beach could he simply say i mean i don't have like an obligation it would be good if i did but like i mean i could just sit here and watch it happen i don't think it's bad this is morally neutral if i sit here watching if he has the means otherwise he's analogous no no okay i should go out and save the person okay why is that disanalgus okay because if that they decided not to do that thing if they decided to abstain it would cost a person their life whereas in the case of a lefty opening a business their decision to open it would not add any negative utility to the world so in that case we're talking about for a lefty it's either you abstain and you have nothing or you participate and you have nothing assuming you don't do extra bad direction okay good that's not really material to the chest swimmer if they abstain you have a death and if they participate you have that that's not that's not at all material participation and abstinence in these two examples met very different outcomes well participation in a morally righteous way and the swimming one could result in saving somebody's life participation in a righteous way in the economic sense could be you opening a business that improves the material conditions of multiple other workers and families i think those are compromised i think that'd be great okay abstinence in one sense is you just stand by and you watch a person drown and abstinence which is negative and abstinence in the business sense is you just stand by and you watch another business open up and exploit workers which would be neutral but the death is negative how is that okay i never ever ever want you to say again that like capitalism is negative or business owners are bad because you understand my argument enough time i guess not because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system i i'm sorry if there's some irreconcilable difference that we're not going to resolve here then we might as well not waste an additional hour on it if you acknowledge that when a lefty opens a business and let's say pays market rates same as everyone else and the workers are treated fine really middle of the road as hard as that is to abstract all you are doing in a purely empirical sense is giving local workers an additional choice uh uh an additional place that they could sell their labor to an unethical institution unfortunate but you're not compelling or mandating or directing any direct harm if you didn't do that there would be no benefit but if you have the means to do now if you have the means to act in a way that's more accordance and more no if you have the means to act in harmony with your principles then for you to do less i genuinely think that your perspective on this issue has been tainted or corroded in some way by the people that you've argued online if it's been tainted or corroded by anything it's by the fact that i went to a jesuit high school and what part of what we taught i guess was like that you should live your principles if you still have any delusions about whether or not vosh believes what he's saying or really any other bread tuber who parrots his rhetoric i hope this puts them to bed this is what a grifter actually is when you openly nakedly say that truth does not exist beyond what you can twist people into believing that winning is more important than being correct that the appearance of being anti-corporate is more important than living your principles there is no more clear example of a grifter than that the problem with the grifter worldview that vash exposes is that eventually reality will snap back it does not matter how many laborers or scientists or engineers that soviet commissar vosh brow beats into submission if you don't adhere to objective real world truth at some point you're gonna get chernobyl out of your nuclear program you can scream that two plus two doesn't equal four as much as you want but the mushroom cloud forming over the ruins of your project does not care and while that is an extreme comparison this sort of thing happens all the time when you ignore the truth what happened to ethan ralph andy warski mr metaker channel awesome game grumps or any other youtube channel or online personality that ignored the truth in favor of grifting hoping their popularity would allow them to skate on by they're all shadows of their former selves and that will be where vash finds himself sooner or later the reason grifters have to keep leaving town eventually and move on is because the people they swindle inevitably catch up to them the act of grifting makes enemies of your own audience the very people that pay you you can't run away from that forever the clap back will come for vosh and the rest of bread tube in due time and just like it did with ralph with warski medicare channel awesome and game grumps i will be here with a bucket of popcorn laughing my ass off about it

"D8DahUYbK4Q": "[Music] hi guys today I'm doing something much different than I've ever done before I really want to review something very basic and compare it with all different brands I've got a whole bunch of white teas for you guys today they are all crewnecks they are all 100% cotton they're all different price ranges so one of them is like 15 bucks the last one is almost $200 and I want to see if it's actually worth spending that kind of money on such a basic white tea for the record I don't plan on keeping all of them some of them still have their tags attached and that's just a chance for me to be able to keep the ones that are the most distinct from the pack and anything else that I feel is a little maybe subpar I will be returning and none of this is sponsored or gifted everything is something that I purchased myself so I will leave everything linked down in the description below that will list my sizes that I bought as well as my own measurements of my body so you can kind of compare and make a judgement on which size that you would get the first one is from made well this one's 15 bucks on sale right now I have to say it is very similar to a more expensive one that I have in a few minutes so keep watching what I want to talk about with this one is that the fit is really beautiful I like the fact that the shoulder is a drop shoulder which means that the sleeve isn't very long but it looks longer on me that's a preference of mine I like for my sleeves to be a little bit longer I also think that this shirt this fabric is very much more on the see-through side of things it's less opaque so it looks more like you would see a white bra through it so I think that that's another preference if you like to have your shirts be maybe more breathable and you don't mind if your bra shows a little bit then this would be a good option I like all sorts of tees I like really thick ones I like thin ones it just depends on the outfit of course with $15 you're not getting as much as you could be with things like ethical standards some other companies that I want to feature today are you know five stars on that realm but this one is just made well so they're making strides on fair trade but really just in their denim Department so far another factor to the fact that it's a see-through shirt it's a very thin material this shirt wouldn't last for you know several years like some of them will that's also something to keep into consideration maybe you aren't looking to invest in a white tee because the t-shirt will become stained over time especially if it's a thin material this next one is from ever Lane it runs 18 dollars right now it again is a very thin material but it's not as thin as the made well one was the fit of it I think is a dream I like the fact that it has like more of a longer sleeve but it's not incredibly long I also like the fact that the sleeves are a little bit tighter and that's just again everything dimension here is preference so judge for yourself on what you like if you like things to have a tighter sleeve or a sleeve that's up higher I prefer them to be longer no matter really how wide they are but I like the look of this one I think because the sleeves are tighter compared to the body that's a really flattering look when I was comparing the feel of each one of these shirts this one was one of the highest-ranked ones on how comfy it is it's very soft it's that pima cotton that makes it so soft there's nothing like that you know it compared to a regular regular cotton of any form this one is so super soft as far as durability like how long it will last I don't think that it will last like a month I think it'll last much longer than that but I don't think it'll last for a couple years just because it's a thinner material and that already will make it more prone to stains and rips and that type of thing I've had plenty of ever lain shirts that are made of this pima cotton material and I find that like my turtlenecks especially they will last about a year and when you think of a turtleneck you're wearing it through several seasons and same with a t-shirt you're gonna wear that spring summer fall at least so those are things to consider I would say that this is a really fair price considered all that I've read about with the good trade they've shown a lot about whatever lanes ethics are and I can link that again down below next is alternative apparel and this one runs about twenty four dollars it's a much thinner material just like the other ones were but this one has a very loose fit so this one's a small on me and I would say that the sleeves have the biggest difference there a shorter sleeve not my preference not my thing it's almost the way that a cap sleeve looks you know when it's just up and angled a little bit more so this one is not really one that I prefer the fit of myself the really redeeming qualities about it is that I think that it's the most comfortable thing it's not the most comfortable out of this pack but this one is right up there with the best of them and I will say too that this one is much more on the you know ethical and sustainable route if you want to go that route then this one would be an option for you to look into this one I'm quite shocked about so this is j.crew it's about 30 bucks I would say that it is so incredibly similar to the made well one the first one but you know what's so interesting is the fit is a little bit different the sleeves don't have that you know you don't have that drop shoulder that's making the sleeves look more flattering I really don't care for the fit of this one at all and I was looking closely and it's already starting to have a hole in it and all I've done is put it on a hanger and wear it around just for this video and it still has the tag on it like I haven't worn this out at all it's an extra extra small it's got that same fabric from made while so it's thinner but I have to say that I think it's just the way that made well has created there's I don't know exactly what they've done but this one is so much more fragile than that one is and the fit of it again not my favorite this is me not that like I made that feel both of these shirts he thinks they feel exactly the same but to me this one just feels just a little bit scratchy err in this case I'm just really surprised because this one is backward I think through July or any for months not only that but it's a best-seller I'm just kind of shocked at this one it's much different than what I would assume it's you know double the price of the made well one if you are torn between the made well and the j.crew one because they are so similar a hundred percent I would say go with the cheaper the made well one before reviewing the tape on all of these I thought this next one was going to be my absolute favorite and I haven't ruled that out yet but I have to say the feel of this one is just like heaven it is so dreamy and comfortable and soft it's so much softer than any of the other ones and so this one is from Quiana it runs about $45 the sleeves on it are very interesting because they are cuffed and they're sewn to be cuffed so you can't uncuffed them unless you take a little you know ditch remover and get that off but I love the look of this it's beautiful you know when you're thinking of the complete opposite and you buy a pack o t-shirts you know in a Hanes bag you wouldn't get something like this like this looks like something hanging up in a really nice shop so that's what I appreciate about this it's very extremely drapey and loose again I'm such a fan of longer sleeves so that one's hitting that box forming it's not extremely long but it's somewhere in the middle it almost has a shine on me too and when I was wearing it's acts like you know that has like a sheen to it and I found that to be really interesting a note about their ethics they're more of a slow fashion brand they're very fair trade and I actually even though it's a thinner shirt I don't think it's gonna fall apart very quickly it's very tightly knit and I think that that will give it a little bit more life to it but I do think that it could stain kind of easily next is redone and this one runs about $78 about a year ago Rhydian gave me a shirt and it was the exact same one it just I wore it to death and so I wanted to buy a new one myself and put it in with this list and just kind of compare it and hold it up against the others so one thing to note is that similarly to the made well in Jake it's got this sort of pattern to it if you look closely it's it's not an even pattern it almost looks like it's this heather color you know the way that it's knit together it's significantly different than the made while j.crew option it seems softer and yet heavier it has detail and the way that they knit this together in the back or sewed it together it looks like it's going to stand up the test of time much longer than some other options I just love the look of how vintage this looks it's just so inspired by that and I feel like I just have a different look about me when I'm wearing this shirt I also think it's great that they're using recycled or upcycle materials which redone is just known for I do think that there is just a couple of other shirts in this pack that I prefer more than this one I will say that this one is a dream it's durable it's got up cycled products that is using fabrics but then also just the fit of it it's gorgeous I would say that probably the way that how long it lasted me the last time was about a year but that was when it started to fade and I wanted something that was just bright white that I could compare against these and honestly I could still return this one and still keep going with my old one just kind of judge that for yourself how heavily you'd use this but I am really incredibly happy with this one this last one is somewhere in between really really expensive and affordable and I know that that's different for everybody but what I mean is it's luxury definitely it's not Chanel expensive but it's not you know much more affordable like the $15 option so this is Jesse kam and it runs about 195 dollars there are some really redeeming qualities about it where I am very tempted to keep it so I will just review those with you first of all it's more of an antique white it's not like a starch crisp clean white and I think that that will make it last a little bit longer because I don't have to try to maintain that brightness if you look closely the stitching on it is a very starch clean bright white which i think is a really unique detail to it then they put extra detail around here where it's like double stitched and the material is extremely thick it is so incredibly thick that I would say that you could definitely wear it in like spring and fall or you know if you're indoors but if you're gonna wear this outside in ninety hundred degrees you'd get pretty warm which might make you sweat and maybe stain the shirt so just kind of think about that but reviewing the tape I would say that this I was just blown away at how different this shirt was cut to make it look on me versus the other shirts the other shirts look more standard you know and that's what you get for what you pay when you wear something like this I was really surprised to see how much different I felt like it looked on me because I wasn't expecting that much of a difference for a basic white tee which is why I wanted I was like curious and wanting to try this example and I do love how long the sleeves are that's like automatically I'm gonna fall in love with anything that has that it's got a really wide cuff on the sleeves and I feel like that's another win like it looks really flattering there and then I because it's such a thick shirt and it's just made with such detail and quality and extra stitching everywhere this shirt is not going to disappear in a few months like some of the more like see-through or cheaper options are going to only last maybe you know a season whereas this one's going to last I could see if you took care of it maybe Scotch guarded at first it would last me you know a couple years at least maybe three years so you are paying for that and if you're more trying to buy less and just like consume less then something like this would be a good option because you're gonna have it forever you know as far as white tees are concerned and there's such a staple that I could see that that would be a really great benefit so Jesse Kim is more small business I think she has like three employees it's made locally in and those are reasons where it goes more into the cost of what you're paying for so look into all of that judge for yourself and just see where each one of these companies aligns with where your values are in those realms but this shirt overall it's five stars on how long it will last the fit of it I am absolutely in love with very tempted to keep it the feel of it I would say is the only thing holding me back from skipping it like five stars because it isn't super soft but I love the feeling of having a thick shirt sometimes you know so going into the ones that I'll be like keeping and returning I love love the Quiana one that one is my favorite I think that it's just such a great price range and I also think that the fit and the feel we're absolutely amazing so I definitely want to keep that one I'm also very tempted with the Jesse cam one even though it's much higher price I could see in the footage the difference of how it's cut compared to any of the others where I feel like okay it's a designer shirt like this one has reason for the price because it's just such a beautifully designed shirt and then the quality of it is right up there so no disappointments there I just you know maybe with time it will get even a little bit softer I wish that was just a little bit softer if it was it would have been my favorite out of the affordable options definitely the ever lane one was my favorite $18.00 and you get an incredible shirt and it's just beautifully cut the the design of it was flattering it's very light weight and it's something that I could wear every single day as for the ones I'll definitely be returning the alternative apparel one just really didn't amaze me enough to keep it just the way that it fit really was a little bit awkward to me and so it's just really not my preference I do think that their ethics are just amazing what it stands for so those are qualities that you might want to invest in and make up your own mind on that my least favorite in the one I'll definitely be returning was the j.crew option I just don't think that it was a good fit I feel like it was poorly put together it was double the price of the made while option and it's you know same company everything so I would rather just go with a maid well one if I was choosing between them I think that the maid well one had a much better sleeve length as far as having that drop shoulder and this one just doesn't have that so definitely not a fan of this one and that's it hopefully you found a shirt that meets exactly what you love maybe there's a certain fit you love or a brand or you know that it's standards behind it or maybe it's just a price point thing for you and all of those things are something to judge for yourself but I definitely have my winners and losers in this pack for my own personal taste and hopefully it just gives you guys insight if you like this sort of video then let me know because I could definitely do this more frequently with different types like maybe jeans or shoes or there's just so many options so give this video a thumbs up if you liked it don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time love dancing you never mind cloudy day make the world a better place do you love dancing

mean I have all three of the easy presses and it's the mini one and $69 and it's good for hats and um probably bowtie I mean Bosley beekeeper bows but I don't think I'm getting that let me know about low if you have it I rating what you think about it and then um comment below okay let me go ahead and push these I new project okay all right be not my project I'm already have the item that I want to I already have the image that I want to use let me go back to my projects click on that and I already got it I didn't do anything to it I just uploaded it some go here to push customize like I said own thing only step I'm missing is when you go to basically upload and you go into your files and define your own SVG or PNG whatever you want to use and I have another video on that also how to upload PNG is how to change your colors SVG's and videos are all that so I'm not gonna go below okay I have this beautiful woman right here I love her I love her and you reach my chose reason why I purchased this SVG is because of the colors except the mission it's all about the colors to me well it's also because sublimation when you really can't feel it and your shirt so I love that because if I know you can feel it but something mission you can't feel it so I really love some elimination because of two things you can't feeling on your shirt you don't feel like anything else and then plus the colors are so vibrant so when I seen this on Coco twin attack comics I have I gotta have her I gotta have her the colors are vibrant they're pretty this colorful and I've been doing lot of sublimation not my civilization being really like black and white and a few colors I want to show my colors out on my cell emission printer that's why I purchased I'm gonna put her on everything I'm gonna do this shirt today I'm gonna do another video of me putting her on a mug yeah she's gonna be on everything I'm thinking about putting her in the bag too she's beautiful I love the colors I need to find more color more images with colors like this they have a lot of cartoon colors a lot of cartoon characters with a lot of colors but I love to find my african-american women with different colors and I can change the colors on this SVG you could change colors like I said I have a video that shows you how to change the colors of SVG's so I'm not gonna do all that today I don't think I'm gonna do today is size this up and put on the show you got to put on the shirt okay first of all let's go ahead and do this the sighs wood creaking to cut and print which is caught we have to do a cut print for sublimation with Cricut so we have to go by the size and the size is just 0.75 by 9 okay I'm gonna do 6.75 go ahead and go across like this right here 6.75 go over okay that's the picture right there i know ii said i just don't like i hate that I have to cook with um that side I wish I could do a bigger footprint could but I'm still trying to figure out how to um I can do it you can't print bigger on um silhouette but I don't have a cutter to cut my glitter bigger you know I'm saying so I have to do this size because my glitter has to be good okay on my Cricut so yes that's it like you say you if you want that you can't print this bigger if you're just doing to the mission but since I'm using glitter I might just use that size right now until I figure it up to figure out the other ways of doing it then put the words I'm going to make it bigger I'm gonna make the words vital okay this is my shirt since my own pictures that I'm gonna make my words I'll stay in my picture so I can have some my picture so my shirt can be evened out let's see okay everything said now I have the UM the width six point seven to seven and then um the height is seven point seven three eight I like the way cuz if I go any I could go down to nine but it's gonna it's not gonna look right so I like the way it look like like that then I have her on the words this is gonna be my no on black and this is gonna be glitter one black okay so I need to do is go here so I got my size everything together I need to go ahead and duplicate her make sure you have everything situated before you duplicate it cuz you do not want to change you okay so now this is a cutting print files I got a highlighting right here it says cut and print okay and then this one also says cut and print but I do not want this to be a cut and print I want this to be a cuts okay just so right here it's flattening and you sit down here she's flattened and she's ready to get cut pretty cooked just right here now I'm siding her and I'm going to go ahead and go to see it's print right there I'm gonna no field I'm go ahead and wheeled her see how that was just the UM cooked so it's gonna cut around her butter arrange and sent to the front so you can see just what I'm gonna do when I know my shirt this is how it's gonna be okay cannot sub on 100% cotton or dark colors unless you put it on vinyl first on white glitter vinyl okay I tried to so I tried to do the super fine it was a little bit too dark so just keep it with the white vinyl the white glitter vinyl okay look at like I said before this is gonna be my white glitter I'm it's red but it's this color I wanted to do it you want me to put it white I can put it right someone be confusing imma go ahead and change the color up here to make it white okay okay but this doesn't matter because I'm whatever vinyl I put in my cutter that's what's gonna cut out okay for all you're a newbie still all the ones that you know just started couldn't using the cookie get kind of confusing so now that you see over here you have the cutting print for her and you have this is um welded and she's flattened you have to flatten it to cut and print or to something mate you hit the flattener okay so now I'm gonna work with this down here this is just a cut so you see this this um go here so make sure that this is ready it should be welded and it's just a it's a cut so let's go ahead and see um this is this was already image so it's not words that I made this was a SVG already so it's not really ready to cut okay let's go ahead him to make it as you see right here she's on a white sheet of paper because this is going to be sublimation printer I have two printers you can use both print you can use the same printer for each you gotta have one sublimation printer if he does information you have to have a regular printer if you do a regular cut and print okay we're just gonna be sent to my sublimation printer and then you see this mat this is gonna be cut on my silver glitter I think this is gonna be cut when you know what I changed this to white I'm gonna change this to white because I'm going to be using um black shirts when you go ahead and cancel that and go back and change this so even though I could have left it black cos might like I said doesn't matter but I won't let you so you won't be confused I'm gonna change this to white I'm thinking about putting your own white glitter also okay cuz I'm using a black shirt okay go back to this okay so everything set this is one to my printer this is going to not both of these are going to my cutter and they're sitting on the same mat so I'm gonna worry about having two different mats with these to make sure it even so I won't um it's good over since we want I can say be some vinyl cuz Rhino ain't cheap y'all I know is not cheap okay so you have to mirror because you're putting this on heat you have to mirror both of them so it's clear to mirrored this cuz you're something mating and this is on heat two side mirror that also okay all righty so let me go ahead and get my sublimation everything printed out and I'll be back okay I just want to show you something real quick I got my image RVD cut up I mean print it out from my printer from my own sublimation printer and then I'm gonna show you this when you put down the UM vinyl the glitter bottom make sure you put the shiny side down on the mat okay I'm gonna show you how to yard first so y'all know make sure you put it the shiny side down on the mat make sure it's straight make sure you have a nice sticky mat so will not be moving by from the printer I want to show you that real quick okay and then why this is cutting my to me just cutting their words and then the body parts of the mayor the bottom layer of her I'm gonna go ahead and cut her out besties I'm gonna take this to the printer also I had the printer cut this out also okay and these black registration marks is what keeps the UM Cricut let you know how to print it out so let me go ahead and show you this real quick I already sent it to the printer and I was talking to send it to the cutters it actually where you want to send it to and they already noticed it right here number one it says it's already been printed okay so now it's time to cut it and I'm going to go ahead and send it with paper instead of cardstock I'm gonna put use paper okay and there's a paper I just basically took mine went to my finger and I turned my knife to paper okay so now you know the sitting thinking that that I put loaded into the mat after I put the paper on the mat downloaded then it's gonna cut it out alrighty there she is I got her on a mat this mat ought to be that sticky cuz you know with the paper tears really stands we're gonna show you all the process so you can know how to do it I was gonna skip these process and just go straight through it but I'm gonna show it to you because I already have this process already done I'm one of my printing cut videos but I'm go ahead and go through it again okay I put it on this kind of say I put on paper settings the arrows going because they're telling me go ahead and push the arrow catch they don't push the button [Music] it's so busy you think I'm doing a pretty cook but I'm not well I am but I'm gonna be doing some of the mission also okay so are you thinking this is a prank oh okay now I get the image out of the UM cutter it's cut and it's the same way deal stickers and everything else to cut and print okay that's it out now I'm going to discov I know it's the second step you have to do okay so I make sure this is on a mat upside down like I said it's shiny side down I'm good to my computer okay so now that we've done this already which is it's done today check your stance it's completed it's print and cut so now we got to go down to here to the cut and I gotta change my settings back over to vinyl you know what this is winter vinyl so make sure you change it to glitter vinyl so that's custom because it is tougher you need to get a tougher cut with vinyl okay and I have my I have my binary little already favorite some way to push glitter okay then I'm gonna go ahead and push the button and it's ready to cook and I was always home I met it to give it a little tug so after that now I gotta push the see here like to see my computer southern is dead is cutting and I back at this when this pretty everything cook I just have to read everything I'll show you that real quick to already have a video on how the weed I'm go ahead and show you again so you can all see you just be one quick process for you I'm gonna take my little scraper thing and just trying to pull on the paper pull it up okay now you just go ahead and poke around a picture how about I do it this way better huh hold it down with the best way you can I really want to test the ink on the other side and they put it would be much more vibrant when we um to be sublimated okay a little earring out of here so now I'm just gonna cut around the image stuff to stay with with my nose I can okay and I'm also gonna separate the image from the words okay okay so let's go ahead and read out this glitter Whedon glitter is not too hard so let me go ahead and do this with y'all to see me do it you can't see the camera because it's white for the best way to read glitter it's a good go from the back of course just pour a little part closer to the ears and just pour it all around it you can certainly be tough with glitter cuz it's so deep you keep on pulling that pieces of it all I like it I like this image because it's not too many cuts in it it's just not a round surface but it's not too many you know cut better to do this when you trying to even it up on the arm Matt it's gonna be better to do it this way let me go here to lead out my words my phrase around it just start from the corner get your little piece wrap it and put yankees you can be able just tear it off okay you said your perfect setup is he ever seen the camera with a pen john wetton is by now but I'll try to make sure I see the full effect in the camera so sorry about that okay and I go down and I'm gonna go ahead and see some spots again take over here the little letters and Gert y'all I was right on the money I almost thought I had to cut these this bird over again but I didn't make sure you have enough I know very sticky in here don't thing I don't like about I'm simply made known by no because you can feel it you can feel the vinyl on the bottom on the back of the arm sublimation it's like a patch patchy feeling like a vinyl of course regular glitter vinyl and some permission is just so much is so soft and you'll have to worry about me feeling anything but guess what you got a do if you want to do it on dark colors and tighten tighter percent cotton shirts you have to do it like this you gotta get that patchy feeling on the back of it okay back Lord and still worthy I'm gonna get my he pressed together situated I did this shirt for my son and I use my mini press on that my Cricut easy press on this so I let me go ahead and just try to do this new one then just this project on my impress this is my first time using my heat press before so the mission on black uncle later okay I made this with my son and I like it I just my first one time doing it it's been a while and I see what you can tell when you um don't have the eye and a half together right here under the shirt so it kind of faded a little bit which is fine steel you see how down on glitter yeah outlined in that it's his shirt and this vinyl that's just regular vinyl oh my shirt today I'm going to be using the UM glitter vinyl okay so let's want to show you how that and not it's prepped his shirt first thing we need to do is go ahead and press it no first thing we need to do is go ahead and get the lint roller you got a little flip it based you can see a lot on black okay we'll see all that and I ever see that out here I'm glad I did that um shake it and press it get all the heat and moisture out of it using a medium shirt and skilled skilled in 100% cotton go ahead and get more straps with about five seconds sorry I got the window open like I said I had to let the fume dust in his heat press and it's kind of loud outside from the highways right there okay when you just have the mission you supposed to put butcher paper in between a shirt but I'm not gonna do that because we're stepping on top of glitter so it would not bleed through the glitter I'm not gonna put any butcher paper between the shirt okay well but I will put the foot put your paper on top of the shirt okay the first thing we gotta do is go ahead and set up our glitter always do three inches below for them a little ruler right there a bit more now you see how the glitter paper if you're your first time using literacy how it's already have this contact paper just ink paper on there and you don't have to even use whichever when you good or you can just use that but I'm gonna use anybody's to protect my heat press that's perfect I feel good now put the words down right here and make sure when you put the word down do not let the plastic touch each other so I want to give you kind of close to the body so I'm gonna cut around here so you can get a little close to it on the right when it works too far from the image okay now I have it on the heat press I'm go ahead and put my put your tip on top of it I'm gonna go ahead put my boot up camp on top of it and go ahead and press it for like ten seconds four hundred to ten seconds if you can um just to get that glitter to stay stick one for little eyes oh I don't do I just do ten seconds just get that glitter down 400 for ten seconds I'll do 15 400 for 15 seconds now let it cool for a little bit I'm gonna bring it over here on table because I want the cool before I put the picture on there because I don't want the picture to fade off one the ink on the glitter before I put it on the heat press okay bring it over here let it cool off a little bit see I just pull it off there's the glitter I'm gonna lift that one the word but if so won't do to gonna put that back on the top of the word when I put the ink on here okay so it's cooled off a little bit I think it's good yes be cooled off real quick and I'm going to put it on sublimation on top yeah he's gonna do the same thing my son shirt did it on paper is going on top but the shirt which is going to show so next time it's got to cut the glitter a little bit bigger cuz it does shrink and I heard getting a few videos to that it does shrink but oh well there's a tape of beer so I won't move I'm gonna cover this back up on the heat yeah it's gonna all

going to try to execute is the cotton subs box uh tack down method i believe that's what it's called uh shout out to techbot customs and er thing like that i checked out his video you know i mean so it's a little different way to do the uh cotton sub so you want to see that sit back throw your seat belt and hold on to the wrap baby and we'll be right back but first go ahead and like comment subscribe for your girl yeah i'm gonna get right back with you y'all [Music] i believe that's a good little city let me turn off some light in here get it nice and bright all right that's good right

um a texas chainsaw i believe freddie and uh michael over there they dangerous all right we gotta get the cotton too i ain't even prepared see i just wanted to show you all this i should have put some lotion on my knuckles while i came in here um bear with me one moment let me find my concept i just had them all right so got my cotton sub here my whole sheet make sure this ain't gonna cut because i cut don't join you know you gotta cut it say that on tremendous because you can use them yes you come all right um boom so what you want to do we're going to spray this paper right here this paper right here i'm going to spray with this right here you with me you're picking up what i'm throwing down baby but yeah i like miss y'all nothing heavy and then what you want to do i'm gonna get i got this box of uh trash under here a box is a better to have like when you're doing vinyl and something make it use a bunch of paper and carry your sheets and it's just better but anyway so over here spray over my box don't be too close to it though like miss y'all don't snap do not snap do you hear me all right all right i think i'm good all right i might hold these you don't understand the first time i did this um because i have tried it i messed up because i guess i missed it and like globs of the adhesive came out but you want to put this smooth side down now this part you got to be really patient with you because it's tacky so it's going to want to grab it so he's got to be quick with it once you get it up there you just kind of smooth that baby out you don't smoke but you just want to make sure it's flat y'all get all your creases out you got to be patient on this part trying to hurry up because i don't want this to be a long video i want to be like oh hey watch out uh you did video she got there for three thousand years i mean right now all right this isn't even this is looking more promising than i did the first time all right so once you got that smoothed on there like that got this move great yeah what they call i believe is the guillotine guillotine cutter also with his head yeah but um then you just cut your touch your image straight image boom i come down a few more times with the cotton so just to make sure i got any straggles see i got a straggler right there but if that happened i just i just cut it man no big deal you know i mean i can admit that cutting some can be it's very um fragile so it can be difficult to work with but once you get your little method going you'll be ah you need [Music] this one boom all right so i got a little bit of white up there that i need to get i don't want no white no way to that's why i like these guillotines all right oh i ain't get it it's hard to cut fabric though unless you get actual fabric scissors all a right stragglers i just chop chop chop chicken chop chappie choppy baby all right so that's what i got y'all that's the cotton sub stuck to the paper face up cotton so you need so we're going to see y'all get the heat press go ahead and get my little middle line going and what nizzle this uh technique with the cotton subs you know what i mean the only thing is we just gotta find a better way to

fabrics whether\nyou're brand new to the industry or if you're an industry vet I'm sure you've\nwondered what the difference is between Heather CVC and tri-blend or what the\nheck slub or poly viscose means today we're gonna break it all down for you let's start with the basics\nthe most common tea in the printable market is 100% cotton a lot of other\nbrands out there use carton open-ended cotton this is your cheaper or heavier\nscratchier or price point t-shirt at bella canvas we use only 100% cotton ring\nspun cotton what this means is we take the raw cotton and we comb out the\nimpurities and then it's ring spun to create a long strand of yarn so that\nwhen we knit our fabric its a tight weave and it's the best surface to print on\nthis is our style 3000 one the singles are like a thread count the higher the\nsingle the finer the fabric in the industry singles range for about 18 all\nthe way up to 40 your carded open-end cheaper tees are going to be in that 18\nto 20 single range our 100% combed and ring spun cotton is a 30 single and it's\na 4.2 ounce so 3001 is your go to basic hundred percent comb and ring spun tee\nit's great for discharge printing and direct garment printing we're going to\nget into all the details with printing tips for all the different types of\nfabrications down the line to keep your eyes open for that video to come another\nsuper popular fabrication is Heather CVC our Heather CvC is at 52% combed and\nring-spun cotton 48 percent polyester blend it's a 30 single at 4.2 oz\nHeather CVC basically means and it's a poly-cotton blend and CVC stands for\ncheif value cotton which is a fabric term to indicate that there's a slightly\nhigher cotton content than polyester the incredible market is trending towards\nHeather CVC because that polyester blend gives it that nice texture that nice\nsubtle dimension and the polyester blended with the cotton gives it a\nreally nice soft hand so you have other hundred percent cotton that's more of\nyour price point basic and then Heather CVC is a step up when it comes to\npricing now we're going to take a look at tri-blend tri blend is a unique blend of\ncotton polyester and rayon so you have the comfort of the cotton you have the\ndurability of the polyester and you have the drape from the rayon rayon was\noriginally developed as a substitute for silk that's what gives it it's super\nsoft hand with our tri-blend we have a 40 single and we're the only ones to do\na 40 single in the market I realize I'm bias that we have the best tri-blend in\nthe industry similar to Heather CVC tri ones also have that nice subtle texture\nand the reason for this is that the natural and the synthetic fiber\ntake the dye differently so that when it's knit you have that really nice heather\nlook one thing that's unique about bella canvas tri-blend is that we've also\nengineered our dyeing process so that the natural fibers and the synthetic\nfibers will take the color in a way that results in a solid tri-blend we're the\nonly ones in the industry to offer a solid tri-blend so you get that same\ngreat hand that silky drape but that solid color that sells so well in the\nindustry slub is more of a specialty fabrication\nthat you might not be as familiar with slub is basically the leftover fibers\nand it's a cotton poly rayon blend that's knit in a way that gives it this\nnice tonal texture so when you're screen-printing you get that dimension\nbut it's tonal so that it's approachable from a decoration standpoint people are\nreally into slub because it's something you see prevalent at retail right now\nand it's got that great vintage look to it if you're familiar with Bella\ncanvas you're probably familiar with flowy but you might not know what that\nnecessarily means the flowy collection is made of our poly viscose fabric it's\n65% polyester 35% viscose it's a 30 single and it's is 3.7 oz what's unique\nabout this it's got a really soft silky and it's an elevated fabrication that\nyou would find at retail for women's apparel\nit also drapes away from the body so it's slightly oversized so no matter\nwhat shape or size you are you're gonna find something in the flowy collection\nthat's right for you for the past seven years flowy has only been available to\nwomen but we recently added a poly viscose unisex tee to our fast fashion\ncollection and that's awesome for those sublimation printers out there because\nit's perfect for that type of printing last but not least we have our\nmarble fabrication marble is another one of our signature textures that gives you\nthat great dimension but it's awesome for graphic tees it's 91 percent\npolyester nine percent combed and ring spun cotton it's a 30 single and a 4\nounce so it's got a really nice soft tan to it and again that great texture a lot\nof other brands in the industry have Heather CVC and tri blend options for\nyou but no one else does dimension like this now you should all be fabric\nexperts but if you still have questions leave them for us in the comment section\nbelow it would have been too much to cover printing tips and the difference\nbetween all the fabrics so keep an eye out for our new video that will cover\nall of the different techniques for these fabrics right here Be Different", "z32xKFjoJf8": "hey there if you're anything like me then you practically live in t-shirts especially this year besides the odd polo button-downer sweater 95 of the time i have on a t-shirt i walked into my closet recently to pick one out for the day and realize that majority of the ones i own were either deformed torn or years old for such a staple i wanted to invest in some quality pieces that would not only look good but hold up over time as with anything once i get into something i dive way too deep i spent the next few days researching blogs reddit posts youtube videos and everything in between to learn everything and anything i could about what makes a t-shirt great a few more days and nearly six hundred dollars later i got the top few brands that were mentioned frequently across those platforms i put them all through their paces and made sure i tested them as thoroughly as i could to find the best t-shirt available for men right now if you appreciate the effort all i ask for is a like and free to consider subscribing it means the absolute world my ideal t-shirt is one that nails three things the fit the feel and the overall quality my definition of a good fit is one that drapes well hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but leave some room in the stomach for a large meal or those temporary quarantine pounds for the feel i'm looking for something that is soft to the touch in terms of quality i prefer a heavier t-shirt that has a solid collar is durable and doesn't shrink when it's washed i'll be giving away the shirt i rank the highest in whatever size and color the winner picks to enter subscribe to the channel drop a quick like and comment a video idea down below and i'll pick a winner in the next few weeks stick around to the end of the video to find out which one you could potentially win thanks for watching let's start with the uniqlos to pima cotton crewneck t-shirt i've seen such high praises for this tee on reddit and decided to give it a shot after reading glowing reviews made in vietnam the shirt is 100 supima cotton supima cotton is a brand of cotton that is grown in california texas new mexico or arizona and is amongst the top one percent of cotton grown in the world it features extra long fibers that supposedly give it more strength softness and color retention and less pilling than normal fibers there is no weight that is advertised but the fabric feels pretty thin in comparison to the others on this list the fit is between a slim and a regular fit it hugs the arms well and leaves room in the stomach but shrinks a bit after a wash i opted for a small and it fits well the neck opening is on the smaller end and wears higher than the rest which may be a plus depending on your preference for 15 the t-shirt is pretty good but leaves a lot to be desired the quality definitely isn't there and the t-shirt doesn't hold up after a few washes i noticed a little bit of shrinkage after a wash but nothing too significant it definitely lost some of its initial softness when i washed it and feels like a normal jquery t-shirt afterwards the color feels pretty weak and although it's fine now i suspect i'll develop a bacon neck and a few more washes people have said that the quality on these used to be very good but has gone down in recent months when the production shifted from cambodia to vietnam the fabric feels thinner fits worse and doesn't hold up nearly as well overall for 15 dollars it's still a solid t-shirt for anyone on a budget but it isn't as great as it used to be considering companies like bella and canvas make a similar quality t-shirt for four dollars i'd rather spend my money there and save up for something a bit higher end ask it is a swedish company started in 2015 with the pursuit to create the best basics and as a minimalist favorite i've heard a lot about this company and i've always wanted to try them out so i went with a regular t-shirt ascot uses 100 egyptian cotton and has a weight of 180 gsm the fabric was soft to the touch but not as soft as cuts it offers enough structure for it to feel well made but flows enough to drape over the body really well ask it offers 15 different sizes for the t-shirts from an extra small to an extra large and then breaking down even further into short regular and long it lets everyone find their ideal fit which seems like common sense but is rare for some reason the t-shirt was dyed sewn and assembled all in portugal and the craftsmanship is great the collar is ribbed and feels very sturdy after a few washes i can confirm it holds up just as well as it did when i was brand new the fit is what shined through the most this was snug in all the right places but left just enough room in your stomach without looking sloppy you'll still get that streamlined silhouette and tons of versatility with this t-shirt i opted for a size small and it fit exactly how i expected it to i could also probably get away with the medium but i'm not sure if it would hug the chest and arms as well at 45 this is pricey but worth it in my opinion ask it offers a great product and their customer service is always willing to help it offers a simple well-made crisp t-shirt and a ton of different colors overall i was very impressed and it definitely lived up to my expectations moving along to the cuts split hem crewneck t-shirt just a quick heads up their marketing is insanely persistent so be prepared for them to take over your facebook youtube and instagram ads as soon as you visit their website the ads obviously worked on me because i eventually gave in just to see what the hype was about immediately out of the box the t-shirt was insanely soft and bouncy it's made of cut's own fabric called pike up the only info they give on it is that it's a tri-blend fabric but if i were to guess i'd say it's a mixture of cotton elastane and polyester the fabric feels very performance oriented in a synthetic way even though it's made to wear casually that isn't a bad thing but just something to note compared to the 100 cotton options on this list i opted for a medium as the fit is on the slimmer end the t-shirt sits a bit long and bunches up near my waist and makes my legs look very short when i wear these with cuff jeans i do prefer to wear them more with joggers as it looks a bit more streamlined they have a build your own concept where you can have a choice between three necks the crew the v-neck and the henley and three bottoms the elongated curve the split and the classic curve the color palette is always on point because they stick close to neutral tones while adding new shades every season the fabric is thin and breathable but not in a cheap way the collar is very thin so it eliminates the chances of deforming after a few washes i haven't experienced any shrinkage at all at 48 dollars we can definitely see where their marketing budget comes from i'm impressed by their buttery fabric the stretch how low maintenance it is and the fit but probably wouldn't buy another one due to the length and the price up next let's talk about the everlane premium weight crew in a size small although it is marked as a slim fit this is the boxiest out of all the t-shirts leaving plenty of rooms in the sleeves and through the body at 6.2 ounces i love the weight of this t-shirt but it was the most basic feeling out of the batch it reminds me of a fresh golden tee but with a bit more weight it was scratchy initially but has softened slightly after about a year of washes and wear the neck has held up pretty well and i love the color of this t-shirt coming in at 30 dollars i would say this isn't worth it in my opinion but if you like boxier fits and a wide variety of colors to choose from this might be the way to go next up we have the robert brockett t-shirt i was introduced to this brand when my girlfriend snagged me the white one from nordstrom's anniversary sale last year i went back shortly after and bought the dark gray one for myself and then picked up the navy one this past year the canadian company calls it the rocket tea but it is also known as a georgia crew and some retailers it's made from 100 ultra fine us grown cotton and is finished with a heavy enzyme blush robert brockett claims this helps give it a worn and broken in feel and gives the fabric a slight sheen both of which i can attest to the material is cool to the touch and very smooth these have been a part of my rotation for about a year now and i've experienced no loss of color all mine are a size small they might fit a bit large initially but they shrank a decent amount on the first wash so something to keep in mind when sizing the shirts length was perfect when new but is slightly short for me after the shrinkage the arms and chest region came in nicely and were perfect for me after the wash the collar shows no sign of wear even after wearing these regularly for about a year the split hem is a nice feature that prevents any pulling for more athletic legged people there are 60 on the website but please don't pay that much for this t-shirt nordstrom's anniversary cell brings it down to 38 for all the staple colors and i've seen quirkier ones go for as low as 20 on nordstrom rack just be sure you search for the georgia tea on the discount sites at that price these are some of the best bang for your buck and are worth stocking up on 316 specializes in raw denim so i was a little hesitant adding them to this list however there seems to be a cult-like following for their t-shirts and i had to see what it was all about the regular crew was sold out so i opted for the pocket t-shirt but the material and fit are the exact same right off the bat these are super soft to the touch almost a viscose like softness to them but they're 100 american grown pima cotton the fabric is roughly 160 gsm so it feels substantial in a good way the triple stitched collar feels very sturdy there were two lines of stitching on the collar and one line right below after looking at the size chart i opted for a medium the fit was okay but was easily the biggest drawback about this t-shirt the sleeves didn't hug my arms and it was very boxy around the torso area i might need to try the small and report back if it's any better the shirts are made in the states so they come at a premium they're only available in packs of 2 which i don't understand why but many higher end t-shirts seem to go this route colors are limited to black and white in the pima shirts as of me making this video they come in at 95 for a pack of 2 or about 47.50 a piece they're really high quality so the price is justified but they aren't my favorite solely due to the fit lady white company was started on this one t-shirt i was super excited to get this shirt in because i was intrigued by their claims of no side seams it's something that i haven't experienced before this model is called the hour t-shirt it's made of 100 cotton grown in north carolina the t-shirt is then knitted cut and sewn in los angeles the construction on this t-shirt was flawless the double needle stitch sits perfectly on the collar and lines up perfectly with the shoulder seam which is actually very hard to accomplish the fit was relaxed and boxy so i'm glad i got a small to get the fit i was looking for the main feature about this is the lack of seams on the side they claim it helps achieve a more natural drape and allows a t-shirt to conform better to the body they accomplish this by using circular knitting machines that allow the torso area to be sewn as a tube it's super unique and is something i found really cool the fabric itself is six ounces so it has a very good weight to it i ordered a size small in the dark gray color and it fit really well however i was disappointed when i took it out and the fabric was very rough the fabric didn't have that soft brush-like finish that i looked for personally it felt like a fresh vintage tee from the mid-1900s which isn't a bad thing just something i don't prefer i would almost compare this shirt to raw denim it's not the most comfortable and soft out of the bag but you can feel its heft and sense of quality it's supposed to break in and get softer the more and more it's worn so i'll have to see what it's like a few years from now gray navy black and white come in a pack of two for 99. if you want a different color you'll be looking at 55 for a single one the construction and fit were great and check my boxes but overall the t-shirt was okay i'll probably get heat for this since this t-shirt is supposed to be the holy grail but i just wasn't that impressed by its feel maybe i just don't get it maybe i just haven't worn it enough but i don't think i would run out and grab another one anytime soon i know there weren't many negatives or drawbacks in this video but it just goes to show how great most of these shirts actually are all of them are worthy enough for a spot in your rotation but it just depends on what you look for in a perfect tee based off the fit softness and overall construction ask it took the top prize for me i love how it doesn't look out of place under a suit or on shorts it's a crisp t-shirt that only gets better with age i would give robert barakat a close second followed by cuts 316 lady white co uniqlo and then everlane in that order i can't wait to give away an ask a tea to one of you guys if you enjoyed the video please drop a like and subscribe it helps tremendously i'll catch you guys in the next one thanks", "oRd1vd-2cq4": "What\u2019s up

of our new printing\nshow here at wekoma with the increase in demand for printed\ncustom apparel and other types of printed goods we decided to create a\nbrand new series where we showcase what today's printers\nare capable of and how your custom apparel business can benefit from them\nso before you go make sure to like and subscribe so you don't miss any of our\nfuture episodes all right with that out of the way let's move on to today's\nepisode in which we are going to be transferring\na design onto a cotton t-shirt using the r550\ntransfer printer and the ricoma flat heat press the r550 white toner transfer\nis a versatile printer that can print full color designs that you can then\ntransfer onto cotton and polyester using a heat press\nand since this is a white toner printer you can actually print bright\nvivid whites on your dark garments also the two-step\nsimply peel transfer media that comes with this printer is a great low-cost\nsolution for high quality garment and textile transfers the sheets have a\nclear coating that protects your printed graphics and prevents cracking when the\nfabric is stretched the transfer sheet is also transparent making it easy to\nposition your graphic correctly on your garment now let's go ahead and get\nstarted all right so let's go over the materials\nwe're going to be using today first up we got our cotton black t-shirt\nthen we have our teflon sheet for our heat press and then here we have the two\nsheets that we're going to be using with the heat press\nand the printer to create our transfer paper so first up we got our transparent\ntransfer sheet this is the one that we print this\ndesign on using the printer and then we combine it with our adhesive\nsheet using our heat press to create our final transfer sheet and\nthen obviously we're using the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer and\nthe ricoma hp 1515 heat press now the 1515 stands\nfor the surface area of the heat press which is 15 by 15\ninches all right so let's get into the profit potential for these kinds of\nprints so we bought these shirts at wholesale\nat a site called jiffy shirts and they were about 2 dollars and 25\ncents each then the ink and the transfer papers actually cost about\nthree dollars so that puts our entire investment to about five dollars and 25\ncents shirts like these you could sell them\nfor about 15 to 20 dollars so that means that you have a profit potential\nof 9 to 14 around that all right so let's go over to our computer so that we\ncan start printing out our transfer sheet now this software is included with\nthe purchase of the printer like everything else that we're showing\nin this video so if you're interested go down to the link in the description\nall right to do this we are going to be using the icolor pro rip software\nnow in this episode we're really just going to go over an overview of how to\nprint a transfer sheet but in the future we're\ngoing to be making other videos that go more in depth into the software\nso basically all i have to do is grab my design that i already have here on my\ncomputer drag it over to the software and it's\ngoing to appear now all i have to do is wait for the preview to load\nand then i can go ahead and start setting up my project now because of the\nfact that this design was essentially created by a designer\nand it is already created to the dimensions of a regular\nprinter paper of about eight and a half inches by 11 i\nreally don't have to do a lot and in fact the software already puts the\ndesign mirrored so that when i place it on the\nshirt it is in the right orientation all right so since it is already\npositioned where i want it all i have to do is go here select the project\nright click and print all right so i'm going to go ahead and load my\ntransparent transfer sheet onto the printer so that i can print on it\nnow i'm going to be doing that with the matte side up and the glossy side down now as soon as i insert the tray it\nshould already start printing since i already set the design to print\nall right so here we have our hp 1515 heat press now i have the temperature\nset to 310 degrees fahrenheit now before i do any kind of pressing\nwhat i'm actually going to do is preheat the bottom layer of the heat press\nfor about 120 seconds all right so one of the cool things\nabout this heat press is that when the timer is done it'll actually\nautomatically open all right so now that our heat press is\nnice and warm we're gonna take our transparent\ntransfer sheet we're gonna take out the tray and we're gonna put\nour transparent transfer sheet with the glossy side down again\nin the middle of our heat press then we're gonna take our adhesive sheet and\nwe are going to try to place it right in the middle of the transparent\none lastly we're going to put our teflon sheet\nand place the tray back inside of the heat press now we still have our timer\non our heat press set to 120 seconds and we're gonna be going for again 310\ndegrees fahrenheit all right so our heat press is done i'm\ngoing to take out the tray remove the teflon sheet\nand i'm going to peel now the trick is to do it at a consistent rate\nand non-stop and there you have it there's our\ncompleted transfer sheet all right so we're going to take our\nshirt and we're going to place it on the tray of the heat press\nright in the center or as best we can and\nwe are going to press the shirt for about 10 seconds just to remove any kind\nof moisture and wrinkles i'm gonna smooth out the\nt-shirt all right now before i place my transfer\nsheet on the actual t-shirt what i'm gonna do as an added precaution to make\nsure that i don't have any streaks of residue or anything like\nthat what i'm actually gonna do is just cut around my design\nall right so the next part is placing our design on our actual t-shirt\nand for the first time we're actually going to place the design with the\nglossy side up and the reason for this is because\nthe adhesive and the ink is actually on the matte side\non the bottom and that's the part that we want touching the shirt\nand now we're going to place it by measuring about four fingers from the\ncollar and we're going to try to put it in the\ncenter as best we can that looks about good i'm going to go\nahead and grab our teflon sheet i'm just going to place it above\nand we are going to press this at 310 degrees fahrenheit\nfor about 40 seconds so we're done pressing our shirt and\nremove the teflon sheet and we are going to take our shirt with\nthe design and we're going to place it to the side\nto cool down you want to wait about three to five minutes\nall right so it's been a few minutes so let's just go ahead and peel it now in\nmy opinion i think that this is the most satisfying part of the entire process perfect all right so now we're just\ngoing to finish off the process with another press at 310 degrees for\n20 seconds as always put your teflon sheet on top put the tray\nin the press and change my timer to 20 seconds\nand press we're gonna take out the tray peel the\nteflon and that's it there you have the finisher all right and that's it that's how you\ndo a heat transfer using the r550 printer\nand the heat press two-step transfer printing is an easy way to produce full\ncolor designs that can be transferred onto dark cotton tees\nlike this one you can also print designs on hard surfaces like mugs plates and\nbottles the ricoma r550 is the perfect printer for anyone looking to get into\nthe printing business or expand their current product line and if\nyou pair with one of ricoma's high quality heat presses\nyou'll stay ahead of your competition while reaching a wider customer base and\nkeep in mind that we do have this printer available for you to purchase at\nricoma.com so if you're interested click the link in the description below\nalso if you want to connect with other apparel decorators like

brought to you by Bella campus the innovators behind black Heather and fast fashion just launched their very own YouTube channel not all t-shirt lamps are created equal alright then we are going to go over good better and best t-shirt lengths with Bella canvas not only that at the end of the video you are going to have the opportunity to win good better and best t-shirt flex because feeling is believing video coming up all right guys I was at the Bella canvas headquarters in Los Angeles California and we went over good better and best t-shirt lengths okay and I was with the head of sales and we are going to show you the difference all right and not only that you're gonna have an opportunity to win all three so you can feel them and see which one you're going to use in your t-shirt business alright so wanna hear hear it go hi Gary from t-shirt helpdesk and I'm here was Meghan she's the head of sales at Bella campus and I know a lot of you guys have questions about t-shirts Heather's try blends solids tell us about what's going on with all I'm gonna give you the run now reposition it kind of a good better best style 3001 is our best-selling style friend the bread and butter of our line that's because made out of 100% combed and ring spun cotton and why that's important is we literally comb out the impurities and then it's ring spun to create a really nice strand of yarn so that when we've met our fabrics it's a tight weave it's a smooth consistency it's a nice surface to print on and it's got that super soft hand so what we'd buy for ourselves at retail so this is gonna the gateway into the brand it's a really nice price point at 287 extremely competitively priced so that's kind of the transition into the brand if someone's maybe using a basics brand and they're trying to elevate their their line and get into something a little bit softer and a little bit nicer in terms of printing alright what are some of the qualities that we can look forward to style like this well the hundred percent cotton lends itself really well to DTG direct-to-garment printing is ideal for taking that type of ink it also discharges really well so I would say that's a good go-to for anyone looking to do DGG or discharging so this is the good category this is kind of that better tide worried this is still style 3001 you'll find that we like to mix fabrications within existing silhouettes so style 3001 will have solid kind of percent cotton colors and then poly cotton color so thisis our other CBC it's a fifty to forty eight poly cotton blend and what makes it unique is that it gives it that nice Heather appearance we're seeing a major trend in the market for customers printing on Heather's because not only that nice vintage texture but also that polyester consider and so at 3:05 this is a good kind of lower price point but step up from the hundred percent cotton and we have a wide variety of colors within the three thousand one so no matter what they're looking for whether it's artwork for the graphic or a logo there's something in our color palette to satisfy their needs very minute so if I have to choose any fabric to represent Bella campus it would be our tri-blend I realize that I'm biased but we have the best try one on the market feel that one hmm so it's a 50% polyester 25% combed in ring-spun cotton 25% rayon blend and it's a 40 single the single is kind of like the thread count the highest single the finer the fabric and with the only brand in the industry to do a 40 single try one so it gives it a really silky hand if you have a customer that likes that heathered appearance but they have a tighter budget they can go with the Heather CVC the try one is gonna be able to form a premium and 459 but it feels really good and we have a 36 colors total which is the most try Blanc colors in the industry and I wish you guys could feel this I mean it feels like love really really soft great product so that was it guys good better best t-shirt out that side alright guys so that was it now this is your opportunity to hit the giveaway okay for a select few people okay we're gonna have a package with good better and best so

different types of cotton. Do you know\nthe difference between carded open-end ring-spun and heirloom combed and ring-spun?\nIf not in this video will be extremely useful for you. We're gonna compare how a\nscreen print and DTG print perform on these three types of cotton. Cole from\nShirt Agency is gonna show us how these different types of cotton print\nbut before we get started we just want to explain the differences in these\nqualities of cotton. So first you have your card at open end, your card at open\nend is your cheap scratchy heavier t-shirt? Yeah and then from there a lot\nof our retail customers have moved on to ring-spun because it has a much smoother\nsurface. And the next step up from ring spun is your heirloom combed and ring\nspun. And with ring-spun you can comb out one percent and still call it combed and\nring spun. But we actually comb out about 25 percent of the cotton that we start\nwith because it contains impurities that we don't want in that finished product.\nAnd we also only use long staple cotton which has a huge effect on the final\nresult so you end up with the smoothest printing surface possible. Yeah we\nabsolutely love printing on your guy's garments we get a really nice hand and\nfeel and our prints are really sharp. Today we're gonna show the comparison on\nthese three types of cotton that we talked about with a DTG print a plastisol print and discharge print so let's go see the results. So we have our\nplastisol prints hot off the press what are we looking at here? Well the\nmain thing good check out is on the carded open end when you look through\nthe loop you can see all the different fibers affecting the texture of the last\nscreen printing. And then obviously when you touch it with your hand it's got a\nrougher finish. Yeah you can definitely see some of the red fibers coming\nthrough mm-hmm. And moving on to the ring-spun one it is a little bit better but\nit's not necessarily like the best it could be. There's a little bit of\nfibrillation still happening and that's causing a little bit of a hand feel. And\nwhen you move on to the heirloom it's basically just a completely sharp\nfinished surface and on your hand it feels extremely smooth. So next we'll\nlook at our discharge print how does discharge differ from plastisol?\nSo with discharge instead of putting the ink on top like plastisol. We're\nactually removing the dye from the garment. So this to be honest isn't so\nmuch about the fibers anymore. This is about the quality of the dye and the\nquality of the base garment. So you can see with the heirloom we got a pretty\nclean sharp result with the discharge and then moving on to the ring-spun it's\na pretty similar result but we got a little bit more of the blue staying\nthrough it doesn't look like the true discharge. And then carded open-end\nnormally means that it's like a cheap shirt so we got a really nasty color on\nthis one which was a bit of a surprise. And I think that comes down to the\nquality of the dyes that they're using. Yeah how you dye the shirts is just as\nimportant as how you knit the shirt. So at bella canvas we dye everything in LA so\nwe can main that level of consistency and basically match all of our colors so\nyou have this quality when you have your discharge print. Alright and the third\nprint we did was a DTG or a direct to garment print. So what do you want to\nlook for in a shirt when DTG printing? Well the problem with direct to garment\nfor us pretty much all the time is with brightness. And so we had a pretty great\nresult with the heirloom cotton compared to the carded open-end. I think a lot of\nthat has to do with the tightness of the weave and the ink kind of falling into\nthe fabric. So with DTG it's more important than the other types of screen\nprinting to have a super tight knit weave since the ink lays on top of the\nfabric. Yeah and you already have such a high ink cost what DTG that your product\ncan't be sold for very cheap. And since you're not gonna be doing promo with DTG\nI would think that it makes sense to almost exclusively use a nicer ring spun\nor airlume t-shirt. Hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Now this is one of our favorite ring-spun\ncotton t-shirts. One because of how many colors it's offered in, love it that it\ncomes in so many cool colors. It's also great because it comes in a lady's\nversion too, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton shirt. It has a great fit, love this shirt so much. It actually, I think\nover the course of a lot of washes it maintains that softness which was a big thing for a hundred percent ring-spun. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model. He's gonna come over show it in action. First thing you're gonna notice is just that tailored fit, partially\nbecause of the side seam here. The side seam makes sure that it just kind of hugs the body. It's not going to be too tight, but it is gonna tailor in a little which is just flattering. Everybody wants now kinda that nicer fabric but also the nicer fit.  The next thing you're going to notice is the neckline. We love this because it's a great dip here not too tight either, has some flexibility. That ring-spun cotton has a little more tug to it than just a regular, 100% cotton. The sleeve length is also awesome, super flattering it's a little higher. It's not going to be baggy, which is great. Now you might be  wondering though, we've talked a lot about a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, how does it, how does it wear over the course of life? Is it gonna shrink, anything that way. With this garment\nyou're not really gonna have to worry about shrinkage over the first few washes. A year or two years down the line, it could potentially if you're gonna nuke this thing in the dryer but it is pre-shrunk and very true to size, so we love this. Again, like I said though it does come in a ladies version, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Overall, great shirt, love it, a ton of color options and you look great in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two.

to another episode of fit design TV so happy to have you here on today's episode we'll be looking at cotton and polyester through the lens of a sportswear designer if you guys are wondering which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sports or collection watch this video you're gonna find out [Music] welcome to fit design TV on this channel we'll explore what it takes to make it as an active wear fashion brand whilst providing tips tricks and actionable steps towards starting your own product line whether an entrepreneur look at the start your own brand or just someone interested in fitness fashion there's something for you here [Applause] [Music] cotton/polyester are often compared to contrasted just because they're so widely available on the market they're pretty much two of the most popular farmer types when making a selection on what fabrics to make there's a good reason for this and we'll go through it in this video the main difference that you need to know about these two fiber types is that cotton is a natural fiber versus polyester is a man-made or a synthetic fiber that we made in labs and those are pretty much the main core reasons as to what drives their differences we're looking at six different categories in terms of determining which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sportswear application hopefully by the end you'll be able to make an educated decision on what is right for you we'll be looking at the durability of these two fiber types the temperature regulation of these two fiber types we'll also be looking at the comfort and feel of these two fiber types the ease of maintenance or cleaning the cost associated and last but not least the light weight this of these two fiber types we'll start off with number one the durability the durability has a lot to do with that cotton is naturally occurring and polyester is a synthetic fiber cotton will wear out over time a lot more easily than polyester while you'll notice with a new cotton t-shirt is it's good at retaining its shape up until a few washes at which point it begins to break down from a fiber standpoint it gets a lot more loose it starts to hang loosely it gets a lot softer and this is because it's just much more of a delicate fiber versus polyester which is polymer based it's synthetic fiber it's just going to have a lot more strength into your ability over time it's going to be able to withstand a lot more wear and tear which is important when it comes to sportswear design we're always active we're moving around we're putting our garments through a great ordeal of dynamic activity and our garments need to be able to match our need when it comes to stretch or movement or agility and if cotton is going to wear out over time you're going to notice your garment get looser it's not going to fit as well and it's just overall not gonna perform as well as it needs to perform versus polyester it's gonna go through a lot more wear and tear before it exhibits similar levels of deterioration polyester wins here next is temperature regulation if you know anything about the way that our bodies regulate temperature you know that we spell sweat through the surface of our skin and through the process of evaporation we move away heat from our bodies cotton is breathable which is a win for it in that regard however it absorbs moisture it doesn't wake moisture away from its surface puts it on the skin so what that ends up doing is it prevents the body from allowing sweat to evaporate away from the skin thereby allowing you to feel hotter which polyester doesn't do polyester is more thermal constricting up until a certain point so it'll make you feel hotter and a certain range of temperatures but it will allow you to quick sweat away to the surface of your skin which will allow it to evaporate it won't hold on to that moisture and it won't give you that hot look that cotton is going to do because cotton is just gonna want to absorb all this sweat or first is polyester which is going to wick that sweat away so coffin is much more suitable for neutral climates polyester on the other hand is going to be the more suitable for hot climates where you're going to want to sweat or cooler climates where you're going to want to constrain or restrict the movement of heat away from your body so if you want to look at it cotton is in the middle neutral and then plaster on either sides of the climate scale next we'll look at the comfort and feel comfort of your is a major reason why we select certain fabric and it's no different in this case polyester is known to be a bit more let's just say allergenic when it comes to the way it reacts with people's bodies yes it's silky and it's smooth but it does cause some irritation on a decent segment of the population there are many people that may overcome a certain level of irritation or just an overall mild discomfort with polyester based fabrics that they won't with the cotton content being durable sorry cotton being breathable and cotton being natural it just lends itself to being a lot more suitable for a wider range of skin types so cotton is going to get the edge in this regard cotton is just a generally more forgiving fabric when it comes to skin types and how it meshes with our bodies we also want to look at the ease of maintenance or cleaning like I mentioned cotton is just less durable so it's going to withstand less wear and tear that is afforded by washing whether it's a washing machine or your washing by hand you're going to wear out cotton and faster than polyester polyester though is more prone to deterioration from heat from high levels of heat because it's a polymer based compound it's going to be a lot more sensitive to heat which is also why you can't iron it nor should you iron it but the plus here is that you don't need to iron it whereas caught in wrinkles very easily needs constant care and attention to iron it polyester on the other hand doesn't you just have to be careful not to iron it because you will ruin the garment and not the subject the high levels of heat in a washing machine so it's a give and take here but generally polyesters is going to be easier to maintain over time we want to look at the cost cost is a complicated subject because there are a wide range of different qualities of polyester and cotton but if we're going to be very objective and comparing one to one generally cause it is more expensive than polyester because cotton is a naturally occurring fiber it's limited in our supply - what is available in terms of the agricultural landscape what is the local market able to offer us in terms of raw supply of cotton plant in order to create our cotton fiber needs versus polyester which is a polymer based compound we are able to make it a lot more freely and on our own terms so polyester is going to be cheaper in this regard however you can get better quality of polyester and at the same time you can get a better quality of cotton so it depends it is a give-and-take but I want to one buy a service gonna be cheaper the last is the lightweight nature of both garments hello cotton is more breathable on a meter per meter basis where both fabrics have the same thickness you're going to notice that polyester is going to be significant more lightweight again it is because of the fact that this is a synthetic fiber we're able we were able to create it and as lightweight a case as we can polyester generally is much more lightweight than cotton so for sure if you're going for a lightweight fabric and you want to have some thickness to it you want to go with polyester versus cotton that being said both fabric types or fiber types do have their applications in different cases but we generally do recommend polyester when looking at a core fiber type to incorporate your collection coffin is great for a certain level of tops or lightweight garments that you want to have in a situation where you want to have a natural fiber of your collection but for more of your heavy duty core essential garment types you want to look at polyester because it's going to perform in a way that is a lot more analogous with the needs of sportswear design hopefully guys that makes sense we've also done a video on polyester versus nylon because those are both synthetic fibers that often get compared we give you our verdict on that one highly recommend you check it out if you want us to compare and contrast any other fiber types leave it in the comments below we always love making these videos for you guys if we missed on anything again in the comments below thank you so much for tuning in to fit design TV until next time sails", "1F60Z4GXTtM": "So today I'll be going through a few black\nshirts to find the best ones for you. So when it comes down to the black shirts,\nI know it gets tough to find a better, yes. Black shirts based on your occasion, based\non a week, the one where for Bob, we'll go through a few different collections that I\ngathered. So I was showing you guys what shirt would\nfit best and based on your occasion, What's going on guys. Welcome back to Arccway new direction of a\nbody, man. My name is mr. Lou (Tolu) so I bought a few\nbasic black t-shirts for you guys. Cause I want to go through the best basic\nblack t-shirt that actually will fit your liking based on your situation. Sometimes people will want a shirt just to\ngo under. The long sleeve. Sometimes they want to have a basic black\nshirt ring looking to fit in real, look into texture room and looking to usability or looking\nto like wrinkle test, just to see what it looks like when it has a little more wrinkles,\neven it gets on done. So the first he should have for you guys is\nfrom Uniclo. This is a medium size. So I'm going to throw this on and tell you\nguys my review. So off the bat, having a shirt from Uniqlo,\nit is tight around the arms for more or less. For me for black shirts is a little more different\nthan my whites. But I do like my blacks a little be more tighter,\na little more slimmer. So for me, this t-shirts, she a little bit\nloose around the arms, which is okay for me around the tourist. It has a little bit of a snip feel to great. So that's good as well. And black also just means she's it looks slim\naltogether. The texture quality of this is quite nice. It's it's a hundred percent organic cotton. It doesn't, you don't feel a starchy feel\nto wait. There's no rough patches. It's just a smooth texture all around the\nbasic t-shirt and where it builds the of this t-shirt. I will basically put it in my category of\nas if I put it under like a shirt. And if I put it under like a long time, Share\nit for going out for dinner, going out for an interview or meeting whatever the case\nis. I need to dress up a little more. This'll be the tee shirt on underneath my\nlong sleeve shirt for this is from this teacher is from unicorn. It goes for $10. So it's a good price point budget for if someone's\nlooking for a quality t-shirt, but they're on a budget limit as well. So pick yourself something up like this. I recommend this to you guys. So this show, how about right now? It's a top man and it is in a large, and this\nactually goes to the $15. So the fit of it, all the fit altogether is\nit feels a little constructed, a little bit it's around the arms a little bit. But altogether, this is too bad around the\nneck, the collarbone right here. You can just feel it. This feels like it's the piece of fabric,\nwhich I don't technically like a lot, but I think over time we'll get used to that fabric\njust over my collarbone. Um, for me, this feels more or less like a\nt-shirt where it's just. Sits on you. It doesn't really construct your body. Um, there's a lot of wind span beyond the\narms here. It's not really designed before or a certain\ntype of cut texture wise of this shirt is actually nice. I don't mind at all, a hundred percent organic\ncotton. It's soft. I can't have any problems with it or it's\norganic, no problems at all. So this is the type of shirt I actually wear\nwith my outerwear. So I'll throw like a bomber on over it. Or I'll fill out a squared off for the summer\ntime. So this is something that is not too thin,\nbut also not too thick. So it's in that happy medium. So I think typically, typically for me, I'll\nprobably wear this in spring more or less, and then maybe it goes in the fall where like\na lighter version of this. Cause it'd just be too hot and I need something\nto have that breathability for. So this is from Simon's, it is $10 and this\nis actually a medium. This actually has a slim fit cut to it. So for me, it is. Tight around the pecs and also around the\narms around the biceps, but it's actually not the bigger, it's not that huge of a difference,\nbut I'll typically probably wear this when I'm going out to events. Maybe going out to a speaking, maybe you're\ngiving a speaking. Um, you just want to look slimming, slimming,\ntrim all around as a full circle. And I think this is something that you can\nbe worn where if you go out to dinner party or so it's actual quality of the shirt is\ncaught in it and it is. Nice on the skin. I don't have any problems with it. It's only time how we problem with stress\nis when you do wash it after an initial purchase, and over time you start feeling and you start\nnoticing that it's not the same, like it, where it used to be. And that's where my concern is with buying\nt-shirts. I want to feel the exact same for the first\ntime I buy it. So the 14 shirt on the rack right here is\nfrom Guruji. And this is the one I'm wearing right now. This right here is the large and I actually\nam. Liking this shirt a lot more than I thought. So for this tee-shirt right here, the fit\nof it is nice. I do enjoy this. It does feel nice around the body fit wise. So this t-shirt, so this teacher right here\nis from boogy. So this one I got in a two pack where it's\n$15 per two. So it was also a good deal on the budget. So this is the lighter version of it, of a\ntypical t-shirt I experienced with a lot of, these are me for me around the arms. Did you have that breathability? You don't have a lot of give to it, but you\ndo have that constructive fit look to it. So I do enjoy that myself. So now going ahead, texture wise, this is\norganic is nice on the skin. I don't have any problems with this. So when it comes down to the wrinkle tests\nor I'm going to incorporate now so much, like the shirts I reviewed before, it doesn't give\nyou a new lot of wrinkles, but at the same time, you do get wrinkles over, over time. When it has more use off the bat, it's not\ntoo bad. It's good. I don't mind it. So where does it live? Spring where it's in the summer time. This'll probably be my go to shirt for you\nguys. I recommend, so this shirt is from banana\nRepublic. Okay. Got it. On sale. It typically is 29. It all is for the premium watch. T-shirt like I have for $10 on sale all around. It just feels good. It fits good. I can't complain. The width span of this is in a medium range\nwhere I do like a little give to it and not too tight to drop off this shirt, ultimately. Yeah, there is quite fine. It has a slim fit. So it doesn't feel too loose. Detection of this is. A hundred percent cotton. I can't complain with this yet again, when\nit comes down to usability, this is something I'll probably wear under my long sleeve shirts\nor a blazer from trying to layer up in the winter time. This will probably be my basic t-shirt. So now when it comes down to the wearability\nof this BR t-shirt, so I'll probably wear this when I do go out under eyes and long\nsleeve shirt, or if I typically want to wear something we're comfortable. So this type of share that I actually have\nfor winter and a fall for anything lighter, I won't tend to go to the BR shirts, but this\nis something that actually would keep you a little thicker on the cotton side. This actually has a lot more thickness on\nthe inside. And I do recommend this if you want to layer\nso gardens wrinkle tests, I really could go up a bit, but not, not too many problems yet. Again, it is a prewash shirt. So you're going to get that faded, look on\nthe black shirt as it is. So you can't go too wrong with having a little\nbit of wrinkles, but also. This looks a little more with the style of\nthe shirt. So this shirt I have on right now is a longevity\nshirt. This actually is from H and M and this is\nsomething I actually do prefer a lot more than most of those collections not only has\na longer fit to it. So it does have that modern vibe to it, but\nalso has that nice scoop at the end of the, at the end of the shirt. So it has a nice, slight new cuts at the end\nof the share that makes it a little bit, look base, look a little bit more modern, but also\nit looks good when you do layer it up. So this shirt is actually for. Very nice. And you can't go wrong with this. I usually get jerseys for it's a lot more\nbigger than usual. Cause sometimes we do throw in a rush. It actually makes shrink a lot more fascinating\nthan you expect. So I got this to the medium, even though when\nI tried it on the stories, usually a little bit bigger, but this is something yeah. I recommend for anyone who wants to start\nLarry up this year. So when it comes down to the fit of this shirt,\nit has a loose fitting all together. So it is a lot more breathable. And does it feel tight on the skin, which\nI do like for different purposes? So all together. This actually has a lot more give than usual. So around my torso is loose around my, around\nmy pet Torres is loose as well, arms and pits loose. Everything is really good with his share regarding\nthat longer looser fitted look there's some, you can go for attachment wise. There is cotton, so you can't go wrong with\nsomething like this in your wardrobe. So invest in something that has good quality,\nbut also have that longterm integrity within the shirt regarding the wrinkle test. I can't complain with this shirt yet again. Like many of the black shirts, especially\nthe washed black shirt. You want me to get a lot more wrinkles? This has a little glare to, it has a little\nmore of a sheet, the both shirts. So when you do wrinkle in itself over time\nis be conscious of it. And actually maybe steam it before you leave\nthe house. This is from H and M is from the conscious\nline. And this is actually seven 99 for this shirt. This is one of my favorite shirts. I don't want to be biased, but by want to\ngive it a genuine review for you guys as well. For me, this is actually a blue all around. He doesn't have a tight fuel, but yeah. It has a little bit of a snug feel to it as\nwell. Me, this type of shirt is my go to get again,\nlike I said before, from the chilling at the house running errands, this is my go to shirt. So I have no problem forming the sun. Um, and just for alcohol problems for as long\nwith a bomber and just going about my day. So textual wise, this is a car. It does come from the conscious line. If you don't know what the Asian unconscious\nline is, basically they will recycle the old products and use the same fabrics and textures\nof garments to reproduce new garments. So you kind of saved the planet at the same\ntime, but you're using all products to make new ones. For me, I really stand behind that type of\nbelief of recycling and making sure it was a better place. So this is something that is that right behind,\nand we're proud of you. So this way here is a premium cotton shirt\nby H and M. It actually goes from 1999. This was actually a lot more tighter than\nanything I've ever experienced. This is actually a small. I wasn't meant to grab this bike in this tell\noff the small that the meeting was not going to be too far from it, but I'll probably go\nfor a large event in this year. So what I can talk about with this shirt is\nthe quality. So ESPN client, like they stated I'll see\nmy difference from this and the other Asian. I'm sure it's by. I actually do fuel different when I wear this\nwith one of the. Simon seizures. I feel the Assamese t-shirts have a better\nselection of fabric. Textures is organic cotton with them. This one is a premium Kylene. So you'll feel a big difference between that\npremium cotton. T-shirts it depends when you're going to be\nusing that. Maybe it can be celebration of your birthday\nor friend's birthday party, or maybe just a celebration of life. So it can just. Maybe this depends on the certain situations\ndrew be wearing a shirt, typically four, but this is probably won't be my GoTo regarding\nshirt wise, but I'll probably have this in a category for maybe special occasions or\nwhen I either bust out something that I just need on the spot and it needs to look good\nand clean it out probably where I feel car insurance yet.

click that notification bell and if you're watching on instagram or facebook follow us so you'll be notified of all this fantastic information we have on the t-shirt industry now i know a lot of you guys are dead set you know exactly what t-shirt company you're gonna use to get your blanks from and some of you guys are undecided and this is why this video is being made and for some of you guys who are dead set you might see something that may uh change your mind now in this video we're going to be focusing on three main key points when it comes to a t-shirt blank fit feel and price now we're going to be covering quite a few t-shirts in this video so it may be a little lengthy so i took some time and created time stamps for each brand and that's going to be down in the description box okay so something piques your interest you can go right directly to that brand but i strongly suggest that you watch this video in its entirety so enough with all this talking without any further ado roll that beautiful bean footage here we go okay guys this is the ideal by next level you can see all the style number information down in the left corner this is what it fits like on the model we're just gonna lay it out and we're gonna give it the old uh feel test and it feels nice uh it's mediocre it's not the softest and it's not the scratches so it's like kind of right in the middle and it has that uh rip away label which is always good and it says ideal and not next level i don't know why and this is what it looks like uh from the back now the price is 366. and please note you probably can get these cheaper if you go direct to the manufacturer so here we are anvil and as you can see the fit is nice it's a standard fits a little bit more athletic but just slightly boxy but nice the feel is very nice i would say um out of five i would give it like a four uh uh three and a half three point five out of five you know somewhat soft you know and slightly above average all right it has that rip away tag so you can do your branding okay very nice um and here is the back this is the back uh how it looks okay really nice and the price is 326 okay of course you might get it a little bit cheaper now price in general something you want to take into consideration if it's a bottom of the barrel t-shirt um then you want to get a t-shirt that's less expensive so you can even in that lower price you can have some room to make a profit and if you're selling a more premium t-shirt then you want to get a better quality blank to justify selling your t-shirt at a higher price and of course that blank is going to be a little bit more expensive but hey higher price more profit which means you can afford the more expensive blank let's go to the next one okay so this is jerseys okay we all know jerseys all right and it's a slightly thicker slightly thicker shirt so we're gonna spread this bad boy out and you're gonna see that it's nice you just saw the fit it's a nice fit it's um not too boxy not too athletic you know not too fitted nice shirt and a feel it's good it's it's a good middle of the road shirt you understand what i'm saying no complaints and you can see right here that there's no um side seam which is usually um the more athletic um shirts will have a side seam and right here you see that that is that rip away tag which is always a good sign for a blank all right now the field is the middle of the road it's middle of the road about a three out of a five and the price is 431 which is a little a little high and this is how it looks from the back that's jerseys fit all right guys fit this is so very important because depending on your demographic meaning your core target audience meaning the people who you are pushing your t-shirt company to they may want a different fit you may have a young hip demographic they may want a smaller tighter fit you may have a older demographic all right they may want a little bit of a boxier fit you may have an athletic demographic or you may be one of these people that's out here doing a line for people who are bodybuilders or crossfit or something like that then in that case you may want a more fitted tighter uh smaller waist v taper type fit for your t-shirts everything has to do with your core target audience and not all t-shirts are the same alright so fit is so very important all right and this is the hanes tagless shirt um and this one is the epitome to me in my opinion it's a dad's shirt it's a shirt that you just kinda it's just a shirt that you just kind of wear it's really not for screen printing you can see um it's really big and boxy all right and it's very thick a lot of you guys think that thick is a higher quality and not necessarily all right the feel is it's okay it's it's a mediocre and there's no um there's no side seam all right it's very hand feel it's very mediocre not too soft not rough though not rough and this is really important right here the the back neck tag is already heat pressed so you can't brand it so not a good look and um this is how it looks from the back you can see it's very big and boxy so um not for me my opinion not the best for starting a t-shirt business for obvious reason but it does have a pretty good price 279 and you probably could get it cheaper guys the tag the tag is so very important there was a time when hey whatever the brand of the t-shirt was they left their tag in and there was a time when you literally had to pay screen printers to cut the tag out so you could put your branding in it that's not the case anymore they make these t-shirts with mostly rip away tags so you can rip that tag out and put your own branding in there so i always want to call out what type of tag hopefully a rip away is in your blank tee also guys when you doing all the branding and you have your neck label and your hang tags and your boxes and everything matches guys that stuff looks so professional such a what's called perceived value you take your t-shirt line to a whole nother level baby all right guys alternative apparel very nice shirt first thing you're gonna see you're gonna notice that it is a little bit more fitted okay so a very nice fitting shirt all right let's lay it out and let's give it an initial just a field test and it it's very soft guys very soft very nice shirt okay uh you can get in there touch on that feels really good all right and also you're gonna see that it is a you can see that side seam right there which helps with the fit so we're already having some uh some premium things going on you can see that fit you know a little bit a little bit more tapered and fit it to the body and it has that rip away tag so this one is definitely a little bit more on the primo side all right and the price is about 385 okay um and of course you may be able to get a little bit cheaper at the actual website but alternative apparel really nice shirt all right guys this is the hanes nano tee this one totally came out of left field for me uh different than the haines tagless tee all right really nice fit and the fabric is really soft uh dynamite tee all right the fit is not quite um the super fitted but it fit really nice and you're gonna see right here that it has a really nice feel okay now right here you're gonna see that it does not have the side seam okay but it still managed to have a great fit and i think that has to do with the fabric it's a really light soft fabric so this nano t uh surprised me and uh you can see that it also has that rip away tag all right so um really nice and once again the feel was a really nice you almost can see how soft it is right surprise me right because i never heard of the nano t this is it from the back and the price is three dollars and eleven cent once again you might can get it cheaper from haynes uh themselves so that is the haines nano t okay so here we are fruit of the loom now this one kind of surprised me a little bit i thought it was going to be really bad and it wasn't the fabric is actually a nice feel not the best not the worst it's a light it's a light t-shirt guys it's a nice light t-shirt and it gets the job done if you want to just put something out there throw a screen print on it uh for the loom and of course it has the rip away tag all right which any good t-shirt should have and it was nice it felt good has a decent fit and i was presently surprised this is it from the back and the price was 3.49 i thought it could have been a little cheaper but hey you know i got it from a reseller so if you buy directly from fruit of the loom you may can get it cheaper all right on to the next one gildan or gildan all right this one is popular this is usually the shirt that you see that's the lowest price when you're choosing t-shirts on print on demand and there's a reason for that that's because the fabric is not very soft all right it's not nice it's not that nice feeling at all i mean it's okay after a couple of washes but initially um not the best feeling and that's why it's uh the least expensive um but it's a cool tee no side seam and the fit is it's okay um it's not boxy and it's it's not tapered or or like really fitted um fabric [Music] not the best feeling man not the best best feeling but it does have a rip away tag which is always good uh let's take a look at it from the back um cool t-shirt but um i would say low on lower on the quality scale and the price 279 so you can see it's a little bit less and you know hey you get what you pay for guys all right gildan next level check this one out now great thing about next level is look at the fit really great fit nice fitted to the body great i mean you can see it on the mannequin here so let's lay it out and um first you know we're going to give it a nice little feel and um it feels great it's really soft really nice all right it's um definitely a higher quality shirt and also you're gonna see right here that it too has a side seam okay which is a um telltale sign of a higher quality shirt and the rip away tag here it is from the back the price of 439 so uh it's a little bit it's it's up there all right it's up there but it is a higher quality more premium t-shirt next level bella canvas good old bella canvas you've heard about them several times here at t-shirt help desk great t-shirt really light airy soft fantastic t-shirt with a great fit alright and let's take a look as you guys should know bella canvas also has the side seam okay which gives it a really nice fit it's light it's not a heavy fabric and it's really really soft and of course it has the rip away tag and as stated previously bella is one of the softest on the market all right right up there with next level and in alternative apparel here it is from the back and the price 439 but that's from a middleman you can get it from bella canvas as most of these for about a dollar to 80 90 cents cheaper bella canvas next american apparel yes they are still around okay um they are really soft t-shirts really nice all right and just to let you know this t-shirt all the other ones were largest this one is a medium so if it seems extra snug that's because it is one size down okay but it does have a really good fit all right and it has that side seam okay so it is a more premium shirt with a nice fit okay this is it from the side you can see that it is a good slim fit all right and it yes has the rip away tag so great to brand with this is it from the back all right the price 392 all right so it's more on the premium side but a little bit less and like all the other ones if you go straight to the manufacturer you can get it for less all right guys as you can see all of the t-shirts are 100 cotton i didn't want to get into anything crazy i didn't want to get into the tri-blends or anything fancy schmancy like that that's gonna be for another video i wanted to keep it basic 100 cotton t-shirts but there is one exception i am going to show you guys one 100 polyester tee this is a great t-shirt for any of you guys who are doing active who are doing sports people who are working out golf anything where people may be working out and get sweaty because 100 polyester is a natural wicking fabric meaning that if you're sweating it naturally will kind of wick that sweat away and another thing about 100 polyester tees is that they are great for sublimation in fact really it's the only thing you really can use for sublimation all right so if you want to sublimate small and if you want to do those big all over sublimation tees you need a 100 or at least a very high polyester content but one little thing if you're doing sublimation this shirt has to be a light color preferably white all right so let me show you this is the jerseys dry power sport t-shirt great shirt and it feels like a regular t-shirt that's what's so great about it alright so this is it and it feels very similar to a standard jersey t-shirt if you didn't know the difference you probably couldn't tell and it is soft not the softest but it is a soft t-shirt in the back it doesn't have the rip away tag okay so um branding is gonna be a little bit tricky but um the price is also a little bit uh more 563 this is it from the back but if you want to do that athletic stuff this is the way to go that was a lot of t-shirts guys they were in no particular order i really wasn't trying to critique like that i just wanted to present them to you so you can make your decision on what's going to be in your t-shirt line now when it comes to actually purchasing these t-shirts you can go to each brand's respective website but please note a lot of these companies are going to require you to have a wholesale or a retail license they may want to see your website all right so you know you may have to do that but you're gonna get the absolute best prices now if you don't have that no worries you can go to places like jiffyshirts.com which is where i got all of these shirts okay they have you covered you don't need any of that stuff you can just go you can buy as little or as many as you like so anyway guys that's all i got for you today i'm gonna put some butt on my shoes and slide on out the dope cheers to your t-shirts start a t-shirt business or die trying and do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself god bless and peace shirt man shirt man yeah that's me that's when you take your t-shirt line to a hoe damn that's taking it to another level baby", "32lJiw5L77M": "hi everyone and welcome back to my channel in today's video i'll be doing another round of redouble shop reviews so the other day i posted a community post asking for your rebel shops and if you want to be potentially featured on a future redbubble shop review video then make sure to subscribe to my channel so you stay up to date for when i post those because usually i will film the video a day or two after i post those so you don't have too big of a time frame to actually submit your shops so if you're subscribed then you get to see those posts right away and increase your chances of becoming featured and of course give this video a thumbs up if you like the reviews and want to keep seeing them but now let's head straight into the reviews and see what shops we have today okay so the first drawer we have here is denise dennison um i love the background a lot like it's super cute i'm guessing you probably illustrate these things and it looks super professional you have all of your social media link to it um your redbubble store name your brand name and a little bit about i guess the drawings that you make um i'm not sure what the store name stands for but you can't really change it at this point so who cares i feel like as long as your store name isn't like numbers and letters mixed together it's fine all right so 120 designs that's pretty good amount and off the feature collection is spring that is so smart because as you know spring is in the air and people love buying for new seasons and even without going into any of your other artwork or collections i already adore these photos they're so cute or i guess this artwork because you probably draw it or illustrate it on the computer i'm not just cat sleeping when it's cute it's a tea kettle or tea mug i like that all the store is very similar and it's definitely your own style oh my gosh i love this one and this cat sushi okay next time i buy stickers i need to buy from the store um let's go into one of the spring designs and see what you have so we have cat in a picnic basket so you have the watermark which is great because i noticed that not a lot of people have that so if you want to try and limit the chances of your getting stolen definitely include that so cat in a picnic basket is pretty good i mean it obviously explains what it is maybe say pink cat or something like that spring cat but either way it sounds good for the most part um we have watercolor drawing of cat in a picnic basket siamese kitten inside a picnic basket with a pink bow cottage core aesthetic picnic basket spring and summer design i think that's a great description um you really included like all the best keywords that you possibly could so yeah it's nice i see it's available on 85 plus products i would try to enable it on everything um why not like you could even pattern it on some of the other items that might not work with just like one image of it okay i love this store i can't get over it i think this actually might be one of my favorite shops i've ever seen um where are the tags okay here they are so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven not too many tags but i think she really is packing a punch with the tags that she has in there they're super relevant simple to the point and um you know describe what it is beyond just the subject so i think that's good i would add a couple more you know just to get to 15. might as well use it if you have the room but other than that like everything looks perfect everything fits properly yeah honestly one of the best drawers i've seen so good job next door here we have wk art creations right off the bat i noticed that they don't have a banner which i think they could benefit from one because their thumbnail looks really nice or their profile picture so you know if you have something in that design for the background i think it would just you know look a little bit better more professional 157 designs that is really good too their featured collection is abstract so you know that's good that you're able to get all those designs together and put it in a collection i think they're going for like a couple different niches here like they have quotes floral designs funny quotes abstract new year's design is geometrical um i think patterns are kind of like patterns and text based designs are the main things of the store i really like this one i feel like this one it could use like something in the middle like the pattern is like split up a bit strange this aqua blue leaf looks really cool this one looks really nice i think maybe with like the text based designs you could do a little bit of work like maybe different font or like different layout to just make it more like visually pleasing um but yeah like the pattern ones i think are really your forte they look really good like all the abstract stuff so good job oh that one's really cool the holographic print um i'm gonna go into this one and see the tags this is colorful texture design one i feel like that is not like i feel like that title is not descriptive enough so i would say like pink teal black rose or something like that texture design or i don't know if that's like red or pink i can't really tell um design so yeah definitely include some of the colors in there but i like they have like texture in there and colorful beautiful texture design and the color of black red and turquoise so you have some of the colors in there i would include pink as well and maybe just say something else about it just add another line to make it a little bit more enticing then let's see the tags we have texture pattern abstract so only nine tags here so just like the last one you definitely have room to add a few more and you know why not use it up if you can um it seems like you have gotten most of the things here but i'd add some more of the colors like maybe blue pink um yeah some more of the colors in there overall the store looks pretty good and yeah all the pattern stuff looks amazing okay let's move on to the next one next one is designed by darren so i have a lot of like cool i don't even know what to call this type of design i have it like in my head but i can't think of it right now so yeah i feel like it all matches together and that banner is really nice they have 182 designs and their featured collection of animals natural and mythical that's cool it all matches together oh yeah i think like tattoo style is what i was thinking when i saw this banner so yeah that clarified it for me um yeah lots of collections and even though they have lots of collections i feel like it's all like within the same style so i like that because it really makes the store look cohesive and you know like an actual like artist mail this stuff and put thought into it the sugar skull one is cool the wave is nice a lot of like cartoon inspired stuff i think too [Music] so yeah i think this store is really cool it looks like you spent a lot of time on these designs let's go into the sugar skull so it's sugar skulls galore nice and simple once again you can include the colors or i don't know maybe one other word in there because they do recommend titles being at least four words and of course the sticker part is not like the title officially um sugar skulls are plenty lots of eye-catching designs or details i think that's good but it doesn't really like incorporate a lot of the keywords that you can incorporate in there so i would maybe switch that up a little bit to say like green blue gray red orange sugar skulls or like rainbow sugar skulls and um you know include some other details in that description maybe even say like what sugar skulls are or you know what they're used for so 12 products here yeah some good variety there once again include the colors so they have designs by darren here so you know if anyone clicks it they'll they'll go to your artwork but yeah for the most part the tags look pretty good i think this might be the best like tagging round i've ever seen in reviews because they're all like very to the point they make sense there's no spam so good job for these first three stores okay let's move on to the next one the next one is lulai i hope i say that okay um i love the background already even though it's simple i feel like it does the trick you know it's nice and it lets the like the display picture shine through i think so 96 designs that is also great i think this person is going for a few different themes as well if they have you know lots of different collections some photography some illustrations graphic design got some beach stuff some cloud stuff let me just go into the cloud one so we have cotton clouds scattered in the sky that's pretty good but once again i would include the color like blue um or like maybe summer or something like that just to give it another type of keyword that isn't just about the clouds it doesn't look like there's a description for this one so make sure you go back and add a description it does not have to be long you know one or two sentences is fine but just something to add some extra search terms in there and just to give people you know a better understanding of where this photo came from or you know the the story behind it okay let's look at the tags the tags look pretty good as well um i don't see how they could be much more relevant so good job with that one and yeah overall it looks good maybe i would actually like crop this so it's not such an awkward shape because i feel like if people are buying art prints they usually want like a standard size to fit either in frames or like on their wall in like certain spots so i feel like that one it could be cropped up a little bit so it's more of like a square and less of a like long skinny rectangle so yeah i think i would say either make a square or like a smaller rectangle and i would say that for like any of your other designs that might be this shape as well [Music] okay but let's move on to the next door so the next door is cool sorry i probably said that wrong but i'm not sure how to say it but that was my best attempt for now um we have a cute little background here boom they joined in january 2017 so they've been on here for a while they only have 40 designs but who knows maybe they just restarted their shop or something like that even for me it took a while to get my designs up there so if you can try to post more but it looks like the ones you have are really high quality so sometimes quality over quantity oh these mama bear ones are so cute the vintage moths look really nice even all your tech stuff look really good so for the store i think it was a second store that i said they could use some improvement for their text based designs this is a great example of you know somehow you can improve as you can see these are really like nicely designed they have like some nice pictures attached to them and they're kind of like centered and laid out in the best way possible so it looks really nice and visually pleasing and yeah all the fonts for like all these text-based designs i think are very fitting for the quotes and they look like they aren't your typical like you know 10 standard fonts let's go into this pillow i really like that one this is that you complete me throw pillow so technically the title is only you complete me and i would definitely add a bit more maybe like coffee and donut you complete me or love you complete me or something like that just to add a bit more description to what it was because i feel like people wouldn't normally just search like you complete me because it's kind of random but i love the design it's super cute um description is once again you complete me so i never recommend putting the exact same description as the title so add a little bit more in there you know describe what it is say cute couple of donut and coffee complete each other love valentine's day heart whatever and then oh lots of tags so maybe a little bit too many tags but they do seem pretty relevant from what i can see maybe like celebrities not that relevant but yeah everything else looks relevant so in that sense it's fine but i think it might be a bit too many for redbubble um [Music] i do recommend keeping it to like 10 to 15 so yeah maybe take out a few of those like tv series those are kind of spammy because it doesn't really go with this but the ones that are like relevant keep those but yeah you have a really cute store as well and hopefully you get some sales out of it [Music] okay let's move on to the next one we have our will be a bit confused by this profile picture because it says dr but then like that doesn't match with their username so i know you're unfortunately stuck with this username whether you want to be or not but i would either make this like a picture or make it related to like this name the background is nice and simple i feel like maybe this part could use like some words or something but other than that it looks good so we have a lot of like graphic design style stuff text stuff i would say like same with these text based designs as i said with the second store try to make it look a little bit more enticing for the eye and like something people want to like you know have on different items not just regular fonts so refer back to the store before this as an example um let's go to this pizza is my everything i feel like that would be a popular one so pizza is my life yeah i think that's pretty much all you can say about that so it's a good title um pizza is my life art so here you replicated the same thing so try out a little bit more see like funny quote or cute quote cute food i don't know like something a bit more than that oh my goodness okay i think you might have oh okay i don't know if you did this on purpose or not like this is all one giant tag so i think you probably forgot to put the commas to separate all the tags so maybe go back and do that because this is not gonna get you any results so yeah that's one thing i recommend that was probably an accident but it looks like you know all the words that you have in there are relevant but just not gonna work if it's all one tag but yeah let's go on to the last store we have sm illustrations so right away in the name it says you know what they do illustrations and same in the banner looks really nice and they're also promoting you know their instagram on there i can't remember if i've seen this one before i feel like there's another similar one that i've seen um to this one but anyways the future collection is valentine's day so that was good that you had that for valentine's day but now it is over so it'd probably be good to change that when you get a chance but all those designs are really nice in there um lots of collections here yeah i really like your illustrations you can tell that you know they're handmade you actually put effort into them and i think people appreciate that oh and all your patterns are really nice too i like those a lot okay let me go into this one because that one really caught my eye because those shoes are really nice so it's called black sandal heels fashion uh art print shoe art sticker okay so i can tell that you put art print and art here you don't have to do that because if it's an art print they will add that for you so as you can see it says sticker here so you don't want art prints show up for like other random items so i would just leave it like black sandals heel fashion something like that or black sandals heel shoe fashion maybe yeah i love this piece looks really good oh okay i love this description already it says they were inspired by a pair of shoes it's on instagram cute fashion illustration of black realistic shoes so she goes into a little story about why she designed it why she likes it and i think that is perfect it really i don't know it connects you with the artist and their thought process behind the design and sometimes that can make you want to buy it more although i think they ran out of characters maybe or this last word is an accident so maybe take that off but then that looks good lots of tags um they all seem very relevant very good maybe a bit too many like like i said they want to do like 10 to 15 but other than that they all look super relevant so i mean i think it's fine but for next time you can you can maybe lower it but yeah i love your store and good job with all the designs they look super realistic and really cool okay so those were all the reviews i really liked all those stores and like with every other one i love seeing your stores and getting a chance to look at your designs it's really cool to see you know everything you guys come up with because everyone is so different from each other and yeah i love seeing them so yeah i'll definitely keep doing these videos not just to help you guys but just to see you know what kind of artwork you guys are putting out there but i can see that my camera is about to tie so i'm going to end this video off quickly and thank you guys for submitting all your stores if you didn't get featured now hopefully next time you might subscribe to my channel if you want to see all updates for when i post for new stores and if you want to see these videos come into your feed and give this video a thumbs up if you liked me reviewing the stores but that's all i have for today so i'll see you guys in my next one bye", "TS3IpvXLOfc": "hello again it's brett with shirtspace.com today we're going to talk about a tee that comes in a fun variety of colors is incredibly affordable and is great for printing if i piqued your interest stick around there are a variety of reasons you could be on the hunt for the perfect blank tee maybe you need one for your company's recreational kickball team maybe you make novelty tts for your small apparel brand or maybe you need a large bulk order for promotional items for your nationwide corporation whatever the case may be it is a daunting task to choose the shirt to serve as your blank canvas let us make it a little easier for you the port and company pc54 core cotton tee is a fantastic choice for a number of reasons let's start with weight the shirt weighs in at 5.4 ounces making it a perfect mid-weight shirt not too heavy not too light the cut creates a silhouette around the body that is not too form-fitting but also not overly flowy or boxy it's just right there are no side seams for this adult crew neck so you have extra room to work with if customizing with a unique logo message or design there are many vibrant and colorful shades to choose from to bring your design to life complement your brand or clients color palette perfectly with one of the 52 color options available many of the colors come in 100 cotton 100 cotton is a good choice for printing projects and garment decoration just make sure to pre-wash your shirt so that any shrinking doesn't warp your design and as always remember that 100 cotton is the ideal choice for tie-dye projects many of the neon and heather colors are a 50-50 cotton polyester blend with the exception of the ash color which is 98 cotton and 2 polyester these shirts are less likely to shrink than 100 cotton and they are ideal for projects for screen printing with water-based discharge and plastisol inks as well as heat transfer vinyl but as always make sure to check your heat settings and something to keep in mind port and company suggests taking extra care when printing on 50 50 cotton blend shirts that are on the neon colors to avoid dye migration and ink mishaps embroiders we recommend using any fabric this shirt comes in so stitch away this shirt is also extremely affordable leaving people baffled at the quality they receive for the price this is all the more reason to consider this shirt for buying in bulk tight budgets and commercial purposes now that you know all about the port and company pc54 head over to shirtspace.com the site to visit for all your blank apparel needs if you have any questions or a tier topic you'd

so today I'm gonna be showing you guys how about washing and drying my t-shirts so they won't shrink or lose any quality [Music] so I've quite a few shirts here I have one two three four five great t-shirts of course how we're letting gray three black t-shirts one two never mind just two black t-shirts should have a white t-shirt but I think I forgot it I'm gonna be right back and the white t-shirt so for starters one of the most important things to do it's of course sort them by color I've already done that as I showed you I have to graze the blacks and a white all separate the most important thing to do is to check the Kerr attack in most cases you're probably watching cold water when you're watching t-shirts especially colored t-shirts any kind of heat will shrink that t-shirt so we're gonna do a bit of a test I'm gonna use the Machine and also some hand washing methods to see which one works best before we get started we're going to measure the size of a cup of t-shirts a grey one and a black one just to see if they're gonna be the same exact size before and after washing let's do it [Music] tell me baby is a good touch time I managed alright now that we're done with the measuring let's let's get the washing so I have two gray split teeths from keeping New York everywhere so I'm gonna actually machine wash and in hand wash the other one they're both the same measurements both a size large so we're gonna see how do you still hold up so as you can see there's nothing really special about this wash I'm using is by a brand called Hotpoint have no clue what that is this would just actually inside my apartment when I moved in so this is the best we got we're using a small load we're using whites light and we always want to wash code as I mentioned one thing I will say about these low and washing machines even though you chose to wash and code in most cases is still gonna use hop for majority of the washing so that's just something to keep in mind and I can't say that it'd be the case for all washing machines but it definitely is for this one like I mentioned I don't know much about the brand hat point but I'm guessing this pretty low budget so let's look review what I got load size small I have this on whites light but let's actually go to delicates because we don't really want anything bad to happen to these clothes of course and for cold let's use tap cold we've got the shirts in there I'm gonna be using Tide Pods just one of them just one drop that in there they were gonna hit start now for the hand washing I'm going to be using Tide simply clean and fresh I'm gonna pour a little bit into the lid just a little bit make sure we're running cold water [Music] for the shout it's all the way alright and how do we have to save mother's before with cold water we're gonna pour a little bit of this in there mr. Bob Dole the t-shirt against itself I usually mainly focus on the pits [Music] because of course that's what perspiration happens very good and they'll rub it in and I do that for both mine arms now we're just going to let that soak for a little bit let me get little more water in there as I mentioned cold water dry like this so as you can see the water looks a little bit murky because of course is shirt was dirty and I'm going to check on the other shirts as I mentioned this water is hot we're just gonna do the same thing which allows for this to soak it now again I would not recommend using hot water to do these that of course what this all is about we're gonna test and see which method works best and then Jenny all right so a couple hours have passed since this has been soaking these items are completely done they've actually sat in here a little bit longer they should've I had to tend to some other stuff so I'm hoping these didn't drink at all it looks good that one looks good that one looks good so what we're gonna do with these items is hang dry them [Music] so I dressed in all the gray shirts out of the washer and then hung them on this drying rack that I got from Amazon this is a stainless steel drying rack I'm not sure exactly how much I paid for it but what I'll do is go ahead and drop a link down below so if you're wanting something like this you can find it now we have to dry out this so it's kind of hard to get a good angle on it but when I was doing I would grab a piece twist it fold it twist it fold it twist it and that's usually enough to wring out enough of the water I'm just going to put this on the rack as well and then let it dry overnight so now we're done washing all the gray t-shirts we're gonna go ahead and tackle the black t-shirts and I mentioned earlier I'll have two black t-shirts one of them is a keeping New York everywhere split tee another one is my champion logo black team I originally planned to hand wash one and machine wash the other but it actually got really late I got kind of doing something else and it's like almost 11 o'clock and I don't want to be up all night doing this video so I'm gonna go ahead and toss both of these in the washer before I do that I'm gonna do the same exact thing I did with the great tee and I'm gonna measure to keeping New York everywhere black tee as you can see keeping New York everywhere size large turn it inside out and let's take it to be measured before toss it in the washer don't need a one-handed I know two t-shirts and a washer by yourself is just a waste of water but it's kind of what I got to do I'm just like before one pod and we're gonna keep all this settings the same small delicate tap cold so now that we got the black t-shirts inside to watch her I'm going to go ahead and just hand wash this white t-shirt this is the last one has to be washed this is a white t-shirt from Urban Outfitters so let's do it [Music] alright so now we got the washer going and we got this white tee soaked in so now we're gonna wait for this cycle to be done and about that time I'll go ahead and take the shirt out of the sink alright so now we're gonna hang dry these hang drying is the most essential part of this process alright so lastly we're gonna tackle the white t-shirt and the same no I do have a setting that's going to be a drain and spin setting on my washer so for this one I'm going to utilize that if you don't have a drain and spin setting we're gonna utilize the first method I showed you which is the twist and ring [Music] [Music] as you saw I gave it a little bit of a twist in the sink as you can see it's still pretty wet so we're gonna head and drop this into washer so just gonna toss that in there we're gonna go ahead and twist this to the drain and spin and then see what happens here we go so now it's gonna drain and spin itself and then we can hang that up so it's been about maybe five minutes and I just heard to wash your stop which means this should be fully drain now all right so far so good it's pretty drain and nice and damp and ready to be hung drive the rack is pretty full got one two three four starts here the middle bar has another shirt another shirt oh boom there we go utilize this bar right here alright so all of these shirts are washed they're all drying right behind me I'm gonna get back at you guys tomorrow and then we're going to check it see how they turned out the next day it is officially the next day and the t-shirts have been drying for precisely 21 hours something like that I just got off of work and it's about eight o'clock and if you remember I think I put them to dry maybe a like nine or ten yes about almost 24 hours they are officially dry so let's check them out and Dan we're going to measure same exact t-shirts again to see if they lost any size or quality so let's do it so this was the hand wash t-shirt so he make sure he keep this separate just to remember that was hand washed the rest of these gray shirts were machine wash so I'm just going to compare these two in size because I took measurements of these so machine washed and washed and then we're gonna compare size to the black t as well was it this one yep this one hand washed cold water so a measuring from the top like before so see there all the way down and it is at 30 just a tad bit under so hmm I measured these a mouth will last my little notes here but you see the great teacher we've had at length 30 so let's see if the chest still not 23 and a half so we got the chest starting here 23 and a half so I get to save the state I really didn't lose much size with hand washing and again his home was hand washed in cold water and then hung to dry and now we're gonna test the other gray shirt that was machine wash and then hung dry so the second one just measured out for 29 and a half in a chest both these are the same exact size it looks like we might have lost a half an inch in the length and again this was the one I would machine wash so it's safe to say that the hot water that it did in a wash cycle may have shrunk just a little bit but let's check the chest so the chest is still twenty three and a half inches now to be fair I only measured one of these great t-shirts because since they're the same size I assumed that the dimensions would have been the same but that's false they probably weren't exactly the same so I should have measured both so if we were gonna lose size of the t-shirt we would have lost size from both the chest and length so at this point I don't think that the machine washing affected anything but the true testament will be the black shirt because again that went inside the machine and I did get measurements of that before going in so let's check that [Music] twenty-nine and a half like shirt merchants out at 29 they have and it appears that the black shirt didn't lose any size at all and that was in a machine wash on the dry so in conclusion I would say that it doesn't really matter which method used whether it's gonna be hand washing or machine washes make sure you use cold water and use the delicates settings for your washing machines if you have a washing machine that allows for you to control the temperature through the whole wash make sure you use cold but if it doesn't as you see minded and have those settings and for the most part I didn't lose any quality or size of my T's if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a thumbs up comment down below and if you're new to the channel make sure you hit the subscribe button and click the

so I'm gonna be I'm gonna keep it a band with y'all you know I mean I'm gonna keep it 100% you know me my first impression is what I feel lousy Bobby right so it says long decided a three I'm behind who doesn't know what 8:30 woman's I know 84 was the regular like eight points are about 11 well I think I don't know anyway um but what I measured my piece out to be was 10 by 15 like 10 by 15 that's what I measured out to be so I'm doing it on a black shirt so I made sure I had a black background right when I printed my image um I made sure that it bled like I left for bleed area over it so that it came you know so there's no white border I'm trying to lemonade that white border for this client and I'm gonna show y'all what it looked like so boom this is already cut down to the size that I needed to be so this is cutting out so like a 10 by 12 something like that alright this is like it's a piece of cloth right no but there's a there's a rush there's a rough side and there's a smooth side so the rough side goes down right I'm gonna show y'all that but anyway this is all it is so we know they're talking girls show minute by so that's what I'm gonna do for y'all give me one second swish this camera I'm gonna show you what I'm doing alright so I'm gonna keep it real with y'all I wanted to shoot this video because I wanted to get this done so I came home and I was like try this cotton so about yo and I was like for the first time I got it we got to do this together this is what we do so some steps I have already done like I said I cut down the arm the cotton sub I cut that down cutting down my image with my paper I highly recommend a paper cutter like this straight edges every time one about it being today yeah anyway so I did that right I'm not gonna admit when I cut it you know I mean you want it to like fray a little bit on the ends but not too bad but if you just get some scissors and just snip it right those little threads that's holding on you'll be fine you know I mean that was at least my experience um so yeah I'm just left with this right she won't do instruction by instruction it says pre-press the garment I ain't you got the heat for us huh no okay so let me get the heat pressed first things first pre-press the garment well what's the temp first let's give the temperature 375 to 385 so I'm a term out of 385 get the temp I see with the press hitting that and I'll be right back we'll be right back you know after these sponsors so I said that the t-shirt giveaway was gonna be like in the middle I mean at the end of the video I didn't totally but anyway is right here the first person the first comment that can tell me my favorite NFL football team I've told them a past video there's clues in my workspace but the first person that can comment that will win the t-shirt giveaway back to your regular scheduled program needy all right so here we go y'all prepress garment which already did for five to eight seconds all right place cotton sell it with the world side down on top of the garment alright alright so you can you can't tell them on camera but you can feel it this is my smooth side this is my rough side actually the russia if you look under the light got a little shimmer to it that's a little clue right there you know me so shiny side down so this is a v-neck so i like don't like an inch from the bottom of the V right straight what I like about is that is laying down it ain't curling up on me you know I'm saying I can't work with it was down there makes you a straight little yeah so I mean there's actually looks pretty good to me yeah replacement that it is okay so yeah it laid down really good like I said rough side down or good or he sat down shiny side down you know so we gonna move to the next step we follow directions around here Edie he says mirror printer design onto sublimation tape if using a colored shirt make sure your design completely covers the cotton sub or goes a little outside the material material so no white is visible at the application if using a white shirt make sure that your design stays inside of the material to eliminate ghost Edie so I hear you play and I watched all these videos so I checked them out so basically if it's a white shirt you stay within if it's a black you got to make sure you overdo it like you know you gotta have a bleed on it so white no bleed no need no white no bleed no need black bleed so yeah Misha my word so like my bleed area could have been a look bigger so the cotton survived countless tents so I think I did I try to did like ten and a half bleed which I should've did more than that just my whiskey all right yeah my bad I had to go get a piece that I cut off because some of the black got cut off so I just taped it back up there no biggie hopefully it'd be all right but I laid my sublimation paper on top of my cotton sub so they bought the see how we do get some butcher paper so Jimmy I don't want anything too so it says press the 2375 and three 80-85 degrees with sixty seconds you need any temperature pill is fine if you use a if you're using adhesive sublimation paper delay a pill is the best boom all right so we had three eighty five we're gonna do it for sixty seconds Oh see I put your paper forward it does yeah I know me I won't be here to hold that's good oh yeah that's in there okay yeah oh let me show y'all to my Arriola I'll be right Bob all right so y'all here's my final verdict you know see how it turned out boom see that and when I tell y'all look at this it feel like nothing is on this shirt nothing

to leave um a recording of how i created the monogram with an app i have and how i sent it to my business email so um now that i received it i'm going to download the monogram and then oops and then it's there then i'm going to pull up my crew cut design space or your whatever cutting um device you have i'm going to go to upload upload image browse i'm going to go to my downloads then open simple and then continue and we're going to delete all of this white space behind our image and then we're going to go to continue save as a cut image and then i'm just going to go ahead and label this as the monogram this is my daughter's monogram i'm gonna just save it and then it's there insert image um this is going on a size 3t so i'm gonna make it 6.5 inches across i'm going to go to make it so since we're doing a bleached stencil i'm not going to mirror my image at all i'm just going to leave it like it is and i'm just using regular permanent vinyl for this and then i'm going to go to continue i have my materials set to vinyl and then i'm going to press go on my pre-cut once my pre-cut machine um cuts my vinyl i'm just going to weave my vinyl now very carefully so it doesn't stick to my [Music] image and this is just really simple all right so i have my shirt down here's my monogram what i'm gonna do is just take a piece of transfer tape and put it on my image and i try to use the grid um to get a center line but if you don't it's not you don't have to take my squeegee [Music] [Music] and now i'm just going to lightly and very carefully pull away my transfer tape and i try to hold down the vinyl as i pull just be very gentle [Music] so from here i'm just going to press down my vinyl make sure nothing's sticking up and then we're going to take her outside to bleach all right so i'm outside and i have a piece of cardboard in between my shirt and i'm just going to bleach around my image with 100 bleach until i get the desired effect all right so now i'm just going to take a paper napkin and just dab the vinyl and all the excess bleach that is sitting on it and that's just going to dab it and then i'm going to let it dry and then i'll turn it to the back all right now that it's gotten to a good drying point and it's not going to spread anymore i'm going to take my stencil off and then i'm going to put my shirt into the washing machine you", "wZnvVSwvDDY": "[Music] we're going to be sublimating a cotton shirt after we've sprayed it with a specific polycrylic water mixture although this method does technically work i wouldn't personally sell any shirts subbed using this process there are other less risky alternatives for you to have a sublimated design on cotton links below we'll be following the very basic directions in this comment floating around facebook i'd like to note that i'm using the clear gloss version no clue if the finish type matters for what we're doing but i'm simply following the info in the facebook comment i begin by mixing eight ounces of water with two ounces of the polycrylic in a spray bottle and shaking well next i sprayed the mixture on each of the three cotton shirts until they were soaking wet in the design area i let the shirts fully dry overnight sprayed them again the next day and let them dry a second full night i did an initial press for 15 seconds in the heat press to remove any remaining moisture and to smooth the wrinkles next i took the designs and pressed them onto each shirt as you can see the colors are very vibrant and vivid but let's see how they hold up after five washes again although this method does technically work i wouldn't personally sell any shirts subbed using this process thanks for watching and let me know in the comments what other videos you guys want to see here on the venomous design channel", "kPUMT4N8IEo": "what's up guys my name is Dan McCready I'm here at Twin Cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about the different kinds of cotton when choosing the right t-shirt you can only love you if you've looked at cotton t-shirts you'll probably see that there are a lot of different options you've got standard cotton ring spun combed ring spun heirloom organic lemon shrimp coconut shrimp what do these all mean what are the differences between these types of shirts first of all all cotton no matter if it's ring spun combed organic it all has to go through a process of spinning where the cotton is drawn out into long strands and turned into a yarn the yarns later sewn into fabric which makes your t-shirt so your basic standard cotton t-shirt such as your gilding g500 it's spun into a yarn but a lot of the short strands of cotton and left in there and you get a rougher feel less durability because of that it's the least expensive oh it's a shirt and I saved a buck next you've got your ring spun cotton all that means is there's an additional process of spinning the yarn and in that a lot of those short strands will be taken out this gives you a softer more durable type of cotton not too shabby the next one is your combed ring spun cotton and that's just an additional process of coming out short and mid-sized strands of cotton leaving you with a really long strong durable piece of yarn and then this would be like your next level 3600 your American Apparel these give you a much softer much more durable t-shirt this shirt is really soft and nice I love it if you've looked at Bella canvas shirt so you've noticed they have something called heirloom cotton all this really is is a cone ring spun cotton they've coined their own term heirloom cotton it's their process of towing and spinning the cotton and it's a marketing term they claim it's the best in the industry if it is or not that's up to you to decide but that's all that is is a cone ring spun cotton heirloom cotton huh highlight misty and then lastly we've got organic cotton which has nothing to do if it's ring spun or told and everything to do with the way it was grown and harvested in an eco-friendly way so to recap you start with your standard cotton also known as carded open in cotton that's your cheapest least durable roughest feeling cotton and then you go up to ring-spun which is softer more durable a little more expensive and then you go into your combed ring-spun cotton t-shirt those are much more expensive but they're much softer very durable very nice t-shirts are made out of this and then finally you can go into your organic Cotton's which make the price go up even father if you're looking to have t-shirts made head over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up thank you guys for watching this episode I hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll see you on the next video if you have any questions leave us a comment you", "CDQJcmIwCmI": "hey guys Melissa Harris shirt space here today I solve the age-old question what is better cotton or polyester so sit back and let's get to it [Music] in short the best answer I can give you is it's what you're using it for so now let's dive into a pro and con list kind of like you did with your ex before you broke up with them cotton first cotton is strong and it's soft and has been used since the dawn of time you think that would make it the best but in fact that's not good but let's dive into some more pros cotton is breathable so if Comfort is your number one choice you've found your best match another thing cotton is cheaper but that's only for now cotton is renewable and biodegradable but here's your first con cotton is a very water intensive crop with that said they also rely heavily on pesticides this would move this into the con list for sure however organic cotton has really started to make a play within the industry in the last few years okay let's next touch on polyester polyester is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber aka it's plastic you think this would be a con however in the last couple of years manufacturers have actually started to use recycled bottles to make polyester tees more pros for polyester include that it's durable meaning it will withstand all of that wear and tear polyester also dries quickly wrinkles less and is stain resistant all major pros now for the ultimate plot twist manufacturers have actually started to combine the two making it the goat of blinkx poly cotton blends don't shrink they hold both their shape and their color for extended periods of time they are affordable and they have the softness you want in your favorite team okay we've made it this far and you think you know what T is gonna work best for you but I'm about to throw you the ultimate curve ball now you have to put decoration on your apparel so let's get into it first we're going to talk about water-based inks water-based inks you have to use 100% cotton this also applies to discharged inks as well next let's touch base on plastisol inks with plastisol inks you can use bulk cotton and polyester however with poly and poly blends you'll want to make sure you touch base with the manufacturer to make sure you're good to go in the ink Department when it comes to embroidery you can use both cotton and polyester however just make sure you have the right thread count to make sure your needle will pass through the thread with ease finally heat transfers for vinyl you can use both cotton and polyester however make sure you have the recommended heat settings from the vinyl manufacturer for sublimation we recommend using a hundred percent polyester after all of that I guess we're gonna have to let the debate continue because as you can see it really depends on what you're using the product for but we want to hear what works best for you guys and what is your tried-and-true so give us some comments below to let us know what works best for you thank you guys so much for stopping by to engage in the debate of what is better cotton or polyester if you're looking for more debates like this click that subscribe button turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day oh hey there thought you'd get rid of me but here I am talking again don't worry you'll only have about five more seconds to pick another video before time runs out look at that one in the top I think that one looks very interesting", "naUBCP5_O9A": "look at this side-by-side photo of these\ntwo tees which is better this one is $2.50 and this one is about $3 so which\none do you buy if you knew the cheaper one would shrink after one wash would\nthat affect your decision we're about to unravel the truth behind what makes a\nt-shirt last for the long haul in this episode of our series ask first them but\nbefore we get into it hit that subscribe button unfortunately shrinkage is common with\nfabrics containing cotton unless manufacturers like bellick canvas take\npreventive measures against it the reason natural fibers like cotton shrink\nis because the fibers want to return to their natural state during the fabric\nmaking process when fibers are spun into thread there's a lot of tension put on\nthe fibers and they stretch out beyond their natural length then when fibers\nare warmed by warm water or a hot dryer during the drying process they try to\nreturn to their original state and in turn cause your clothes to shrink the\nreason that more expensive preshrunk cotton does not shrink in the dryer is\nbecause of a process that takes place during the fabric finishing process\nwhich basically gets the fabric to return to its natural state before the\ngarment is sewn with us you want maximum shrinkage of 5 percent while the cheaper\nbrands out there can shrink up to 10 that's basically a hole size we've\ninvested in top-of-the-line equipment that sets the industry benchmark for\nminimal shrinkage first we over stretch the fabric width wise to compensate for\nall the length tension it had in the previous processes next it goes through\nshrink drying chambers in which air blowers tumble the fabric and heat\ntriggers the cotton to revert to its natural state as it shrinks and dries\nthe fabric kind of like a super fancy industrial version of your dryer at home\nthese shrink dryers are a million dollars so it's no wonder mini\nmanufactures skip this step or do their own subpar version of it next the fabric\ngoes through compactor which compresses the length of the fabric using steam\nmaking it physically shorter since the length is where most of the shrinkage\ntends to occur this ensures that when a tee comes to you the fabric has been\nshrunk both lengthwise and widthwise we guarantee a shrinkage rate of five by\nfive meaning the absolute most it will shrink is five percent in both the\nlength and the wet it's always good to leave a little room for shrinkage so you\ndon't have the opposite problem which would be the tee stretching out have you\never had a side seam tee where after a wash that side seam isn't quite on the\nside anymore this happens but non croissant fabric returns to its original\nstate pulling the seam along with it through a\nshrink drying process by stretching and shrinking the fabric\nprior to sewing we eliminate any torque or twisting of the fabric after it's\nbeen washed at home I'm sure if you have a belly canvas tee at home\nyou notice how little it shrinks compared to other brands in your drawer\nthat's because we are the only manufacturer that is invested in\ntop-of-the-line preshrunk dryers like we've just shown you with us we want\nwhat you see to be what you get with no surprises when you take our teas home a\ntea like ours that looks just as awesome after multiple washes as it does right\nout of the box

a different feel than the Bella canvas shirts that I was wearing earlier but still like nice and soft really durable it feels like a strong shirt that you can kind of wear outside and do some chores with so yeah it's it's a good feel it's uh it's a little restricting on the neck a little bit tighter than I usually wear my shirts but other than that the shoulders are nice and loose nice slim fit down the body the length again just like the the Bella canvas it's a great length shirt it's not going to turn into a crop top and you throw your hands up so you can see myself wearing a shirt basically anytime I'm going outside kind of seems like that like a heavy more durable shirt that I can do some chores nice and baseball I'd say my favorite thing about this shirt is probably just the the durability of it it feels like strong fabric so when I'm out playing pickup football at the beach or something like that it's not one of those shirts that I really have to worry about it's it's inexpensive and it's durable so it's just yeah just gonna be a great outdoor shirt the Gildan 5000 hundred percent cotton tee get it today", "hByEF6AaYAY": "\u200bToday we're talking about the Alternative\nApparel 100% ring spun cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt by Alternative Apparel is one\nof our best selling ring spun cottons for a few reasons. One because it's Alternative Apparel offers a really soft fabric. It's a thinner fabric texture also, compared to\nother 100% ring spun cottons. A really fine thread count, the threads are very tight.\nWith that thinner thread also means it's just going to flow better.\n\u200bComes in some great colors. Great fit. It's right now between kind of the Next Level,\nCanvas 100% ring spun cotton pricing and the American Apparel, it's a good middle ground.\nOffers the same great fit, awesome fabric. Instead of telling you all just about it we've\ngot Tyler coming over, going to show it in action.\n\u200bFirst thing you're going to notice a great fit. Has the side seam here, which now a days\nis standard on any shirt that's going to be a nicer brand. Offers that side seam so it's\ngoing to be tailored right to your body. \u200bThe collar here is a great collar. Little\nthinner than other brands. The seam is on the inside also so it's a very flush outer.\nPrint location across the front is awesome. We have right here the sleeve length, great,\nright mid bicep. Not baggy like a lot of the other shirts that we're talking about on these\nvideos. Any time we're going with a nicer fabric and a better fit the sleeve should\nnaturally complement that. We don't want the sleeve to be baggy and the sides tailored.\nIt would be totally uneven. This shirt has great proportions.\n\u200bIn terms of the length we've noticed that this shirt seems a little shorter than the\nAmerican Apparel or even the Next Level comparison. It does seem a little shorter. Not bad, it's\njust something to note. Check out the size charts on our site and again this shirt is\njust great all around shirt. Kind of that middle price point in the 100% ring spun cotton.\n\u200bNow, we've talked a lot about 100% ring spun cotton and kind of the softness, the\nfit. You might be wondering what about shrinkage anything that way. Now, it is 100% ring spun\ncotton so over the course of it's life it could start peeling. It also could start kind\nof distorting in terms of how you dry it. If it's on high heat. We're not talking about\nfirst wash, second wash, the first washes. We're talking about a year down the line.\nIf you nuke the shirt. Longevity wise, anytime you want a shirt for the long hall a blend.\nA 50/50 blend, a 60/40 is going to be better than this for the long hall of the life of\nthe shirt, but this is a great shirt. You're going to love it and overall this is one of\nour best sellers because Alternative Apparel is a hot brand right now.\n\u200bTyler you look awesome in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate\nthis t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video.

crystal welcome back to my channel today we're going to be doing a chromoblast t-shirt so i've talked about it for a while i finally got it so some of you guys know that sawgrass has a printer you have sublimation and then you also have chromoblast so i'm finally going to be able to bring you guys some chromoblast stuff and teach you how to use it and what is it today we're going to be making this t-shirt right here and to get that design it's right over here on designbundles.net i'll have this linked below this will be a great item to sell on your website etsy local swap sites right now this is a very popular design and that's why i chose that today all right so let's go ahead and talk about chromoblast and what is it so let's head on over here to heat press nation let me go ahead and tell you guys if it's between november 22nd 2020 through november 30th 2020 right now there is a huge sale going on as you guys know sawgrass hardly ever has any sales um i don't think that i've ever seen a cell so right now the inks are on sale so if you guys already have the printer maybe you guys need to replenish or um you guys want to order some extra inks or anything like that so the sublijet inks are on sale for 65. the caesar ones are 74 but the chromoblast ones that i'm talking about today are 48 the chromoblast inks are way cheaper than the sublimation now what is chromoblast compared to sublimation right you can still get it in the sg500 and the sg-1000 so whichever printer so it's the exact same printer it's just different inks so please note you cannot switch from one ink to the next you have to purchase a separate printer for that so if you're going to have sublimation you'll want a separate printer for your chromoblast chromoblast is for your 100 cotton so this is not going to work for your substrates or anything like that this is going to be only a hundred percent cotton so maybe you want to add something on some you know cotton shoes cotton shirts sweatpants anything like that it needs to be a hundred percent cotton and you can go from light colored fabrics up to some pretty bright ones so we'll get into that um there's tons of videos to come so please uh stay tuned for that you could definitely check out the uh playlist down below if this is a year from now i'll have a ton more videos covering this stuff chromoblast versus sublimation sublimation is it has to have polyester where this one has cotton so the sublimation goes into the shirt it becomes one with it where you can't feel it now this one the chromoblast also goes into the t-shirt but you can feel it so it doesn't set on top like dtg or screen printing but it does have that same feel but it actually goes down into the fibers it if you guys come over here which i'll have these linked down below you guys can kind of come down here and it'll talk a little bit about it it's got vibrant colors um it talks about how it will never fade so the thing about it compared to dtg and screen printing it will never crack or fade it works the same since the sublimation except for you can have feel to it compared to sublimation if that makes sense so if you guys have been wanting to um you know to work with 100 cotton highly recommend you check this out if you guys have been wanting a dtg printer but you can't afford it i highly recommend that you guys check this out so just as as the other one the sg500 is 5.99 the sg-1000 is 1549 and these are going to come with the inks so the thing with this chromoblast just like sublimation has a special paper this is a separate paper you're going to want to use the chromoblast paper so the paper with the ink together is going to make this magic happen all right so let's go ahead and jump right into this video so for today once again i've got my design already brought in here and this is what i like to do everybody asks me all the time how do i size this how do i get it where i want it so say for example today we're using the sg500 i know that i want a full sheet so this is the smaller one you really want to use they recommend over here you really want to use the sg-1000 for t-shirts and stuff so i know for me with the sg 500 i need the full sheet the full eight and a half by eleven so what i like to do is come to blank products and then i just type in 8.5 and i'll go to the 8.5 by 11 and there it is so i can just kind of mess around with it here and get this like a full sheet and if you pay attention over here on the side i have it on inches you can do millimeters or inches you can kind of see that there so i just bring it down a little bit less than the 11 so it'll fit on the page and then center it up you can always use your grid there so you can get it right in the center so you know when you put it down on the shirt it's going to be centered and then when you go to print you want to make sure that it's going to be mirrored and you don't need the bleed lines i'm going to make sure it's mirror when you have the chromoblast printer you don't have all the options like before it's easy peasy it's cotton chromoblast paper you don't have any options color mode you can still choose you've got photographic graphic grayscale or classic i leave it on photographic and then you've got high quality high speed same thing like that at this point it's ready to go i would hit print and send it over to the spm so that's it so let's go ahead and head on over and make a shirt all right so now i've got the heat press ready today i'm using my tea padded so i've got a bigger tea patty here only because this is a small shirt i need to get those seams out of my way because i've got a 15 by 15 press so that's what's going on there and then because i have that pad i couldn't get this to shut i could if i really played around with it but i just thought i'd hold the pressure myself probably a wrong wrong example for you guys but this is only if you have the t padded most you guys probably wouldn't even be doing this but uh here's our design so i've got that printed out now keep in mind with chromoblast you want to work fast so we're sublimation we can print that we can mess with it in a week you know a month from now this you got to do right now there's a whole time on that i'll get the exact timing on that for you guys soon and then i'm going to cover it with a cover sheet so i've got it down i've got my cover sheet and i'm going to push this down i've got it 375 for 30 seconds the cool thing about this it's less heat and less time so i'm giving it like a medium pressure i'm doing it myself because i've got the tea pad it like i said and then quickly i'm going to work fast now the way that you're going to do this is pull your shirt so pull pull pull and it's going to number one help those the ink settle down into the t-shirt and help bring this off because if you guys don't pull this fast enough you guys are going to have almost like a um i'm not explaining you guys will notice on the glasses right here on the right side that little bit almost like it's where it's going to try to peel it off a little bit so work quick just pull and you know pull from the sides pull from the top that's it so i hope you guys enjoyed this i hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one",

ready to print so forth the sublimation transfers of sublimation final as I should call it the sublimation file this one you need to pre-heat your press to three-fifty and my purse my camp is a little high I met 369 one state between and I know that sounds long but it's not so we're going to do 350 for 60 seconds when you print your final sublimation transfers your promo vinyl it's going to look like this okay so it's gonna give a dull look but once you press it this is what it's going to look like now this one is faster so once you press it gonna line up and these are the colors that you're done please so you see it's a big big difference okay and here's one that we actually be it on a t-shirt so we're going to go ahead and we're going to get started with this particular type of printable vinyl you do it comes with a clear backing and you see those sublimation inks they go all the way to the back so you do have to take this apart and remove it now because this is a pretty easy design it's all in one piece I can just remove it with my hands if maybe I was doing another video where I'm doing some tag sorts of things that are separated and I'll show you how to print how to pull those up early in the morning my mouth is very dry so that's just how you do it and you're gonna lay it face down and you always want to have some type of paper and you can use just regular regular old coffee paper this is my subs I'm sorry my screen credit transfer but I'm going to use this today while I'm waiting on my feet French to PETA is I just take my t-shirt and I fooled my t-shirt in half like this and I lay it on the fridge and I'm gonna move this camera over here some so I lay it on the crest I can lay multiple [Music] we are pressing under the stairs so all I'm doing is I'm giving a 17 and I can do five or six of these at one time if I need to [Music] so this give me a knife I already know whatever Spencer thirty and I know exactly what I'm told so that's fine everybody so I'm just going to take my transfer and because I've gotten to a point here I'm gonna [Music] without one and can't touch them done so you can't really go from scene from well I'll just pull that turnout sorry folks I'm gonna pop that down now because I'm doing sublimation vinyl transfers i'm not going to pre-press and I just had quit Princeton anyway so close this down and count off about 30 seconds go right to that [Music] and I'm going to lift my transfer straight up I don't want to leave it there and move it around okay because they'll get the wrong thing on it so I've got one down [Music] [Music] and normally don't use a ruler but [Music] now sublimation transfer they start to roll I'm gonna put something over that collar right there because it looks like a scientist I don't want that so just gonna do another one [Music] now let's remember that I am paying myself for the time that I print so always remember to calculate in your crisis the time that it takes you to print those garments [Music] good thing I didn't put that there [Music] [Music] the colors of nice and vibrant I'm continued with these [Music] [Music] but I'm always using just a regular heat transfer paper uses a regular not heat transfer for regular copy paper you'll save a lot my heat breath was not flattering [Music] probably [Music] [Music] I noticed that I've got just a little bit of that white outline showing someone go back over this with my favorite friend and that's the ability continue to go on - sure you [Music] it's a good idea to invest in a lint roller and lint roll that area I don't have a lot of [Music] so I'm just going to continue to do this and show you guys the picture to kind of give you guys an idea as you get to get to going on this fresh thing you know once I pretty much know where the print goes and I don't really use the metric package well one thing you have to realize is you see how that curling up is that when you're pressing you gotta watch out for that that makes sure that you don't get curls now I'm going to reuse this paper but the reason that I'm reusing if I am doing a black shirt I've gotta make sure that it doesn't you are my sublimation I've got to make sure that my paper does so that's one of the things that you need to watch out for when you're pressing shirt another thing is if you start to get press lines on your on your charts these are polyester shirts if you start to get press lines then you want to rip your paper that's on top of it so like for example here I don't know if you can see but there is a little press line pretty much come out [Music] a really high temperature but if you were hundreds of we'll do those press live let me get a fresh taste of fresh so they're going to do is just rip the edges of it and should they ever do that in the smooth the edges I exam you will avoid those principles so this is the last shirt I'm going to a manual inspection of each and every last one of these shirts now and since idea to this cut by hand I'm going to go in with a fabric marker and make sure that I don't have any white spots it's all about so just when it's hot put this on my pray grab a marker I just gotta [Music] [Music] fabric [Music] that [Music] like [Music] so [Music] here we have it in Canton and scale [Music] and I'm doing this very I'm just looking for I want my [Music] it's about right about 9 o'clock and I'm here all alone this morning my Bulldog to the bit [Music] my birthday lunch is my birthday month close it up stop one thing that I love about the business [Music] right time to start holiday things like that stuff like that [Music] working [Music] walk back looking at my sale [Music] updating website all of that type of stuff so in your downtime the last one we saw [Music] you know what for long term now for and [Music] 1987 was when I graduated oh I love this song [Music] my all of that stuff is so really what we're gonna do is we're about to start doing the home invasion start [Music] I'm gonna go back over and do a final pricks but again [Music] one day Oh only done one press and I didn't do this one free because I want to show people that it be explored out of the white shirt and I didn't press the back so guys that [Music] that one here that's almost [Music] now to really take your time even with with your conscience [Music] my shirt yeah Oh [Music] [Music] and the follow this order get it ready box up for the customer and get on to the next thing that I have to do state custom the appeared to be the day I make sure you got let you guys see me set up a child on the automatic", "qUCF7jpPli0": "all right guys um i'm excited today i'm in my lab i've had these sheets now since january or february i had forgotten why i had ordered them with the madness of coronavirus but then i decided to start looking through and seeing where my cost went and i remembered i had these guys what i have in my hand right now okay these are called reveal s sheets okay reveal s sheets these are sheets used with sublimation ink to sublimate on light garments like sublimation but on cotton guys let me repeat that these are a no weed one step process from printer to press with sublimation ink on to cotton light colored of course and so today we're gonna put this to the test i'm gonna sublimate on a hundred percent cotton no weeding so let's see how this goes guys we'll be right back i got the press getting heat up um i'm just going to print my standard uh logo i'm not sure what i'm going to print on here i don't want to waste a lot so when i try to bring you guys these videos you know i use a small scale because i'm always testing different things and obviously to keep it affordable for me because i'm not giving these things for free except for once all right how these work you're going to print on the dull side so it has a shiny side and like a off-white opaque looking doll side you're going to print on that side and mirror your image like you would sublimation all right so what i'm going to do is um i've created my image i'm doing an 11 by or eight and a half by 11 image on a white cotton t-shirt i'm going to print and send to my sublimation printer i don't i don't know if you guys can see that but i'm sending it one second sending it to my sublimation printer okay but before i hit print i do have to come put the sheet in again i'm printing on the dole white-ish looking side so i'm going to place it with the shiny side up in my case because my printers go you know draws it in so i'm putting the shiny side up as you see sublimation paper is face down so i'm putting the print sheet i need in here all right and i'm going to print you okay it's coming here it is so i don't know kind of looks like uh over uh like uh you know those little projector things in school that's what it looks like all right i'm gonna grab my cotton shirt and i'll be right back all right guys every single rule with sublimation applies so you guys can see i am using i don't know if y'all can see that there 100 cotton okay heavy cotton or ultra colon i have pre-pressed my garment already the press is at 380 385 to 400 i'm just going to try it at 380. the instructions say 400. now with sublimation is usually 60 seconds with this is 18 seconds guys 18 seconds 385 to 400 degrees i'm gonna place it on here you guys can see i'm not worried about where it's all right i'm going to put parchment paper i'm not sure if it's going to bleed through the back or not um so we're just putting parchment and hoping for the best okay again 380 not 60 seconds 18 seconds heavy pressure we'll be right back guys all right i left it for 20 seconds and you can peel it while it's hot wait a minute there's some error maybe not too too hot okay we're gonna just press it one quick time here and wait a little bit to cool it's hot peel but i'm gonna wait all right i'm gonna wait a little bit before i peel it though it's hot peel so i'm not sure bring it over here all right let's peel all right guys i messed it up by letting it cool down i should have hot peeled it not sure what's up with this little guy up here definitely not the right way i'm gonna research a little more and be right back it went good all right guys the first time was an error my press was set to um 375 so we're gonna see if it really if it really matters the time or these sheets suck we'll see but every video i watched it came out smooth i think 10 degrees matters probably guys here goes 15. meant to put it to 18 seconds i didn't put no cover sheets so wish me luck and it says to pull off hot one continuous pool negative oh my god guys okay it freaking worked i just sublimated can you guys see that on a hundred percent cotton guys okay so the problem with this image was i was doing 18 seconds it's 25 seconds as well as very light color does not appear so it has to be dark vibrant colors guys i am stoked holy heck so i pretty much take the printer sheet these clear sheets they're called reveal s put it with the shiny side up on your printer or you have to print on the dull side like the white side mirrored of course then you put it on your shirt this way down press it for 25 seconds 385 380 sorry for 25 seconds and peel hot in one fast you know one continuous motion i didn't weed it anywhere that the ink wasn't there's no texture i need to wash this and then i'll be right back all right a few things i want to add blend roll if you don't let rule obviously just like regular sublimation it's not gonna happen as well as you must pull with the fabric instead of against it i pulled against it but i am in awe this was done with a converted workforce 7720 with sublimation ink", "lAM90VD1y8g": "What's up garment decorators! We're here\nto talk to you today about some dye sublimation. Did you know you can dye\nsublimate on more than just 100% white polyester t-shirts? I'm AJ, this is Kirk, we're going to show you today on how to do different blends of t-shirts and a\nwide range of colors. First we pressed 100% polyester t-shirts.\nYou can see we did white, a columbia blue, and a dark grey. All the same exact print, and as you can see with 100% polyester, after you wash, the colors stays the same. You're never going to have any fading when you use 100% polyester, but you are going to have the different contrast of the color coming through the inks. As you can see here on this white, the colors were super vibrant. You know, white is the best for colors. But, also, there's some cool effects on the columbia blue. Really like the colors. I like it. The look is what, you know it makes it totally different. As you can see, the\ncolor, even between the yellows on the grey - totally different. So what we did, we went and found some tri-blends, because I like more of a softer shirt. I'm kind of the guy, that kind of t-shirt snob, so I liked that type of stuff. So we went and found some tri-blends and these are like 75% polyester they got\n12% of the rayon and also 13% of your cotton. And so you look at, is like when I\npress this, I mean like what do you think? (It's cool) It looks good. But when you washed it, we're going to have a little bit of fading to it. But, I think it still overall looks great. So obviously you can do the traditional white, but then you also, your wash look, you're going have a little bit of fading. I'm a big fan of the sublimation on color. It kind of gives you that a little bit more to offer your\ncustomers. What do we have on? My favorite - 50% polyester, 25% cotton and 25% rayon. It's another style at tri-blend, but it's\nreally nice as well. It has a really fresh look when you press it. So don't get used to that, because as soon as you wash it you're going to get that better cool of a washed out look that a lot of people are going for these days. I like it. I mean I like the feel, and I think kinda of has\nthat faded look. Already looks like the garment's broken in. When you're pressing AJ, \nyou prefer to use like, when you tack stuff down - you know I'm a guy likes to use the spray. What about you and what else do you use? I like using the thermo\ntape. We have green and clear. Typically green is used more often just\nso you can see it on any color garment. But that's what I like. I like the tape\nit's tried and true. The spray is your favorite. I like using this spray a\nlittle bit. So you just kind of tack along on top of the paper. And it holds it in place. Don't have to use the tape. Just a light mist on the paper and it tacks it right in place so you don't have anything jumping off our ghosting. So more versatile for\nme because I'm doing kind of back and forth But whichever you use, obviously you still get the same results as you can see. So now AJ, let's just talk a little bit about\npricing and make sure that everyone understands like now we're using a lot\nnicer garments - they're tri-blends. So you have a little bit higher end shirt. So\nobviously you factor in obviously your time and your inks and your paper. But now you have the garment that's a little bit higher price. So don't forget now you're\nhaving an very nice garment, so you can charge more and get more for it. So obviously make sure you're getting what you're worth on these garments and\neverything else you're doing, because this is nice stuff and it's neat. So you can get all these different styles of garments that you saw here today by\ngoing to HeatTransferClothing.com And anything in the dye sublimation world\nthat we talked about with the spray or the mist paper or ink by going to HeatTransferWarehouse.com Thank you decorators for watching our video today.

Now, over the past few years this has\nbecome one of the most popular and most demanded T-shirts we've seen, for a few reasons. One is the price point, two is the color options, and three is just the fit and fabric. It feels great, fits great and again, that price point is amazing. So, so many bands look at this shirt as their standard at merch tables. Instead of just telling you\nabout it though, we do have our model coming over and we're gonna show it off.\nNow, first thing you're gonna notice is it is a great fit but there's no side seam here, which that's, that kind of\nbegs the question, what does that mean? Well, without a side seam we can\nactually do more of a wrap logo, which is very popular. If we had a side seam\ngoing down the side, it could be an uneven print right there, which makes the ink\nkind of bunch up and not be as good. So this is perfect if you want to have a wrap logo. The next thing we're gonna talk about though is just this neckline. It's bound on the\ninside, super clean neckline here. 100 percent cotton has a good stretch to it without being too\nstretchy. The sleeve length is pretty generous here. It's a little longer than, maybe the comparable Next Level or American Apparel, but still hits at a great point here, not baggy at all. It comes in great colors, and like I said before a great price point for this shirt. 100 percent ring-spun cotton, now you might be wondering, does that mean it's gonna shrink? How should I wash it? What size should I order? It fits very true to size, on top of that, it is a hundred percent ring-spun, so you're not gonna have to really worry about shrinking it. A year or two years down the line if this becomes\nyour favorite t-shirt, I'd just say, don't nuke it in the laundry. You know, kinda keep it to that mid to low heat, because cotton, over the course of its life, could shrink. Cotton also can pill, so, if you're looking for\nlongevity of a shirt, I'd recommend maybe looking at the District Threads 60/40 blend or\nmaybe a Canvas, Next Level, American, one of their 50/50's if it has to wear and re-wear every week for volunteers or maybe, if you're ordering for employees that have to wear it. But this is a great price point, 100% ring-spun cotton, same line of thought as the Next Level or Canvas in terms of pricing. Cheaper than American Apparel though and the Alternative Apparel. So, if you're looking for a great price point go with this, which is why we get it demanded so much. Thanks so much, you look awesome in it! On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two.

Now, the Bella ladies 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt is a\ngreat option, great price point, great fit, overall an awesome shirt. I'm going to have\nMaia come over and show it off instead of just talking about it. Right away you're going\nto notice a great fit, tailored side seam means it's naturally going to hug your sides.\nIt's going to offer that more feminine feel to it, 100% ring-spun cotton. It's soft.\n\u200bNow, if we're talking about sizing on this, we do kind of ... Anytime we're talking about\n100% ring-spun, err on the side of ordering one size larger because 100% ring-spun doesn't\nstretch as much as more of a blend does. You'll notice the sleeve length fell a little higher\nthan the unisex version, not baggy at all, naturally complements her body. The other\nthing is the neckline here, a little breathe-ability here. It's not tight up to the neck like some\nt-shirts are. This offers a little breathe-ability here.\n\u200bAll around though, great shirt, a lot of color options and since it's Bella, Bella\nowns Canvas, a unisex t-shirt company so a lot of the colors are interchangeable between\nunisex and ladies. This is great for a ladies group. You can also order the Canvas t-shirt\nfor the larger group of males or just women who maybe want more of a boxy fit, but for\na women's t-shirt, great standard. If we're talking about this versus the American Apparel\nand the Next Level 100% ring-spun cotton, I kind of put this right in the middle. The\nprice point is closer to the Next Level. You save a lot going Bella over American Apparel's\n100%. I believe that you get more out of this shirt too than the American Apparel, which\nis why we probably sell so many of them, although the American Apparel has the name everybody\nreally trusts. Bella is also a name, but anytime you're ordering 100% ring-spun, again, think\nabout ordering one size up in the ladies version because you don't want it to be too small.\n\u200bYou look great in it Maia. Thank you so much. \u200bOn the Co-ed Monkey Soft Scale, we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this\nvideo.

try out this trend that i keep seeing on tiktok where they are taking poly acrylic and mixing it with water and spraying on their 100 cotton and poly cotton blend t-shirt and making sublimation stick to it um i really do want to try this i'm a little bit skeptical because i have bought like dye sub sprays before and they didn't work uh again it might not have been the product it could have been me and user error i don't even have it anymore to even try it again but i thought we could try this and see what happens so i have a couple different shirts here i have just a 100 um heavy cotton t-shirt then i have a 50 50 color and then i have another 100 cotton shirt but this is a soft style not sure if there's going to be a difference with that but i did want to try and then i have another 50 50 that is already bleached that i'm gonna put an image on and let's see if it makes my image any brighter so what i did was is i put 16 since i'm doing so many shirts and i'm trying on so many i did 16 ounces of water in here and then i added four four tablespoons of the poly acrylic into here and just kind of mixed it up um i already had this um i'm not sure if the semi-gloss or any of that really matters but i already had this so i wasn't gonna go out and buy anything just to try something and then it not work but anyway let's i'm going to go print out my images for these shirts real quick and then we'll be back at the heat press all right so now i'm just going to give my little mix a or my little mixture a little shape just make sure nothing's settled at the bottom make sure and all i'm going to do is just spray this all over the shirt that's on the pad i'm gonna take another piece of parchment paper i'm gonna lay on top and just kind of rub it and i'm gonna press it at 350 for 30 seconds all right so now you're going to go back in with a second coat um but it doesn't have to be as heavy of a coat i put my parchment paper on here again and i'm using this because i don't want to burn my garment and i don't want anything to bleed onto my heat press either i'm gonna do for another 30 seconds so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to pre-press all my shirts like this that i have or i don't know i'm gonna go set this one to the side and do my other two shirts all right so now that we have this one set and ready to go i'm gonna up my heat press to 400 degrees and once that gets there we'll be back all right this is the image that we're going to put on this to center forty another piece of parchment paper and i'm going to heat press it at 400 for um 50 seconds okay so this is the heavy cotton my paper is sticking to my shirt i don't know if it's supposed to be what is and this is the heavy cotton this is what it turned out i'm gonna throw it in the wash and see if it fades all right so now we're going to do the 5050 seconds sorry all right so this is on the 50 50 um i think it did better on this one than it did on the cottons but we're about to see i'm about to put them both in the wash or all three of them on the wash and see how they turn out all right so i'm back with the update on these shirts so i ended up not doing all the colors like i initially thought i didn't want to waste any shirts and i had like a bunch i was gonna do and i'm like let's not do that let's not waste anything if this doesn't work um so i only did the 4t which was the heavy cotton i did the 100 cotton soft style and then i did the 50 50 bleach um i don't have the 50 50 bleach on hand because that was actually an order and i had to get it i had to get it out um but i'll tell you it didn't change um there wasn't much of a difference on it once it was washed it faded out like it normally would with the 5050s um maybe it was a little bit darker but not much i didn't i didn't see that much of a difference in that one um now i did find a difference in the cottons so this is the heavy cotton here this is one wash um i'm gonna move this in so maybe you can see the she is anything that was black is now brown uh darker brown so it did fade a little bit after one wash on that one this one i did two washes and this is the soft style on here it looks a little bit darker but on the blue line you can kind of see where it's faded it's not um it's not that not that dark as it would be on a 100 cotton um does this work yes it does work but the there's no quality in this it's still going to fade over time it works initially um but this is just going to keep fading the more you wash it the more it's going to fade it gives you a little bit longer durability on the cotton if you was just to do a cotton one time it would just fade right out um but i i wouldn't sell these personally i would not sell these to my customers because within a corner how many times they wear the shirt within four washes it's just gonna wash right out or be like super faint so i don't i don't recommend this i don't recommend selling this now if you have like an event that you're doing yourself or something that you have shirts it's just gonna be like a one or two time wear i would probably do it it would save you money instead of doing polyester shirts um but that's it i wouldn't sell these other than that they're just gonna keep washing out um like i said it does work it does work it's not a myth i couldn't find any videos on youtube about it which i thought was like kind of weird um i think i found one but i didn't get any information off of that video so there was the only information i could get from this was through tick tock and those are like literally one minute videos so there wasn't much information there um i seen one girl on tick tock that she said it didn't work for her either and she wouldn't sell them as well so then i seen other people that it some way shape or form worked for them i don't know what i did wrong i went by everything that i seen and all that and it just didn't didn't really work for me um but if you guys have done it please leave a comment down below and let me know what what you did if it worked for you if it didn't work for you how many washes you got out of it so you notice the difference i would really like to know if there's something that i did wrong um but yeah if you guys have any questions or comment again leave them down below i try to answer and respond to everyone that i can and as well as please don't forget to

to uh that was weird wait a minute just like that just like that productions just like that like comment subscribe just like that boom wait a minute just like that hey dub you ready wait a minute yes dub nation welcome welcome back it is so wonderful to see you again thank you for joining me if it's your first time please hit the thumbs up button and subscribe to the channel if you haven't done so already yes that was weird okay guys what's going on it's your boy alan wade thank you so much for joining me today guys um what are we gonna do first oh yeah today um we're gonna wash some clothes yeah that that's right we're washing some clothes today so you guys asked for it so i i'm going to do it for you guys you guys wanted a wash test remember these two shirts this shirt supplemented directly onto cotton a little bit of fade vintage look i like it we want to see if it fades in a wash right and this shirt right here was the one that was sublimated onto 100 cotton using our treatment that we got from amazon you guys suggest i get a roller a lot more vivid but we're going to see if it lasts after we wash it we're going to wash and dry both of these shirts guys all right so yeah and then who can forget this shirt remember this shirt guys this shirt i did with the silhouette cameo four plus or was it still i came for i think it was done with silver cameo four plus but i'm not gonna lie to you i washed this shirt quite a few times already maybe about six and right around the edges the letters are starting to slightly show some type of wear but what i'm going to do is i'm going to wash it again and we're going to dry the shirt and then we're going to press it so we're going to see if we can rejuvenate and get the letters to look like it's brand new again after we washed it a few times and we press it so you guys can see the benefits of using this stuff and how you can like rejuvenate stuff that's been pressed on the shirts i know with vinyl when the vinyl starts coming up the vinyl is still there so if you press it again or even if you use an iron you can it'll look just like brand new again but ink once it gets washed away the ink is gone baby benefits of vinyl so without further ado guys oh one more thing and after that we're gonna go we're gonna do an unboxing we have a package that we got in the mail and um it's some supplies so stick around to the end of the video so you guys can see that guys but for now let's go watch some clothes let's go what up dub nation please hit that like button so more a dub videos will be found in the youtube algorithm please do it now do it do it right now i'm waiting okay [Music] oh hi didn't see you there guys so um guys we're just gonna put these two shirts inside and i'm going to use bleach because it's white clothes i'm going to use bleach and i'm going to use a little bit of detergent treat it like normal a little bit of bleach a little bit of detergent we're only watching two shirts and we're gonna see what happens and then we're gonna put this shirt in here and then we'll see what happens we're gonna do everything two separate loads but you guys don't have to see everything so let's load up a little bit of detergent just a little bit softener of the fabric a little tad bit of the bleach oh that's a bit much hi guys let's see how the colors last i don't know all right done the wash let's see what we have here damn that's pretty messed up there that looks like the one that was treated that's pretty jacked up and this looks like the one that was just straight to cotton and i mean it's still even but it's also faded let's put them in the dryer this has a whole light spot right here this is just totally ruined put my jar aw productions all right guys let's talk about some stuff real fast uh the wash the wash to wash proved a lot of things check a look at the shirts uh the one that has the vintage type of look totally useless yeah no this looks like your old old pajamas that you had for a whole like a lot of years it looks washed out it looks faded it's almost gone look at our poor llama from vexels shouts out to vexels uh for those of you guys that don't know vexels is a website that you can purchase a membership for and they have unlimited designs that well i won't say unlimited hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of designs that you can use to start your clothing apparel they have different type of types of files that you can manipulate and photoshop and things like that and you can even submit your custom design elements and they can customize something for you and i heard it through the grapevine that they might be having a sale coming soon stay tuned for that but um if you're interested check out vexels in the description down below check that out check out the website it's a real valuable resource and this is where i got the llama from okay so look at the llama both of them look like crap to be honest with you guys this one um i could have applied the i could have applied some more of the substance to the shirt right here because you see it's like really really faded right here it's like unevenly faded but it's still darker than this one but the thing is this one is faded at a more even coat it's faded a more even level than this one so long story short just sub on polyester this stuff is no good if anybody had better luck in the comment section down below let me know obviously i would have got better results if i would have used a roller and rolled uh the solution on this shirt evenly i would have gotten better results because as you guys see all right here is like big faded right but all over here even fade because we didn't use any solution at all we just sublimated directly to cotton it's good to know that it works but this is like this would be like a 1u shirt one wear shirt because you see how much the uh wash washed away and you see how much of an impact the wash had on this because all this right here is faded guys so yeah that's it for those shirts now let's look at this shirt that i've had for a while and we put these shirts in the washers and the dryers shirt still looks good still looks vibrant all right let's lay it down let's check it out still looks good still looks vibrant um fresh out of the uh the dryer all right um i don't know if you guys can see right now but the letters are starting to come up so what we're going to do is we're going to press the shirt we're going to press it to see what happens and if it looks good again because what can happen if even if you don't if if you use this method and you sell it to your customer you want them to know that they can even if they can use an iron put like something over top of it use iron might look just as good as new so just for curiosity's sake let's just press it let's just press it and let's see if these little letters that are coming up just lay back down let's see hey peoples and p-bets you are now tuned into an aida production if you like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up it'll really help the channel and if you want to see that it says they come don't forget to hit that subscribe button and hit that notification bell you will not be disappointed back to your show all right guys our heat press is all heated up and ready to go we're just going to lay our shirt down flat see where the edges are up right there and right here i'm just going to see if we press it one time will it will it like go back to normal so let's just see it's not even that bad i've seen vinyl shirts and i've had vinyl shirts actually it's way worse than this and um pressed them back to life so that's the benefit of using like vinyl using a material that lays on top of the shirt you can press it back to life i'm getting a lot of lumps in here let me uh shake it out a little bit and lay it back down so it'd be flat because this is fresh got fabric softener in it and everything is very very thick looking good though looking at my teflon sheet fell over the table let me grab it real fast guys bear with me bear with me all right so let me lay this down strategically so that corners will be flat again cool and let me just press it just for a few seconds we're not going to do like a oh look there's not that much tension on there let me push something adjust that a little bit guys sorry about that and here we go here we go put some pressure on there just for a few seconds doesn't have to be a long time you know maybe like 10 20 or something like that you know all right that should be sufficient for a re-application of a shirt let's see what we got uh it definitely pressed it back but you know uh didn't do a good job laying that down but it definitely pressed everything back for the most part yep just as i thought uh vinyl does the same thing um overlapped on the corner right there because i didn't lay it down good enough and the corner this is totally missing but it did the trick like i said on my on my youtube shirts my ada production shirts i've done it with vinyl where the vinyl was you know up way more than this was up and um pressed it and it was good as new so just keep that in mind when you when you have vinyl shirts just because the vinyl starts coming up does not does not mean it's ruined aw productions all right time to get to business get down to business get down to business we have a box in front of us right here and this is everybody's um everybody enjoys unboxing stuff um i i love unboxing stuff i love opening up new stuff and i want to share this with you

"qK6bVWanM9M": "Applying sublimation paper\nonto 100% polyester T-shirts results in vibrant, photo quality\nresults unlike standard heat transfer paper. While similar to light heat\ntransfer paper by relying on the white or brightness\nof a poly-based substrate, sublimation paper provides no\npop out feeling when transferred. The dyes on sublimation\npaper are the only portion being permanently heat\ntransferred, and they also have excellent washability! To print onto sublimation\npaper, all you\u2019ll need is a sublimation printing system. Before printing however, make\nsure that the image is mirrored, which is typically done by\ndefault through sublimation print manager software. The best way to apply sublimation\npaper is with a heat press. Their large heating elements can\neasily cover standard paper sizes. Setting up your machine for\nsublimation will mainly depend on what type of substrate\nyou\u2019ll be pressing. Our Heat Press Cheat Sheet\nincludes go-to settings for many popular sublimation blanks. When the machine reaches\ntemperature, we\u2019ll first pre-press the T-shirt to clear out any\nwrinkles and moisture. We recommend placing a\npressing pillow in or below your sublimation garments to\nreduce visible press marks. Next, place the paper facing\ndown on the shirt and make sure it stays before covering\nit with parchment paper. And now we can press! Using adhesive spray or\nheat tape can allow sublimation paper to really stick\nto a substrate upon pressing. When the machine is done,\ncarefully remove the parchment paper so as to not slide the paper. The dyes may still be\nactive just after pressing. Allow the transfer to \ncool for a few moments, then peel the paper out,\nand you\u2019re all done!

we also know it's sometimes hard to\nbeat the feeling of a good old worn in team but what if you could create that\nlook right away without spending all those years wearing it in well today\nwe're a deluxe screen printing to map out the basic steps you need for\ncreating vintage tees so there are a few different types of\nt-shirts and fabrics that work well when going for a vintage vibe poly cotton\nblends and tri blends in particular are great because the yarns take the ink\ndifferently giving it that worn in look today we're going to use our vintage\nslub a fabric with a great tonal texture thanks to the uneven knit to showcase\nthis another great option is to go for a shirt that is pre distressed like our\n3009 from the fast fashion collection this tee is made up of super soft 100%\nairlume combed and ring-spun fabric but features holes throughout for that worn\nin look so the next step is to pair that tee with the right design we've\nconsulted an expert designer Charley Pangus Pangus to showcase how to do just that\nwhat's up guys so for this artwork we wanted to apply a nice vintage look and\nin order to achieve that I needed to find some really heavy textures online\nfor the first texture we use rust and when you apply that above the artwork on\ntop we use the white ink so It blended it right into the artwork it gives it a\nnice broken feel which we love with the vintage look for the second texture\nI like to use an oil splatter and I put that below the artwork which gives it a\neven more broken up look it's also important to note that I applied these\ntextures very very heavy on purpose so when we actually print it and you don't\nlose a lot of detail and then when you actually print it you get this nice\nvintage design that we were looking for and last but not least you're going to\nneed to choose a printing technique that complements both the shirt and the\ndesign so there are two different types of inks that you can use for a vintage\nprint there's either plastisol without a base or water base with plastisol\nwithout a base you typically would like to print on a dark fabric that way your\nbright colors are going to get less bright and they're gonna darken up and\nit's gonna lay right on top of that fabric and you're gonna have a little\nbit of a natural distressed look the other way would be to use water base\nwhich is gonna lay into the fabric and it's gonna have a really soft feel to it\nas if you wash that tee a million times there are two different types of\nwater-based inks there's water base that you're gonna print on white or pastel\ncolors when you're printing on darker colors like blacks reds blues you want\nto go to what's called discharge printing that has a discharge base to it\nwhich actually bleaches out the dye in the fabric with that one it's great for\na distressed looked as well depending on the fabric you're using if you're using\na poly blend it's going to discharge the cotton part of it so that's gonna help\nwith that a little bit of that vintage look\nthank you for going bright it's gonna darken up so be aware with that you\nmight want to do some pre-testing on that because your colors will change now\non 100% cotton that color should be true again you'll want to do some testing on\nthat the two tees that we printed today the distressed tee and the slub tee\nare great options when printing that vintage look let us know what you\nthought of the vintage teens we created in this video in the comment section be\nsure to check out how Charlie completed his design in his

Wednesdays and Saturdays with the occasional bonus live video it's completely free to subscribe and all you have to do is hit the big red subscribe button today I'm so excited to show you this I had such a fun time making it I'm going to show you guys how to make this cool bleached shirt and then how you can layer some HTV on top to really make it your own I love the way it came out it's super fun and bleached and you can do kind of any kind of pattern that you want I wanted the nice white square in the center what I love about these is there's really no wrong way to do them even if your square doesn't end up completely square like mine it's still a funnest shirt and there's no perfect shirt and every shirt is gonna be unique and fun and this is something that you can do with the whole family so let's get started I'm gonna show you guys how to bleach your shirt first and then I'll show you guys how to layer your HTV the first super important step is to take some cardboard and put it inside of your shirt all I've done here is taken the flaps of a box cut them off and put some painters tape to hold them together you're gonna want to put this inside of your shirt it's going to help prevent any bleed through of your bleach I highly recommend using cardboard as it is a pretty thick material you can also just buy those t-shirt inserts from the craft store but this is going to prevent any of that bleach from the front of your shirt where the big white square is from bleeding in to the back of your shirt and that way it doesn't look kind of weird on the back with a big white square with nothing in it just get that cardboard all the way in there make sure it is nice and centered sometimes it can be a little bit of a pain as you see I struggled here but once you get that done you are ready to start bleaching on this shirt I am using a 50/50 bleach and water mixture just in a little spray bottle I have it set to the streams spray to fill in that square and I do have this sitting out in the Sun on my driveway if you're gonna do these shirts please be very careful as obviously anything that you get bleach on is going to bleach so be aware of that be very very careful that's why I recommend doing these outside so I let my bleach sit for a minute just to see where I like it and how it's looking and if I wanted to add some more and I just was checking where my cardboard was because I want to make sure that I didn't overspray off that cardboard I do end up with a little spot on the back but it was fine it looked okay no big deal so I just changed it over to mist and now I'm kind of adding some misty bits to the shirt and then what I did is I took the little spray top off and I flicked the nozzle and the bottom hose part all over the shirt to create a really fun like speckled look you'll see me do that here in a minute and then this is just trying to reach out line that Square a little bit more so that it was more rounded off it was a little too small when I did it the first time but you can totally go in and change it up and do it however you want the more bleeds you put on the lighter the color will be but you're also going to get a little bit of thinning on your fabric so be aware of that I like to use a bit of a thicker shirt this is a Hanes 100% cotton shirt so you see I'm flicking the bleach that is one way to do it when I do the back I'm gonna speed that up but when I do the back I actually took the bleach sprayed it on my gloved hand to make sure you do wear gloves when doing this and then I flicked my hand at the shirt to get a different kind of look so you can kind of play with the bleach figure out what works best and what design you like and how you want your shirt to look but I'm gonna go ahead and speed these up so you guys can see it happening I'm letting the front dry a bit before I flip it over to do the back and now on the back I don't want to put that big square so I use some of my mist I use some of the stream and I do some flicking of the bleach on to the shirt I let my shirt sit out in the Sun for a little while and fully dry and then I took it into the house I rinsed it off with some cold water and then I did a quick wash on it once the shirt has been fully washed and dried you can apply your vinyl I am using a mix of Starcraft softflex and Caesar Electric so you're gonna press each layer for just a few seconds now being that the Caesar Electric presses at 305 I just went ahead and pressed the Starcraft at 305 that little bit of temperature difference won't really make a huge issue and all I'm doing is laying each layer down and just pressing it for just a few seconds usually less than five seconds and pulling it up and then removing that transfer sheet you're gonna do each layer like this and then when you do your final layer you will press it for the full 10 to 15 seconds again because I used Caesar Electric I wanted to make sure that I was in fact using the electric settings it was fine with the Starcraft softflex so I had to lay the main bunny down first and then her a really cute red el\u00e9ctrica headband and on top of that I layered some Starcraft softflex white in the stars again just pressing for just a few seconds on each layer that way it doesn't over press go ahead and remove that carrier sheet you do want to remove these ones warm they are warm peel items next comes the little adorable like outline for her headband so you want to make sure that you take your time the reason that you don't do a full press on each layer is because HTV shrinks so if you full press you're gonna end up having a hard time lining them up correctly because they tend to shrink so that's why you do just a really quick press a lot of you ask what he pressed this is this is a Starcraft clamshell 15 by 15 heat press I will link this below it is the best purchase I have ever made for my crafting I use it all the time it's super easy to use and it is a really good quality product so now our last layer is going to be our cute little electric blue glasses that go on our bunny so I just wanted to make sure I got those lined up where I liked them and this time we are going to do the full press because we have all of our layers down and we are ready to go now that we have waited that 10 to 15 seconds here is the finished bunny I'm gonna peel off the last carrier sheet and move it so you can see it here is our finished shirt I love how it came out it was so fun to do and it's so unique the bunny looks awesome she is super cute and the electric really gives it that little extra shine if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments down below I'm always happy to answer those for you make sure you subscribe to my channel I put up new videos on Wednesdays and Saturdays I hope you guys had a great time and happy crafting [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "9Ra1fswSqJE": "hey there in today's video I'm gonna show you how I use my Sawgrass creative studio software I'm going to grab an old file that I do need to press print and press on 100% cotton shirt and most of you already know that sublimation you cannot print on 100% cotton shirts but there are several ways to accomplish that my favorite one is a powder process which I'm going to show you today so I'm gonna go ahead and log on to my Sawgrass software and it's called okay I'm gonna launch it and right now it's gonna it's gonna ask me what blank design I want and I'm just gonna click Next and I'm looking for I'm gonna do a letter size US letter ate nap by 11 next it's always gonna be white sublimation there is no white so you can start with just a blank canvas and I'm gonna be printing a vertical I mean there's that on the vertical image map 11 so I'm going to start my designer I'm gonna go to my designs and I'm gonna pull an old image there's a lot of stuff I've done since I've had this sucker software for three years I guess anyway so it's perfect if I would have added too much white that would have literally see that cut into that so you don't ever want to save an image with too much white up here you know it's not gonna print but still if you covered that that's exactly what's gonna print it's gonna cut that ringside off so I'm not so I don't want it don't know what the gloves too big because it's gonna this is gonna be a crossing chest so I want it maybe maybe five inches right here it tells you it's five by I'm sorry seven by seven right now I want it maybe five inches so that it doesn't look too too big there's a shrink this too much so let's just say about five inches okay so it's five inches squared actually this is gonna be on an excel shirt let's say for next so this is an eight nap I live in print maybe we can be seven inches just go back to other seven inches let's do six and a half up here on the left corner to telling me like what the image size is okay so here's where you see the white those are called bleed lines you don't want to go over or put you don't want your image in there and it's gonna cut off you're literally gonna cut off your image it's kind of a guideline not to go over so let's do that but this is close to the top as possible do you see the bleed lines right here you don't want your image or wording in there and I want to make this as white as possible I'm staying away from the big line if you look up here hopefully you can see it so this is gonna go on an excel shirt just solid white I kind of want to make this bigger but I want this to be across the chest I thought about doing I thought about doing this making this um heat transfer vinyl so that I can make it bigger which I probably should but it's two different processes and for a freebie you don't want to spend too much time on on this process I can make it wider to make it more pronounced again I'm trying to get avoid the bleed lines if you want please comment down below your thoughts I'm just playing around with the I think that would look okay I already have one printed it was my very first one I think I don't remember what happened but somewhere along the line the I mean I didn't place the the image correctly and when you're using powder for your pressing your print on your press you have to be really careful once you place it because once you put it down because it's powder that it's soaking up the ink once you put it down that's it you have to leave it down or it's gonna mess up your humor process I think I want to leave it like that I think that looks looks okay maybe shrink it just a little bit maybe let's make it six inches I'm just trying to imagine what it will look like on an XL shirt normally I would put it that close but again we're working with a freebie right now just for the guys just gonna be using it for boxing boxing shirt okay so let's say we want to Center it I'm gonna highlight both click on object and align Center right so it's a line now so okay now so now what I'm going to do is I've been imprinted on sublimation I'm sorry the powder comes with its own toilet tone paper from SEPs and I'm gonna show you that process now I'm getting ready to print that first I want to show you I put my process my powder in this in this container it's uh it's a one and a half gallon Rubbermaid container and we're gonna have it this big is because I want to be able to fit my paper like at 1111 an 11 inch by 17 inch is the longest either way I want to I want enough room to put the paper in there and I'll show you what I'm going to do they look they did their paper just so that people know which side to print on this one had a little wine on it probably cut that out I'm gonna go ahead and use this I'll just cut that out if I don't need it and I'll show you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and stick this in mind this is my soccer X it's 200 try to face down let me stick them on print the image you do have to select which paper and because it does not give you an option for four steps in a virtuosic creative studio I've been choosing the option of I still select you know sub products and for the paper I just pick a key plot no idea what that is to be honest but it works and I keep it on high quality waiting for it to print I don't need that much powder this is gonna be plenty usually there comes a little baggie like that I don't put it back I just close the seal the literally tightly and I just leave it there until the next time I use it because ink is what if you touch it you're ruined the print so do not touch the ink just be careful and just hang on to it just just grab the edges and avoid touch them to eat I learned the hard way okay so what I'm gonna do you can still wet now grab to eat the paper and just slowly just move the the powder in there grab the ends and I'm just gonna kind of sway back and forth so there's one one time and then I did one last time and that's it I just tap it just like that I also have this little comb brush that I bought just to get any excess powder because you will have to put it under the your heat press for about 30 seconds to secure it so I'm gonna do that process now okay for the temperature settings they have to be 375 Fahrenheit 30 seconds since it's fresh off the press and still wet when you use a piece of parchment paper because there is gonna be powder in the back and that's what the brush silicone brush was for but I went ahead and use my hands just to get any excess out and I'm just gonna set it down I'm waiting for the temperature to get to three seventy-five once that's once I've reached that temperature I mean just let it hover over the image and just let it cure for 30 seconds and then from there I'm going to show you the the pressing process I didn't mention you have to use moderate pressure and it is for 30 seconds once you've done that you have to it's a cold pill so you have to wait about 40 seconds before you remove the transfer so I wanted to add that really quick before I forget this shirt appears a medium-sized shirt this was the very first shirt I print a while back I mean it's then it has been a good maybe a couple years and I can't see it and I want to take this shirt off but I have this as my sample for evening for showing people the sublimation to cutting process which is this powder process I somehow didn't place it correctly and it's it's kind of off in some areas but here didn't pick up the ink and that's why I decided to just keep this I used a sharpie pick just for so looking for display I don't know if you can see about you'll be able to see once I show you now use a sharpie see the black mark I just did that because I wanted to keep it for Show and Tell for sublimation to patent that's why I still have this plus it looks good I mean it's good to have shirts for your process for show-and-tell not what people can see the different processes that you know I would turn the camera but I don't want to have to I'm using the octopus one and I won't have to readjust it but eventually I'll show you all the shirts that I have them hanging on the walls that I use a show and tell the pressure is already at 6:56 362 which that's hot enough so for now I'm just gonna go ahead and cure my in so again it has to hover for about 30 seconds to let it cure and all it's doing is just keeping the moisture it's removing moisture and it's also curing the ink with the powder and you can feel it you can't feel it it really just feels like heat transfer vinyl okay that's about 30 seconds I didn't really count maybe about five more seconds okay so it's out don't touch it I wish I had a handle to do this I'll bring it in close I don't know if you can see it but it's kind of got a like a velvety kind of look to it I would say feel but you can't feel it but he's got a velvety look to it and if you remember a little while ago I mentioned that it had a little smudge or something on I'm gonna go to cut that out I don't want that to end up on my shirt so I'm just gonna cut it out and I'm fixing to I'm fixing to go ahead and take the moisture out of my t-shirt these are white of course this I'm gonna go into these my lint roller you still have to be careful not to touch touch the the image same thing [Music] try not to be camera I'm using a Hanes t-shirt turn it to the camera too much it's gonna move the moisture out of the t-shirt my my my tripod broke my big one my 50 inch tripod it broke got the pressure too hard I'm gonna go ahead and find my center line I'm gonna fold it in half vertically just suck and create my center line my image and I do have this and one of my videos how to find your center line has a kink in there and trying to get out I don't want that I want to get him as far as possible like I did something wrong sorry I know I'm off-camera just trying to find my centerline doesn't let me take this long and also when I look at when I'm you trying to find my centerline the caller when we slowed it in half you can feel the caller I always put the collar off of the edge of the heat press only because I don't want the I don't want the collar imprinted on the on the [Music] on the other side of the shirt if that makes any sense okay that's good for now just going to apply the pressure line to close it just to avoid the camera being so shaky okay now on you can't you can't find the you can't bend it like you normally would he transfer vinyl there you know you pinch the top and the bottom but you can't do it on these because you know you don't want to ruin the the image because it's powdered so what I've been doing there's my centerline look you can see it there you go there's my centerline and again this is an XL shirt I'm gonna do four inches I'm just gonna put a little indention with my nail and I'm gonna get the color off the press or the Putney so what I do because this is I know this is eight at eight and a half by eleven I just find the four and a half inch mark with my ruler or my tape measure normally what I do and I do this way before time I just get it like an exact don't know if you can't use a pen or marker of course you don't want that on his shirt I just he's a either an exacto knife or I'll just mark it with the scissors I know it seems like a lot of different steps but for me it's worth it I'm just gonna make a little make a little mark with my scissors again the wrong reason I'm doing that is because I don't want to touch it and I'm just gonna make little Mark's and just to show you my markers right there my scissor mark so four and a half inches plus another one of inches actually I'm more fiction is I don't wanna to off okay so right there right there right doesn't have to be perfect but that's just me okay and the reason you want to do this is because it's powder once you put it down that's it there's no turning back but regardless I still love this process because I'm able to print on one or any cotton-blend shirt okay so I've got my mark I'm gonna line these up with the center line that I created okay so once they're fine cinnamon I just drop it very carefully and I do use um parchment paper for this for sublimation you do not want to use Teflon sheets because it will pick up any of the ink and I will you will transfer that to your next substrate so I always use parchment paper when I'm working with sublimation okay so we're gonna do 30 seconds and then we have to wait 40 seconds before we can remove the transfer to the transfer paper so we have about seven seconds left if you want to share what process you use for sublimation please drop that below so we can share information maybe I can give you some tips that you have any questions please feel free to drop your questions down below you have to wait 40 seconds I'm not gonna need this because that's the cup steps instructions I'm gonna wait about 40 seconds turn it's been 40 seconds and it is Coquille I hope you can see this I want to call the image when I press it one more time just so I can remove these lines this is a civil mission - cotton okay I hope this video was helpful feel free to ask questions and I look forward to producing more videos for you thank you for watching until the next time", "xjGX1nlMtqM": "in this video I'm going to give you a quick review on the infusible ink markers made by cricut and how they interact with 100% cotton shirts follow the instructions on the cricut website for the infusible ink markers and I actually made this in Adobe Illustrator and then exported it as a PNG uploaded that PNG into my Cricut design space and then had the black marker draw it out and so this is what the original image looked like you can see it's very sharp it was a one-point tip so it's gonna be bolder I colored in these areas because I wanted those filled a little bit but the rest of the outline is from the marker and so I followed instructions and put the card stock underneath the shirt and it actually bled through onto the cardstock so it's important to have that card stock there I would maybe even double up if you have card stock to spare and so that that was the first one I did and it actually bled through some onto the butcher paper too so I'll tell you what I did after that in just a minute but this is how it came out and with this light it looks pretty bold pretty solid but it's actually more of a more of like a faded black at this point although it looks really good on the camera so I also made spots to put on and the reason that this one did not come out so well is because it was on the crease and I did not apply pressure to the heat press that I was using the Cricut ez press I just laid it on there and had a applied the pressure it would be darker right here but um like I said this isn't 100% cotton shirt it's a 3t which I have a toddler and none of cricket's shirts are toddler sizes and so that's why I just went ahead and went with this to see what would happen so ii whenever i was working on the back as you can see it also bled through onto my cloth that i have right here which that's fine but by the time I got to the back I put cardstock on the inside the image down cardstock on top and then I use another piece of clean butcher paper and you can still see where the butcher paper the in fusible ink still faded onto the butcher paper where there was no cardstock and so I did this to kind of preserve the cardstock a little bit longer and you can see that it still gives you that slightly faded look I'm not sure what this will look like after I wash it but I'll definitely wash it by itself inside out but that's when this image got put on here so I would also in the future put cardstock right here if you're using a cricket mat it would definitely come off of this shirt and onto the mat and so I would put cardstock over the mat also maybe a couple of pieces if you have any to spare and that is my review of using crickets and fusible ink markers on 100% cotton so it's definitely a different result than on the polyester shirts but if that's all you've got", "vkCnjUqdlq4": "I'm starting a t-shirt line what's the best shirt to use I can honestly say this is the number one question I get asked to answer that you have to consider what is most important to you about your brand what people starting a t-shirt line usually care about the most is fit feel fashion and how they can be decorated so let's see if I can answer that number one question for you up next [Music] hey guys it's melissa my shirt space when it comes to finding the best t-shirt to start a t-shirt line what you'll first want to consider is your brand's aesthetic if you feel like your brand is more about the design than the shirt I would consider using the g500 okay what I'm referencing here is brands that tend to be about funny slogans or silly images personally I wouldn't consider a brand like this to be a fashion-forward brand so what classic tubular team might be your best bet but I'm guessing that people watching this video are more interested in starting a fashion-forward clothing brand when it comes to a fashion-forward clothing brand that appeals to all genders I can definitely give some more recommendations and again we will want to touch on what matters most fit feel and fashion let's start with fit this is a big one everyone wants to look good and feel good but plains of both genders can be hard this is where manufacturers have stepped up to create the retail unisex team this slim-fitting tee that caters to both genders will be a hit for sure next let's touch on feel a soft comfortable tea will be something that your customers will not forget so this is where fabric comes into play there are three recommendations I would make on fabric the first is cotton the second is CVC and the third is try blend let's talk a hundred percent cotton 100% cotton is a tried-and-true tea it's only downfall is that it will shrink after its first wash but if you provide your customers with the correct wash instructions to follow they will be sure to fall in love next up is CVC cv c stands for chief value cup this refers to the cotton poly ratio within the tea with a heavy percentage of cotton these teas provide the softness of the cotton and the durability and texture of the polyester finally we have our try blends this is a blend of 50% poly twenty-five percent cotton and 25% ring a triflin is very similar to a CVC but with an added feature you have your softness of your cotton your durability and texture of your polyester but then with that round you also get some added features these fabrics all have a very price point depending on where you'd like to be for your customer base okay let's talk fashion a huge trend in the fashion world right now is street wear so how does this apply to choosing a teeth well the unisex tee is one of the hottest things in the street wear market right now so you should definitely consider everything that I've touched on when choosing your fashion-forward teeth but I know what you're thinking WTF I just wanted her to tell me the answer well it's your lucky day here are my top picks or starting a t-shirt line first we have the Bella canvas 3001 seat this is a 4.2 ounce hundred percent cotton retail fit the shirt comes in a number of amazing colors and also has a tearaway label and it also comes in a CTC option next up we have the n62 10 by next level this shirt is made up of 60% cotton and 40% polyester it's a 4.3 ounce and comes with a tearaway label as an added bonus now for our tribe ones first up we have the tr4 o1w weighing in at a 3.7 ounce making it a great lightweight option finally we have my personal favorite it's the three four one three seat by bella canvas it's a three point eight ounce retail fit with unisex sizing side seams and a tearaway label oh and it's also preshrunk what's not to love well there you have it guys my thoughts on the best t-shirt to use

question that many of you had um the question was should you subliminate before you bleach or after your bleach now there is um several ways that people do it some people prefer to press their sublimation on which if you're pressing on a darker like a gray shirt like this you're not going to see it real well it's going to kind of blend in here so they would press it on and then once you bleach it it kind of the design kind of becomes visible um and that works just fine however it does cause severe fading in my opinion the other way is to bleach a spot on your shirt um i actually have some of my dryer right now i forgot about um bleach your shirt and then after it's um washed and dried sublimate onto that shirt um after that and the different the major major difference that i have noticed is let me show you my two different designs here two methods i did same design two different methods this one has a definite more vintagey look this one i had subliminated first and then i bleached so you can see the design is kind of faded and that's because this is 65 poly and 35 percent cotton so once you wash it the design is going to fade the bleach makes the design fade the sun makes the design fade um all that so i have had much better results with bleaching first and then sublimating the design right on top of it um doing it this way is a little more work however it's worth it in my opinion i can do a side by side of the shirts um the only issue i've run into is not knowing exactly how big or how small that design is so you're kind of guessing when you're like spraying your bleach on not exactly knowing you know okay is this going to be too big of a spot is this going to be too small of a spot so you're kind of stuck guessing um let me go here and flip the camera and show you them side by side so obviously uh bleached first bleached second so there you have it um i mean some people get great results this way this is just my personal review my personal opinion and yeah i hope y'all have a wonderful sunday", "Nxmo7KGQsx0": "[Music] all right what's going on everybody it's your boy george from jp custom inc and we're back we are going to do two shirts uh that's gonna be shown to customers a demo or a um basically how it's gonna look and um i chose to do that just so they can get the feel of the two different shirts because we're going to do 100 polyester and also a 100 cotton so right now what we're going to do is we have a white polyester shirt i have the design here and we're gonna try this out and then this is what's gonna go to the customer to show them what it looks like basically and how does the shirt feel i'm not a fan of polyester but a lot of people do like it i'm not a fan of it um i don't like the fill maybe when i'm playing sports yeah but just to wear it around i don't so we're pressing this at 400 uh 400 degrees 35 seconds it should be good also that design is done by those inks over there those inks are jp custom inks it's on the website at www.jp custom inks the printer that i use and those inks are for the epson ep2720 so yep it's on the website so we got nine seconds here um yeah and then we'll do two more because i wanted to do two different uh type of shirts like i said so and i'll explain that to you in a few and typically on these you want to wait until it cools down um to kind of show the shirt or pull up the design but i know a lot of people who does sublimation they pull it right away which is okay too but typically you want to kind of let it cool down let that ink sit but we'll just go ahead and do that um it looks good i could put a little pressure i can tell the problem is i didn't put a lot of pressure on it but it does look good it's clean but i like i said this is just want to show the uh the company what it's going to look like on on this type of shirt polyester shirt and how it feels but yeah i could have put a little bit of pressure when light and that's about it and we'll be right back on the next show all right so we're back now we're gonna do the cotton shirt now if you guys remember the last video we did this um i could show you this design as you can see the entire design is black so what i did on the last one on this one on the last video excuse me i cut everything out all that area there supposed to be black ink i chose to cut it so i didn't have to use black ink but since i'm since the customer's gonna look at this i said well let me do what they thought at first so this is my way saves me on black ink so i'm gonna do it their way as well i'm going to use the same shirt but i'm going to put it on the back just to show them the difference and to me this is worth my time doing just because they're going to get a hundred of these shirts um they're going to get it regardless of which method i use but i figured i can show you guys uh the method that we can try or the possibilities that you can do with certain machines so i'm just gonna press it for three seconds get the crease out i'm gonna peel so that's my design there i don't like to print black on black that's the reason why so this one we are going to do this at 3 30 for 15 seconds 3 30 15 seconds medium pressure we peel this off when it cools down so while this design is cooling down we're going to do another design which is another customer who is going to get 100 shirts and to me it's worth doing a sample okay so this one we're going to put it aside and let it cool off and then we'll be back so we're going to set up the next design and like i said this customer wants a hundred shirt as well um they've been asking me for weeks so i don't mind doing the sample and plus the sample only cost a few bucks and that's not that bad so so this one we're gonna peel as well i've had a lot of people ask me to do designs for them kind of like what's what super color is doing um i don't know it's something that i'm thinking about i don't know if it's worth the time but we'll see it's definitely something we can look at in the near future so this is going to be 3 30 uh 15 seconds cool pale so the other one is cooling down um we'll see how it goes i know the last video i kind of messed up a little bit we'll see how this goes so we'll just let that cool off a little bit we're going to bring the other one back and i don't think i put enough uh pressure i i feel like my pressure changed i forgot what i was doing before i did the shirt i forgot what i pressed but i feel like the pressure did change as you can see i'm not as scared as last time that's why i said mistakes is okay you learn from them right now that's got a little bit of shininess to it uh what i forgot to tell you guys it is gloss so it does have a shine to it so you would have to do another press and that will get rid of that shininess uh looking at this i still like the what my method but let's see i still like the the other way uh cutting the black out i just don't like the shirt feeling like um the entire thing is like plasticky so there it is so it looks good but do you see like this whole thing you could tell the difference between this black and the shirt i don't like that so now if i turn this around you could see the difference right so i think my method works better so obviously the customer customer's going to see both so let me hopefully this has cooled down so this is going to be the same thing but at least this one doesn't have that black going around so we'll see how that goes i got to get used to just like [Music] killing this thing there you go just kind of like to go on the angle with it and you should be good [Applause] so we're gonna do another press to get that glossiness out of out of there and see how that looks like i said i don't mind using this method i just don't like the entire thing looking like that like having that plastic look plastic feel so we'll do this for about five seconds and we'll see the results like i said less i can put on there the better it's gonna look oh okay got stuck a little bit there okay and there you go i mean the graphics look good and i just don't like that little it doesn't feel like plastic this is good i mean i see people using paper and opaque paper whatever's called laser to me i i don't like that fail man this is actually vinyl so there's a big difference between this and those paper that people are using because this is actually vinyl and we use what i know all the time so this is good i just don't like that look but that's just me uh let me know let me know what you guys think um if you have any questions also before we before we go if you guys have any questions the best way i say join my um join my facebook group because what happened is a lot of people are asking me questions on ig facebook and other places and it's the same questions that other people are asking so if it's asked in in my facebook group which is jp custom inc then the person that has the same question will see that somebody asked and the answer is already there so that way i'm not like individually talking to everybody as you know answering the same question so if you go on the facebook i think it'd be an easier way that way um people might come up with a question that you didn't come up with so yeah join jp customink on facebook and www.jpcustommake.com there's a couple things on there as well that's it peace", "ZnguoFcG290": "do you know how hard it is to find a perfect white t-shirt I've bought a lot of t-shirts over the years but there always seems to be something off slightly too long slightly too short sleeves a little too big sleeves a little too small easily wrinkles too large of a neckline can any of you guys relate I mean first of all problems right but you know what today is that they this stops because today we are going to find the perfect white t-shirt let's go [Music] okay so here's the deal the objective here is to compare different white t-shirts from different brands ranging from three dollar t-shirts all the way up to eighty dollar t-shirts and the attempts to hopefully find the perfect white team so right now I have a couple of the unit close to pima cotton tease sitting at home and one from Primark and there's one from a skit that should be arriving today so right now we are headed downtown to buy a couple of white t-shirts from hmm Zara costs and a PC and then we'll head back home and compare each of those side-by-side let's go [Music] okay guys so we are now back and we have a total of eight white t-shirts to try on so ranging from the cheapest to the most expensive we've got one from Primark two from H&M one which is their basic white t-shirt and another one that's a regular fit I'm not sure how tough it's gonna be different on those two so we're gonna see that later then we've got one from Uniqlo which is your basic supima cotton white t-shirt then we have two from asket one in extra-small and another one in small if you guys don't know ask it is a brand which makes 15 different sizes instead of the usual five so they basically go from extra small to extra large and then for each of those sizes you can choose between three different lengths short medium or long so I basically got to one an extra small and one in small both in regular length after that we've got one from costs and finally we've got one from a PC which is also their basic white sheet it's called a jimmy t-shirt on their website for sizing purposes know that I am 5 foot 7 tall I weigh 60 kilos and I usually wear the smallest size available in any given brand all right let's get into it [Music] okay so first off we've got this one from Primark it's their basic white t-shirts in extra-small and it's priced at $3.59 truck ssin is quite poor the stitching alongside the body is not symmetrical on both sides and the material is see-through so if you get close you can actually see like my tattoos underneath but I feel like we can expect that from a t-shirt at this price range so overall I probably wouldn't stock up on these as like my essential go-to t-shirt for for everyday use but at this price I mean I would consider wearing it at home if I'm doing some manual labor for example and I know I'm gonna get dirty or if you're really stranded on budget and you want something super cheap and you don't mind that the quality is not really there you can also go for this the fit is actually not that bad so I would recommend this if you're really tight on your budget [Music] alright number two we've got this hmm basic white t-shirt it's their basic cotton t-shirt in extra-small and it is priced at $6.99 that is since most of you guys are in the u.s. I'll be giving the prices in US dollars so it's an extra small but it definitely feels much bigger it's quite long it goes down below the crotch as you can see and it's also quite large on the side so it feels very oversized quite baggy definitely does not feel like an extra small and this fits much more like a medium size than an extra small as for the quality of the material it's a bit see-through but not too much I guess that's okay it feels slightly better than the Primark one but it also does not look like high quality cotton at all okay number three we have this regular fit H&M t-shirt this is super weird guys like I feel like a bat the fit is just really awkward like it's super super long and the sleeves are super tight there's like plenty of excess fabric right here which kind of makes it look really awkward lifts the tag here I'm definitely gonna be returning this one it's also six dollars 99 the other one was a much better fit to be honest even though it was also a little too big alright there we have it [Music] next up we've got Yoona close supima cotton white t-shirt so I've actually been wearing these for a number of years now I've got a couple in whites and then a couple in other neutral colors like Navy and gray they're all in extra-small underpriced that 9.99 for my height at least they fall right about mid crotch which i think is perfect for a t-shirt they're quite slim and they fit nice over the body and the sleeves are just about right I used to think that the sleeves were a little too big because my arms were a bit thin but now to be honest like I've been working out a bit getting a bit of arms and the fit is just perfect overall it's obviously not the highest quality cotton you're gonna have like it's it's slightly see-through and you lose a bit of that softness after like washing it a lot of times like not after a couple of washes but let's say if you had the t-shirt for like six months to a year and you've been wearing it like every week and washing it often you're gonna lose a little bit of that softness in the material but asides from that I've been quite happy with them I think they're a great balance between quality and budget so a $9 98 they're not gonna break the bank but you're still getting really good quality and the fit is nice but with that said the next four t-shirts I've never tried them on in the past so maybe who knows we're gonna find one that's better than this one from Uniqlo let's see what happens [Applause] all right so the next two are both going to be from a skits as I mentioned I go one an extra small and then one in small because they've got those 15 different sizes so you never know when there's that many sizes which one's gonna fit your best so one an extra small regular length and one in small also regular length so this one is the extra small and to be honest it feels super nice the cauda is it's a heavyweight 100% Egyptian cotton it does not look see-through at all and it just feels super nice and super soft onto the body and I keep in mind I haven't washed them yet but they really feel super nice on you lengthwise it does feel slightly too short the extra small it hits like at the crotch and maybe slightly too high on the armpits let's try on the small see if it fits any better be right back all right so now we have the ask it in size small regular length it definitely has a more room than the extra small one especially around the midsection and around the torso area and it's longer it hits about slightly under mid crotch which honestly I prefer the length of the Uniqlo t-shirts the material on this one feels better but I kind of feel like I would want it in between the two you know because it's much roomier on the sides and it's also longer but maybe slightly too long God you guys are gonna say I'm so picky but maybe like if you get an extra small in the longer length would that be better would it be in between the two would it be like super long I don't know okay so conclusion on these two from a skits if you're slightly under five foot seven because I'm five foot seven so if you're slightly under that and a little more thin I think the extra small in regular length would be a perfect fit but if you're slightly taller than me slightly taller than five foot seven and you slightly have a little more mass on you I would go for the smaller and if you're like me I would go for any in between so probably the Uniqlo ones okay let's move on to number seven alright number seven we've got this bonded cotton t-shirt from costs so this one is super big it's definitely much bigger than all the other t-shirts but not big as in ill-fitting big more like long line slash oversized kind of vibe so it would definitely work for a street wear a kind of look with that long line t-shirt maybe like under a denim jacket and you got the t-shirt kind of growing out of it to be honest I really like it it's got these kind of bands at the sleeves and at the bottom of the hem and it fits nicely for an oversized t-shirt like I would definitely not buy like 10 of these and have them be like my staple go to everyday t-shirts but as a more unique piece in my wardrobe I would rock it so it's priced at 60 I think just a second sorry about that it's priced at $45 USD so yeah it's definitely a bit more expensive than the rest but the material feels nice feels supersoft like you can feel that it's like heavy weight cotton drapes nicely over the body if you're into the oversize kind of look and you don't mind putting 45 bucks into a t-shirt I will go for it and lastly we have this t-shirt from a PC in size small and it is priced at $85.00 sir not too surprisingly it also fits a bit long like many t-shirts from many brands because I'm so short but other than that the material feels nice regarding the sleeves they feel slightly big but at the same time they also flare out very nicely and geometrically on the sides like this and although they make my arms look a little small I kind of like the look of it I like the look of how they flare out on the sides but then again is it worth $85 you guys decide for me probably not I probably wouldn't want to spend $85 for a t-shirt but the quality feels nice if you're taller than this like if you're slim if you're thin and you're tall like five foot nine or something this would probably fit you perfectly to be honest because other than the length it fits me pretty nicely all over so it's really only the length that's the problem if you're five nine and slim and you've got the money to pay 85 bucks for a teacher try it on fits nicely quality is good alright now that we have reviewed these eight different white tee shirts also I know that I didn't review one from Zara because I went to the store and couldn't find any t-shirt even not in whites I couldn't find anything in size small I mean in size extra small so sorry guys I cannot review that so in conclusion which one of these brands makes the best white t-shirt in my subjective opinion with my size and my height and my frame and build if we simply take into account the fit of the t-shirt I would definitely go for the unique low ones now if you're bringing the quality of the material and the durability and how transparent it is and how soft it feels to the touch I would go pretty asketh once those felt really high quality to me at a reasonably affordable price compared to like the more luxury brands like a PC like for a skits you get really high quality t-shirt for 40 bucks I'm not saying it's cheap it is expensive for a t-shirt but to get that premium quality fabric I think it's reasonable but then again when it comes to the size and the fits of a t-shirt it all comes down to your own personal body type so only use this as a reference while keeping in mind my size and keeping into account to your body type and how it would likely fit you and there's no better test than simply buying the t-shirt for yourself trying them on and seeing how they fit with that said I hope you guys got some value from this video let me know down in the comments if you enjoyed this style of video it's a bit

i want to do a video of what these shirts look like before the wash test now the three here these three are all sublimation this is sublimation on a black shirt using the 3g opaque paper this is a sublimation on a 99 cotton t-shirt so we might as well consider that 100 cotton t-shirt uh just nothing added to it just straight direct sublimation and the third shirt we have here this one is oh on a jersey dry blend which is a 50 50 shirt so this one we're expecting to get a vintage look this one we're looking for it to come out just about with the print gone and this one we're just looking to see how the opaque transfer holds up if the print washes off or not i'm also going to do a couple of other wash tests since i'm doing that might as well go ahead and throw this in from another video these are the transfers from f m expressions go ahead and throw in these these are screen printed transfers i don't think i put anything on the back of that one this one is um the screen print with the the uh just the foil and we've got a screen print transfer over on this side from them so go in get some close-ups of how they look beforehand it's really really close up some see okay the 50 50 would help if i wasn't in the way of the light there is that one the hundred percent which is more vintage and that would okay let's head to the washer okay guys so here are all three t-shirts side by side the first one here being the uh 99 cotton t-shirt which gave us a very vintage look i'm gonna give you guys my honest opinions on them i'm gonna show you first that one gave us a really really vintage looks looks really really light on the shirt it actually doesn't look bad uh if that was the look i was going for but to be honest with you i've done a lot of 100 cotton t-shirts without any type of poly spray or anything like that and they all really just fade out to the point of where you really can't see the design so i don't know if that one percent poly is saving this or if this is but i know that this is going to fade out some more or at least i feel so so i'll do some more wash tests on it just to see uh what happens but it it'll it may get a little bit lighter than that what happens with polyester with the printing on 100 cotton or 99 cotton is that the inks don't stick to anything because it only sticks to the poly and so since we don't have poly what's happening here is that we're just getting a stain okay and so that stain may stay or it may not it's inconsistent next we have the jersey 5050t and this is pretty much the same result that i get on the gildan 5050 or any other 50 50 blend shirt so that's our look there um and you'll notice you notice this on vintage t it's nice and smooth guys nice and smooth great thing about direct uh with those with with this one i definitely sell this to my customers um and i let them know go back and look at the beginning of the video so that you can see the difference in the color i let them know that you will get a little bit of what a little bit of fading most people are okay with that because they want that softness and vintages in right now so if your customer can get that softness they'll go with something like this most of the time over something like this it's all about a little give and take okay and then we have the last one that we have here is the um jersey tea and this is a black 50 50. again you're actually supposed to do this on 100 cotton and if we had done that we wouldn't see the black coming through of the shirt that's uh what you call dye migration guys so my opinion on this one is that the printing actually stayed pretty good it does look like it faded maybe just a little bit but i'm really surprised to see it stay in because most well i'm not surprised to see it stay in i was surprised when i supplement actually sublimated on it and the ink stayed because i've sublimated on different ones and the ink didn't stay but um to have sublimated on this and for the sublimation ink to stay this turned out pretty good um the only issue that i have with this one is that it does feel patchy and it you can hear it see so versus that so that's the only issue that i have with that one but if your customer really wants a black t-shirt this would be a way to go uh let's also remember that this is a full you know kind of a big patch um all in all they turned out pretty good considering that none of these shirts are a hundred percent polyester and like i said we would i wouldn't do this i'd do that for myself these two right here i'd sell this one is wash tested up to 50 washes but i have a feeling that it's going to end up fading and not fading but cracking i would sell that to a customer who was doing a birthday shirt or something like that and they know it's not you know not for your brand you wouldn't want something like this for your brand you could use something like this for rest in peace shirt something that somebody's going to wear one or two times a few times other than that the one in the middle would be the way to go if you guys want to see how the f and m transfers turned out after washing them then stay tuned", "hsDbQ05k5gE": "what is up everyone i hope you're doing well spring is just around the corner so i thought it was about time to start getting some basic tees in place for the warmer weather you probably all know by now that uniqlo is my go-to when it comes to affordable basics what you get for the price is unbeatable in my opinion so for this week's video i decided to pick up the most popular and most talked about t-shirts i'm gonna try them on and talk about what i like about each one and what i don't like about each one i'm six foot and about 73 kilograms and i picked all of the t-shirts up in a size medium which is my true size i'll let you know which one's my favorite and which ones i don't like so much at the end of the video i've also measured each of the t-shirts just to give you more accurate information on how they differ in size but anyway without wasting any more time let's get straight into the first t-shirt so the first t-shirt that i've got is the crewneck supima cotton tee in white the first thing that i noticed is the color seems to be a bit more of an off-white than a pure white which i happen to like but it may not be what you want when ordering a white tee the quality feels lovely and the tea is so soft just what you'd expect from cp mccotton this tea comes in at 27.5 inches long a width of 20 inches from pit to pit and a sleeve length of 9 inches so let's have a look at how the tee fits the first thing that i noticed is the neck opening is a lot wider than i was expecting apparently they've updated this tee to have a slightly more relaxed fit so that's probably why i usually like a tight-fitting neck with my tees but i actually don't mind the wider neck here and i think it will look decent underneath an open shirt or a jacket this tee in the white is also slightly see-through not enough to the point where i wouldn't wear it but it may be for you if you don't like this then maybe opt for a darker color in this tee all in all it feels beautiful the quality is there but for me the fit is a little off i think i could have probably sized up with this tee for a more relaxed look but i'd still wear it as it is the next t-shirt we've got is the airism oversized u-range tee in black this is a very soft feeling tee and actually a bit thicker than i was expecting the quality feels really nice and i already know this is going to be comfortable this tee is made from 53 cotton 30 polyester and 17 elasto multiester this t-shirt comes in at 12 pound 90 and i think that's a very decent price for this tee this team measures 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of 10.5 inches the tee is so soft and it has a decent weight to it this one may be even more comfortable than the supima cotton t2 the quality feels great and this tee fits me really well for an oversized tee the sleeve length and the body length ratio is perfect for me sometimes tees can have massive sleeves and then too much of a crop in the body which some people do prefer but for me this is the perfect balance for an oversized tee the neckline is really soft just like the rest of the tee and it fits snug to my neck this tea also has a drop shoulder for an even more relaxed look and i really like this feature on this tee all in all i'm really impressed with this t-shirt and for the price you may not find anything better for an oversized tee however we do have another oversized tee coming up next so maybe that'll beat this one next up we have another oversized tee from the u range that i picked up in this petrol blue color it features a pocket on the front and a split at the hem which are nice additional details this one is made from 100 cotton but it feels a lot stiffer than the other teas on the list i don't actually mind a stiff tee when it's in a heavy weight material and i actually prefer that so it's not a problem for me this tea also comes in at 12p90 which is an absolute bargain for a tea like this due to the split hem there's different lengths at the back of the front of this t-shirt the t mesh is 27 inches long at the front and 27.5 inches at the back it's got a width of 23 inches and a sleeve length of 10 inches so now moving on to the fit the tee has a generous boxy fit oversized sleeves and a slightly shorter length in the body i'm aware this tea is designed to be a bit shorter at the front in the body but for me i'd like an extra inch of length so maybe sizing up a size would work better for me it's nowhere near as comfortable as the airism tea but that's not really surprising the neck is softer than the rest of the t-shirt though so that's a nice touch and you don't have to worry about it rubbing i'm in love with the colour and the details of this tea but for me the tea doesn't sit as well on me as the airism tea does the final tea we've got here is the ut this is a classic tea and one of the first styles i ever picked up from uniqlo the ut is made from 100 cotton and it has a bit of a heavyweight feel to it like the previous t it's got a bit of a rough feel to it too and although that doesn't bother me it's definitely worth mentioning this one also comes in at 12 pound 90 which seems about average for a u-range t from uniqlo the team meshes in at 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of nine inches like most of the u-range products this tee has a slightly relaxed fit which i really like i feel this tee fits me perfectly and sits well on my body i've had a few of these tees in the past and i feel the material is slightly thinner on this newer model for some of you in the warmer countries this may be a good thing but i always prefer a thicker tee the neckline is ribbed and it has a nice tight fit to my neck which i really like the thicker neck also means you don't have to worry about the neckline getting misshapen in the wash the length and the sleeve length is spot on for me although the sleeves are a little floppy all in all this tee fits me really well and i'm really happy with the way it looks so for me each t-shirt serves a different purpose if i wanted to wear any of these t-shirts as an undershirt then the one that wins it for me would be the supima cotton t-shirt for an oversized tee i would go for the airism tee the fit on this t-shirt is lovely and it's so comfortable too i love the color and the details on the oversized pocket t-shirt but the fit on me is just not quite right and i do prefer the airism oversized tee over this t-shirt and last but not least the best all-rounder in my opinion is the uniqlo ut the fit is spot on with this tee and although it's not perfect there are a couple of things that i would change i don't think you can beat this t-shirt for the price and it's probably the one that i'll be wearing the most in the spring and the summer months but whichever t-shirt that you go for you can't really go wrong they're all great for the price so choose the one that suits you best but i hope this video has helped you out and help you decide which one you want to get maybe just pick up all of them if you can't decide like i did and let me know your favorite down in the comments but anyway as always thanks so much for watching please do give the video a like if you enjoyed it hit subscribe if you're new and i will see you next week see ya", "88t_oHz-g9Q": "what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be taking a look at three different plain white t-shirts from Uniqlo you guys already know how much I love Uniqlo I think they make amazing products amazing clothes prices that are affordable for most people and you guys also know how much I love plain white t-shirts I wear them pretty much every single day and in fact this one that I'm wearing right now is one of the ones that we'll be discussing in this video today the three white t-shirts that I chose for today's video are some of Uniqlo's most basic plain white t-shirts and I chose these because I think that they're the most versatile they don't have any pockets they're pretty basic in their cut and in their silhouette so I think that these are the ones that a lot of you guys will choose if you guys plan on buying some of these plain white t-shirts as well but if you guys want me to review some of uni clothes more Craigie or seasonal white t-shirts I can do those as well because I do own a few of those as well just let me know in the comment box down below and I'll be sure to make that happen also if you guys like this type of video go ahead and hit that thumbs up button because it really does help me out it helps more people find this video it helps the channel grow so I'd really really appreciate it the three shirts that I chose from Uniqlo are the package tri plain tee this is the crewneck version I also chose the FEMA cotton T which is the shirt that Uniqlo is very known for and the last one is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt and before we get started I just want to mention that I am a little over 5 feet 9 inches as of making this video I'm around 165 pounds so that should give you guys an idea of how these shirts fit me and how they might fit you as well and yeah that's about it let's get started so the first shirt is this Uniqlo package dry crewneck shirt this also comes in a v-neck variation which should be similar if not exactly the same except for the collar and this is the cheapest shirt out of the three that I'm going to show you guys today coming in at around five dollars and ninety cents in the US and here in the Philippines where I'm from it comes in at 290 casos making it the most affordable out of the bunch and this is the one that I was actually the most excited about because I haven't tried the shirt the other two I do own so I've you know I have a lot of experience with it but this is my first time actually trying the shirt so yeah I'm really excited about it so I'm gonna start off with the things that I really really like about the shirt and right off the bat I love the fit of the shirt I like the length it falls around mid crotch for me you know this is where my belt is and I like the length of the sleeves as well they also are not too loose not too tight which I do like it's very it's a very regular fit but it fits really nicely and I'm actually very happily surprised about how the shirt feels so yeah I'm really happy about the fit of the shirt the next thing you'll notice is the sort of the quality or the thickness of the material itself and in comparison to the supima tee that I'm used to this is thinner and you could also say it's a little rougher than the supima tee which may not necessarily be a bad thing because if you're not comparing the two side-by-side you won't really notice the difference because it is still very soft now it is also a little thinner so as you can see it's a little see-through that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you for me it's not particularly you know too much of a negative and in fact in the Philippines ran from sometimes these lighter materials even if they're technically not as good as heavier weight materials can be really nice in the heat you know walking around outside so yeah I really really really really dig the shirt overall I'm very very pleased with this I think it's a very first house shirt you can use it for a lot of things yeah that's pretty much it I really like the shirt and at the price I don't think you wrong with with this with a shirt at all the next t-shirt is the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo this is the famous two pima cotton tee it's very very soft it's very very nice and this in particular is my everyday white t-shirt this one comes in at around nine dollars and ninety cents u.s. and here in the philippines it comes at five hundred and ninety pesos making it sort of the middle range between all these three shirt shirts but yeah I really love the shirt again it's my everyday shirt very very comfortable so let's just get straight into the look in the field first off right off the bat you'll see that the length is very similar to the previous tee to the dry package tee it comes down around mid crotch here the sleeves come around mid bicep and again not too tight not too loose the shoulders are just the right size for me this is a large by the way so all of the shirts that I'm fitting today are large because I'm generally a little bit bigger in the chest and in the shoulders yeah very very nice now in comparison to the previous shirt this is very noticeably a lot softer and a lot thicker in terms of material I did buy a brand new one because I do have a bunch of these but you know there are shirts that have been wearing for a long time now so I wanted to make this video with a brand new shirt just to see how one feels right off the bat and there it is super nice you can see it's not really transparent if it is it's very very little and you know it takes a lot to see that so it is a lot of thicker a lot softer and it feels a lot more durable than the first one but again you know it really depends if what you're looking for if you wear your white tee shirts a lot what you're gonna use them for so if you don't wear your white t-shirt often and you just want to have one in the closet you know you can go either of two ways you can just get this one which is a little bit more expensive but since you don't wear too much and you know you're not going to be spending a lot on my t-shirts you might want to spend a little bit more for this so that when you do wear it it is you know a little nicer a little bit more durable or you can go the other way you wear you know since you don't wear too much you don't really care for that slight bit of extra durability and quality you might just go with the cheaper one they're both great options at this point what I can say is that I'm not sure how the packaged dry shirt wear is over time but for me in particular I have a bunch of these supima shirts some of them are some of them are actually maybe two or more years old and I still wear them until today they fit very well still they basically lasted a long time especially you know this year where I'm wearing white t-shirts almost every day they've they've been very very good so that's it that is number two the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo the third and final shirt of the bunch is this one this is the newest shirt of the bunch in terms of when they came out this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve tunic shirt and there are many differences between the shirt and the other two shirts but I think that this is one of the shirts that they might keep in their lineup for a long time so I decided to show you guys this shirt as well now this shirt is also a large and in terms of price it comes in at around fourteen dollars and ninety cents in the US but the strange thing is here in the Philippines this comes in at the same price as a subcommittee at around five hundred and ninety pesos so I think we're pretty lucky here in the Philippines for that to be the case and I don't really know why that is but I'm pretty happy about it so again this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve crew neck shirt and the big difference between this and the other shirts are I think what Uniqlo is going with the shirt is they were trying to do sort of a more retro feeling plain shirt and they do that through having this thicker material so the other two are sort of a soft more modern material I guess you could call it a more modern blend making it very soft making making it comfortable but this one purposely gives you a rough texture a heavy material giving you that sort of more more retro feel the shape is also not as form-fitting as the previous two it's a little bit more boxy as you guys can see the sleeves are a little tiny bit longer tiny bit looser so was the body area and again this is a large but it's supposed to fit that way it dropped a little lower in the crotch and yeah it's a little heavier a little rougher but I do like the shirt because it gives you that you know it gives you that retro look it's a completely different look it looks very very relaxed and as you guys know I love wearing cargo shorts and sure it fits the aesthetic really well so if you guys are more laid-back and you like this casual retro look the shirt might be the one for you now even though this shirt is heavier is thicker it's not like the thickest thing in the world and there is a certain level of lightness to it so they could have made this a lot thicker but they didn't which I actually do really really appreciate especially again here in the Philippines with all the heat yeah here's here's how it looks super nice super comfortable and this is one of the shirts that are in my er rotation I actually only have one of these in my current rotation so I'm happy to have another one after purchasing this one so this is nice some of you guys might actually like the shirt more than the other two and I think that's you know not a bad thing it's a great option there you go so that's it guys that is my comparison of the three plain white tee shirts from Uniqlo the package dry shirt the supima cotton tee as well as this the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt if you guys found this helpful if you guys enjoyed the video let me know by giving me a thumbs up and if you guys want to see reviews of more seasonal shirts from Uniqlo leave those in the comment box down below I'll be sure to make those happen if you guys want me to and yeah that's it for this video

style geez 64,000 like this one right here then this video is for you there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from so many that stand has this permanent look on his face but not to fear because today we're just gonna look at one in specific the Gildan soft style G 64,000 there are a few important things to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options and price and also since we are a screen print shop we're actually going to talk about the print ability using discharge and water-based inks which is what we specialize in here at Twin Cities first let's start with comfort this shirt is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton and it weighs 4.5 ounces what this means is that through the ring spun process they've left it with longer stronger strands of yarn what it means for you and I is that this shirt is soft and it's durable shirt was made for wear it's a softer shirt than your Gildan G 5000 your standard heavy cotton t-shirt but not quite as soft as like your next level 3600 your Bella canvas 3000 won American Apparel 2001 those shirts are combed ring spun cotton so they're gonna be a little bit softer but this shirt is a nice middle-of-the-road comfortable shirt next let's talk about styling it's not a Corvette but it's also not your grandma's beige Buick LeSabre out here this shirt is a semi fitted with a tape neck and shoulders it has a rolled forward shoulder so it fits most body types really comfortably it has a nice seamless double collar a durable sleeve and him double needle stitch it is a little longer than your standard t-shirt but not as long as something like the next level 3600 and this shirt comes in sizes extra small through Forex as for shirt colors Gildan always has a lot of color options and this shirt is no different it has a ton of different options to choose from if you look at these charts you'll see that they mix the heather colors and things with it as for price once again nice mill the road shirt as Goldilocks would say it's not too cheap it's not too expensive it's just right and to give you an idea here is a price list this price is 450 shirts with a1 color print and as you can see it fits right in between like the cheaper Gildan 5 thousands and the more expensive fitted shirts like next level labelled the canvas american apparel things like that so this price is really just to give you an idea where this shirt fits among a bunch of our other popular t-shirt options and remember that these prices are subject to change since the time you've seen this video so next let's talk a little bit about actually printing on the Gildan soft style t-shirt since we use discharge inks the dye lot of the shirt actually is very important and what a dialogue is is where they actually take a blank material and they diet to give it its color so in some places like here's an example of a bad dialogue where we print discharge ink on it and we get varying results luckily Gildan has been very consistent with their dialogues we've seen a little bit of problems lately but not too much the important thing is as a customer it's not really that important to you guys because it's up to us to printers to figure out the dialogue problems and it just makes a little extra work for us but for you just so you know the Gildan soft style t-shirt has always been a good option their colors always come out really nice and really consistent one more thing to add the Gildan soft shirt also comes in a ladies version that's the G 64,000 L let me just throw that on for you real quick so you can see what it looks like so once again the Gildan soft style is a very middle-of-the-road shirt it's not fitted so it's not going to make you feel insecure staying here has no shame and it's not a boxy shirt that's gonna make you feel like a square it's right down the middle and now there's only one thing left for you to do and that's to click on the link in the description below fill out the quote form let us know you want the Gildan soft style t-shirt if that is indeed that shirt you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own we talked about a lot of

set it to the hottest water temperature next wash your shirt dry it thoroughly using a medium heat set finally wear would drive option to boil some water step 1 Royall a large bottle once it's boiling remove it from the heat toss in your shirt let the shirts soaked in the water for around 5 minutes now drain the water let the shirt cool off wring it out and let it dry voila your once oversized shirt now fits like a glove", "vnRV3p3Deq0": "hey everybody it's rachel with die press today i want to show you how to use poly t plus for supplementing cotton and cotton blends poly t plus is a one step formula that allows you to prep and sub a shirt in only five minutes paula t plus does two things at once it removes the chemical sizing and it also lays down a polyester resin on the cotton threads let's talk briefly about chemical sizing thread is coated in chemical sizing during the manufacturing process to prevent the thread from breaking while they weave the fabric together sizing can cause two problems one is it will burn and scorch when heated and it will also cause your image to fade after the first second wash poly t plus is sold as a concentrate there are three reasons why we sell it as a concentrate number one we sell it as a concentrate to prevent freezing when we ship it to colder regions we also sell it as a concentrate to extend the shelf life of the product and lastly we sell it as a concentrate to save you money because we don't want you to have to pay for us to ship water across the country since i'm pretty sure you have water where you live here are the four smaller sizes that we sell of poly t plus the four ounce bottle poly t plus will make 16 ounces of spray when you add water and it will coat about 30 shirts the 8 ounce bottle of poly t plus concentrate will make 32 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 60 shirts 16 ounce bottle we'll make a half a gallon or 64 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 120 shirts and lastly the 32 ounce bottle of poly t plus will make a gallon of spray and coat about 240 t-shirts all right so before we spray the shirt we do want to get our heat press heated up because this formula needs to be pressed while wet so i need to make sure my heat press is ready so as soon as i'm done spraying i can press it wet in order to remove the sizing and cure the poly t-plus at the same time so i've set the heat press at 330 degrees and that is currently warming up so while that's warming up we're going to go ahead and spray the shirt the first thing i want to do is i already made up my spray i took the four ounces of concentrate poured it into this 16 ounce bottle and then i added 12 ounces of purified water and shake it up and you're ready to go okay so you want to spray the poly t plus about the size of your image this cardboard is just slightly larger than my image so i'm going to use this as a template to mark to have an idea of where to spray and then you're just going to spray you get it good and wet you need to have it wet in order to see steam and to remove the sizing so this step is actually going to be wetter than the second coat that we will apply after all right i think that's looking pretty good next thing you need to do is cover it with parchment paper any other type of paper will stick so it must be parchment paper uh this is parchment paper from costco the thicker it is the better because if it's really thin and flimsy it will tend to get wrinkles which will press into your shirt so we lay that across there and you should see some steam coming out here okay that's 30 seconds open it up that first coat is dry now we're going to apply a second coat this is the second and final coat this one can be a little bit lighter than the first coat and i'm just i kind of remember where my image is going so i'll just spray that area right and roll it in again all right oh and by the way this shirt is actually a 60 cotton 40 polyester and we recommend starting with a minimum of 40 polyester because you're gonna get more vibrant images uh the shirt that i'm wearing is actually 100 cotton um i did this whole technique on this shirt and it's already been washed but in my opinion it's not as vibrant if there's at least a little bit of polyester in there all right now this time this is the second time we're pressing it wet this time we're only going to press it for 20 seconds and this is to cure and dry the poly t plus so we're ready to subtle mate okay all right now the shirt is ready to sublimate so we're going to set it aside before we sublimate we need to pre-press at 385 for five seconds to make sure there's no more moisture left in the shirt okay i'm ready to subtle mate i got this really cute design from debbie does design and i'm going to put this on the shirt center there and what i like to do is i like to cover my sublimation paper in this case it's just multi-purpose paper cover that with regular copy paper so this absorbs any extra ink that might pass through that way when i do my butcher paper i can keep using this butcher paper over and over again and not have to worry not throw it away and not be so wasteful okay so we have the temperature of 385 we're going to press medium pressure for 70 seconds and actually i just did want to show you here we don't i don't have anything on the press except for the thick rubber mat that came with my heat press and that is because all the seams are off this press if you were doing a smaller shirt like a onesie or kid shirt or even a raglan shirt you would need to lift up the image area higher using a silicone mat so you would lift cut it about the size of your image put it underneath the shirt so that your image area is higher than the thick seams on your shirt like i said medium firm pressure 70 seconds all right 70 seconds is up all right looks good nice and vibrant still feels really soft if you happen to get too much coating on there and it feels a little stiff the softness will come back after the first wash thanks for joining me today be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel also join us on facebook look for the group titled dye sublimation that is sponsored by die press for more details about polyt plus check out www.dipress.com", "ixY1Af77Bjs": "[Music] okay guys so today i'm bringing you how to do sublimation on cotton this is very easy as you can see i'm printing my design this is the design we're gonna do today don't forget to mirror it as you can see this is the paper that i'm using for sublimation it's pretty good so the ink is gonna be a little wet because we're gonna put some polyamide polyamide is a powder that we're gonna put on top of our design uh don't forget to follow us on etsy uh so as you can see i'm gonna start like putting all the polyamide on top uh on top of the design it has to cover the whole design but like i said it's gotta be the designs had to be a little a little wet so you know sometimes you had to like print it less slowly so you had to cover uh the whole design so in that way you know it's gonna be working perfectly so the polyamide what it does it it's like a like a sort of glue this the way it has to look you can you can see like over here it's everything cover the letters the blue color the red and once you have it [Music] covered with the polyamide powder what we're gonna do we're gonna cook it so i have a heat gun that i used to use for soldering so now i'm using it to cook my design so you're gonna start like like putting some heat on on top you gotta move it because otherwise you're gonna burn the the sheet so you have to melt a little bit the powder with the ink as you can see it's turning a little different instead of getting a little brighter over here let me do this right here okay so you have to do this for your design otherwise it's not gonna work uh so like i said the polyamide is what it's doing it's acting as a glue uh some people were telling me that the polyamide for some people could be people could be allergic to polyamide i don't think that would be a problem you know uh and i have used this for like so many times even for my kids and none of them they have a problem with it so just try to cover the whole design like i said i don't think polymer it's something that is going to burn you you know like cause you some irritation and over here we have the design and in my case i always like to do it double so in that way it's gonna look perfect i i mean how much polyamide you're gonna use just like a little bit you can reuse it you can reuse this polymer like so many times um i have a bag that is i have been using like so many times okay so you just like shake it a little bit so in that way there's not gonna be like an extra polyamide on on the design over here i can show you that it's like the first time when we put the polymer on top so once again once you powder the the polyamide on on the design we're gonna cook it again i always try to like you know put it flat so because with the heat the design is going to curve a little bit so again we had to shake it and you know like cook it a little bit i found another way to if you don't have a heat gone you can press it for like five seconds but you have to put um you have to put like a um a sheet on top of the design like facing up and i just like press it for like five seconds but it's gonna be like the paper is gonna be like a special paper like some sort of uh like um i don't know how you could how you call it i'll find out and i'll put a comment on the on the bottom like to show you like what type of paper you have to use okay so over here you have your design you have to cook it like i said got to make sure that all the design is covered and the letters too you know because we wanted to make it look pretty nice we're gonna make it look professional and once you're done what we're gonna do we're gonna just cut around so because you can see the the square we are gonna use that okay so all right so we have it ready to press on our garment this is a shirt for my kit and this is the design as you can see i cut around so to get rid of the square now you have to place it wherever you wanna press it and you know like you're gonna press like like some other uh sublimation design that you do in my case i do it for 400 degrees uh i used 35 seconds and because 400 degrees is a lot you know and then after that just you have to let it cool off you have to let it cool off for a few or a couple minutes once it's cooled off we're gonna use some water cold water once it's cooled off we're gonna start like pressing a little bit on the design on the paper especially make sure that it's cold it's not hot and we're gonna start like putting some water like this okay we're gonna get the paper wet because in that way it's gonna be like more easy for us to remove it you're not gonna you know like peel the the paper and the letters are gonna come off so that's why it's very important that you uh take your time get it wet get it done right so put a little bit wider it doesn't matter if you get like some water on the shirt i mean it's gonna dry so don't worry about that so put a little water like on every single corner um this paper has a little as you can see look kind of blue so one time i was just like scrubbing it and the blue it was like coming off touch it make sure that it's feeling wet you know it's not hard this one is still hard so we're gonna put more water and like i said the blue i don't know as part of the paper it was like getting on the on the shirt so that's why i tried to be careful you just like put a little pressure um once it's all wet try to peel from one corner and if you feel like it's not coming off try to put a little bit more water don't rush the design because otherwise you're going to ruin and we don't want to do that so just like take your time put a little bit more water just like go easy with the design once it's all wet it's gonna be like so easy to peel it off and you're gonna see the paper there's not um ink on the paper all the ink is gonna be transferred to the to the shirt okay so it feels much better it's coming off uh little by little don't try to rush it okay coming up perfectly in this corner right here okay um okay okay this right here and don't try to rush it like i said just go easy one corner and another okay the letters you gotta be careful and there you go as you can see i got a little water on the shirt but that's nothing to worry about take a look at the design it looks good and the all the ink was transferred i'll show you that this is a 100 cotton let me show you right here i'll make sure that okay here we go 100 cotton oh let me get the light okay there you go 100 cotton sublimation with polyamide i mean it looks good pretty good it feels good it's not gonna wash away like some people were saying that if you do sublimation on cotton it's gonna wash away the only thing you have to find you can find the polyamide on etsy or ebay take a look at the design it looks pretty good pretty legit letters are perfect design is perfect and like i said i mean the poi i made you can find it on etsy or you can find it on ebay either way and it comes from powder all right guys thank you for watching hope you like this video subscribe if you have any comments

Now this is one of our favorite t-shirts by Next Level because it's a great price point and for just a little more than a hundred percent\nring-spun cotton offers a ton more softness. That 60/40 blend of polyester/cotton means it's gonna be so much softer than just a hundred percent ring-spun cotton t-shirt.\nStill offers a great fit, awesome colors. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model here, he's gonna come over and show it off. First thing you'll notice is just a\ngreat fit. It has this tailored side seam like all Next Level t-shirts have. So that means it's gonna naturally cut in and it's not going to be that boxy shirt we all grew up in. Next the neckline, the neckline is great 60/40 means it does have more stretch than a ring-spun cotton. It's just awesome because it's not gonna be tight on your neck. The sleeve length is also great it hits mid-bicep here, perfect dip right there. We love this shirt for so\nmany reasons. One of the other things about it is the colors, it comes in so many\ncool colors and as you can see it's a little heathered here. Meaning made of kind of speckles of different shades. That's signature to a blend because a blend is made of different fabric types, Cotton and Poly. So, with this we naturally recommend a vintage ink a thinner coat of ink, so that if we do a vintage white this blue color can come through just a little and make it look a little older, because the heather already looks a little aged, so that just plays off of it. We can always do a standard ink, do a bright white ink, but it's a little thicker.And this shirt is just so soft, so thin, it just moves with your body. Great length on the Next Level shirt too. Care instruction wise, you're not gonna have to worry about shrinking it. That polyester means that over the course of a lot of washes, it's not gonna pill. If you're ordering for volunteers or an event that needs to go on week after week after week or maybe\nit's your staff shirt this is a great step up. Go with this any day over a hundred\npercent ring-spun because it's gonna wear so much better over year or two. You're gonna love\nthis shirt! Tyler, you look awesome in it too! Tyler: \"Thank you.\" Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a three. Thanks for watching this video.

but they're not so let me tell you about the G 200 up next hey guys it's Melissa with shirt space so the G 200 is made up of a hundred percent preshrunk cost this of course makes it soft and less likely to shrink after its first wash the G 200 has what we call a classic fit it does not hug the body too much and is what some call boxy as the G 200 is a 6-ounce it will stand up to any wear and tear that you put it through this is a major difference compared to the G 500 which weighs in at five point three ounces and let's also talk about color the G 200 comes in sixty-two colors so you can definitely find something that will work for your print or a color that you'll like the G 200 is so similar to its close companion the G 500 slice we've set i recommend it as a work shirt a tee to print on and hand out at an event because of its body structure or just as a standard comfortable team as far as decoration for the G 200 it is similar to other 100% cotton tee if your screen printing on the G 200 water-based classes all in discharge are safe but some of the colors range in the hundred percent cotton category so make sure you check its specs before you print heat press on the G 200 is also great but like we always say make sure you check your heat settings before you give it a go oh and you embroidery folks you're also good to go thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn

"kMynC2jFrQw": "[Music] so hello tom with the father's workshop screen printing again and look we're back on part two remember part one we were basically dealing with uh the shirts and how much polyester was in the shirts on the 5050 on the bleaching that was going on what kind of shirts you would use because you see them bleaching and they're they're sublimating sublimating to it and as they sublimate to it [Music] is that a regular 100 cotton but well no they're using basically heather shirts that are a 50 50 blend 50 polyester 50 cotton what i said we were going to do in this episode we were are going to use a 100 percent cotton shirt i'll show you the shirt down here this shirt right here this is a 100 cotton this is the i will show you this is a gilded somebody buy me a camera because this thing is terrible but this is a 100 cotton because i bought it i know what it is and as a 100 cotton what we want to do we want to treat the cotton shirt with the poly t plus and no we're not a sponsor for poly t plus i know they get a plug every time we say it and um and it makes them look good so maybe they are to send me some of that stuff free but um what i'm going to do [Music] is we're going to spray the shirt we're going to saturate it roll it all that stuff that they say to do we're going to do that and prep the shirt so the shirt will be prepared and all ready so what we'll do we will print out our sublimation photo and when we do that we'll put it on the shirt now it's a black shirt so you know it's not going to show up very well at all you know to sublimate on a black shirt is a no-no because you don't have white uh in sublimation ink so you basically have to put a white background to sublimate on so they have a sublimation paper that you can sublimate on it's a process but you can submit it on it cuts it out and you'll have the picture on there with the white uh in in it but it's only the white because of the background so that's what brings it out so you can actually see it on on dark colors but here we've got this black one and we're gonna bleach this afterwards we'll bleach it like everybody else does but we'll do it a little different but we're going to bleach it and we'll see what the sublimation looks like now this is 100 cotton so if somebody says if you got a customer says hey look i want 100 cotton shirt can you do that on 100 cotton and they've got that picture that they want that is a lot of color now unless you've got your screen printing and your screens ready and um you know and you're going to you want to you wanna screen print this you can do it but you'll have to do it after you bleach it i don't know how bleach does on [Music] um on regular plastisols but we're going to use sublimation ink but what we're going to do we're going to treat the shirt first we're going to go ahead and get the resin in the five in the threads the poly polyester resin we're going to get it in the thread so when we put the sublimation photo on there it will look good you won't be able to see it looking good until you bleach it so the bleach is going to bring it out so you'll get to see what it looks like once we sublimate it with the picture and we look at it and say then but right now we're going to treat the shirt so what we want to do um let me get to give me just a minute and let me get to my roller and stuff and i'll be right back okay got my roller here it is this is the roller and what we'll do we'll spray it on the shirt and then we'll use the roller and we'll kind of uh make it you know roll it roll the stuff into the shirt i guess that kind of gets it on the fibers on the on the threads really well and soaks it gets that stuff on there so once we heat press it and i'll have to find the paperwork that tells me how long to heat press it i've got it right there i'm looking at it so i have to walk around the table again and go over there to get that so we'll be right back again okay now do you remember i have my handy dandy ruler and i have the instructions remember dads always read the instructions you know how you get the bicycles and stuff in and you think you can put it all together or remember remember when you ordered the wheel barrel and you tried to put it together and by the time you got done either you were short some screws or you did or you had a bunch of extra ones left over because you didn't put them where they were supposed to be so you found that your wheelbarrow fell apart because you didn't put them all in there like you're supposed to anyways let's um let's look at this these are the instructions to our poly so we're we're gonna we're gonna go through this and look at it and um it says we need to have our press set up to 3 30. uh we need to um [Music] okay so one were well okay we're supposed to mix our poly okay we got all that all that done i still got some in the container here i've already got all this stuff mixed up so i've got some in the container i mixed that up before so i don't know what the shelf life is on that but uh we'll find out um two preheat the press all right three um spray the shirt until damp use a foam roller to press poly t into the fibers okay so we're supposed to spray the shirt and then once we do that once it's into the fibers uh cover lower platen with then cotton material avoid moisture blah blah blah blah blah press light pressure 330 degrees for 30 seconds okay so we need to go for 30 seconds and that says do a second coat of poly t-plus the second coat does not need to be as heavy as the first um and then it says cover with parchment paper press 3 30 20 seconds um heat press temperature 385 degrees [Music] okay the heat press temperature and then 30 degrees to be sure the shirt is completely dry okay well let's do that let's go ahead and get this out of the way now we're applying all right now for you for y'all that don't know what i'm using the bottle is over there it's the polity polly it's the poly t plus um it is not the old poly this is the de-sizer in a separate bottle than the actual quality spray that was when they sold it to start out with and now they just have the polyt plus which has everything in it you just do the spray and you're done so what i'm gonna do here we go all right let's get this started [Music] [Music] we're going to work this in real good and this is getting this into the material that's why i'm using the roller this little piece of stuff is on there but we'll take that off [Music] once i get all this rolled into it real good but remember what we're doing we're putting this poly tea into it because this is going to put the poly resin we need on the material okay now we're going to spin remove this computer out of the way we're going to bring this around slide this back in there [Music] we're going to set this up [Music] then we're going to press it to [Music] let's just press it for 30 seconds and um i guess i should have set the timer for a little bit more because i don't have to set for eight seconds so [Music] 22 3 247 30 seconds now it looks like it needs to press a little longer because it still looks a little damp so i'm going to press it just a little bit longer get the moisture out of the shirt so go for [Music] okay all right that was 15 seconds okay [Music] now according to the instructions it says the second coat of poly tea the second coat does not need to be as heavy as the first and um one thing i didn't do i should have done is i should have used my parchment paper this is parchment paper i should have used parchment paper when i when i did that but i didn't but that's okay it didn't hurt nothing so what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and spray this again all right now we did not spray it as heavy as we did first time but we'll go ahead and roll it out [Music] do set the bottle of poly over [Music] now like i said this time it goes for 20 seconds yeah cover with parchment paper almost did it again so we'll put parchment paper on it i know some of y'all are going to carver's favorite parchment paper thank you for reminding me and here we go we will put this on here we'll go for 20 seconds that timer set at 12 seconds i thought it was 15 but it's [Music] 2 12. 17 18 19 20. all right [Music] and we want to make sure that that is [Music] dry sure that it's dry [Music] now i want to put this i also want our picture to be straight [Music] they put the picture on it y'all could quack quarkitated [Music] that looks like it might be straight and if it ain't well it just ain't all right now what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and print up we're going to print the sublimation photo have i got one yet nope but you know how it is on the magic of camera stop pause video editing stuff whatever i'll be right back okay we are printing the image right this very second i'm cleaning the nozzle head on the printer is the thing clogs up the craziest thing i know if you've got one of these um epson's 2750 wf 2750s that thing ain't done nothing but constantly fog that nozzle gets clogged up so if you're not printing on a regular basis uh that's the only thing i hate about it i'm going to get me a sawgrass eventually i'm gonna get me a sawgrass um one of those printers and um so if y'all feel sorry for me you can send me one if you want to i'll advertise it but um anyways that's the print i got out i'm gonna put gone fishing and um it's funny i can show that i'm looking at it in the in the camera i'm looking at it in the camera and it actually says gone fishing but it's a mirror image so i mirrored the image but actually it's backwards i guess when i show the video too it'll be backwards i'm looking in the background and i'm noticing all my shirts are back let me see yep even my face is backwards i'm standing on the left side of myself don't even realize it all right be right back okay we are back no we had to print up something and uh so we printed up gone fishing that's what i wish i could do to take my boat out there and get out there and catch me some fish speckled trout running old man's back of trout i like spaghetti i like collecting i just like fish i don't like sushi okay i don't eat raw fish i eat real fish hey raw is real and um you say well sushi has real fish now i'm talking about going out fillet them up i mean put them in the pan while they're still flopping so i'm talking about fresh anyways we're going to put this on the shirt now if you'll notice this is going to come out really dark on the shirt you're not going to be able to see it i'm going to be able to tell it very much but here's where the here's where all the trick comes in is when you bleach it then the white is going to show up and then the pit the picture of the fish is going to come out right now it don't look like a whole lot on this paper i don't know what it could look like on the shirt but we'll find out so let's uh let's wait and see you know what this looks like you know what the shirt looks like you know what i look like and uh let's go ahead and put it on the shirt and when we get done doing that what we'll do um because we've already treated the shirt we'll bleach it we're going to bleach it here in the building it's dark outside so i ain't got no sunlight everybody talks about you gotta do it in the sunlight you don't do the sunlight you're not going to walk well i guess we'll do it and we'll do it in the um [Music] we'll do it in our you know so let's uh let's press this thing [Music] okay so we're gonna find it i'm gonna put it on here let's find the spot we want to put it [Music] make sure it's right in the middle okay that should be good i don't know well here's what it looks like [Music] see it i don't see nothing so i don't know i don't see nothing i'm gonna put this over to the side i want to cut off [Music] my heat pressy [Music] and [Music] and [Music] see how that works [Music] [Music] okay we're still waiting on the bleach to do something being that it's inside it's not out in the sunlight it's going to take a lot longer to do so it's uh it's gonna take a little while but that's all right let's see what it looks like [Music] so you can see it's coming along and so the picture starts to get brighter as it gets wider so that's what we're waiting on so it'll take a little bit longer um it's also cold a little cool in here i just kept the heat back on that's what that noise is over there you hear that heater running i'm out here in our little studio shop and uh we'll get this going now i have used this this little roller put some bleach on it and went over the spot where this picture is at so it will kind of whiten it a little more but um i don't get these tapes over here but it's it's just cold in here and i don't think we're going to get any better than this and i don't want to keep the bleach on there too long bleach is not good for the material get these off there and if you don't like the little [Music] don't like the little piece of tape on there as far as the little stripes [Music] don't like them you can always blend them in a little bit [Music] put you some little marks across there [Music] blend them in with the shirt [Music] now we'll take this shirt we're going to put it over here and we just dropped it in our bucket of water that's a actually a bin with [Music] oh we got it in the water and [Music] now that we've done that we got it in the water um i guess it's best to do it during the daytime unfortunately i didn't have time this afternoon to be in the sunlight i was too busy out doing other stuff so maybe i going fishing you don't know that anyways i've got uh got him in the water and uh we tried that out um the pitcher did not come out as well as i wanted to i need to pull the printer head off my printer and clean it so we're going to try this again but anyways i think it looks pretty good it looks kind of um well they call it a distressed a distressed shirt a gone fishing distress shirt but it would be good to have that little clear because uh there's something about the black shirts of turn orange uh i guess and the thing that is the bleach that i'm using is old bleach and it looks like it's been separated because of the cold weather so so at least i didn't get all over me so we will do this again tomorrow when the sun's out and hopefully it's not raining but uh we're going to do another black shirt and we're going to i'm going to pull the print head off there tomorrow before we do the video and this will be part three so this is part two we did part one this is part two tomorrow we'll do part three and i won't load i'm gonna load this up tonight i'm gonna edit it and load it up tonight and let you see what we got and uh and then we're gonna do this again and uh let me let you see the shirt one more time i just squeezed the water out of it [Music] anyways [Music] so that's what you got on that i've got a lot of a lot of other ideas so it'll look like it's kind of straight right here like the piece of styrofoam got a piece of styrofoam under there you gotta be careful it doesn't take the shape of your [Music] so [Music] [Music] so and what's good about this i've got all this is basically neutralized and i just went over here and just did this corners kind of make it spread out but now i'm going to unneutralize it because i'm putting more bleach on again oh how about that [Music] till next time part three tomorrow lord bless [Music] you", "YBNjhuVgYFM": "what's up just Ali and as you know I am starting my own t-shirt company line merch whatever you want to call it caught my visual interpretation let's go ahead and get into what type of shirts of that boss so I am going through what's their name TSE apparel so I'm going through a wholesale company called TSE apparel and today I picked up some sample and I can already tell the difference in qual one of them's like a hashey black that's the Gildan and I don't appreciate that I'm gonna have my customers putting a lotion on their shirts I'm about to show y'all in one second we lay about let me lay them out for ya let me lay them out for ya okay so you can see the variations in the and black pusher turn the soft light off that back light you can definitely see the variations you've got Gildan you've got Bella canvas right here Bella canvas and then I also picked up a home brand Toltecs and as of right now just looking down I like these two better already out the gate because you can just tell the quality from looking at the shirts that you know they took their time they took the time this one this one's actually this is definitely going to be or I shouldn't even say a she is just it's just a different black a black that I can't appreciate right now um and what I'm going for with my brand is you know quality products because I can't be giving out no uh no lame stuff but off the camera this one is definitely darker this it goes darker this one and then this one but let me show you how they feel trying all Gildan first so trying on this shirt first I mean it's okay now I have no complaints as of right now it feels it feels fine I feel like maybe it might be a little bit each year but I mean it's not bad whatsoever it's not bad at all it feels good it's not riding up my arms I can it's good like me I mean that's good you thought you got to see some titties psych next is Bella canvas Bella canvas this one feels a little bit better this guilting was a little bit it's not I can't say it's itchy it's just different it's just a little bit different this one you can definitely tell they took their time with it the dyes I mean it just feels good I liked how the hello how come I have my own how the sleeves are it's not it's not tight it's not hugging too tight and by the way all of these are smalls I'm 5 2 and 1/3 ok I'm 5 to 130 so this is what it looks like I mean this is how it looks on me [Music] so this one as of right now between the two that I've already warned this one is definitely tough like I said the color is different the color you can definitely check tell the color colors apart this was deeper this one is like I said this is like an Ashley black this is Gildan Ashley black and right now I have on the belly canvas it's not getting into focus but this is the Toltec okay again this is a small this is a small not too bad I like the fields I like to feel I kind of I when it comes to the actual sleeves I like how Bella canvas and gilt it kind of wraps around and it's tight with this one this one's kind of loose it's not a bad thing it's definitely preference but I don't like I don't I like it to hug me hug me tell me how you really feel so my number one is Bella tall Tex and then the Gildan Gildan is okay I feel like I just feel like the Gildan it's just it's just it's just just this is just I don't know what I got to do to get that feel it like I said you gotta try these things on because it's one thing for somebody to tell you it's another thing for y'all actually feeling it on your skin this feels good like a bread my titties for tuning in this is the start of my visual interpretation support me I love y'all all the realest just a lead", "R3uSjyw92b8": "hello everyone today got something special for you and printing dye-sublimation on 100% cotton t-shirt so I've done it before the video hits about fifty five thousand eight so it's quite successful looks like a lot of you would like to know how to do it so there is another method is a couple more steps involved but it is quite good I like it so I'm keep watching so hurry up as I said to you I'm going to show you another way of printing on the cotton t-shirts is with the sublimation inks as well as the last minute I show you with that with the powder but this one involved a couple steps mark you're going to decide if you like it out now basically what we do is printing on on a sublimation printer with sublimation ink in my case I was a reco printer just simply print them to design in mirror on the sublimation paper and we're gonna print some polo shirt is 100% cotton as you can see I don't know if you can see it properly yes J hey let's crack on and see how it's done oh by the way before we start I show you what's going on basically what it is you need to put like a special pretreatment on the t-shirt there's lots of pretreatment is like a powder as I show you in one of my videos which hits about 35,000 of your song thanks very much um this one is in basically what it is is just a fits in a 3-4 months you can buy in the hundreds it's like a poly eight polyester sheets you can go wrong because the one side is a glossy is the one you apply on here and the other one as a logo printed on it so there's only one way to apply so it's quite easy so let me show you what steps are involved in it so so here we are this is a transport sublimation transfers smoke enlargement and this is a sublet cotton so what we need to do now we to trim to the size of a transfer so let me just grab that Jesus and let's see what sizes we need so need some kind of half of the ring very right always twist a little bit bigger than the transfer so that what is ready and we can use this crap for the smaller one okay as you can see slightly bit slightly larger are we going to apply this piece of polyester really because that's where it is it's called simply cotton I got it from Spain from company called blender oh I can really remember Philly so Spanish name anyway um please look in the description below the wind fellow the video so I will place the link when you can have it so if you want to test you can I wished folder a few sheets or whole pack it wasn't that expensive so okay so let's apply to the way to the polo shirt though so the press heat up to the correct temperature is 2000 total solid 210 centigrade for the 20 seconds and we need to apply there we need to apply the sob cotton is quite hot for the cotton so what you probably will do you probably will go yellow puff we have to say okay so here is the big transfer this is the big transfer so we put in transfer on the side and applying just the silicon so we'll place somewhere here so 210 centigrade for 20 seconds quite lots of steam moving this temperature I will wait just a couple seconds no more than freefall and try to remove there so become okay you're probably wondering how will you find the place when you put the sublet item you probably won't say it but you try to zoom in now you probably want to say but there there is a quite rough area now when all the fibers goes up so that's how I see when to when to apply there when to apply the transfer okay now we do the front I don't have a jig or nothing for the front so I just put it on the side to do the quick quickly so I do it this way here we go just make it flap and now we put the smaller table cut huh and again 20 seconds again quite a lot of steam and times up few more seconds let us do goes away and we peel in it straight away so now is when the fun should start begin I get to lower the temperature down for from 210 to down to 200 only where I'm going to rise the time from 20 seconds to 35 this is recommended by their by the seller so so I'm gonna do it as they want me to do just wait till the temperature drop and I'm going to bring their chest first okay temperature dropped so now we need to find the spot as I said these more rough area same pretty much same shape as this one is here roughly I hope I'm gonna hit the spot if not it's going to be embarrassing it doesn't really matter okay now I'll put some teflon sheet on it 200 degrees for 35 seconds times nearly up it's 200 centigrade so is really really hard nope oh I don't think I am heat this bot correctly no I keep this pod I don't think I have enough brusha because the color looks bit more beat door not too bad not too wet for the one of the first atoms you know this is the front and let's try the back again okay semester that's the bat let's find that the rough place yeah I can see a straight awake on the big one yes okay so definitely sheets again off we go yeah it's much better much much better but you remember when I mentioned the rough the rough fabric so all you can do you can just put some different sheets over again the clear price you know let's review that result so I'm back on my chair now with the Palo in my hand and as I said it's not as vivid as I wanted here we go this is the result this is the front and this is the back this is the back I looked closely closely into it is very acceptable results by the way is nice but I never done the pollo again with this method just a tight wave cotton cotton t-shirts and I was looking really nice the problem with the companies and sorrow with will the Cottenham Paulo is their wave it was a tiny little house like this I don't know what would you call it but you stop perfectly smooth so that's where the ink didn't go to so that's why either you look big fate it's not actually fine he didn't the ink didn't fill out all those little house so is more testing so more testing needs to be done on those maybe maybe writer writes the time or temperature or something but in the one thing that I don't really like that matter for this method is is the temperature used temperature used for this method was like oh well over 200 degrees so but if you ever printed a cotton above one 170 or maybe 175 180 you will now that if you live in for a little bit too long just go yellow this one is not too bad I'm sure that yellow goes away with first wash by again you don't want to show that to the test of so so in general the method is great is cheap so cheap cheap cotton t-shirts cheap subway Cottenham polyester sheets and you can have a nice nice dish it's done because it is quite a few steps involved I'm not sure if this is for everyone and this is for the mass production but if you want to just one or two loves no problem so as I said we need to do more testing so see you soon", "pPCYhGCQ418": "hey y'all it's Betsy from cuttin corners vinyl in Natal in Texas and today is craft Smith season 2 episode 4 and we are going to go over how to DIY bleach dye a shirt and then put a one color graphic on it now I'm going to give you all the instructions pretty much from start to finish but remember with crafts maasai don't show you all the cutting procedures if you need to know that look back at my Cricut or silhouette tutorials or brother scan and cut I give you all the instructions over there now give me a moment and I'll show you how I bleach my shirts [Music] [Applause] so as you can see I have a piece of coroplast and a mustard Bella in canvas shirt now the first thing I'm going to do to do this bleach shirt is I'm going to take and place my shirt over my coroplast you can use cardboard if you've got it I just like to use plastic for it because it seems to make it a little bit where the bleach doesn't absorb into the paper and kind of keeps the bleach a little bit more where I want it so I'm just taking and putting this on and if you can hear the air conditioner I'm sorry but it's hot so I run my AC there we go okay so as you can see I have it loaded on to the cardboard now the first thing that we want to do is now that we have it all smoothed out it's going to decide on how we're wanting our design are we wanting to just bleach the bottom half of this chart which you can easily do are we wanting to bleach a center circle which is what I'm wanting to do but then we want splatters other places I am using the Clorox cleanup spray with bleach this makes it a little bit simpler instead of worrying about a actual bleach bottle so what I'm going to do is start making my circular pattern now this is not an exact science so each one is unique when you do it like this which is part of the fun of doing it so as you can see I have a pretty equal circular design with a little bit of overspray where we're going to get a few extra bleach spots now I'm going to take and stand a little bit further away with my bleach bottle about two feet from it and just kind of spritz all the other places to kind of give it that unique bleached love [Music] okey-dokey so now that my shirt has all the bleach on it I'm going to let it sit till I reach the desired whiteness that I want so and once that happens then I'll wash the shirt but as of right now we're going to leave it alone just like it is and let it set for a little bit and then we'll come back to it so as you can see this is what the shirt looks like at this point you can see that it is bleached out this color to more of a pale yellow and then on the spots that are completely dry they are white now this is still damp so I'll probably let it set till it's completely dry and then throw it through the washing machine but I wanted you to see at this progress because I won't get to film this again till it's washed and dry now to remember this that if you are applying vinyl over this shirt you are going to want to wash it with regular washing detergent with no fabric softener so if you're using the pods don't use the pots because fabric softener will mess with the adhesion of your vinyl so this is what it looks like at this point and this belt in canvas that I am using is a hundred percent cotton so it may take longer to achieve this shade of lightness if you are using a 50-50 shirt it may take less time I've only worked with 100% cotton doing this bleaching method but as you can see we have a nice spot to be able to put a design on and it has this really unique look to it this is what the t-shirt looks like after it's been washed and dried with the bleach spray used on it now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and line it up just like I would any other shirt on my steady Betty with the collar off and the tag let's make that down just a little bit there we go and the shoulder seams even now one thing I am gonna do that I normally don't because it to me it's not really necessary but because this has been washed and dried I want to iron out the wrinkles so I'm just taking my easy press which is preheated to 332 Gries for 15 seconds but this is such an easy thing to do and we'll take and make you a lot of money now I'm using my 15 inch t-shirt guide lined up with the edges of my study buddy which my study buddy is a 15 by 24 inch and that's why I use the 15 inch now I'm taking my design folding it with the sticky side out and giving myself a crease now I'm going to load that Center crease mark up on my t-shirt guide and use about three fingers to measure down now this file is available on my patron for $10 or more patreon patreon supporters or you can purchase it from my website same thing with the vinyl I am using the brown glitter flecks ultra so we're just going to hold this on this section for 15 seconds and then on the other section for 15 seconds at 330 degrees now this process is mainly to show you the glitter process not the glitter process with the bleaching process but I wanted to show you how cute you could make these and this is something that is so popular right now you could make a whole lot of money selling these okay there we go now I'm going to take and remove my clear backing off of here perfect cover it again with my Teflon sheet 15 seconds on each side because again my ez press is 9 inches by 9 inches if you have a 12 inch you wouldn't need to do this you could do your whole design because this design is cut at 10 and a half inches wide there we go okay turn that off look how good that looks with just one simple color and you can see that that bleach process really did work out well for this shirt now give me a moment we'll go over everything that we've done there are a couple of things to remember about when you are bleaching this shirt I always wash and dry mine you don't have to but remember if you put too much bleach it can't eat holes into your shirt that's why I recommend washing and drying and whenever you wash them you can use soap but do not use anything that has fabric softener in it it will mess with the adhesion of your vinyl but I love how this turned out and I know this week's been a lot of shirts and there will be another one tomorrow because we're doing our crafting for Disney we're throwing those in with our craftsmen to kind of keep things moving along but just remember it's not all about shirts but this is such a cool process and it's so popular right now I wanted to make sure to show it to you now remember if you like this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up don't forget to hit the subscribe

"V9mXnHViDUY": "welcome back to maddie bugs creations channel and i'm megan and i'm grateful to everybody that watched my first video on how to make the poly tea a spray and i am back with another episode on how to actually use this poly tea spray that we made in the very first video that i made if you've missed it you can go back and watch it still have just a little bit left i'm going to show you guys how to put this on first after before not after but before we do that i'm going to show you this shirt that i made for my son and i went ahead and i washed it three times in the washer to show you how well this poly tea spray that i make holds up there as you can see there's no fading or anything on this shirt it looks just how it looks just like how i had um printed it or he pressed it or whatever you want to say so this poly tea spray i believe is like the magic to sublimating on cotton besides having to go out and buy um all polyester and a lot of people like the cotton fill better than they do the polyester fill all right so i'm going to show you guys how to put this on this shirt if i don't break my tripod because all right so here's the shirt which is a little kids shirt that i'm gonna do tripod keeps breaking okay so the trick is not to put too much on this shirt because if you put too much on this shirt it will turn yellow all right so what you want to do is you want to lay the shirt flat and you want to spray just a little bit over where you're going to put it you want to spray until it is completely wet you don't want to over saturate it so if you over saturate it it will turn yellow on you so like three or four sprays with this mister now if you have something that's not a mister you might have to do it like seven times but as long as the whole part is wet the image will stay on there now i have already went ahead and did another shirt that i've already sprayed down that i have underneath my heat press over here that i'm going to show you what it looks like after it is heat pressed on let's see my cute little design it says no more chicken nuggets or chicken nuggies i'm just going to lay that down there on my shirt that already has the poly tea spray on it because it has to dry you have to let it fully dry before you put your sublimation on it because if you do not then it will smear and it will it just look really bad the image will look real bad so i'm gonna go ahead and heat press this and show you what image looks like after it and when i put my heat press on is 350 and i put it down for 40 seconds on this particular shirt well actually i do it on all my shirts and i believe that that is the best setting for my heat press because everything seems to come out more vibrant and better if i put it on too much then i usually end up having yellowing of my shirt and the shirt just doesn't it's hard to get that yellowing out even if you use peroxide for me it is so let's see all right lift it up move that and we move our image and voila no more cheeky nuggets yeah let's get some stuff on it anyway move this back just a little bit all right i think you just got included all right so this is what the shirt looks like after it's been pressed still as vibrant as the one that i showed you after it had already been washed three times and this shirt was already brown like that i was practicing with my bleaching um so if you all if you all like videos like this or if you need any more visual effects on t-shirts because i love doing t-shirts um please like and subscribe my video and leave a comment down below and i for for ideas that she would like to see done or anything that you all would like to see done and i will do it and i'll show you how it's done thank you for watching and please like and subscribe my

here feels like it or not with everything going on in the world currently I mean literally summer solstice is one week away from the date this video is going live but anyway into the am sent me some of their teas from the relatively new branded basic collections and we're going to be checking them out I'm actually pretty excited to be doing so because I actually ordered a few of these a couple weeks ago and I've been waiting for a time to open them up so we're gonna look at these ones as well let's start off with the black basics tea we have right here um let's go ahead and just open the stuff first toss it to the side and reveal your tea right here the brain to basics come in two different types of fabrics these t-shirts have a 60-40 poly cotton blends the same exact materials as they use as their graphic tees again pretty basic tee notice no into the am logo on the back there the only logo you got is this one right here so there is your black one let's go ahead and crack open the charcoal one now which again is pretty much going to be the hot sticky same exact type of t-shirt here but here is your charcoal looking one has a little bit of a nice texture to it that I'm pretty fond of both of these are fitting as expected which is great I mean they fit well snug in the arms I don't know what it is about all the charcoal tees but they feel like they're way softer than the other ones and I love them and yeah there are 12 total colors of the poly cotton tees you got this the black one and this charcoal one and you'll be seeing two other of them at the end of this video moving on to the other fabric we have here this one I believe the dark gene or dumped called blue gene one and this is their their other fabric which oh yeah first first impressions here is definitely a different type of fabric go ahead and take a good look at that these 100% cotton ones fit a little bit different than the poly blend they're a little bit more looser all around in the material feels a bit more coarse from a regular cotton t-shirt but compared to like a normal Hanes t-shirts first thing that comes to mind one where I think hunter sent poly or 100% cotton it's definitely a thinner material and it's a little bit more I don't know soft sort a little smoother than the typical 100% cotton shirt but still fit well and fit much better than a lot of the 100% cotton shirts that I own I would definitely prefer this over host now last but not least we have the this one the ocean color it's a sticker no fee yeah the poly blend one didn't come with a sticker these two come with the sticker so I don't know if that was intentional or not but this is the ocean one it's a nice ocean blue is actually pretty fond of this color here oh I think I liked the ocean one a lot better than the blue-jean one if I'm gonna be honest um but one of the other thing I wanted to mention is these this material is not as stretchy as the poly cotton which is to be expected with the poly cotton ones I was able to easily put this over with my hat on these ones the the neckline like it didn't stretch as far and I was having trouble do with that because it is 100% cotton but these are understand cotton ones come in for total colors there's two other colors in this one I think there's charcoal in green is the other one the nice big bright green the charcoal one it's like a charcoal light grayish type of color now before we end the video I do have my two other ones here that I'm gonna open up real quick BAM I magically open them up I'm not gonna throw these on because I don't want to it's more than I have to but here is the purple one same exact concept going on there's not much else to talk about them here it's a basic t-shirt and then that here is the white one oh just a little bit more oh no I just realized the lab Mike I had under here fell down and wasn't pointing in the right direction so I apologize if that audio sounded weird or I don't know how long that was but uh yeah feels like the same material as this tee right here I don't have a like playing white t-shirt to wear at all that's why I wanted to get a plain white t-shirt so there are your branded basic tees you guys are interested in getting any of these they currently have a promo going on where you can get three of them for 40 bucks I think normally they're like 15 apiece you

I\u2019m five-eleven and this\nis the American Apparel two thousand and one (2001) a hundred percent ring-spun jersey cotton t-shirt size small.  So first off, this t-shirt is an American Apparel, a name you can trust for the fit and the fabric.  It\u2019s a hundred percent ring-spun jersey cotton; it\u2019s soft. The thing of this, it won\u2019t shrink; people ask, but it won\u2019t. A slim\nfit; notice that this t-shirt does not have a seam. It\u2019s seamless, but it still has\nthat slim fit that you love. The great sleeve length. Everything about this shirt, I love\nit, it fits great.  As the founder of Coed Monkey, I want to personally thank you for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any questions, because our goal is offering you the best printed product, and the best customer service in the entire industry. And we can\u2019t wait to make you look amazing in your custom printed t-shirts.", "p6PMvht5z6k": "\u200bToday we're talking about the American\nApparel 2001 100% Ring Spun Cotton Fine Jersey t-shirt. Now this t-shirt is the t-shirt that\nstarted the entire soft t-shirt revolution. I say that because this was the first shirt\nto be soft. Back in the day, it's hard to believe, but we all grew up with shirts that\nwere stiff. It felt like you were wearing cardboard. This was the first shirt to actually\ncome out and offer a soft fabric, and not only a soft fabric, but a great fit, tailored\nfit. \u200bAs we talk about this here today, just\nthink about that. It dates the shirt a little, and it makes it one of our favorite shirts.\nInstead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models coming over and going\nto talk about this on him. \u200bYou can see, right away you're going to\nnote this side here there is no side seam on the side because it's perfect for this\nwrap logo. This is only one of the only unisex t-shirts, besides our 100% cotton t-shirt,\nbottom of the line, standard economical t-shirts that doesn't have a side seam, so perfect\nif you need a wrap. \u200bThe next thing you're going to notice though\nis though it does have a great fit, it's not boxy, because this shirt, although it is one\nbig wind, it's one fabric, it doesn't have that boxy feel. Love that about this shirt.\n\u200bThe neckline is standard crew neck length here, the sleeves, mid to high bicep, awesome\nplacement here, very flattering, great statement shirt. 100% ring spun fine jersey t-shirt\nmaterial. This shirt breathes great, feels great.\n\u200bIn terms of the price point, it's a little more expensive than the Next Level and Canvas\n100% ring spun, and just that top of the line 100% ring spun material. If you're getting\nthis, you know you're getting the top of the line 100% cotton, made in America as all American\nApparel is. We love this shirt, it comes in a ton of colors, also comes in a comparable\nladies style if you're looking for companion style. If you have a big group of people that\nwant to order ladies and unisex, this is your shirt to go with.\n\u200bAlso, if you're thinking about care instructions, we're talking 100% ring spun cotton here.\nOver the course of its life, we're talking a year, two years down the line, it could\nstart pilling. 100% cotton, we always like giving that disclaimer that if you're going\nto dry this thing on high every wash, it could start shrinking, or just distorting. We don't\nrecommend washing it and drying it on high temperatures. Keep it on low to mid, and it's\ngoing to last a lot longer. \u200bIf you are looking to order for a staff\nat your business or restaurant, or volunteer organization that they're going to wear on\nweek after week, definitely bump it up to the 50/50 or 50/25/25 blend, it's going to\nlast a lot longer. \u200bAs you can see, it fits great, it feels\ngreat, we love this shirt for so many reasons, and I guarantee when you try it on, when you\nexperience this, just like I literally think millions of people have done since the early\n2000's, you'll know why this one t-shirt started the entire soft t-shirt revolution. You're\ngoing to love it, Tyler you look amazing in it, thank you. \u200bOn the Coed Monkey soft scale, we rate this t-shirt a 2. Thanks for watching this\nvideo, please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, soft\nmatters, and so do our customers.", "VnJhfy7R2wE": "today we're talking about the next level lady is 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt now this is our go to lady style t-shirt one because of the price - because of the fabric the fit everything about this shirt is great for large groups instead of just telling you though I do have Maia coming over she's gonna show this off first thing you'll notice is great fit first because this side seam here now that means it's going to naturally hug your curves any lady shirt shouldn't be baggy like a unisex style it should naturally hug and this sure does that the next thing you'll notice is the neckline here it's a little lower than the American Apparel 100% ladies neckline the American Apparel is a little tighter this does offer a little more breathability so if you're looking for a hundred percent ring-spun cotton ladies t-shirt this is our go to it also it's a better price point than the American Apparel ladies hundred percent the other thing you're gonna see is just the sleeve length flattering it hits you right at the right part of the arm not too high not too low fits great feels great hundred percent ring-spun means that basically if you're thinking about sizing we do suggest maybe getting one size up so normally Maia would wear maybe like a small but in this we have her in a medium today just because with that cotton and just doesn't stretch as much so that's one thing to note with this if you order familiar drew sometimes err on the side of bigger because it's never fun to get a shirt good with this though we recommend any type of our eggs vintage or standard vintage being the lighter ink coat standard being a normal print a little thicker ink to make it pop but with this also comes in two 100% ring-spun this is a heathered garment and athletic gray meaning at any time we have a heathered means this could be 90 10 90 cotton poly which just means it's gonna have a little more stretch but still offers kind of that more snug fit great shirt overall one of our best selling ladies shirts and you can see why great price point great fit the neckline is awesome everything about it might look awesome in it I'm a co-ed monkey soft scale we rate this t-shirt a - thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at co-ed monkey soft matters and so do our customers", "Vbfj6TyMwY4": "hi guys it's Krystal welcome back to my channel so this is going to be the design that we're gonna be using today I've already printed it out using my Sawgrass SG 400 that's the sublimation printer I use now I've had people ask me if you could use a regular printer and you cannot I'll insert a picture of it somewhere in here so you guys can see which one I'm using I've got tons of videos on it so I've already printed out my design is ready to go the paper I use as Tex print are I'm going to be using my Cricut ten by twelve quick and easy press today for the design so we're gonna be using that and I'm gonna be using my 14 by 14 polka dot mat as well and then the shirts that I'm using these are the Gildan so when you first get them they look like this I'm gonna be doing the bleach method today and this is how they look when you first purchase them they are Gildan soft style ring-spun so they look just like this okay I'll have a link down below where i order my shirts I'm not affiliated anyway but they are super fast and that's just where I order them these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton as well as they are color you want to stick with like a light color a high polyester count so this is the ones that I'm using today they look like this when you first start out so you can put it on here and it will look super cute if you want to do what's popular right now and do the bleach method this is how they're going to look now I've done a video already showing you how to do this but I've actually changed the way that I'm bleaching these now so I actually don't even do it that way now so what I do and I'll just tell you really quickly and then I'll actually do an updated video very very soon so the way that I do this is I just put a hanger on it like normal I go and hang it outside on a tree like a small tree like a little branch you could be doing this um you can use like those those clothes racks that you get at Walmart that you know those little metal racks you could use those you could get them as cheap as like eight dollars I think 810 dollars so you get one of those clothes racks hang it on there so what I do is I have it on the hanger I hang it on a tree branch where I can reach it obviously and then I take a a bleach bottle like I did before and then I just lightly spray in this area and then I kind of spritz here and there just to get like these little spritz marks here I'll change the dial on my spritzer so it'll have a straight stream and then that's how I kind of get some of these spots like this so this is what the bottom of the t-shirt looks like just like this and then the top part where the design goes that's what a lot of people are doing just like this and then on the backside since it's hanging from the tree I'm not a lot of the bleach comes through there so it's just ro bite and then I took my spritzer and just kind of went like this with the sprays and that's how I came out with this really cool effect so it's super cute on the back love it but it's set out there I let it set out there and kind of dry just a little bit then I brought it inside now if you're doing a ton of these you don't have to do this stuff but this is what I did I brought it inside hung it up and then use my blow dryer to dry them really quick I like the ones with the attachments like this so where you have them on here so it gives it a nice string that's straight in my spot I always talk about that and then I just go you could use like a heat gun and stuff just don't get too too close so you're just gonna use your hairdryer I go over the whole shirt drying it really quickly and what that does is it intensifies the bleach and really helps bleach this out so I found it the best way and then when I'm done I take it over to my sink and I rinse it with cold cold water rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse until I know all the bleach is out I add just a little dot of the Dawn dishwashing detergent just a dot and then I just kind of wash it at my sink it's wet like this really well rinsing and washing and kind of carefully gently going like this until it's completely rinsed out there's no more soap bubbles and then I ring it and ring it ring it gently because I'm not want to get crazy just spots like this and I'm kind of pushing any water out like this as much as I can and then I just throw it the dryer just like that because it's clean I did the Dawn dish soap and everything so then I just throw it in the dryer with some towels or something and it's good to go that's how I'm doing mine like I said I will do an updated video very soon but I wanted to throw that out there just so you guys had that okay so let's get going so I've got my Cricut easy press on 350 for 60 seconds any taking my 14 by 14 mats I'm gonna get that down here you're gonna want to protect that surface with some butcher paper and then I'm gonna go ahead and get down my t-shirt get that up here like so take your lint roller and go over the entire shirt to make sure there's no lint especially if you put it in there with some towels probably bad but that's what I do so definitely go over it with a lint roller make sure you get off any lint and that's gonna avoid those little blue dots that you'll get okay so our t-shirts ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and pre-press it really fast to get out any moisture just like that so just pull down any moisture that was remaining and now we're ready to go so what I like to do is take my design here and I'm gonna fold it in half obviously it's not from the paper to paper it's right here so I'm gonna just I get it like this fold it in half where I can see my design I'm gonna line those up make sure my papers up here at the top make sure those are lined up and I'm gonna get a crease so that way I know where my Center is up go ahead and take my Cricut ruler that I've talked about before today I'm do it using these six by 26 looks good I've got it even up there at the top then I'm gonna go ahead and take my design we're gonna put it upside down I'm gonna line up that crease mark just getting that right up there at the top like so all right I'm gonna go ahead and take some heat transfer tape you can either get it from Amazon and rolls like this you can also get it from Cricut or you can pick it up at Michael's or Cricut calm I'll have it both of these linked down below so just gonna go ahead and give me some heat transfer tape like this and cut that down and I'm gonna get one on each side so I'm just gonna go ahead and get one here and one here all right so we're ready to go now that I've got this down all I'm gonna do is take a piece of butcher paper on top I will have this link below as well I buy the big rolls of this from heat press nation so now we're ready so we're gonna do is 350 for 60 seconds and you want to keep it as still as possible all right so very carefully we don't lift this up we're gonna go ahead and pull off our butcher paper all right so I'm going to go ahead and peel up our design just like that super cute don't worry about this right here so it looks like it burned the shirt so this will actually wash out whenever you go to do it I don't know what it is between this and the bleach I actually have it do this to me earlier and all I did was take it over to the sink just to double-check it would come out and it did so I took it over to the sink washed this out thing between the bleach and the press but like I said once I wash this it did come right out so don't worry about it at all so I'm gonna go ahead and go wash this really fast I'm gonna come back as soon as it's dry and show you guys that this is just gonna come right back out we wouldn't do that really quick and I will be right I am back so it felt seconds for you but it was about an hour or so for me so I washed the t-shirt and it completely came out I don't know why it does that I think it's some sort of chemical reaction with that bleach that it does it but it's not stained it will come out so if you guys do this where you bleach it first and then you put this on make sure you wash the t-shirt bleach it wash the t-shirt and then do it but even when you do that if it does that like I said it's some sort of chemical reaction but when you go wash this it's gonna completely come out what I do is I take it over to the sink again add a little bit of that Dawn dish soap and I brought the t-shirt together very carefully rubbing like this all the way around and then I wash wash wash in the sink wring it out and then I threw it back in the dryer now I probably could have just thrown this into the wash and it would have just done it on its own that way but since I was kind of quick for the video I did it that way so if you need to do it that way as well you can I just put a little bit darkness up like I said just one dog and then I moved it around the shirt and kind of wash while I was already wet and then just rinsed all the way around and like I said I don't know why it does that but it has to be some sort of chemical reaction now it's only gonna do that obviously if you bleach the shirt and then do it so if you do like we did before we use sublimate and then bleach the shirt you're not gonna have these issues at all you don't want to fuss with that I would definitely recommend that you go ahead and sublimate your t-shirt for first and then do the and then do the bleach because it's going to come out the same either way but you're not going to have to fuss with the extra steps of washing it again cute like I said I absolutely love the bleach effect this is what the back side of the t-shirt looks like it's super adorable I love it so I hope you guys enjoy this I hope you guys found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "LLCb4hjFWPs": "you guys I'm going to be extra truthful today my biggest pet peeve is when my t-shirt shrinks after washing it it really can turn my day upside down but why does this happen let's get into it [Music] hey guys it's Melissa a shirt space so the shrinkage in the tee can be caused by a couple of things first it could be the way you wash it but the second can be if a shirt is preshrunk or not so let's get into that what does preshrunk actually mean the term preshrunk mostly speaks for itself but there are a few factors to be aware of so I took notes to make sure I get this right preshrunk doesn't necessarily mean that the t-shirt manufacturer washes every single garment instead it refers to the garment being put through a machine that pushes or compacts the fibers tightly together this process condenses the fabric by removing the spaces in between the stitches as a way of replicating the shrinking process in doing this the garment has been pre shrunk and will shrink less when being put through the traditional washing and drying process now let's be real I couldn't have memorized all of that point number two having a pre shrunk shirt doesn't always mean the shirt won't shrink further most fabric will shrink on average three to seven percent so you won't typically notice but there will always be some additional minimal shrinkage to be where bottom line is preshrunk implies that the shirt will no longer string but what is actually the case is it will just reduce the amount of shrinkage thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn more about preshrunk

worlds are colliding today in our review we're going to be checking out the travis scott mcdonald's merch and the 100 recycled made usa noah t hey hey look it's above me want me to answer all of your questions but it's above me now some of my followers may know mcdonald's is just place i love going to go there all the time mainly because i'm super broke i mean not that bad but i want to save my money for other stuff you know some different things and that mailman salary you know it's not that high you know you don't make a whole lot of money being a usps male delivery person which that's what i'm doing right now i am painting shirts that's why i got the noah shirts those 100 recyclable check those out i want to paint on those like i painted on this one this is my most recent you guys like that graphic got a bunch of detail in there and then with my noah tees i'm going to make them real crisp i've been letting the paint kind of bleed around the edges on these organic tees that i've been using got a couple i've painted over here but anyways uh let's break into these travis shirts because you know there's a bunch of cactus jack fans out there we're gonna check them out one at a time let's see oh this is the cactus mac shirt that one actually sold out pretty quickly or they just took it off the website i don't know and then we have our action figure on the back shirt and then we have our action figure on the front jack smile t-shirt too what is this one action figure series t okay so just comes in this shipping bag with a paper receipt and then all of them are totally sealed in their plastic all of them are size large oh wait this one's a medium this one's a large this one's a large i got one medium and two larges okay well this channel's purpose right now anyways the main focus is to check out some dope street wear some hype street wear brands and things like that some ethical streetwear is what i'm getting been trying to get into more so make sure you subscribe hit that like button for me and we'll check out the stickers on this plastic here there's that medium-sized one and we got the two large t's right there and then on the back there's a bunch of warning information they're all the same but yeah this has been written over and over and over again there and so i'm actually probably most excited for this purplish colored one it's kind of purplish right it's called berry i mean it's kind of a cool tie-dye name for it if you call this tie-dye i guess i will call it tie-dye yeah definitely here is cactus jack size large he does have a bunch of puff print all over here it's kind of a mix so you got this uh elephant print back here that doesn't really have much print to it but the jack on here loads of it and then you can't even read the cactus because his action figure is over top of it but under here it says cactus tell him jack sent you there we go and then we have our giant cactus jack whoa come on and then we have our giant cactus jack logo on the back here all in puff print barely legible because they like did a bunch of effects to it to make it really blotchy or whatever so you can kind of tell that this k is amazing that's a great k i gotta say or what about this s down here look at that s just a mean come on and this u easily you can tell that to you right i can't quit hating on what they did with that logo but it's kind of cool how they just kind of meshed it up there and then what do you think about this bluish turquoise color against this berry purple do you like that color combination there i don't know it's not too bad they seem like inverted colors and then on here you have this lime yellowish green lots of yellow in this lime green but then you can tell it's not quite yellow because the orange in this mcdonald's this yellow in here this orange really makes you see that this other text has a little bit of green tint to it yeah they went for a lot of 90s vibes with this tee you can really tell with that scribbling down there that's really common in the 90s in this elephant print obviously as well and yeah so enough talk let's look at the tag on the back of the neck there it is coming up for you this one here is a size large it's a standard size large american standard size large nothing special i ordered a bunch of these tees and uh just gonna start painting them you guys can order them from me for sure so just reach out to me tell me you want a tea created with my with my current uh expression of art put a couple colors together and get you sent out that team let's check how the travis scott large fits comparatively and yeah i feel like this one fits basically the same basically exactly the same as that last t i was just wearing what do you guys think you guys think they're about the same size i would say this is just a standard size large american maybe a little bit longer but i mean a quarter of an inch or something that could vary from piece to piece and you got the back graphic on there as well being loud and bold colors are all over the place and yeah let's get into these organic or 100 recycled cotton tees repurposed cotton looks like noah is not doing any additional packaging in here to keep the t-shirts free of any dust or debris that might get inside the bag these ones i did buy size extra large for seed and so yeah no plastic on these ones they just come out with their tag on there and yeah this cotton it actually doesn't feel too terrible it does have markings on it just like some little markings here and there because uh they didn't put any plastic they just put it in the shipping bag and i don't know you can't really tell that much but there's definitely some dirt yeah so this tea definitely feels really rough you can see a lot of texture in there there's some variation to how this looks it's super pilly already it's got little black specks all over a few little pilly black specks here and there and you do have the noaa logo down at the bottom corner right down there bottom left and then up at the top i'll zoom in for your tag here you guys can check this tag out there it is just safety pinned on we got this logo here and on the inside left you do have this wash tag yeah so there's a little bit of a message on the bottom of this noah t very sad message but you know sometimes truth hurts it says at least 40 million pounds of plastic has accumulated and is floating in the north pacific ocean so this tea is trying to help reverse that the noaa brand is really trying to help reverse that that's probably the main reason why in here they did not put any plastic casing on anything oh look a sticker here we go we got a sticker and it is a transparent one i think it's a transparent sticker whoa is there two stickers here there's totally two stickers here yeah hey they're almost stuck together got two noah stickers yeah this snow brand is just headed in a great direction a direction i myself i'm really trying to head towards i know i'm still kind of torn i'm still kind of in two different worlds with trying to have ethical street wear and then also you know the hype streetwear that has really drawn me into the whole culture and even educated me on a lot of things and really opened my mind to discover different truths that are basically things that i thought were true but ended up just being false or just being a theory there's a lot of theories out there things that can't be proven a lot of people are taking as a hundred percent truth really what i want to get back to is just caring about every single living thing or when i get to i don't think the world has ever been in a place where it cares about every living thing maybe i mean i tend to think a lot of the indigenous people of the americas were very conscious about the earth and about each other and and respect and things like that then humans had to come in and do what they do best and you know whoever is the dominant figure their way of life wins out so really that's something we can be conscious about all the time just be thinking about our footprint what are we doing how are we leaving this earth what are some practical steps we can individually take to just make this world a better place make it a more joyful place and just make it so that we can flourish as a society without taking advantage of other species of life out here on this planet and so that's basically my positive message for today just really want us to be conscious every single decision matters everything you say even matters you know i'll be debating with my family about different religious things i'm really into theology and philosophy and they're really strict and convinced of the status quo christian but then i'm more questioning all these structured things that christianity has laid out and i'm just not falling for him anymore i just i just think it was set up for governments to be able to rule people and to create complying citizens and i'm complying yes i mean i'm an artist i'm just out there i change things up i want things to be different so anyways let me know what you think about this e-conscious shirt this organic cotton tee that i painted up here with that graphic you know the continents the whole earth matters right and then also if you were into the cactus jack and mcdonald's gear i have more stuff coming i don't know if any of you guys got the email but i definitely did i got the email from travis saying that it's going to be like three and four weeks further out than was originally expected it's just yeah it's going to take forever apparently i guess they're just blaming it on coven that's what you gotta do just blame everything on call of it because it's making everybody slow down and making businesses timelines all messed up i mean i'm currently working on trying to get a trademark and then i'm going to get a utility patent and then the design patent because me and abby i told you guys a few weeks ago if anybody's been following that we've been working on a special project or i've been working on a special project with her and we put a lot of time effort energy into that creating this baby of ours we invented a really cool game that you play at the table not on a computer it's kind of vintage right but uh hopefully once i get the trademark done i can show it to you guys i'll have my patent pending i can start selling it and just have different people be playing this game it's really fun i really enjoy it i brought it over to a ton of different people's houses and i played it a bunch with them they all really love it they want me to market it so i'm going to go after it and we'll see what happens i mean i just want to spread joy and some cheer to people and i feel like playing a game with your family definitely has a possibility or potential of springing up some joyce bringing up some happiness i mean that's why people play games just uh just

pain we did some surfs the other day that I've been recording us you know but we did some search using it the other day they came our purpose so amazing search for collaboration I got coming on the way if you look at the Instagram twelve out apparently even see the collaboration when I presumably serves to my guy Isaac Turner school um and I was secure back this camera up and I'm just happy for

have about 35,000 pins in my my account and many boards and one that caught my eye a few months ago and I've been wanting to do it and show you guys is how to turn a stiff shirt this one is very stiff into one of those soft vintage feel like this one this is so soft it's like a baby's blanket this is my son Jonathon shirt now my boys my boys love to wear t-shirts and they tend to go to like the character t-shirts like these are Batman Marvel Comics and all that stuff because of the way it's made a lot of these shirts are very soft and vintage looking and so when they wear it specially here where we live during the summertime it goes up to like 90 95 degrees it's very hot it's very humid they don't want to wear something like this that's so heavy for them and so thick this is one of my husband's favorite shirts because of course it says Hawaii it's a Hawaiian shirt actually says Hawaiian strength but he had gotten this in Hawaii during one of his visits there and he has a love and hate relationship with this shirt he loves it but then he hates to wear it so I figured I'd wanted to since I saw this on Pinterest I wanted to go ahead and surprise him turn this hard feeling t-shirt into a soft vintage one alright the recipe to turn your hard shirts into a soft vintage feel only requires two ingredients four cups of water and half a cup of salt place everything into your container I'm just using one of my kitchen Pyrex because it's the right size for me and mix it well make sure the salt is well dissolved into that water okay the salt is fully dissolved I have my shirt here my husband's shirt and I'm going to go ahead and fold it nice and flat so that it soaks into that water and just make sure that your um your shirt is fully covered in that water okay and we're supposed to brine it we're supposed to brine it for three days and brining is just a process of just letting it sit I'm going to go ahead and let it sit outside it's a nice weather outside it's not hot it's not cold and then every evening I'm just going to put it put it inside or else I can also place it in my laundry room so either way where you guys decide to place it just make sure that um once in a while every day or two just Pat it in and make sure all the the fabric is covered and I will see you guys in three days Aloha friends it has been three days this thing has really soaked in well it's been brining and now I'm going to go ahead and give it a regular wash and it's supposed to have a vintage feel to it let's go see how it works out alright friends here is the final result went ahead and washed it twice and the result I'm pretty happy with them okay with it I think it actually did work it's not vintage soft soft but it is it is a lot softer than what it originally was and I have to take into consideration that I did start off with a very heavy cotton shirt this was very thick it wasn't just the regular cotton t-shirt this one was super thick but hubby have already tried it and he can't feel the difference specially along along the sleeves this DIY of turning your your regular t-shirt into vintage vintage t-shirt does work at some point it won't turn it super vintage like you know like this super thin but it does you know line it up a bit maybe I'll even try one day of just doing another batch of the the salt and and the water brine and see how it does work but um for now I'm pretty happy with it so I give it thumbs up thank you guys for watching this quick video of how to turn your regular t-shirt into vintage shirts and like I said I think it works and I hope you guys try to Maha", "_su1Bwx6A-Q": "The 2000L may be the heaviest ladies' tee\nthat we offer but don't let that fool you, it still offers a tapered flattering\nfit.

best results so let's jump right into this and get started so here you'll see i already bleached the one on the left and then the one on the right here this is the one that we are going to put our image on and then we are going to bleach it so the bleached image is already bleached washed dried ready to go when you see us press it you're going to see some steam come off of it because it is a little bit wet we are using you know certifical t-shirt making 65 polyester you do need the polyester in order to sublimate or your image is not going to stick even if you bleach cotton it's not going to stick to the fabric super important to get a polyester blend thing over 50 seems to be the best for me now here i marked shirt one and sure just in case the results are so close that i can't tell the difference because my goal is to get them pretty much the same i'm making these for my daughter and her friend and you know sorry you kind of want them to be as close as possible all right so what we're going to do is we are going to make sure that our image is centered so i fold the shirts in half and i'm just going to do like a quick press just to give me a nice straight line and not only am i going to put a straight line down the shirt but i'm also going to fold the end in half and just do a little indents just so i kind of have some sort of a guide you know you always kind of just want to eye it up the best that you can now i use a super small press here so it's very important that i you know line it up because i have such a small space i'm working with um you know i wasn't sure how i was gonna feel about doing the t-shirting so you know i didn't go crazy and buy the most expensive thing on the market um here you're gonna see that we are pressing the bleached first shirt so we're just going to kind of give it a second this is the one that i don't know if you can see in the inch but yep there's a little bit of steam popping out there because the shirt was just a little wet from me hurrying up trying to get it washed and then flamated so here we are we have our image and this image i believe i just purchased it off of etsy i do buy my edges i don't think it's okay to just keep stealing stuff off of google especially if you're gonna use that multiple times or you know commercial images so i do you know get my permissions in order especially if i'm going to put it on youtube so you can go on etsy and find you know bundles of different images sublimations all right so here we go we're going to fold our little picture in half and this is hocus pocus so cute it's a squat on it adorable especially for little girls um all right so here we go we are gonna get our mat nice and clean and solid straight we're gonna put our shirt down again working through a very small press so we have to make sure everything is lined up perfectly and everything is fitting into our little canvas area that we're working with we don't need anything hanging outside be very careful uh i know my hand gets very close to the top part there but you know you you know your limits and what you're capable of handling and the heat that you can handle on your fingers so anyway back to the shirt we're going to line this baby up we're going to make sure that it's where it needs to be now i probably overkill but i do put the tooth down just to help any blowouts and to help contain the gases that's how you sublimate the gases come out and they attach to your fibers you have a beautiful image but um i don't know so i put two top parts on it seems to be the best thing that's worked for me thus far this is just parched paper from my kitchen and then i had these sheets that came with my vinyl once um it worked very well so we're just waiting and this is fast forward so you're not sitting here for 60 seconds waiting for my shirt to press we're gonna release it and you're going to be able to see a little glimpse of the bleached first shirt bring your mark get set go oh man already you can just tell it is beautiful but we're not going to ruin it you're still going to be surprised at the very end when we compare it to our sublimated first then bleached image and tell me whether or not you like it and which one came out better so same thing here what we need to do is fit it all on the mat make sure nothing is hanging over where we need the image to go or obviously it's going to be on the shirt and now this one's going to come out and it's going to be a little scary it's going to be very dark you're not going to really be able to see it but then the bleachers work it's magic and then we will have a gorgeous image so here we are again lining it up making sure that it's even it's on our mats and then now press it [Music] we're going to cover it here with our little protective you know of course it is heat resistant and make sure you're not using wax paper i do need to tell you all that do not use wax paper make sure it is partial paper so okay that 60 seconds was the first to 60 seconds of my life and let's wait here it is ready oh my gosh you can barely see it right like you already saw the bleach one turned out pretty good this one a little bit different story but never fear it's not over yet if you've seen our other videos here you'll know they come out pretty nice when they're all said and done so here you have it here's our second squad one and oh one of them there's the other one but you have seen the side by side yet so don't go anywhere because i'm gonna shift side by side the difference so here we go we take our dark now shirt number two we take it outside and then we're gonna bring her down and i was working on the other shirts too so if you're instead we'll have that video up soon and we're just gonna squirt around our shirt right around the image try not to get the neckline if you get the neckline there is a chance that it will bleed through and it just does not look cute so i use plastic bag good you know use of recycling there use the plastic bags put them between the shirts try to get them if you can see here on the right how it's covering the neckline try to do that be very cautious of drip any little drip is going to show up on your shirt obviously so here i am here just trying to contain it keep it in the center i want to make sure that you know the entire center is covered with bleach and it's not running all over because you don't want to ruin your image and you want to keep that bleach contained so next you're going to rinse it with cold water wash it in the washer dry it in your dryer just like you would your clothes obviously don't put anything in there that you don't want a little bleach on so just wash it by itself you can and here are results the left is the bleach first and the right is seated then bleach which one did you like i'm gonna tell you my winter bleach first and then sublimate my first time do and i think their results were actually a lot better than the vice versa so yeah bleach it first then sublimate and guys don't forget that right button thank you so much for watching we appreciate you as bye y'all", "Ytg16bt2460": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys kelly walters here with stahls tv and today we are doing video two of our bleaching series and today our focus is going to be with sublimation transfers now as you can see i do have a roll of cad cut here and we will be using it and specifically we are going to be using our cad-cut glitter flake in our hologram gold but incorporating into the transfers this round it's going to be two versions of sublimation so our first is our cad prince sublimation transfer and then our next is our patterns specifically using a sublimation pattern so what we are doing is i am showing you how to play with bleach now i mean that very loosely of course we're going to be bleaching some t-shirts i'll be using our gildan softs or using gildan's soft style tees i'm staying in the heathered colors now i will tell you we will be using the sun outside so when we go outside to bleach bear with me on the outdoor elements and of course hopefully the sun will stay strong and we'll be able to knock it out of the park now the first thing that we need to do is go ahead and cut our art for our glitter flake we don't have anything else to do with sublimation so that is done and ready to go next we will weed and then we will take our t-shirts to the heat press we will apply our sublimation transfer and then we will apply our cad-cut glitter flake transfer and then we will go outside and bleach now before we get started before you get started make sure you do testing of your own with bleach it can be very tricky there's elements that can have an effect on it if you struggle use some heat i know that helps and then of course make sure you wash test whatever you are um trying that way before you sell it to the customer you know it's successful and it can be washed so let's get started hey guys before you get to bleaching there's a couple of things to keep in mind there are a variety of squirt bottles out there i just am using an empty glass cleaner bottle it does have a little bit more of a mist versus a stream so if you are wanting a certain style of bleaching i do encourage you to try a couple of different bottles a little bleach can go a long way and that's something that i've learned throughout this project so make sure you try just a little before you add way too much and then you can't take it back all right so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and protect our lower platen now i have just folded a cover sheet about three quarters that way if i wanted to use the other side i could cut it off use it for smaller things and because we are using a size small i'm not too concerned you know with the logo getting outside of where our protection is um just because of the size of the logo that we're using so now that we've threaded our shirt we're going to just lightly pull it off we want to try to have as many seams as possible off of our platen and then next up we're going to pre-press for six seconds this allows any moisture wrinkles to go ahead and release from the shirt okay now that that is finished we're going to go ahead and lay our transfer right back down where we wanted it now because i'm going to be adding bleach to this i'm not too concerned about the logo being about two fingers down right now we are about a hand so four fingers down again when i spray the bleach it's going to kind of come up here so instead of the logo shifting upward it's going to be now in the middle more of in the middle of the chest okay we are applying for 395 for 60 seconds now the other thing to consider is because we are on an automatic release press i am actually going to hold on to the press before it lifts up that way i can control it okay now we have about 10 seconds left so i'm going to go ahead and just hold on to the press i'm pushing it down that way when it pops i can control it coming up now of course it's a hot peel all right now next up we're going to go ahead and load our green shirt now same thing we will need to pre-press now i am using a new cover sheet for this shirt but i'm going to go ahead and use that same cover sheet underneath the shirt for the transfer so pre-press now like i said i folded it and as you can see we have a little bit of ghosting here now i'm just going to fold it that way i can use this side and i'm getting multiple uses out of this cover sheet versus just one and done and throwing it away now for ease i'm just sticking it underneath the neck and i really want to make sure this one is in the center now for this transfer our goal is to create a pattern underneath our vinyl so what i recommend doing so you don't have the straight edges is i've just gone and i have torn it's not going to be perfect but when you are bleaching a shirt it's never going to be perfect now if you want you can go back in and of course make it a little bit straighter you can add a little bit more character to it you have really good control over the size that you would like to use and that is exactly what i am going to go with i can feel where my my cover sheet is so i'm just going to adjust this just a little bit now this one is definitely more a center of a center chest and because there's no way to get a good square center on this i'm just eyeballing from my perspective okay again we have 60 seconds and i will stop it once if we are at about 10 seconds and again hot peel okay now that our sublimation is done we are going to go ahead and apply our glitter flake because the glitter flake will not be affected by the bleach it's okay to go ahead and apply that and then spray the bleach on top so i'm just going to go ahead and find my center very quick and i'm just going to place it in the midst of the middle on top of our sublimation we're not quite even in our square but hopefully this will just give us a good idea on what it would look like i am pretty much in the middle if i'm aligning up with the tag i just see that i have a little bit more sublimation on this side versus that side now this is a hot peel just my pressure and especially with the sublimation make sure you use a cover sheet since we're not back at the 395 we didn't activate the sublimation we just have a little bit of ghosting right here so just always take precaution and protect your upper heating element all right let's go bleach this all right you guys we are outside and the best place to bleach is actually in the sun the sun activates the bleach just a little bit quicker and you get to see results faster versus waiting overnight you can do this inside it's just much easier to kind of see where the bleach is um bleaching when you are outside so these are just two um cover sheets that i have used in the past i've just folded them in half um as you can see i am using an adult small in this gildan so i don't really want the full 16 by 20 size i'm just gonna put it in there for protection because it's not going to be the exact size that i need it there might be a little bit of bleaching spilled over but that's okay also ignore my boots i'm just trying to make sure i don't get bleach everywhere okay so i have my my bleach in my windex bottle and then i am just going to lightly spray you don't want to go too much too quick because there's no way of taking the bleach back so as you can see we are starting to get a little bit of change so in the middle of the logo that's where i'm really trying to spray the bleach you can see that we are starting to turn colors it doesn't have to be perfect and of course you don't want that soak through on the other side but if you do it's only going to add some characteristic to the shirt but you can see the characteristics of the shirt starting to come to life i am going to just set it to the side and then up next we have the full sublimation okay i went ahead and threaded our cover sheet like i did previously on that now the same effect that i had with the other one i am just going to spray [Music] all over right around where the logo is okay we're gonna let that one sit for just a bit and then we are going to review what they look like once they are finished hey guys we are done and i cannot wait to show you and review both of these shirts now if you remember i said to use a little bleach because it goes a long way the reason why i said that is because i used a little too much bleach bleach specifically on the go cats logo and i will explain to you why here in just a minute but make sure you just test a little and if it's not turning like i should just be patient be a little more patient than me and you will see some results i promise so the first we're gonna first one we're gonna review is our peace love and rock and roll as you guys know i did have um some cover sheet um inside of this we did have just a little bit sneak through on the back but that's okay i like character so i think it just adds a little bit more to the shirt itself just because you know it's already got a lot of character there's not a lot of rhyme and rhythm in this now the reason i always say just be a little patient is because as you can see down here i got a little bit higher up i was kind of going more for that type of effect but i did creep up to the side and then this actually turned out um pretty decent in size comparison to the logo if you remember we dropped the logo down when we were applying and it's because that bleach just creeps a little bit further up to the neckline i added a little bit of character here on the sleeves and overall i cannot wait to wash this it has not been washed yet literally put the blow dryer on it to help speed it up and now it's a little crunchy it just needs to be drawn uh washed and dried that way we can rid um any of the bleach remaining on it so anyway i think this one turned out great i'm really happy with the overall kind of grunge look that it brings now this one i definitely went really crazy on the bleach as you you guys saw it was just taking a little bit longer to turn well they were both taking too long to turn but the whole point with this was to have the leopard effect so i went about two inches too far past where i really want it to go so the idea was that we would have this bleaching this you know kind of crazy pattern like right along the edge of the leopard so you do see the rip transfer i kind of like it i'm not against it but what we were going for was more of the fade away with the pattern and then the go cats on top of that as you can see we also are now picking up the pink in the leopard which originally was not there when we were spraying outside so once the shirt went white or cream we definitely pick up more color from our sublimation transfers now as far as the rest of the bleaching goes i love the splattered look across the bottom i just wish i wouldn't have gotten too crazy with the bleach and um you know didn't go too far down but a little goes a long way it is um a knit you know it's it's a material that soaks up water or liquids so just keep that in mind when it comes to bleach that it is going to spread just a little bit but overall this concludes the end of our two-part series with bleaching if you haven't seen video one we use just heat transfer vinyl and i hope you enjoyed learning how to sublimate and then bleach on the guild and soft style t-shirt i'm kelly walters thanks so much for watching this video i really hope you have enjoyed this content if you haven't give us a thumbs up otherwise we will see you next time and get creative bye guys you", "mujpNxavalk": "what's going on guys i hope everyone is having a great day now in today's video i wanted to cover one of the basic essentials that i guarantee each of you already own i'm talking more basic than bathroom selfies vineyard vines and yes even more basic than all of them becky's out there in the world and of course we're talking about plain tees now everyone knows how essential plain tees are to every man's wardrobe because of their simplicity and versatility with that being said everyone knows that it's nearly impossible to find the perfect tee but your boy is like mj and i took that statement personally that's why in this video i'll be going over six t-shirts all at different price points in the hopes of finding the best tee now keep in mind that my rankings especially when it comes to fit is based off of my preferences and my body type so make sure to make your own judgments as well i will provide the sizes that i bought as well as my upper body measurements throughout the video so that you can easily compare and make those judgments in terms of my ranking system i will give each tea a score of 1 to 10 that will take into account fit quality and overall value but before i begin if at any point throughout the video you like it or find it to be informative i would really appreciate it if you gave the video a thumbs up so without further ado the first tee that i have here is the everlane air crew tea and i got this one in a size small this tea comes in at a price of 24 which is right in the middle of the pack compared to all the other teas now by just holding this tea i can tell that it's extremely lightweight and a bit on the thinner side now when looking at the fit this shirt actually fits pretty well which honestly is not what i expected the shirt has a nice slim fit through the chest and waist without being overly tight and the arm sleeves are nice and tapered with an overall solid sleeve length it could maybe be a half inch shorter if i wanted the perfect fit but this length is more than satisfactory the only thing i will say is that the collar is a tad wide for me but i also just have a smaller neck at 14.5 inches so that may just be a me problem now judging the quality this tee is made of 100 cotton and is purposely woven loosely in an uneven sub texture for extra breathability while the breathability and lightweight features are a plus i can definitely feel like this can shrink up on you if you don't hang dry the tee so you may just want to be extra careful when washing now maybe i'm just not used to extremely lightweight tees but i feel like i have to be extra gentle when taking this shirt off because when i try to take it off the first time normally i felt like i was almost going to rip the shirt again i'm just not the biggest fan of lightweight tees as one of my basic essentials so i have to mark it down a few points for quality with that being said i'll probably rate this t a 7.5 out of 10 because even though the shirt is lightweight and can tear a little bit easier i feel like the fit is actually really great besides just a slightly loose collar now the second tee that i have is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tee and this shirt comes in at 29.50 this tea has a little bit of a rougher texture on the exterior but we'll see if the interior has a different feel but first when it comes to fit this tee fits extremely well the chest width is basically perfect for my body type and the length is great as well i would say that it runs just slightly on the longer end but definitely isn't major the arm sleeve link sticks right around mid bicep which i do like but the only thing i'll say is that i wish the arm width was just a quarter or half inch smaller to fit nice and snug on my arm now when it comes to the quality this tee is made from a cotton polyester blend so it definitely does have a little bit of stretch to it now while i said earlier that the outer layer texture is a bit rough i didn't find any discomfort when actually wearing the shirt i wouldn't consider the shirt to be extremely soft but it definitely is comfortable enough to wear regularly and then lastly i would consider the shirt to be a medium weight and so it definitely will keep its shape and isn't flimsy and with all that being said i'd give this tea for madewell a solid 8 out of 10. the main reason why i had to mark it down a few points is because i feel like this would be better priced at 20 rather than 30 and so the overall value is a little bit lower and now the next tea that i have for you guys is the men's premium tea from talentless and this tea comes in at 39 right off the bat i can tell that this tea has a premium feel to it because it's much softer than the other two teas now when it comes to the fit though this shirt is not what i expected at all the shirt description stated that it has a relaxed fit and so i'm either extremely chunky or this tee is definitely more of a slim tapered fit i actually do like the width at the hips and waist but the chest area and the armholes especially are definitely a bit too tight for my liking i can definitely feel my arms losing blood circulation because of how tight the t is and so i would say to recommend sizing up but the thing is if you're short a guy like me at five feet six inches the size small i have here is a bit long and i can only imagine how much longer a size medium would be now when assessing the quality it truly does feel extremely premium and has a ridiculously soft feel for a garment dyed cotton fabric the collar is nicely ribbed and so there is a bit of stretch to it making it much easier to put on but then the collar quickly compresses again right after and wraps up tightly around your neck honestly if this shirt just fit me better i'd be going crazy over this tee because of the quality you're getting at this price point however because that isn't the case and fit is extremely important when it comes to basic tees i have to rate this tee a 7 out of 10. now the next tee that i have is the t-shirt from ask it and this is priced at 45. now the great thing about ascot is that they actually offer 15 different sizes from extra small to extra large with length options of short regular and long i chose to go with the size small and the short length because i am on the shorter side but as you will see i wish i had gotten the regular length when looking at the fit this shirt for me almost fits to perfection but the only thing that is stopping it from fitting perfectly is the shirt length i'm going to try and return this for the regular length because everything else truly fits great i love both the chest and arm sleeve widths and the sleeve length is at my preferred length as well hopefully when i return this for the regular length version this tee will fit perfectly when it comes to the quality of the shirt it definitely is more of a premium heavyweight cotton fabric which will definitely make this shirt extremely durable now i will say that the shirt isn't as soft or comfortable as the tailless tee that i just tried on but it has a similar or better feel than all the other tees in this video and then this tea similarly to the talentless tee also has a nice ribbed neckline that really conforms to your neck with now overall with this shirt i'll have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 because of the fit and the premium quality but i hope that when i return this for the size small in the regular length i'll be able to grade it up to a 9 or a 9.5 now the fifth tee that i have here is a uniqlo supima cotton tee and this tee comes in at 14.90 now at 15 bucks this tee has a pretty nice overall fit but i'll judge it objectively like i did with all the other tees the chest measurement of this shirt fits perfectly on my body and the shirt length is also perfect sitting right around mid crotch a few shortcomings of this tea though has to be the slightly looser neckline as well as slightly loose armholes when it comes to the quality the shirt is made with 100 supima cotton and has a nice smooth texture finish i would consider this tee to be a medium weight and that is not nearly as lightweight as the everlane tee but it is definitely lighter than the ascit and talentless tees in terms of comfortability i wouldn't say that it's jaw-dropping comfortable but it definitely still is comfortable enough to wear regularly as an essential piece and with this tee only coming in at 15 i would say that this tee has the best value meaning you get the best bang for your buck however with that being said the t isn't perfect and so i have to rate it a 9 out of 10. now the last that i have is a jersey t-shirt from todd snyder and this one is in a size small this tee comes in at a whopping price of 68 and so we'll see if the fit and quality warrant this higher price looking at the fit i'm a bit torn because there are a few things i love about this tee but then there are also some small deal breakers i love the chest width as it's a comfortable slim fit and i also love the width of the arms however it would be a tiny bit better if it was just a quarter inch looser the neckline is just a bit too loose for my liking and the length of the shirt is also a bit on the longer end now when it comes to the quality that's an entirely different story while i can argue that the ascit or tailless tee has the most premium feel this tee is a very close second but it's by far the softest tee out of all of them they use 100 garment dyed cotton jersey fabric which is the reason why this tee not only has an extremely premium feel but is also super soft and stretchy because of the jersey fabric if this tee had a perfect fit then i would maybe consider it as one of the top tees in this list but because the fit isn't that great and the price is astronomical the overall value of the shirt decreases and i would have to rate it a 6 out of 10. alright so now that we got through all the teas let's see how each tee ranked up against each other now remember that my rankings take into account fit quality and overall value but also keep in mind that something that may not have fit me well may actually fit you great so hopefully you can make that comparison so coming in last place with a score of 6 out of 10 or 60 we have the todd snyder t now if we were using the asian grading scale with these scores then this would be a d and if you're asian you would know that this stands for don't come home if you don't get the joke this basically means that you gotta score so low that your parents don't even think that you deserve to come home but luckily i'm not that ruthless when it comes to grading and i actually think that this can find itself in people's homes because of how soft and high quality the tea is but because the tea just didn't fit my body type well and it's also priced at 68 dollars i had to rank it last on my list now in fifth place we have the men's premium tea from talentless which got a score of 7 out of 10. now i will preface this by saying that if the t did fit me better it would definitely be in the top three but because the t was a bit long and a little too tight for me as well as being the second most expensive option at 39 i had to ring it fifth on my list moving on to fourth place with the score of 7.5 out of 10 we have the everlane air crew tee now the fit of this tee was nearly perfect but because this tee just didn't feel as durable because of the lighter weight this tea isn't one that i would keep now finishing it in the top three is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tea which received a score of 8 out of 10. this tea had a very similar feel and fit to the uniqlo tee but was just double the price which is why i had to rank it third now finishing as a runner up we have the asget t-shirt which received a score of 8.5 out of 10. now while this technically finished second i would consider it more of a 1b because it really depends on whether you prefer quality or affordability the t is quite expensive at 45 but the quality is seriously amazing and the fit is great too again the only issue that i had was the length and that was my fault because i chose to go with the shorter length rather than the regular length but i'm going to exchange it for the regular size small and i'm expecting the fit to be perfect but lastly coming in first place in terms of the best bang for your buck it has to be the uniqlo pima cotton tea the tea is priced at 14.90 but it often goes on sale for 9.90 and the fit and quality are great you really can't find a better fitting tee at this price point and so if you want an affordable yet still very high quality tea then i would definitely recommend to go with the uniqlo supima cotton tea now again those are just my rankings and so i'd love to hear your thoughts and your own rankings based off what you saw in this video let me know down in the comments if you agree or just think that i'm crazy and now that's all that i have for you guys in today's video hopefully this video helped you guys find the right basic tee for your body type

best for it up next hey guys it's Melissa with shirt space and today I'm bringing up the hot talk okay enough of the cheesiness so let's jump right in to pick the best shirt for heat transfer vinyl the shirt has to meet a certain criteria it will not only need to be a great T to wear but it will also need to be a tea that works well with your heat transfers heat transfer vinyl works well with many fabrics but we think these two type of fabrics stand out above the rest the first is a hundred percent polyester polyester is less likely to shrink than any other fabrics but what does this have to do with heat transfer vinyl once your design has been added to the tea it's crucial that it does not shrink this could wrinkle pull or even ruin the vinyl with 100% polyester you know your shrinkage will be minimal and we like minimal shrinkage especially when it comes to HTV but I'm not just gonna stop there what if we could take it to another level well there's no what-ifs about it we can with three simple words cotton poly blend cotton poly blends are the best of both worlds you have the durability and minimal shrinkage from the polyester and the softness and wearability of the cotton the blending of these two fabrics will create an overall makeup that you will love since this is our number one candidate what's the top tea we recommend in this category drumroll please it's the bell of canvas 3001 CVC made up a 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton which is the best cotton out there and 48 percent polyester weighing in at 4.2 ounces this is a lightweight tea that you will love to wear being a retail fit and fashion-forward your customers can rock your great design it has unisex sizing side seams tearaway label and it's pre Shrunk the list goes on and on well there

video of the dieter cotton sub lis power the emember net powder and the special transfer paper we've watched it a few times so let's have a little look to see how it's turned out right okay well here's the garment here and it's probably been through to watch four to five times so it's been worn quite a bit now and I'll just show you closely so that you can actually see the the finish on it and it degraded at all I'll show you I've got a new camera by the way so I should be adding some really close images of this so let's have a look at it now well though whether you can actually see that the the color seems to be okay it seems to have held up there and the feel of it as you can probably see is nice and soft and if I stretch it as you can see look we're stretching it there and as you can see it doesn't actually crack or split when you stretch it so I personally think that it's actually it's down a pretty good job so yeah let me try get near the actual ink looks like it's gone into the actual fibers itself look at that look that's pretty close detailed at any now I want to try and let me out because I'm very zoomed in oh not bare with me let's zoom back out there there we go and that's what we were actually looking at so that in my eyes is pretty impressive but I want you to take it one step further now don't forget we use sublimation ink with this so what I'm going to try now just thought about this and I'm going to give it a go I don't know if it's going to work or not because I believe that it might be the polymer powder which is holding the image into a takes it off if it takes the sublimation off of this special paper they give you the sublimation paper and it allows it to bind into there now when we use transfer papers the transfer paper is basically very similar I supposed to this polymer powder and I use dye based inks as you know so what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to print an image out on this transfer paper in dye based ink and then I'm going to put the powder over the top and see if we can transfer a dye based ink image as opposed to a sublimation ink image which is a lot dear a sublimation ink so we'll see how that goes so I'm just going to print an image out now and then we'll put the powder on so bear with me for a second right okay din well I've had to use some standard sublimation paper because this thicker stuff didn't want to go through my printer for some reason so I'm just going to put this now in there this is still a little bit wet there we go and I'm just going to get this sublimation powder just pour it over the top there like that and then just sprinkle it down the ink all over the ink as you can probably see and don't forget this is just standard ink this isn't sublimation ink in here so I don't know whether this is going to work or not couldn't tell you doesn't like it's really stuck to me to be honest with you okay din so we'll just lift out the standard paper which I don't think is going to work but we'll give it a go anyway and just place that facedown there put a little cover sheet on it I don't think this is going to work and give a 30-second blast we're on a kite night not transferred at all here we go so you must use sublimation ink with this as you can see standard ink doesn't work whatsoever so that is definitely an owner that is sublimation paper but that is normal dye based inks so you need to have the sublimation ink with this product to be able to do a peel away on a standard t-shirt so what I'll do I'll quickly just transfer this image now onto the sublimation printer and we'll actually do this image on a standard sublimation paper this time and see what it does with that no I don't think it's stuck to that paper either this is standard transfer paper and it's not actually stuck to that so we're now going to have to try the standard sub b2 cotton transfer paper and give that a go so again we'll put in our reco printer face down like that and print it again alright well I've actually run out of ink I've got a changing table motioning but you can see they're mostly this half of the picture is still looking look mottled and wet so let's put this in there sit this on there that okay here we go I get the image here alright so this is the image now to go onto our t-shirt right okay so place it face down all right here we go and we'll remove the transfer paper don't forget this is out of cotton t-shirt nice and then you go there's another one freshly printed there as you can probably see let's let down on the workshop so yeah there you go there's another one we print it out on the back of this so it appears that you have to have the right paper this with standard sublimation paper now this transfer officers right although I've printed out on this transfer paper which is sublimation paper this will actually transfer onto a polyester garment they're all mouse mat or anything even though it's dry to the touch because this is transfer paper and it's sublimation ink so there you go that appears to be holding up pretty well after about five washes and again we just printed a new one there we've tried it with a few different variations we try doing it with diabase things for that special powder that didn't work and then we went over to the sublimation ink and obviously that worked as well so it needs to be done on the paper that comes with this kit which is the sub litre cotton paper and this time why did I actually raise the temperature to 190 degrees C for 30 seconds that one I did 180 degrees C and it really hasn't really made any difference to be honest with you so hundred and ninety is probably a better one to go because you're going to get more penetration with the the material into the actual garment so anyway I hope that was of some used here that was me follow-up of our subleader cotton product which we tried in our last video ok then thanks very much hope you enjoyed this video and we'll see you again in the next video bye for now you", "3N84Fvw18yE": "hello my name is megan bender and i am the creator of maddiebanks.com um and maddie bugs creation on facebook if you want to and instagram and all that stuff if you want to um follow me on all my t-shirts and stuff like that i will link everything down below um i've had a lot of requests on facebook about how i make my poly tea spray and how it actually works because a lot of people say that you have to have 65 cot or polyester or more and that you cannot sublimate on 100 cotton well i'm going to prove him wrong today that she can actually sublimate on 100 cotton and the shirt i have on is actually 50 polyester 50 cotton and my poly t spray was on this shirt and it made the image pop out more than what it really would on a 50 polyester 65 is also very great to have because your colors you don't need to use the poly t spray and your colors come out more vibrant and this is without poly t spray on a 65 cotton or polyester and the colors came out perfectly cool on those that's what the colors look like on 65 polyester now i have already used my spray on one of my shirts that is 100 cotton and i've already pressed it and i'll show you what that looks like before i make the spray and that came out looking like this so the colors are still just as vibrant as a 65 cotton or polyester i'm sorry 65 polyester all right so i'm going to take you over here to my table and i'm going to show you how i make my spray okay in this spray you are going to need sorry i gotta get this situated right in this spray you're going to need not this a spray bottle that is eight eight fluid ounces or you can do 16 fluid ounces just like my dawn spray bottle is here which i like using these because it's got that power mister and you don't have to spray as much and work as hard and then you're going to need this poly acrylic i've got the poly acrylic clear matte i got this at walmart for 18 i got the big jar and it should make quite a bit another thing you're going to need is a tablespoon because you're gonna need for every eight fluid ounces you need two tablespoons so for this particular bottle i put four tablespoons of this poly acrylic in it and then i fill it up with water and it works perfectly fine it made that shirt that i just showed you all so i'm going to go ahead and let's pour this out i don't have very much in there i'm going to go ahead and make it for you guys so what i do first is i open up my polycrylic and i dip my spoon in here make sure that it is level with a teaspoon and then i put it in here try not to make a mess like i do i'm one of the messiest people in the world yep just put four in here one that's two just make sure your teaspoons or your tablespoons i mean tablespoons are level when putting them in your jug or your bottle and you can use any spray bottle you can go buy one for a dollar at the dollar store or you can get your if you use this kind of a dish liquid you could just wait till it's empty and use it or you can use it you can just use any kind of spray bottle laying around i think that's four one more perfect all right and then after i get my tablespoons in there i will just fill it up with water i use cold water for this you want to use cold water for this and shake it up and that is how you make polyt spray it will be white looking should be white looking when you're done and that is my magic poly tea spray", "hfoawy9_ayg": "today I'm going to test out dye press poly tea spray sublimation coating for t-shirts which allows you to sublimate on cotton yes even 100% cotton t-shirts if you've been in the sublimation business for long you know this is a long awaited item I found out about dye press from a sublimation form and just had to give it a try I bought this bottle on Amazon for $64 it is concentrated and will make half a gallon of the solution I'm not sure how many t-shirts that will make but seems like it'll be quite a few after my purchase from Amazon I discovered that I could have purchased this for $30 from going to die press calm I believe plus the shipping I think was six or seven dollars but I'm not going to send it back to Amazon because I just really want to try it I already bought it it's here and I'll leave you with the information on where you can get it cheaper than Amazon in the description below well you will need for this process is of course the dye press poly T spray a light colored cotton t-shirt this one's actually ninety percent cotton it was cheaper I bought a pack of five of these for like under $12 at Walmart and you will need this spray bottle or something that will put a fine mist it doesn't really matter honestly because you have to get the whole thing completely soaked but I bought this fine mist one because someone had recommended it and you want to use distilled water so I'm supposed to have one ounce of the dye press Holi tea spray and seven ounces of water however my spray bottle my mister that I bought it does not hold seven ounces of water so I went a little bit under if you know that two tablespoons is about an ounce so I went a little bit under that for the one anyway to go with the six ounces of distilled water that I have going this in the my spray bottle already have that set up and ready to go now I'm filling it with six ounces almost to the top I'm just ready to shake it up and get ready to spray it on my shirt so I have my concoction here one ounce of the Die Presse poly tea spray and seven ounces of water give or take and I'm going to put a Teflon sheet inside my shirt because I only want to spray the front I don't want the back to get soaking wet and you're supposed to spray it until it is nice and damp let dry completely before you sublimate on it let's go my first time I have this continuous spray bottle of see how it work not too terribly continuous here's my t-shirt hanging up to dry in the bathroom didn't want to throw it in the dryer because I wasn't sure if that was allowed maybe I'll try that next time who knows brand-new dryer so I don't know if I want to okay now we take it apart and we're just gonna spray regular water through it so that the nozzle doesn't get clogged with the poly stuff because then it will ruin our sprayer and we don't want that then I'm gonna put the lid back on and save what I have left I almost used like half of the spray bottle so I used about a half an ounce just to get the front of that shirt way the directions that come with the the dye press do say to pre press for 15 seconds at 375 degrees so that's what I'm gonna do you know a lot of times I separate my designs into two pieces if I want it to be this was this way if I want it to be a little bit bigger than what my printer will print which is eight and a half by fourteen is the largest size it will print so I printed this on eight and a half by eleven I printed this on a larger legal size paper and then I cut them out and I can kind of put them together piece them together on there so that it has a bigger design make sure it is all pre pressed and I'm going to I'm just going to start out by laying the top one where it needs to go fits perfectly I have a smaller heat press mine's only 13 by 13 which I should have actually gotten a larger one so that's there I'm putting two pieces put your paper on as recommended and we press it with a heavy pressure for a minute and ten seconds so I did go ahead and put the second part of the design on there the first one turned out okay it was a little bit light I think I'm not sure if that's because we're doing it at 375 degrees instead of the usual 400 but that was what was suggested in those instructions so let's see how the whole thing turned out it does also say not to use the spray that makes it stick to the shirt use it and it sticks just fine alright so here we have it it's fine it's a nice shirt to wear to school when I'm subbing this is the school I'm subbing at and it's a little right I have to say I don't know if I would try it at a higher temperature next time but it definitely does work and I will I'll give it a go and I'll wash it too and I'll let you know how that turned out so here I am in my shirt that I just made it has been washed and dried it's a little white I think in the future I will experiment with temperatures because 375 degrees for dye sublimation is really a low temperature and that is what it the instructions said to use but I feel like it needs to feel hotter so the design is like the main thing I like about having this option with 100% cotton is that pilot percent polyester is not always available so in a pinch if you need a shirt you need to make some shirts for somebody you can just stop by Hobby Lobby in get a

EE", "0ZKkALOJTm4": "hey guys it's jake in this video i'll be showing you six of my favorite t-shirts and i'll be ranking them on quality fit and price each of these shirts have their own pros and cons which i'll clarify as i talk about them first up is the los angeles apparel one eight zero one g d this is a pretty standard t-shirt it's not incredibly thin like a gildan shirt but also not overly cumbersome like a root porter shirt this shirt is 185 gsm or 6.5 ounces so it has a bit of weight to it but not thick enough to overheat you or feel stiff the makeup is 100 cotton so you need to be careful washing it on hot or you'll risk shrinkage the best washing method for any 100 cotton garment is to wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size large the sleeves flare out a tiny bit but really not as much as other shirts i'm very picky about my sleeve flaring but i'm comfortable with this amount of flarage the color is a bit on the thicker side hugs my neck but not suffocating me and the length of the shirt is great even though it's a white shirt it's not really see-through like some other cheap white shirts the 1801 gd is fairly true to size from what i can tell this shirt is 24 dollars retail and 7.85 cents wholesale compared to other shirt blanks that range around 6 to 6.5 ounces the wholesale price is sort of in the medium upper price range but you can definitely feel the difference in quality comparison like if you were to compare the laa1801gd at 7.85 cents with the bella canvas 3001 at four dollars the weight difference is night and day the 1801 gd offers a decent selection of colors people tend to prefer neutral colors anyway like black white gray and cream so this blank checks those boxes next is the root porter ultra luxury hoodie this t-shirt is the heaviest blank i'm aware of at the moment if you want a typical street wear look and feel this is your shirt this shirt is 235 gsm or 10.5 ounces which is one of the heaviest sharp links you can buy from any supplier at the moment the makeup is 100 cotton and is already pre-washed so the shrinkage rate is about zero to three percent as dictated on the website i still recommend to wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size large the sleeves are pretty flarey and it has a baggy oversized fit the collar is thin and hugs my neck not my preferred type of collar i like my collars a little wider to show the collarbones it's more of a boxy cut which some people like it's not my absolute preference but i can't deny the superior quality this shirt is 29 retail and 13.95 wholesale 14 is pretty pricey for just a sharp blink but this is the absolute best shirt you can get as a blank at the moment if you're referring to the quality you can get comparable quality for a little cheaper if you bought bulk wholesale from alibaba but that's not the purpose of this video i'd recommend this shirt if your brand positioning is in the more exclusive luxury market and you price your shirt around 40 to 60 dollars the colors offered are limited to basic neutral colors like white black and cream but they introduce new colors every now and then which are only available on the wholesale store i don't know if these are limited edition colors or if they're permanently added next is the los angeles apparel mt01 yukon army tee this is an interesting shirt it's thick warm and the fit is pretty good this shirt is 230 gsm or 8 ounces the makeup is 90 cotton and 10 polyester this shirt is the softest shirt in this list it's hard to explain it almost feels like a really thin blanket if you plan to try any of these blanks i highly recommend you get this army tee just to see how unique it feels if it's cold outside and you want to wear a shirt underneath your outerwear i definitely pick this shirt first out of all the other choices on this list here i'm wearing a size xl the fit is like a standard shirt sleeves don't flare out as much and the length isn't too long i also like the size of the collar it's a bit on the thicker side and i'm a big fan of how open it is it shows a little bit of the collarbones which i like and chest hair you know if you got any this shirt is 28 retail and 9.70 wholesale i say this price is fair for the quality you get the weight and ounce values are important and can give a general idea of how high the quality of the garment but considering how i know what this feels like it's one of the nicest feeling blanks i've ever felt unfortunately this tea only comes in heather gray which is a huge drawback if this came in other basic colors this would be my absolute go-to shirt for all of my projects next is the gildan 5000 this is going to be your budget shirt if you're just starting out and have close to no capital this is an acceptable starting blank this shirt is 150 gsm or 5.3 ounces and the makeup is 100 cotton there's nothing particularly special about this quality it's not as thin as the bella canvas 3001 shirt which i'll talk about later but it's also not so thick that you'd be complimenting this shirt and referring it to your friends it's just a standard shirt that any club youth group club soccer team or bakery team fundraiser would use here i'm wearing a size xl the sleeves flare out a bit and the collar isn't too thick or too thin and it's not super tight around my neck the white color is a tad bit see-through as with most jeep shirt models the fit is nothing special however you expect the normal shirt to fit that's exactly how it fits this shirt is about a dollar fifty to three dollars retail and that's pretty damn cheap you can find this shirt on most mass clothing distribution websites there's really no need for a wholesale price because it's so damn cheap even though it's so cheap i actually think it's a really good deal i would expect a 5.3 ounce shirt to be maybe four to five dollars but you can get the white color shirt for like a dollar 67 on some vendor size there are plenty of colors to choose from whatever theme or mood you need they definitely have it next is the a.s color classic tee this is a good quality standard tee that you can use in pretty much all of your projects virtually no complaints with this one shirt the shirt is 185 gsm or 6.5 ounces and the makeup is 100 cotton this shirt is super soft like very flowy if that makes sense it moves with your body well and doesn't feel cumbersome at all here i'm wearing a size large the fit on this shirt is great still a standard fit like most shirts in the list the collar is thick but doesn't hug my neck super tightly sleeves have an okay amount of flaring and the length of the shirt is good nothing super special about this shirt it's cheap and feels soft this shirt is 20 retail and 8.85 wholesale which is a great price for a standard yet great quality shirt i tend to use the classic tee and the los angeles apparel 1801gd for lots of my projects and collections i'd say if your shirts are priced 25 dollars to 35 dollars you should definitely use this shirt as your standard go-to blank the shirt has a fair amount of color choices mostly the popular colors some neutral colors and a few brighter tones on an extra related note the as color staple tee seen here in size xl is the exact same as the classic tee except its weight is 6.3 ounces as opposed to the classic 6.5 ounces and it cost 16 retail and 4.95 wholesale as opposed to the classics 20 retail and 8.85 wholesale so if you want a tad bit cheaper version while not sacrificing the quality too much go for the staple tea i actually prefer the staple tea over the classic tea because the collar is a little thinner and more open and since it's only a little bit lighter i prefer the more flowiness of the staple tee this shirt is my usual go-to blank when making collections the final shirt is the bella canvas 3001 this is a lightweight and flowy shirt i feel like this shirt would be best for hot seasons or for people who overheat easily this shirt is 120 gsm or 4.2 ounces with a makeup of 100 cotton watch the shrinking specifically on this blank wash on cold and hang dry here i'm wearing a size xl i like this shirt because it's pretty cheap very light and soft to the touch and i like the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders it's very flowy and stretchy the collar is thin and pretty open very relaxed fit other than that it's another standard shirt fit this shirt is three to four dollars retail and you can find this blank on many clothing distribution websites it's pretty damn cheap so there's no need to get wholesale pricing i think the price to quality trade-off is appropriate this shirt is lighter than the gildan 5000 which is cheaper but this bella canvas 3001 is just more appealing to wear i just love the lightness of it there are a bunch of colors to choose from whatever you want they most likely have it my recommendations if you're just starting out and just want to get product out on a budget get the gildan 5000 as color staple tee or the bella canvas 3001 it just depends on what characteristics you look for in a shirt the gildan 5000 is the cheapest while the as color staplet is the highest quality out of these three i just recommended if you want to stand out a little bit from everyone else then spend a little bit more money and get the la apparel 1801 gd or the as color classic t if you want to get the absolute best blank you can get and money isn't an issue get the rp18x extra note if you're releasing a special t-shirt or a specific graphic that works well on a grey blank then i highly recommend you use that los angeles apparel mt-01 yukon army tee like i said it's unfortunate it only comes in gray heather but if they've released it in extra colors it would be the only shirt i would use you", "do_0E0e1jSs": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to another video i am joy and i'm about to try to use this poly acrylic to supplement on a hundred percent white cotton shirt so i got this polyester from lowe's and it was 17 so right now i'm pouring in one cup of warm water and i'm going to add in uh some of this poly acrylic stuff i have these cups that i got from dollar tree and they are two ounces i had already shake it shook it and mixed it up and right now i'm just mixing it up again and you know just doing what i got so i poured it in the bottle i pulled a little over two ounces in there and i'm going to put the top on it when i can find it and shake it up [Music] [Music] so right here i'm showing you that it is a 100 cotton shirt and it is white and this right here is just a piece of board a piece of um it was a shipping box from united states post service which are free and i just hold it up and put it in there so that's the spray and i'm just spraying it on there just to get it you know a little damp not too damp and i'm showing you the time it is 1203 and when i put it on there and when i came back to put it on there it was 12 i think like 12 26 i forgot to record the time i thought i was recording but i wasn't so right now i'm just preheating the shirt and to get all the moisture out [Music] [Music] right now i'm just waiting for the picture to finish printing off the machine up there it goes and i'm gonna cut around it at first i wasn't but then i changed my mind and started cutting um [Music] and so now i'm just putting it on the press for 60 seconds and we are gonna see what's gonna happen and i'm also tripping on my kids because you know they're my babies all right now here is the big reveal we're gonna swing the arm back and see what happens as you can see i only put two sheets of paper and it's just regular white coffee paper i should have put more but i didn't and as you can see it went through both of the sheets of paper so next time i will probably use butcher paper instead of just plain white cotton paper and let's pull it off and voila this is what you get you guys i'm like super super duper excited and i am in love with the colors and how they popped on this shirt it it just amazes me how it looks and so i'm also going to show you another shirt that i did same process but without that spray that i made same paper same everything same heat press same uh box in this shirt and everything and you'll see how those colors are dull on that shirt but it did work on it but just not as much as the one that popped

to answer a question from the homegirl Mary today and she said every time she tries the heat press some vinyl onto a t-shirt when she lifts the press up she notices that it's all gunky and gluey and sticky and the designs not smashed into the t-shirt it's pretty much sliding around and it's just a big mess from the pictures that she's shown me I asked her what kind of vinyl was she using and she replied with she was just using the vinyl that came with her vinyl cutter I think she has a cricket or cameo not exactly sure but I think she bought one of those like budget bundle deals where she buys the cutter and it comes with like a few you know twelve by twelve pieces of vinyl to practice on and test out so I think she had one of those but she thought she had heat transfer vinyl but the vinyl that was supplied was regular decal vinyl now you're asking yourself what's the difference between heat transfer vinyl and decal vinyl basically heat transfer vinyl is made to be heat transfer it onto a garment onto a t-shirt onto a hat onto whatever type of material you bought the vinyl for now let me stop right there and just say that when you're buying heat transfer vinyl you have to buy the vinyl made for the material that you're gonna be pressing on meaning if you're gonna be pressing on polyester make sure that the vinyl you buy can adhere to polyester a lot of times we'll buy some vinyl because it'll be on sale or we might not be looking at the label and it might be made for like nylon and then we go and try to press it onto a cotton t-shirt and it doesn't adhere right the settings are all backwards and messed up and we don't understand what's going on the problem is each vinyl is made for certain materials so you might get some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton for polyester and cotton poly blends so that's just saying that heat transfer vinyl will work on 100% cotton 100% polyester and a blend in between the two now why is this important because it's not going to adhere correctly to whatever material you're using if have a heat transfer vinyl that's made for like I said nylon and you're trying to put it onto cotton or vice versa so you have some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton now you're trying to put it onto some nylon bags and nylon jackets and you're melting your bags and jackets and you don't understand what's going on you have to buy the vinyl made for the materi you're gonna press on with that being said decal vinyl is the vinyl that you make stickers and car decals and like that for hydro flash car windows I mean you can stick them on anywhere but that's the regular basic decal vinyl that's not made to be heat press and it's not made for t-shirts now if you are buying vinyl by the rule on the shelf this might look normal and like oh yeah let me just get that put that on t-shirt but no this is actually decal I know it's a little bit more glossy you'll notice that there's some holes right there let's see if we get this in focus so there's holes on the side usually that tells you that this is decal vinyl you could tell by the feel it's pretty glossy most of the time heat transfer vinyls a little bit more matted and dull in color this is usually on a really big role when I go to mclogan right here in LA this is on a really big roll and I tell them let me get you know 5 yards of this 3 yards of this and they pull it out cut it and give it to me this is a 15 inch roll this is probably maybe two yards of orange this right here looks the same it's rolled up vinyl but this is actually heat transfer mine on the shelf it probably doesn't look just like this it comes in a C it'll come in like a bag similar to this there'll be some heating instructions a piece of paper in here it'll say you know what material it's made for the brand name how to apply it the instructions all of that will be on a piece of paper inside this plastic tube this is your standard 5 yard if 10 inch roll and this is heat transfer vine this right here made to put on two garments so these are made for cotton and poly blends there's no holes on the side like the other one that I just showed you color is a little bit more magic because this is the side that's gonna get stuck on to the t-shirt they look very similar like if you're buying them on Amazon you wouldn't know the difference most of the time heat transfer vinyl comes with application instructions the regular decal vinyl sometimes does sometimes doesn't but yeah that's pretty much it so hopefully if you were having that same issue and you watch my video and you see me cut some vinyl out and press it on a t-shirt you notice that the decal vinyl is not sticking on the shirt and it's kind of gumming the shirt up and you see the glue getting everywhere and like that it's a big mess that's because you're using the wrong final possibly you might be using decal vinyl when you should be using heat transfer vinyl HT v heat transfer vinyl it's usually

yeah [Music]", "qpYGhGNPm7A": "two things that I like I like t-shirts and I like style hacks I'm always looking online to find different little tips and tricks that can help getting dressed easier just help your life in regards to fashion a little bit more simple so one of the tips that I always see online is to make your shirt softer using salt so I was like huh this interests me BASC your t-shirt in salt and then it suddenly comes out softer I'm always buying t-shirts and frankly I like to buy semi expensive t-shirts there are certain lower end brands that work for me but you know I'm a t-shirt junkie I want them soft I want them nice so I thought to myself well if these hacks actually work could I take like a five pack of Target Hanes t-shirts and turn them into an expensive shirt so I could essentially take a $2.00 shirt and turn it into a $100 shirt so I got really excited about it and went to Target about my shirt it's about my salt took a little Bowl and I went to town so this is the new version of the t-shirt from Target PS immense medium a little tiny I would get immense large our boys large excuse me so this is a new one out of the package it feels pretty soft but what I discovered is I think what they're doing is they're putting like some sort of coating on top of the shirt so it feels soft in the package but then once you wash it like the softness washes off so feeling it I'm like well this isn't too bad but don't be fooled so this is the new the star control item okay pretty soft you know looks pretty good so then I found a instructions online on how to make your shirt softer with salt and what they said was to take big pot of water put your t-shirt inside cover it with water add one cup of salt and bring it to a boil okay so bring it to a boil once it hits a boil you put it down to a simmer pop a lid on it and let that baby marinate in that salt water for 45 minutes so I did that watch a little scandal while it was boiling away and then you take it out you put it in the wash and wash it like you would your normal clothes so I had a couple of other things in the laundry use my soap did the whole thing dried it was thinking out crunchy okay this did not work the boiling trick it didn't work this thing feels horrible like it is so far from soft that it's like it's ridiculous and on the site they were saying that they tried it and it worked you know maybe they had a more expensive shirt to start with maybe that's what happened but I do not recommend the boiling technique big ole thumbs down moving right along so then you know this is a five pack I could experiment then I found another recipe that said take bowl of water just regular cold water no boiling required half a cup of salt and soak your t-shirt in it for three days and then wash it as normal so for this one I was like let's just add a little more salt 1/2 a cup didn't seem like enough so I think I added a cup of salt you know I wanted to a speed of the process so I put the shirt in the bowl of salt on a Friday and then Sunday night I took it out instead of washing it in the machine because I thought maybe that would be too harsh I hand washed it with some soap from the laundress and I let it air dry for a bit I tumbled it in the dryer just to soften it up and these are the results now this one feels a heck of a lot better than the boiled shirt like way softer does it feel softer than the the new one not really so the salt trick you know sorry if you got all excited you were like oh cool I'm going to like check out how to do this I just don't know that it works that well I think you should just buy a soft shirt to begin with like I said I hate to burst your bubble but I'm in three days and I wasted like a couple cups of salt I could have cooked with that salt I don't think it's worth it but I will tell you if you do want to try it definitely the three day soaking method Trump's the old boiling method so scrap the boiling so I would love to hear your thoughts if you've tried this and maybe it worked for you maybe I just have no clue how to dip a shirt and salt maybe I just suck at it but if you've done it and it worked please let me know if you've done it and it was horrible - I'd like to hear about that as well so that is how you fail at making sure softer with salt", "O6cI0vGuskk": "hello just gonna do some illustrations of printing that can be done at home or wherever you like using two software programs and examples of two t-shirts the first one is a round neck t-shirt quite simple white simple design as you can see it it's got a it's got a round neck at the front very light very airy and the second one is this one's a sports t-shirt with my own jokey design on it as you can see it's quite simple it's got black lining around the edges and also it's a v-neck and basically what we're going to do is use two software programs to print out and print on these t-shirts the two software programs I enjoy using are this is the first one this is called coral draw it's basically a vector based program very similar to Adobe Illustrator but you get so much sharpness on it using vector and the second one is Photoshop another nice is the industry standard for actually printing and stuff or for designing and those are two preferable programs I use for do my designs alright so what we're gonna do now is we're going to take that design and print it onto the printer let's just set the printing up make sure everything's there we go there's a print preview mirror the image that's fine check the color which is everything's fine let's go for a print or fly it first as in merit as you can see on the panel there it's long mirrors let's go for a print and as you see it's pooling at the moment and any second now it should be sending the information down the printer there it goes any second now with a print should come out you never look at it now comes now this is the heat press you pick them up reasonably cheap on eBay simple - it's basically a flat iron really I think see I've loaded the t-shirt onto that ready I'm gonna put my picture there and we'll do it now in fact right line it up make sure it's upside right there we go fine then what I use is this it's basically safety pallet parchment very cheap you can use a Teflon sheet if you like but I'm quite happy to use it it worked me developed at times about this basic question of switching the actual heat press on and printing a mic and this is the baking parchment that I use you picked that up from anywhere as the Morrisons Tesco it's just bacon is basically non-stick baking paper other people use Teflon sheets which again you can buy off eBay but as far as I'm concerned I've been using that for many many t-shirts and seems to be working fine what we've done is we've pressed the plate down using this handle I've set my temperature for 200 degrees which 100 just about that area and you should count me down now that was set to 60 seconds and any second now we should lift the presser and see the final results of the actual t-shirt and hopefully you'll come up fine alarm sounds swing that away move forward take that off gently and now we have it perfect t-shirt hopefully you see that perfect print every time I list it it's washable what resistor or fade or have you it's stuck on there permanently you", "y-E2mW7mCH0": "hello everyone happy Saturday today I would like to show you quick trick well it's not that quick but it's very interesting trick about sublimation as you all know you cannot print white on on a dark t-shirt on the dark garment with sublimation simply because there is no waiting and even if there will be white ink it will it won't I don't think there will be OPEC enough to to stay on the undershirt you wouldn't die the shirt so you would have to use some kind of discharge before so so if you bored with with printing on just a polyester mags and and stuff that's widely available for your suppliers try to think outside of the box a little bit so I will show you something different today so as you can see there is an image and is white it's on a black background so this is what I hope it will look on my dark t-shirt and this will be printed with tight sublimation printer and with dye sublimation ink there is no special formula formula for those things is just a general sublimation energy used for printing on mags and and other items so let me go to my layers window so here we go this is how it will print you probably won't say it's just a slightly slightly white greyish on it will be on the paper so on the t-shirt you should look like this so I'll go ahead and I print it off on the very special paper and we'll show you well I hope I will show you how it will look one once is pressed to the to the t-shirt ticket will be black well it's not going to be t-shirt I just try to press it on some kind of scrub cotton material so go ahead and print some artwork first and see you in a minute so here I am back so job is printed and hopefully I get the property as you can see is printed lightly gray and ink is still wet so the trick is we as I mentioned there is no no white pigment in the sublimation printer but there is a great so what we were gonna do we're gonna help we're gonna help the ink with white pigment powder so this is how it's done wet image you probably seen similar stuff on YouTube you know the thing is we just won't we just want print where the ink is we don't want anyone else so we're gonna have a go my scrap nevermind anyway so this is the this is the this is like a pigment powder so what we have to do now need to dry we need to dry the image so the in same thing to the pigment so that sink into the pigment so here we go I'm going to put it under the press for a couple minutes just like this so he's a so you dry out I will see you in a second okay so a couple of minutes just gone so the image should be dry I'm not gonna touch it just in case it isn't I don't know if you can see you can see that with the powder here done and just remember guys this is just normal sublimation ink just I just printed it gray there's nothing special in here there's no special inks no special printers is just a special paper and special powder coating so um so I never done it before you might be a failure but you never know until you try so here we go so this is the scrub cotton scrap cotton shirt I'm going to repress it and now it's a big moment will you work oh really no image might be slightly too big for that for my tiny little press off we don't see you in a few seconds okay guys 10 seconds to go six and we'll see if this is a game changer oh this is a failure as I said first time I'm doing it so I have no idea what to expect I just following them I'm just following instruction from the supplier and they say to cool it down don't don't lift the paper when he's warm so we just lay here I'm not gonna turn the camera off so you can see it you just cool it down on the table and beef moment in a minute in tea in theory there shouldn't be an image because as I said is a cotton that's a sublimation sublimation dollar we've gotten and there is no and the light ink doesn't show up on the dark so let's have a look that is quite cold no just give it a few more seconds to be sure oh there is a image there you go there is a image look at that nice there is a image something we made as well he's not sublimated but he's use of sublimation printer he's very very grainy I think maybe I just didn't do enough powder but that's quite cool that it's quite cool that's actually not but let's have a look with another scrap and the other text I prepared I'm not sure if that drawing yet so we give it a few seconds and let's try this craft if the scrap is big enough should be just just big enough just press it and trim it so I can see why powerful places okay apply image class and wait take ten seconds left and no see if that attempt will be also have any good now let's zoom in to that I think we can release an image well there is an image look at this right so now I don't know guys is this acceptable for sublimation I don't think so so I'm not sure if I'm doing everything correctly from the images that supplier send me that image should be dead-on white to me is very grainy so looks like one I didn't apply enough powder oh I may be over dry there but they definitely differently there is an image I don't try to the mean that and he's very very softly no if you have to distress look that's that's good babe that could be your your thing but anyway I've got one more thing to show you again I didn't I didn't try that before so everything is from the PDF that supplier sent me so please bear with me and I will be back with another print in a minute all right so here I am back with living you art won't let go don't know if you can see in fingers there is a unicorn that printed with grey so this supposed to be very attractive effect on the dark or dark government and we're gonna tell you what it is yet but because I wanna I wanna see I'm gonna see if you say so here we go so we with the solution yeah now probably you can see already what it is then yeah yeah very funky very funky oh can you say it now he's a glitch ha here we go so let's see how this glitch I will show up on the dark government so we're gonna try me I can see lots of data around the image so let's try I don't know if you can see these lovely enshrining let's zoom in okay so I've got my scrap look at my scrap pre-press and then for 34 seconds we're going to press a unicorn see you some on a couple seconds left six seconds to be precise and we're going to see if this is a oh boy oh boy effect oh he's a disappointment so I'll let it cool down first actually if you can say hey this is very very sparkly powder so in theory there should be sparkly unicorn show up on the dark t-shirt and this is oh all with the sublimation ink and a bit of a special powder okay so look one two three woo actually unicorn die oh oh I like that I don't like the little little bits of unique sorry glitter around the image by two like that I don't like the sublimated dance already printed unicorn so this is some definitely yes for me let's try the is quite stretchy yeah that's brilliant that's actually I really like it so here we go so we've got semi-decent or maybe not even semi-decent a white print we have we have a distressed look yeah she's not too patterned on this on this artwork and a unicorn nice and shiny glittery okay so I have a one more thing for you one more thing obviously we have to try this powder on white garment so I will be back in three seconds okay I'm back with some white scrap t-shirt I just heard lying around and another image of Isis pretty obviously coated already and these protists is exactly same as with all the ones you just put the paper put the powder on your image paper is exactly the same just trim it and try to apply it on white effect if he's going to be a disappointment let me remind you I'm printing with a sublimation ink on a sublimation printer on a sublimation paper but it's a special paper it's not there's normal paper you could just buy like a tropics orders and on a cotton t-shirt so this is not polyester shirt is a cotton shirt you cannot sublimate to the cotton but you can prefer a kit to sublimate on the treatment so it does work sometimes the old supply is all over the world trying to come up with a better and better ideas all the time but obviously some of them better some of them the worse but this is another one so let's have a look let's give them a chance we want the game change or do we Hey and as usual 34 seconds 3 2 1 beep so let's call it down simple last time a few seconds and we're going to see if you work okay one two or three Oh blimey all night I like that hello there is a pop and there's a massive pop up on it and he's extremely soft look at this oh I want

forever type like washing tests and all this so you", "GTuPatQOf3Q": "peradventure then broadcasting Jesus will help them behave themselves take a step outside and seize the day now set aside your worries it's okay heading out the Sun is here to stay [Music] hey YouTube it's Janita from blast oppressed creations thank you so much for joining us I want to start off by saying thank you to those of you who have subscribed to our channel we're up and coming new new business and new YouTube channels so we're trying to be consistent as much as is possible to get content and relevant content I'm relating to the business particularly with sublimation printing tonight I'm going to be doing my take on a process for getting a 100% cotton surface palpable for sublimation and this video is what I watched from a youtuber named Jay Joel's creation that's the name of her Channel and it's Jay a why do s well Jo apostrophe s creations and she's right on YouTube the title of her video is sublimation on cotton using poly acrylic she is what she has so she's going through the process of showing you what she went what she did to create a sublimate able surface using this Minwax polycrylic okay so this is what I'm going to do now I had this in my stash for some scrapbooking and other processes that I wanted to use this for I don't even remember what it was specifically that I bought it for but I know I did not buy this for sublimation because I've had it way longer than I started sublimating but following her process and her technique I'm going to also do my take on it in her video she doesn't walk you through the actual process of creating the mixture but what's inside of this little spray bottle that I purchased at the Dollar Tree is 8 ounces of water and then I use two and 1/2 teaspoon tablespoons of the polycrylic liquid and mixed it in here shook it up really good and what I've used thus far I might have oversaturated the shirts but I saturated the the Front's of the shirts so that it was very damp and then I put the shirts inside of the dryer to dry and there's their 100% dry so what I did I prepared a couple of different shirts so that I could see how this is going to work out to the touch the shirts don't feel any different maybe just a smidge crunchy are on the front then on the back I have one Gildan extra-large that I prepare it and white I have a George brand which is from Walmart large that I prepared in white and then I have two small t-shirts I plan on doing something for my granddaughter so this is the Gildan small I'm white and in the Gildan small gray I have some sublimation prints that we have that we didn't use they were printed out for other things and we never use them so I figured I'd use them tonight and see how they work out with making that surface ready for sublimation okay let me just quickly go through them I apologize because I should have had it ready now these are images that I printed a while ago so I'm going to put this one on one of the small shirts it's already reversed I had some ink leaked on here both sides when I first set up my printer I at this time had these Emerson 7710 and in the very beginning I might have overfilled my ink cartridges so some ink leaked out on the edge of this on both sides over there so I'm just gonna cut around that I'm not going to really focus too much because this is just a test to see how this process will work for me jeido creations has success with it so I'm going to believe that I will as well seeing as I pretty much follow her instructions with the exception she used two teaspoons I used a little bit more in that I use two and a half teaspoons what but what she showed on her channel two teaspoons seems to have worked really good she also posted when she got negative comments down in one of her videos she also stated that she reached out to men whacks and questioned them about the safety of utilizing the liquid on surfaces and they pretty much told her with this small amount that she was using it was not going to be a big deal so my assumption is well actually not my assumption but if I go forward with this particular process there are some other things other than just t-shirts that I have in mind to do with it so if it works out my intention is to utilize cotton excuse me coming over to utilize the cotton as an opportunity to create some other things so with that being said I'm going to go ahead and put this on the white t-shirt this will be just going to my granddaughter so what I'm gonna do I'm having some trouble with my back right now so I can't go back and forth with the camera and like I said I don't have Kim with me right now but I'm gonna take this over to my heat press which is on the other side of the room and I'm going to pre-press it and then I'll be right back over to that area I have my heat press set to 360 I'm going to do the pre-press at that temperature but I'm gonna raise it up to 400 so by the time I get the t-shirt fully ready my heat press will be at 400 okay so that pre-press feels good and I'm gonna tighten up my press raise my temperature to 400 and I'm gonna set my time back down to 60 seconds all right okay so that feels good now I got it tightened up enough wonderful okay so we're gonna put the shirt over here move that out of my way and I've already cut the excess paper off it will have this little bit of extra ink on it but that's okay I'm not going to make a big deal about that I just want to see if this process will actually work I should have used some shirts that I threw away from some mistakes that I mean before but it's all good I'm just gonna eyeball this and go with my gut on location like I said this turtle just be for my grant one of my grandkids and we're around for adventure then broadcasting Jesus will help them behave themselves okay and I'm gonna tape the bottom just because my paper is a little curly down here okay so I got that on I'm gonna get another piece of parchment paper to put it over the top and bring this over to the press I'll press this out for the 60 seconds and then we'll see if this process works fully I'm using a heat press that I purchased off of Amazon it's the company that I need another piece of tape it's a photo ink it's a 16 by 24 and I like it a lot so far I have not had any trouble with it any problems out of it I'm very very very heavy and it's a on portraits style okay so yes j-joe Janos Creations has a couple of videos where she's showing you how she sublimated to a various different types of surfaces so she has a really nice channel she doesn't have a ton of videos but she has some good content there and then later on I'll be bringing a video that I will be attempting some things that I saw from another youtuber where he utilized he used some other materials are I can't think of it right now but I was bringing that content to you as well and we also encourage you if anybody is watching and would like to see us try or work on any particular surface you can leave a comment down below requesting what you'd like to see and we'll definitely give it a try if we have the substrate so if we can get on the material that you're requesting but I do have some videos planned Kim does have some things planned that we'll be doing in the next coming couple of weeks okay all right previous sublimating situations or any indication that this worked I'm gonna say that that's a success because I can see the image through the shirt oh yes look at that oh that works beautifully oh boy yes Jojo that worked and now let me see how it feels oh that worked beautifully oh I'm liking that this is a game changer I reckon yes it is look how nice and concentrated the colors are you can see my little ink mishap down there but like I said that's not a big deal as this will be just a shirt for one of my kids my grandkids I don't have any children this little Kim's my baby and she's 20 oh that looks really good so this works aye-aye-aye aye-aye-aye here this is this is good okay so I'm going to continue and attempt some other things but this looks like it would be suitable I mean it warm its some more investigation as to whether it will be safe the shirts are going to be washed so I'm sure that if you know what this is something that you want it to do to expand your ability to print onto cotton you were in the building look at that [Music]", "iNtufeGrRho": "so people have been embracing the organic lifestyle for years now so it's no surprise that the apparel industry has hopped

but um full disclosure it came with no instructions my guy um i really can't find much on b flex flock sublimation but i'm just gonna use my judgment and we're going to get it done but i literally have no instruction um i would find it similar to easy subleave where you can print on it and print cutting all that or the way i like to do it is just lay the easy subway and this up on top of it because for some reason my easy sublease gets jammed in my printer i don't know it don't happen to everybody happy to me i ain't banging with it so if you see my previous video uh sublimating 100

show you how to make a mask without sewing it President Trump said that we could use scarves or other objects for mask like a bandana but today I'm going to show you how to use a hundred percent cotton t-shirt to make a mask without sewing it of course you're gonna want a long-sleeve shirt you'll take and cut the shirt right about the armpit again this doesn't take any sewing go along the side make sure you keep the seam in your cut area I'm gonna lay this flat so it's a little better to work with and you'll have a theme on one side this is an old t-shirt so it's an Allegro flat I've washed it many times I'm not when I wear anymore you want to cut down about six inches on each side just enough to make it tie and then you're gonna cut up from the wrist up again about six inches maybe a little less the spine it depends on how long your t-shirt is but you want to leave here about I'd say six to eight inches in the middle then the next thing you're gonna do is take your shirt your sleeve and tuck in these extra pieces this is going to give you a four actually a six layer cotton cotton shirt that you can turn into a mask so you'll have six layers of a hundred percent cotton now when I'm sewing masks I put two layers on the outside and a hundred percent cotton batting the inside so this will kind of simulate that inside cotton batting so once you tuck all those in just want to lay them flat make sure they're comfortable then you're going to end up with a mess like this you can tie the sides and then this goes around the ears you can cut these extra pieces off let's make sure you fit it to your face then you have a very simple cotton mask that you can put over that's four or six panels thick of 100% cotton", "jA7Bcr3vs9U": "this classic will be a tea that if you

reunion you really don't want to go to its coming up you're gonna start a clothing line with your tax returns you need shirts you're filling out the order form on the website of some sweet merch company upstate merch they're asking what shirt brand and style you want you check the list Bella canvas Jersey all style Gildan American Apparel Hanes an Vil champion Toltecs Fruit of the Loom they're just t-shirts man what's the difference in this message from upstate merch we're talking about the most common shirts we sell and the differences between them [Music] so I've divided this into three tiers one your basic economy shirts two your mid-level premium shirts three your high-end tri blends basic economy shirts I'm 6 foot tall 185 pounds and I wear a large of the basic shirts we sell all the brands and styles are pretty much the same standard fitting true to size and about the same 5 ounce cotton weight getting one instead of the other because you're looking for better quality is like going to Burger King instead of McDonald's it's a little different you might have a preference but it's kind of the same thing how dare you don't listen to a Big Mac baby flame-broiled Maia for basic 100% cotton shirts we mostly sell the Gildan 5000 some substitutes include the Hanes 50 to 80 and the jerseys three six three four basic blends we mostly sell the Gildan 8000 for a substitute the jerseys 29 m or the Hanes 51 70 blends are usually a 50/50 mixture of polyester and cotton make my own blend a little bit of cotton a little bit of poly and so you might be asking what's the difference between a basic blend and a basic cotton tee cotton has more breathability and comfort but it's more likely to lose shape and color with repeat washings the polyester and blends makes them stronger hold shape and better for athletic activities all of these shirts have preshrunk cotton but if you don't follow your care instructions and just cram it into the dryer which is what most people do they're going to shrink I ain't wash my clothes anyhow and I ain't got a wife that does it for me either if you're worried about shrinking your best bet would be to get a blend a lot of times people are afraid to get basic shirts they call them cardboard shirts got this for cheap scratchy and starchy not wrong with a little starch they aren't that bad by any means they have a purpose they're budget-friendly shirts good for work and giveaways if they get ruined it doesn't hit your wallet as hard they're also better if you prefer a loose-fitting shirt or if you have a larger build maybe you're a big dude you even lift bro and you don't want some fancy fitted shirt with soft cotton maybe you want to roll your cigs up in that unfitted sleeve and listen to the boss Tipton worth mentioning some of the brands offer even thicker versions of their 100% cotton tees like the Gildan 2000 or the Hanes 50 180 beefy t be fair these are gonna be a bit tougher and I recommend them alongside the blends for contractors but keep in mind it's still a shirt sometimes we feel like customers are looking for a magical shirt that's flame resistant stain resistant stab resistant unfortunately the quest for the magical unicorn shirts have a field of course because they do not exist there's no shame in getting the basic shirts the best way to describe them is they're just regular shirts I recommend considering the basic shirts just think about your needs and they might be the right pick mid-level premium shirts I still wear a large you'll see the words combed ring-spun cotton which is a manufacturing process that makes them thinner softer and stronger usually these are fitted to these are the shirts people would generally rather wear because they're more comfortable than the basic shirts being fitted they also look more flattering for a lot of people and they're a little bit more trendy trendy they will last longer they will make you look good for 100% cotton we mostly sell the next level 3600 and for a substitute we usually sell the Bella 3000 and one for a blend we mostly sell the next level 6,200 and for a substitute the Bella 3650 these shirts cost more but you can generally get into this style for about 80 cents to a dollar more than a basic tee that's less than extra cheese on your pizza extra cheese is two dollars again I recommend trying them out to see if the right for you [Music] talk to your tribe lense Oh what the hell's he talking about blend I still wear a large as the name implies it's a blend of three materials generally cotton polyester and rayon making them the thinnest and the softest they're fitted like the mid-level premium shirts except the rayon gives them a unique drape does the carpet match the drapes tri blends usually don't come in solid colors I'm not gonna say they never do instead they usually come in Heather colors Heather's a girlfriend once I think her name was Heather here you can see the difference between a solid black and a tri-blend black these shirts are very fashion-forward trendy we mostly see them used for clothing lines small or personal runs of tees athletic based companies businesses that aren't contractor based but even contractors might throw in a couple of these as nicer shirts to wear when they're not working the brand we sell the most the next level 6010 for a substitute the belle of 3413 see starting at two dollars and sixty five cents more than a basic shirt you generally don't want to ruin these as work shirts or use them as a giveaway 265 more tell me how to spend my money I'll make it rain crap that was a tenner again I recommend trying them out to see if they're right for you you can always get a mix of shirt styles in one order they don't all have to be the same style or brand also you can order blank samples before you place a print order these are shirts that I wanted to bring up because I want you to know about them but they don't really fit in the other tiers I'll call them hybrids not talking about no Toyota Prius first up is the Gildan h zero zero zero hammer shirt this is a regular fitted shirt manufactured like a premium shirt it's thick combed ring spun cotton so it's a soft strong shirt that's standard cut and true to size instead of being fitted next up is the jersey 601 mr tri-blend it's standard fit true to size but it's a try blend lastly 100% polyester shirts they are often billed as dry fit ClimaCool cool dry dry power dry Sport active and performance shirts they have wicking properties which are essentially Littlejohn wicks that fight off moisture by absorbing it and drawing it away from your body of course really good for athletics in the sports ball go to the shirt I recommend most is the a four and 3142 let's do a quick review the cheapest option the 100% cotton standard cut Gildan 5000 worried about shrinking need something a little stronger try a blend the Gildan 8,000 take it up a notch with a premium fitted cotton tee like the next level 3600 need a blend try the next level 6200 if you want the feel and breathability of cotton the strength and wicking properties of polyester the special drape and comfort of rayon the thinnest and softest shirt tri next level 60 10 tri-blend so there you have it upstate merch is most sold types of t-shirts and brands there are tons of other brands and options there are also other types of apparel that exists in those same tiers like hoodies and tank tops and long sleeves v-necks you can check out apparel from our main distributor at Alpha Brodeur comm if you see something you're interested in just ask in a sales rep we'll help you I'll put links to all the shirts that I mentioned in this video below and don't forget come on down to Upstate merch merch upstate to downtown come", "D7FqwkG8I10": "what's up guys Lucia Lumina here and in today's video I am going to be sublimating on three different types of shirts so today I have the Cricut and fusible ink t-shirts that they sell at Michaels and you probably can find these Michaels certain Walmart's Hobby Lobby Joanne's all those type of hobby or craft shops and these guys are 95% polyester and 5% I believe nylon or something like diet or spandex 5% spandex and cricket markets this as its infusible inc brand I'll see the camera can kind of focus on that right there but really they sell like their own patterns and be able to cut it with the Cricut and kind of you know print similar to what this guy has well lucky for us we have an actual sublimation printer that will print whatever we want on this guy so the other two type of shirts I was trying to find a 50/50 poly cotton but I couldn't find one anymore like locally so I ended up grabbing a to Walmart shirts but their one was is for women and one for men and one of them is a time and true brand you can see think that sir the woman brand that they have and this guy is and I'll show you guys here it is a 60% cotton and 40% recycled polyester and you guys can see the tag there so you see it so we're gonna be using this guy we're gonna see how a subliminal print comes out on this and then I also got a George brand I say and and this is actually shirts that I use very often with HCV and and heat transfers I actually like the George Brown how the shirts kind of feel and they're very easy to access at least during the summer and spring times and even fall a winter you kind of see this long-sleeve version of these t-shirts but for the most part they're pretty easy to find and this guy is 65% polyester and 35% cotton you can kind of see so we have three different levels of polyester in the shirt and while I kind of know you know I think the minimum should be 50/50 poly cotton this one probably would work this is just kind of my I guess assumptions or or my theory I don't think this one's gonna do too well but this one for sure should sublimate very very good and I actually found these for sale at Michaels 50% off so if you guys actually follow me on my Instagram at Lumina creative I typically post about cells like this so these guys like I said were 50% off so $10 typically at Michaels they were 5 bucks guys is this cheaper than what I can get them like on some t-shirt websites I can be trying to get a hundred percent polyester so it was a really good deal I picked up a bunch of these because I have a huge order and then like I said follow my Instagram and I always pull stuff like this so yeah guys I am gonna get my designer here real quick I'm not really gonna show that if you want to see the process of doing that you can watch my previous video up here that kind of shows you the introduction of sublimation how I set up a image of that nature but I'm gonna go ahead and set up the image and then I'm gonna go ahead and print it and I'm gonna get the heat press ready I guess for so far the settings on the heat press you're gonna do 400 degrees Fahrenheit so if your machine is in Celsius like mine that's gonna be 200 and 204 degrees I definitely recommend having a little legs are going to kind of check the temperature of your heat press at all times because mine is a little off sometimes and you're gonna set your timer at 45 to 60 seconds try to play with the timer typically black ink if your image has a lot of black ink that takes a little bit longer to sublimate as simply the last color that kind of transfers over and again guys if you guys are only a little more about sublimation of the process check out that video I did a few weeks ago but anyways let me go ahead and get to it I'm gonna print and then we'll switch over to the camera over here on the heat press alright guys so I just ran my test print I always suggest you guys to run with your sublimation printer in case you don't use it on the daily like I do like I said I'm more of a few chunks of plaster so heat transfer user and HCV and so I just kind of ran one real quick it's kinda what the delenn's gonna be similar to the one I do with the Neenah 3G opaque when I did a print and cut except I added my domain at the bottom so we're gonna sublimate this guy this is just a regular eight and a half by eleven sheet guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start running the actual one and let's see how it comes out guys I cannot stress this enough I printed these guys wrong so what sublimation always always always always remember mirror your image I just wasted a bunch of ink on three prints that were supposed to be reversed learn from my mistakes guys I got a reprint them let's go alright guys so we are back so I already kind of pre-press this one right here now you're supposed to put something in here and I don't know where 1/2 will happen to my little board I like a little plastic thing that I put underneath so I'm gonna slide our old of use quick and Matt underneath here and just because I don't have my actual thing that I use but I guess this works too right and what this is guys is with sublimation sometimes the the transfer will go a little bit too far or like the it'll go through so you can do this so that that doesn't happen to you this shirts a v-neck so I'm gonna put it up a little higher so this first shirt is the time ensure I'm so sorry the lighting sucks I'm not this is not I intended to do Hey oh cool so one of the transfers now it is a mirrored rookie mistakes guys I'm not gonna measure I'm not gonna try to get this perfect this is literally just to see if it'll sublimate on to the shirt just want to see if it'll work these are just test prints so we're gonna go ahead and press those guys let's see how this goes I guess we're gonna take this one off I'm not gonna show you how everything looks till the end so ye alrighty guys we're gonna go ahead and put the next shirt in which is the George brand and this one is 6535 so we're gonna go ahead and put this guy on [Music] that we transfer same thing guys same process and you'll put it on here slap this narek there you know we're gonna go to town I think that's pretty close to being Center so yeah sorry guys so same thing lift up don't breathe in remember you're supposed to be doing this in a regulated area alrighty guys so last shirt gonna throw on the and this is the cricket one notice every shirt gets bigger and bigger I start from small medium and now extra-large these old cricket Matt's work just fine for this but they do kind of melt so you got to wait a little bit before you take them out and it'll harden up again and take shape so anyways you're gonna impress these get the wrinkles out and the moisture I'm gonna go ahead and do the last print guys Center that like so [Music] again I'm not doing this 100% accurate I'm just kind of eyeballing to see the quality of these prints not necessarily use these shirts for anything [Music] same think I'm breathe alright guys so I know it looks like anyone from day to night I kind of started this little delayed afternoon where there's a little bit of sunlight it's kind of gone down her those prints took a little while to do especially because I could do it twice because my dumb self decided to do them not mirrored again guys learn from my mistakes and I am not ashamed to show you that I to make these type of mistakes three perfectly good sublimation sheets gone to waste including ink don't be like me just see you see these are the ones I used they are mirrored so to you look straight to me here on the camera whether they have been all used and let's see the final results guys I just don't want you guys to see that not because something shouldn't be done doesn't mean just because some people say it shouldn't be done doesn't mean you can't do it there's a bunch of different ways to do things and and you know what guys every customer is different you might get a customer that wants the least expensive route that wants to just as long as the image is somewhat visible they don't care and you know for those type of customers one of these options are going to be great for the customers I want the higher end stuff one of these options is gonna be good too and so like I tell people that comment on my videos because I do get some people are like I bet you if you watch that nina 3g up a paper is gonna fall right off or I bit because it's not pigment in ink it's gonna fall right off after water too and you know what guys I get it it's hard to believe it when you don't do it yourself but if you follow some of these instructions that I'm giving you step-by-step you're gonna get the same results I do and you know the this is stuff that people say shouldn't work on and so I'm gonna show you guys the three results from three sharps and you tell me what you think and which route would you go through would you go for would you offer all these three to your customers we're joining off for one comment in the section below and tell me what are your thoughts so anyways let me grab these shirts so you can kind of take a look already so we're gonna start with the shirt that I thought just wasn't gonna sublimate and that's the time and true brand from Walmart and the reason why I use these specifically showed you guys is because you can go purchase these at your local stores this is not something you have to order from someone these shirts are not something that you have to go find in the internet it's literally available to anybody and at ridiculous prices so this time and shoe came in and think I had four dollars for a shirt and guys honestly if you don't have an account somewhere or like a wholesale account that's a pretty good fish good price for a shirt especially something you can sublimate on so this is the type of shoe brand guys and I'll see if I can ladies all out at the end and you know comparison like I actually do like a panning of them but this is what that shirt looks like and again this was if I am correct 65% cotton about 60% pima cotton and a forty percent recycled polyester so I mean here I know the camera is a little difficult to see but it's definitely a little a little faded type of look it's not it's not a super super sharp image but it works guys some people might have customers that don't mind this you know and this is why you have a few samples laying around will show your your customers and you know for somebody's gonna get these dirty and they're just you know for advanced or for something that's like a one-off use why not why am i go with the least expensive option so anyways let's switch over to the George brand and I try to do a female and a male brand so that's like yeah yeah you know I can't find it for one the other Bailey's this is the George Brown guys right here and this is 65% polyester 35% cotton a little more vibrant you can definitely see a little more details in the print looks good like I said Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart I like most of my shirts that I saw the people at one work I use Gildan Walmart and then I want to go to step up like a little bit better quality I go to next level or Bella canvas which Bella canvas is actually now available at michaels if you don't have a whole slit account alright so last shirt okay and this is the cricut brand and fusible ink and I got these guys on sale I got that for style Michaels and they do go I'm sorry once in a blue moon and these these are typically $10 a piece which is a little more expensive than the order from a website or something typically the polyester 100% of like seven dollars or maybe a little less I know you guys probably some of you guys probably have a better host account than I do but for me it's seven dollars for polyester shirt and I found these guys for five bucks guys so I actually bought almost a whole inventory because I had a very large order fulfill but this is how the Cricut this is 95% polyester and 5% spandex guys it is so vibrant like it is sharp it is clean check that out it is a very nice quality image very little bleeding you can specifically tell in the text very little bleeding very clean image and this might be for those customers that don't mind spending a little bit extra you go with the 95% cotton again you can probably find this stuff cheaper online guys but I'm trying to give you a solution to be able to do this stuff from home and if you get like a random customer that pops up and you need a quote quick and they need something turnaround for next day either way you're gonna charge them a premium this is the cost you gotta pay they gotta pay in store prices if not they can wait like everybody else and you can order and get your discounted rates okay so this is what it looks like after a wash and this is the more cotton one the yeah the tiny children and so she watched this one time already so I'm kind of trying to get a little close a little bit looks a little bit like that worn effect but guys like I said it looks good and I printed well the heat didn't fall off you know obviously I don't know we might give it a few more wash tests and see what they come out like the cricket one looks awesome we washed all three of them together and this is the cricket one pretty much the same nice and vibrant looks great so tell ten guys thank you so much guys for tuning in don't forget to tune in for my lives on Mondays at 7 p.m. central I do a giveaway

these t-shirts are hot garments like don't even buy those YouTube what is going on in Detroit GZ in AEG bean Kesey and in today's video we're gonna be trying on all of these t-shirts all these white tees that are either from H&M Zara in your knee glow and we're trying to find out which one is the best white t-shirt for your essential wardrobe rotation going through different fabrics price and also the fitting so let's go ahead and talk about it before watching this video is that in my personal opinion there really is no such thing as a perfect white t-shirt that can last you for decades not really anyway or not not necessarily one brand name that I have gone to because if there was I would have found it by now and a big reason behind making this video is that a lot of people are curious as far as what the differences are between these white shirts compared to another brand just putting that out there so anyways let's go ahead and do this just a zoom out here real quick okay so the way we're gonna format this I'm just gonna go shirt by shirt try them on and we're gonna go through some categories like fit price comfort ability and also things like fabric if I leave out any of those details in a particular t-shirt we could talk about it in the comment section below okay first up we got these through neck dry color t-shirts by you to blow and I bought a large and I bought an extra-large I've never tried them on as full crew I've never even seen this actually this is kind of like in their pajama section seven dollars and ninety cents almost ten bucks per shirt maybe there's two of them in here I don't know what about to find I was going to open this up I'm hoping that these are returnable though got it fabric is not bad it's kind of soft not bad it does look a little bit see-through mind go ahead and try this one on first this is a size large by the way alright for the sake of this video I'm taking my chain off it's a little too thin for me it definitely feels way more of a kind of feels like a pajama like I just kind of mentioned if I'm looking in the mirror biggest drawback to this is that you can actually see my wife beater underneath like look how see-through that it's like I bet you if I didn't have this wife beater on could totally seen it would I absolutely hate what teachers do that like it sucks it looks really stupid I look stupid you look sooo the Libyan rebels you already know what it is let's just try on the extra large for kicks and giggles anyway but we already know that this t-shirt is just not it okay this one's looking a little more promising as I'm trying it on as far as size goes I mean extra large honestly fits like a large I'm a my true to size is a large I bet you through the camera you can see my pants can you see my pants like if you can see your pants through the t-shirt or through the t-shirt no this it's an automatic no like I just like nipples and pants you can see my nipples and you can see my boxers and pants through your t-shirt then you shouldn't even be wearing a t-shirt doesn't even make sense I would say for sure these are more of like a pajama and I don't even know for sure if they are for pajamas or not the only Plus that I would say to this t-shirt that I do like is that this collar is actually kind of tight the neck area actually stays the same size as the size large which I like because if I end up sizing up maybe to a double X which I don't even think they have double exit you know go for this t-shirt and I was looking at the top and there was just only XL ring of the next day is the same size which is good because if you end up getting two sizes up are size up the the ring of the next not gonna get like you know two inches bigger an inch bigger kind of suck sometimes good then you can see your collarbone I mean that's great but that is enough for me to keep this t-shirt where you can see nips wife-beater boxers and pants no go I'm gonna put this one to the side for now okay so this is the super thin Yuna globe t-shirt you see my hand like you can you can see my hand right okay so then now we're gonna put the thicker one on here hold on now can you see my hand it's way harder so like clearly this one is like way thicker so just the thin t-shirts like just stay away from these these suck okay next brand we got up is we're gonna talk about Zara and we bought one t-shirt out of this whole stack of t-shirts that is from Zara and this is actually a shirt that I'm very familiar with so let's go ahead and try it on first still got the tag on I'm already I'm keepin the shirt I already know I am because I own I own a couple of these and reason why I absolutely love these shirts is because they're not seeing through very different than what we just tried on this one you can't see through it and if you can't comment and let me know that you can see this I mean as far as I know you can't see my wife later you probably can't see my pants either also I like the fit too it's not like boxy not like crazy boxy words like too high here this is a size large but it does fit between like large and XL if that if that's not even like really a size but if I were to just like give you a gauge of what it kind of fits like and I love that I love that it comes down to here cuz it covers up my farmers can just keep it in one it doesn't rise that's too high doesn't rise down too low not trying to be like too trendy I love it the fabric is also very soft these do come in at a whopping $20 and also a very quick tip for this t-shirt from Zara is that they make them usually in like three colors black white I think like a beige color and I think that's it but as far as I know right now these are kind of like year-round because when I first started buying these shirts ending 2017 beginning 2018 I started buying these shirts from Zara and these are not like the cheap shirts because they make like three or four different batches of different types of white t-shirts they have ones that are super see-through they suck they have like elongated ones I pass on those samples with zippers I also pass on those but this is just like your regular mundane white t-shirt but it's like a little bit of fabric softening is actually very nice too for some people you might even eat the size down but for me I just go true to size I go with a large it works for me and also best thing about it is if you wash it and dry it it doesn't wrinkle as much especially for being you know it being a cheaper t-shirt $20 t-shirt it is what it is I love it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next shirt we got up is another unit load shirt I literally bought these without without even looking at them and I didn't know it came with a pocket tried my best not to buy t-shirts for this video with pockets but you know we're already here at this point we already have both of the t-shirts in a size large and also an XL let me try on the size large first size large it does look a little oversized already kind of even bigger than the shirt that I have on and also it looks a little bit more boxy but let's go ahead and try it on and see how this goes and wow this is very this is like pretty oversized hold on it's all it's oversized I'm very boxy actually well I'm not bad I'm kind of impressed to be honest it's not a bad shirt this is a little longer than what we just tried on but it's actually not really like technically boxy because it has this little I don't know what you call this it has like a break here and then it comes down lower in the back but which is which is kind of cool if you're looking for a boxy t-shirt and if you're at Uniqlo I would try these out in addition to that I would say the fabric is pretty nice the fabric is a little thinner than these are t-shirt that I just tried on I don't know how these will hold up in the wash way better than the like pajama type t-shirt and I don't know if you can see can you see my wife beater through it if I do this and you can see the wife beater then it's bad if I do that obviously because you know you see the crease there but if you can see right through it I'm assuming you can't because the fabric is like a little bit thicker I guess right not bad I would say the only thing pushing me away from buying this is this whole little trendy thing I've kind of stayed away from buying t-shirts that do this like little breakage here because I'm really just not into it anymore it just kind of reminds me of going to Zara and then paying for those are teas that have like zippers and weird cuts and kind of like dated back like four or five years I just try to stay away from those and just try to get like regular t-shirts also if you like cigarette holder pocket King that's also a cool thing too I also stay away from t-shirts that have these pockets I don't know why I don't I don't use the pocket much I don't smoke cigarettes I don't have anything light enough to put in my pocket if that makes sense okay we can go ahead and try on the extra-large anyway even though the large fits we can go ahead and try on the extra-large just to show you the size difference seeing that this is an extra-large I'm already we already know this is gonna be huge but anyways this is yeah it's just it's a little too boxy for me the large fit extra-large probably pass on it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next t-shirt up is from H&M not much to say about it other than the fact that I just I literally walked right eighty-thousand where's the white t-shirts found it purchased it and I just kind of held it up against my body the launch looked too small I only grabbed an extra large so I don't have large and extra-large to compare today so let's go ahead and try this on and then see the difference so as we know when it comes to like the tiers of fast fashion you talked about hmm chuckles ara you know globe whatever other fast fashion houses there are out there those are like the top three in tears it's like you know close at the top bars in the middle and sometimes they battle between top and middle and then H&M is pretty much the bottom of the barrel when it comes to that depending on the item of course all of you eyes I would say this is way thinner this fits and feels exactly like you know Glo JAMA t-shirt that is super thin it literally feels like it's from the same exact Factory my guess is that if I end up washing this and drying it it's it's like toast like literally it is probably a t-shirt that you can only wear once and then once you dry it comes out of the dryer it's like all crinkled and then on top of all of that hmm ste shirt is see-through you can totally see through it if I didn't have my wife beater on you would see nibbles and I'm telling you right now nobody on my channel would want to see that it is but if you really are I guess Ram conscious or a brand loyal to H&M and if you really want to get these shirts I would say size up this extra-large definitely feels like a large to me doesn't really feel like an XL this feels like more of like a pajama t-shirt not even for sports more pajamas a shirt that you just don't care about next shirt okay so the next and final shirt that we have up here is again from Uniqlo we're going back to Uniqlo really quick I've really wanted to talk about these because these have kind of been in conversation with a couple other channels and then also some of my friends have been wearing these as well and they've been recommending this t-shirt to me these are a little bit thicker than the previous Uniqlo t-shirts that we're talking about here today but they're a different fabric they are called crewneck short sleeve t-shirt I mean I hate when they can you give it a different name let's let's just try it on entertain myself a little bit here I'm gonna try the XL on before I try the large on even though I've never tried XL on before so the XL is actually not that bad sizing wise can't see through it right well I can't anyway it's a little too thick for you to see through this is definitely gonna be a lot warmer of a t-shirt compared to the others I would definitely not name this as a pajama t-shirt a lot thicker than actually a majority of the t-shirts that we try on here today but the only difference between this and the others are a t-shirt and you know glow like trendy fitting shirt which I will maybe give the name here is that the fabric on this is a little bit rougher on the skin it's definitely not like a soft fabric this kind of feels like like recycled fabric if like against your skin it does anyway and then also it doesn't like when you do this I know this is like a straight really strange example but when the fabric kind of rubs against your pants and also either a wife-beater underneath and stuff it just it feels like a fabric is gripping on to whatever other fabric it's touching I still prefer the Zara t-shirt over this one as far as fabric goes and also fit even though this is an extra large not really too bad of a fit I would say but let's go ahead and try all the large this is the XL let's see what the large fits like okay this is a lot smaller okay the large large works I think I think large is what do you guys think it's hard to maybe harder to tell on camera but I guess if you want the oversize fit then go for the XL or go for the size up these fit pretty true to size like this is a very true to size large I would say it definitely has a different feel since it does feel a little bit smaller than the extra-large the same specs as this this is just a large compared to an XL it kind of works out it's not bad whether or not I'll keep this one hard to say I have to I have to sleep on this one I don't know it's not it's definitely not perfect the fit is nice the collar is nice you definitely get a thicker color on these on these you do glow ones and you kind of get like this human-made looking collar the collar is a little bit tighter than the Zara one that I like so much out of this bunch but as far as like fabric goes I don't really like this fabric that much I do like the Zara one a little better because it's a lot softer than this one in particular [Music] it's my shirt here real quick yeah just have to kind of summarize this whole thing and I've been wanting to make a video like this for a long time and making a video like this just before we talk about the rest of this here is very difficult because there's too many variations when it comes to white t-shirt and also there is a lack of affordable essential t-shirts that are good geordie I would say 90% 99% besides the one percent that I want to talk about here today I actually like and I will actually keep I'm literally only going to keep one of these t-shirts and it's actually originally the t-shirt that I liked to begin with the Uniqlo one's fabric really isn't soft enough compared to the Zara t-shirt and also the Uniqlo t-shirt that had the better fabric ended up having like that really weird cut on the side of the t-shirt I'm not really a big fan of that those those type of teachers to me just feel a little bit too trendy and I'd like my t-shirts to just be regular mundane shirt instead of like some like fad fit if that's like the right words for it out of the bunch the best one is the Zara t-shirt I don't always shop as ara I know I've made a couple videos either about Zara I do talk about Zara some of my flannels suffer from Zara but you know Zara has a good like 3% of their products that I like okay the rest of them are a little bit too trendy for me and usually the quality is checked a little bit too low but as far as the Zara teacher goes compared to the rest of them I would say the thick is true to size and also the fabric is soft enough I know for a fact that these kind of last through the storm of washing them over and over and over and over and them also keeping the same shape and not wrinkling so much because of whatever particular fabric this is I think in total today I spent like how much should I spend I probably spent like over 100 it's like 120 if you're wondering yes I'm returning stuff especially returning these these don't buy these don't buy these you see these crewneck dry dry color teeth don't buy these these are these are these are pretty bad trends trash if you want to show nipples in your t-shirt and you want to show your belt while wearing the t-shirt at the same time then go ahead and buy these but if not then t-shirts are hot garbage like well don't even buy those so with all that was said today make sure you guys are girls keep the lock right here for our latest information from clothing music to culture it is your boy and I'll see you next time peace Stosh it minute yeah wait a minute we don't say whatever happened to coming into Thomas baby whatever color whatever happen to come into Dolman that's all I want to know me", "ERgE8QFfGnQ": "all right y'all so as promised i am sorry i got to turn my tv down okay so as promised i'm going to show you all a new solution on how to do sublimation on cotton um textiles okay so you're gonna need a spray bottle and you're going to need eight ounces of water in here and then you're gonna need this minwax polycrylic okay i got the clear gloss finish i don't know if the finish matters this is what i happen to get so hopefully it works okay um this is my first time doing it i saw jlo's creations on youtube i'll link her video this is originally how i uh saw this idea she's the first person who i've seen to do it this way and i'm gonna try it so i'll be sure to link her videos so you guys can check her out if you want to see how she did it so at any rate eight ounces of water two tablespoons of this poly acrylic all right so the price for this was 22 this was 17 and some change and then this was three dollars and some change so 22 dollars and look how much you're getting okay two tablespoons is nothing out of this i mean i can use this probably forever and when i bought this these are four ounces so i got two four ounce bottles off of etsy and so again you know you be the judge and i think i paid around it's on sale now because i just look but i paid around 20 some odd dollars for this so price wise they were about the same but what you get and obviously how they work are going to be totally different so um yeah let's go ahead and make the solution all right so we got a really good shake and obviously if you want to make more make more you can fill this thing all the way up just for every eight ounces of water do two tablespoons of polycrylic okay and i'm gonna get our shirt over here i've been waiting wanting to do this project on these two little shirts i got from um hobby lobby they were on clearance so i've been waiting to use them for something so this will be perfect i'm going to do like um a little theme or something on them [Music] i want to spray honey but is it open oh my god wasn't over and pretty much you want to [Music] like really get this thing wet um i don't like the spray bottle i'm gonna be honest with y'all cause it doesn't have the oopsies and i broke it broke this try to get you a nozzle that actually is a sprayer not one that just has this single spray like get one that sprays like evenly because i don't like this um all righty so what i'm going to do is sit this under the um heat press not actually put the plate down but just sit it on the um heat press is our is heat oh it's not even heating up it's already at 400 degrees so i'm just gonna kind of let this i guess dry by that heat while i do the other one and um the tutorial that i saw she actually put her stuff in she let it air dry she let one air dry and she let one dry in the dryer i'm gonna heat press these to dry them but first um like i said i'm gonna sit this underneath the heat press just kind of let it chill there until i'm done with the other one okay probably should use gloves too sorry you should probably use gloves all right and out of that solution we started out with eight ounces i'm probably at like the five ounce line all right so this two will go under the heat press and see you guys over there [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this looks like it may take longer than i was expecting so i am going to throw this stuff in the dryer y'all just to speed up the process because i have a few other things to get to today so we're going to put this in a dryer all right you guys so basically here we have it okay this is our um our prints i got both of these off of etsy i don't know for some reason the quality on this one doesn't seem as nice as this one and i did not distort it a lot but um that's what i have these were in a dryer they do have a little bit of stiffness about them from going in the dryer i'm not sure why that is but they do have a little bit of stiffness to them all right so it's hot i know [Music] okay so see that right there the black hair didn't go didn't get absorbed all the way another thing is that i think i was way too high 400 degrees is way too high for this considering i put a chemical solution on here so look at that see how it's yellowing around there which i know there's ways to fix that um i don't really care to fix it oh that's hot and here's our little boss man so how do i like this they're okay there is some yellowing and y'all i honestly is getting late because this kind of was a long process does it work absolutely does work um oh that's hot but that looked a lot better this looks a lot better than the shirt i did yesterday for corey and this is pink and that was a gray shirt so there's no way that this light pink should be popping to me any more than a gray shirt um i obviously didn't put enough solution there so it's important to saturate well because the black hair didn't really take but you guys it does work and it can be done this black is a little iffy too but overall y'all it does look good i'm actually going to wash them i'm going to wash them and see if this residue comes off and so we can get a test on how they look after they've been washed so i'm gonna do that too so anyway y'all don't forget to like comment subscribe let me know um what you guys think about this do you all think that it's worth you know doing your own poly um poly tea spray or not even poly tea spray but doing your own sublimation spray and doing these shirts definitely will play around with the heat settings i most certainly will be doing this again and i think i'm going to lower my temperature to 350 and i'm going to do it in 60 second increments and then going from there i think 400 is too high especially considering we sprayed a chemical on there that's the first mistake so we'll definitely redo it so anyway all right y'all bye hey guys so i am back and here are the shirts with after they've been washed and i don't know if you all recall this one the pigment wasn't that great to begin with and it's definitely horrible now and i think that the color even bled not think it did the color bled after washing and it set for a few days and you guys can see the splotches where the color wasn't even to begin with with this one and of course it did fade um the image is still there i don't know what's so different about this then have we not treated it versus have we um versus how we did treat it like if using cotton so i don't know how helpful this is to you all but this is the after the wash i will insert a picture of the befores and do i feel that it's worth it no not really could it also be user error most certainly you guys know that that was my first time doing it i can definitely try it again and see how it turns out oh and then for corey's y'all his was even worse i used the um poly t sublimation spray for his did i look at that his face is completely gone you do see the tick tock name but look at that this is completely gone and that's using the [Music] subletty spray from etsy so yeah that's this time i can try it again i may try it again guys using something smaller see if i can get better results and i'll follow instructions by the t for the subletting because i didn't lose it but i did take a screenshot so hopefully possibly i can redo it and follow the directions to the t for the poly t and then for the acrylic for the poly acrylic and water i don't know i can try it again y'all and see what else we can come up with but this was the wash test and they do not pass in my book so yeah um if y'all have any suggestions comments leave them down below and let's talk about it bye y'all", "9h4Cj26ZZB4": "[Music] [Music] hey everybody welcome to another screen-printing video by cats bit productions thanks a lot for clicking on my video today I really appreciate your time and attention and of course if you like my videos make sure to subscribe to my youtube channel right now alright so try to make this a little shorter than the last one if possible just checking out some more shirts little t-shirt reviews remember that this is very casual it's not supposed to be scientific or anything like that I'm just kind of checking them out letting you know what I think about them casually and that's about it doing a couple test prints just for fun and checking these shirts out so today I have a couple of gilt ins and we have a soft style 64000 I think is the model number and then a guild in 2000 I think is this one and a lot of people know the guild in 5000 so I thought we would look at these two gilded shirts so let's take a quick close up look at the shirt itself and then do a couple test prints alright so this is the Gildan soft style it's like six four zero zero zero 64,000 if that's correct guild and soft style soft style delta t and it looks kind of like a fashion cut you know it's not really boxy and the surface is soft feels pretty soft you know stitching looks pretty good you know if you look at the collar on sleeves and stuff it looks pretty you know centered and well-formed you know I don't see any strings or anything hand you know looks like a decent shirt nicely made feels pretty soft this one probably will fit a little you know tighter than the Gildan 5000 would you know but just checking it out the stitching looks pretty decent and everything looks excuse me looks pretty good and I like the soft feel of this one and that it's not such a boxy cut here's the Gildan 2000 ultra cotton adult t-shirt and this one you know feels a little bit how do you say it's not a soft so you know theoretically it might have a better print surface possibly than the other one we were just looking at again stitching looks pretty good these two specimens that I have here look pretty straight pretty uniform stitching looks pretty good there's a little you know spot of bundled up stitch right there in the collar but that's not too bad up here so that's interesting there's a little wad of fabric or you know thread or whatever okay let's see does this one have a lot not really but there are a couple strings hanging here in those same spots not on this side but this one so that's interesting it's a little piece of thread hanging out over here in the collar on these two you know and then this one has some little wad of thread over here or something I'd have to look at it closer because I'm blind I can't see so but you know looks okay you know so you know but I mean in other words it looks like advice well made sure there may be some I don't know I'd have to see more of them you know to make sure of it you know these are only this is only two out of a lot so who knows but it doesn't look too bad you know the true you know what is it the proof is in the pudding when I try them on and stuff like that you really get a feel for how the garment is made okay so here's the Gildan 2000 ultra cotton adult t-shirt preshrunk 100% cotton Jersey net six ounce t-shirt this one printed pretty well it's not as soft as the other one we're looking at the sixty four thousand or whatever that is they're the soft style so it seems to print pretty well and pretty sharp looks good let's check out the spot color okay so again pretty sharp seems like a decent print surface the knit is good you know for screen printing seems pretty decent you should be able to get some fairly detailed prints all right and then the 64,000 Gildan soft style adult tea again actually you know I was pretty impressed it has a soft you know knit or or feeling to it but it actually printed pretty well I think the this halftone design I like the way printed better than the spa color there could be you know much more of a chance for fibrillation on this shirt alright so you know less ink I don't know it just this one kind of looks better to me I think this this halftone print not sure why exactly not sure why let's see sorry alright so here's the spot color and it printed well I thought it would not print as well as it did honestly like I'm saying but it printed pretty good but yeah maybe you know more of a chance for fibrillation than the than the mm okay so the Gildan soft style 64,000 is a four and a half ounce 100% cotton ring-spun t-shirt its preshrunk knit fabric so yeah so that's probably why it feels a little bit smaller than the mm maybe but we'll take these home and wash them and see what happens yeah okay yeah it's already getting warm here this I had to turn the dryer off already so all right so I've got my specimens here I've got them separated marked just in case you know they're actually pretty different I should be able to tell by the shirts but so yeah I'll bring them home I'll wash them bring them back tomorrow and then we'll try them on and give you the kind of you know what I think about the bottom line of what I think about these shirts and like I said before it's just a casual little look at these to give you any information that I can share just by taking a little look at them and sharing what I see what I can feel you know stuff like that but by no means am I trying to be scientific or find the best shirt to print on or anything like that that's not what I'm doing here I'm just checking out some t-shirts and giving you as much you know casual information about them that I can wash testing and printing on them and just a general kind of feel okay so that's it let's get these done and we'll be back okay so I took both of these shirts here all of these specimens and I took them home washed them inside out you know regular cycle not a gentle cycle or anything and dried them in the dryer tumble dry that sort of thing and so now I'm taking a look at them you see sometimes also you know when you have a t-shirt that's brand new it looks pretty good and then sometimes if you wash it and dry it when it shrinks thinks it can happen as well to the stitching even right so it's interesting to do this and take a look at different shirts just to see but I was actually I was actually impressed with the way the soft style you know the 64,000 soft style adult shirt printed is very soft but it printed quite well and the the mm the killed in two thousand printed pretty well also and you know so now I you know let's take a look at these a little bit close-up of course and then I tried them on and that's really where I kind of get an overall feel for the shirt I'm wondering if the Gildan you know soft style is gonna be really tight as opposed to the mm so let's see if we can take a quick look at the print surface and then we'll try them on this is the guild in 2000 okay and yeah actually I was impressed with the way these washed you know printed and washed I think you know compared to the Hanes you know we did the Hanes review and I just think the print looks better after washing with these gild ins than it did on the Hanes but you know who knows I'm not sure if that's you know did you know what I'm saying it just I don't know for some reason I think I like these better as far as printing and washing them they you know they look pretty good so you know also though I noticed the necks the collar on the mm we'll have to see when we try these on but they look really small so let's see about that this is the Gildan soft style 64,000 6-4 of zero-zero-zero Gildan soft style and again I was actually impressed with the way it printed I thought these would have you know more fibrillation problems and you know you can always have fibrillation if you caused it yourself you know what I'm saying but some shirts are more prone to it than others and even though these were kind of soft feeling it they seem to do quite well with that again the stitching on both of these Gildan specimens the mm and the soft style you know they went on the palate pretty well the stitching looks pretty straight and all that and you know once again the wash you know the way the print looks after the wash I kind of I don't know hey I don't know if it's just weird or if it's just the weird happenstance but I like the way this print looks better washed on these guildenstone I did on the Hanes and you know one of the Hanes was a beefy T which is an expensive shirt and it's supposed to have a nice print surface and stuff and it does and it's a really nice shirt but you know I'm actually impressed with the after wash look of the print on these gild ins so that's interesting oh sorry but okay I just put on the the Gildan soft style you know 64000 or 64000 Gildan soft style of del t and I'm just laughing because it's really tight and this is what I was saying before about sizes you know of shirts each brand and even style within a brand can run differently in the way they're cut so this is a medium you know all the shirts that I'm doing are mediums but this is way too small for me I mean it's I mean it's like yeah if this is if I ordered this as a medium and I'd be like I'd be bummed this is this is way too tight for me okay so that definitely is something you know to be concerned about the collar feels okay it's not it's not choking me or anything but I'm getting choked in the armpits and around the chest very tight and you know that can be uncomfortable sometimes you know for people who aren't into the so let's try out the gilded mm okay so this is the gilt in 2000 and it definitely fits much better it's more of the medium you know the collar the collar is a little bit small as I mentioned earlier I do feel the collar it's interesting the soft style the other shirt the collar felt a lot better this one it's definitely a little bit tighter around my neck but the cut is more generous it's it's more of a medium it's probably right you know since I washed it and it's shrunk so it's probably about right but I have to say that it feels when I first put it on I laughed and I said this feels like sandpaper so it's kind of it has a little bit of a rough feel you might need fabric softener with this shirt you know the soft style Gildan 64000 model was much more comfortable in the feel of the fabric but it was way too tight this one seems okay in the cut the neck is a little tight and it's a little rough or something so interesting things I never actually really you know doing these comparisons like this is interesting for me because I've never done anything like this before so to feel the difference is and and what not myself by trying each shirt on and printing them and touching and working with them is actually more interesting than I thought it would be yeah actually I might suggest this for you as a screen printer the person who sells the shirts you know if you actually were able to try them on and test print them I think it's actually a valuable exercise obviously you couldn't do ever shirt on the market but you could do some of the most popular sellers for your particular print shop yeah so very interesting that's it for today that's all I have I think the these two definitely you know they they pass muster you know they're definitely good shirts professionally made the stitching was good they went on the okay seems to have good print ability good wash ability just the major differences in comfort and feel and the way they fit I think are the most important factors in this little casual review here so I hope you found something valuable in this video I hope it wasn't too long it probably was longer than the first one and I hope the focus was okay because I had to experiment with locking the focus and stuff so hopefully it's okay and you will forgive me for any shortcomings in this video thanks a lot for watching I really appreciate your time and attention make sure to

"pBVQIeyHKrY": "What's up everybody? We're talking today about the American Apparel\n2001 unisex 100% cotton t-shirt. Now this is the t-shirt that started the soft\nt-shirt revolution. So, it has a tailored fit, 100% ring spun\ncotton, super soft. But instead of just telling you about it,\nwe have a model, she's going to come over. And just show it. So now this is the unisex fit, it also comes\nin the womens, but as you can see the unisex -- the sleeves are still, they're slimmer\nfitting, a little longer than the womens feature, but it has a side seam here that means it's\ngoing to be more contoured to your body. Soft 100% ring spun cotton. If you're looking to order this I'd say feel\nthe difference because once you go with the American Apparel 100% cotton t-shirt, you're\nnever going to want to go back to a normal 100% cotton. You're going to be spoiled. And you know what? That's okay because it's the best shirt out\nthere. So, check it out: coedmonkey.com.

a cool peel so I'm just gonna pull it off a little bit because again lower heating element and peel it off so to summarize on our 100% cotton lose the fashionfilm we applied it at 320 degrees for 12 to 15 seconds on the Heather we use our premium plus at 275 degrees for 7 to 10 seconds and on a tribe lens we use our premium plus 300 degrees on the bottom with using our lower heating element 250 on our top heating element for 7 to 10 seconds don't forget to subscribe for more content like this we come out with a new video every week [Music]", "KL9iwaWrLPI": "Today we're talking about the District\nThreads 100% ringspun cotton vintage wash t-shirt. Now this is one of my favorite t-shirts personally for a few reasons. One it is so soft and also it's so thin now\nyou can often have like kind of a soft shirt but the thinness of this fabric, it's about a 3.7 ounce fabric, 100% ring-spun cotton so it just feels so airy, so light. When you're wearing it, it just flows, which is awesome. It also has been garment washed so it has a kind of a more, I guess organic or\nvintage-y feel to it. It doesn't have that bright pop of a color, it has a more muted feel. Great fit, great fabric. Instead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models here coming over to show it off. Now, first thing you're gonna notice, is a great fit. You can see the side seam is just naturally gonna hug your sides. It's not gonna be big and boxy. The next thing though, is all about the neckline on this shirt. A much thinner collar. So this is a, I'd say, more trendy shirt. You're talking about a really thin fabric, a cool more vintage-y, earthy, color because of that wash applied to it, and then this collar being a little thinner makes this look like a\nlittle more expensive of a shirt. The price point is awesome on this. It's gonna be a little more expensive than the hundred percent ring-spun, but worth every penny. The sleeve right here comes to mid-bicep again, a great sleeve length, not baggy. That's the big thing about district threads, a lot of the upper echelon brands, American Apparel, Alternative, we don't want baggy and this is not baggy. If we're going to put this kind of in a category though, its gonna be between a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, and kind of a 50/50 or 60/40 in terms of softness. It is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, so over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, it could start pilling, it might offer a little\nshrinking if you dry your clothes on super high. But if you're thinking about what size should I order? It is very true to size and we do offer size charts on our site you can look at. Now this is a great shirt all around but since it is kind of that more muted and washed color we would recommend keeping the print super simple we love vintage ink on a soft shirt like this. Vintage ink meaning a softer coat of ink. It's a thinner, thinner coat of ink that allows some of the shirt color to come through, which is just amazing because this shirt doesn't need to have a ton of ink coverage. This shirt says a lot let the ink kind of just compliment it. That vintage white on it or a thin coat of navy or black or whatever complimenting color is perfect. If you wanted a bright white, we always offer standard ink also, or a bright yellow or whatever. But the vintage is amazing on this shirt. Tyler you look awesome in it, thank you so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters, and so do our customers.", "lgzpQulFVOE": "t-shirts are always one of the main things I feel like we're all looking to buy because there's so many different brands out there there's so much different quality out there and finding good quality basic street wear shirts and obviously sometimes pretty different personally I love to avoid all the cheap kind of brands out there and I like to buy a little bit more premium quality when it comes to stuff like shirts so today's video I want to talk about one of the new brands I've found in terms of basic clothing and that is reporter and today we're gonna be talking about all about reporter t-shirts up without saying too much more let's get into it what's up guys if you're new here my name is Matt I make a ton of videos like this on YouTube twice a week usually if you're new here I suggest subscribing them below it is definitely a growing community and I appreciate all the support I get in every video so let's talk about reporter who is reporter well reporter is a wholesale like dirt hoodie sweatshirt sweat pant company and they really try to capitalize on people who are looking for very basic clothing but a more premium quality so today we're gonna talk to my t-shirt I picked up three of them in my left hand which would be on your right side was gonna be a black I'm currently wearing their vintage wash shirt and on my right your left will be the white t-shirt so something interesting to note about with all these shirts is that they're all made in Portugal there's different levels of cotton that they use all three of the ones I'm wearing right now are more of their like ultra luxury ones which in my opinion are just heavier t-shirts I actually did order two white ones that were supposed to be one in the regular original version and one of the luxury cotton version but they ran out of the white one in my size and the reason why I wanted two of those is really because of how I've been wearing my shirts and stuff lately is I've been wearing stuff like this under like a sweatshirt or something that's what kind of piece of the bottom and picks out a little bit at the top but honestly the guys over at reporters or customer service can reach out to me and actually texted me saying hey like we'll give you an upgrade to the ultra version because it ran out and in my opinion I need to mention that because you don't get that all the time and most people would have just canceled the order they wouldn't even let you know they would just strip just cancel if you get one shirt and be curious on why so for them to reach out honestly I thought was worth mentioning it lets me know what the customer service team cares lets me know the Britain cares about the customer more than it cares about like three dollars in profit and I'm hoping that I can help them of the three dollars of loss and profit for me can go ahead and go back into other people buying their stuff and know this isn't a sponsor post didn't get any of these products to free I just got like the ultra version of this one at a slightly discounted rate but not on purpose so getting it to the actual quality of the shirt some stuff I'm talking about everything else but the shirt quality honestly these are extremely good quality shirts they're very thick they feel way better than gilding they feel way better than American Apparel in my opinion iOS a that they feel better than some of the LA apparel they're better than pretty much any other quality shirt that's like a wholesale division that I felt personally I'd say these are closer to what you will find in an essentials t-shirt than what you will find with the minimal ones and even I'm going on record and saying I actually love the quality of this so much better than the essentials teachers and I think the main differences between these reporter shirts and essentials are kind of twofold one is that these have virtually no branding on these like literally is no branding because you're supposed to put your own branding on this is supposed to be for like a brand to buy but if you look there's literally no tag here at all it's just my size tag which I about these all and a medium i think the other difference between this and an essentials teacher would be that the neck collar is a little bit higher up it is more like kind of reaching more mock neck territory when it comes to kind of how its spinning this is the only thing that i don't really care for on this i wish it was a little bit lower because like my collarbone is down here and it is like way up here you can probably even see that i have like a tan this is where I normally have my t-shirts and it's a lot higher than that something to keep in mind for for summer because if you can have a tan you really don't want this a shirt on at that point cousin you have a tan up here and any heavy either tan down here something to keep in mind now in terms of sizing I went down the size I normally wear a large and all my shirts it's my true to size size I went down to medium just based off their size guide fact I didn't really want arm links that went down past my elbow and for me these fit perfectly how I wanted it to I didn't want super oversize but I did want it more of a drop shoulder relaxed fit and for me personally this fits the cut and with sizing on this for me personally I went down size you can go true to size and I've definitely seen it work the guy that really pushed my hand to buying this was on the Facebook group so looked at someone honey I think is like Luciano and hopefully I'll have like some type of photo up of his Instagram page but he was really the person I saw and he went true to size with his shirts I went down a size and I personally feel like that fits better for how I like my clothing and not looking super duper big and stuff but just looking just right for me I honestly think with this vintage wash I think that could have been a little bit better of a wash with it pairing it to this locusts and wild honey t-shirt that I bought from Paul funny fella when he dropped it this is a vintage watch shirt through and through a little bit softer feel to it I would say that the wash on the t-shirt is night and day you can pretty much see the difference like this is more like a wash black this is in my opinion a vintage wash but then again this could wash down where the wall I haven't put these in the washing machine yet although I do plan on putting this one in the washing machine soon sure suit I can't frickin talk today and just kind of see how that turns out be really interesting to see if I can turn it more into this vintage style look that's kind of why I bought it rather than just like kind of washed black we're just gonna looks like a dark grey in a way I think the only improvements that could be made to this shirt to make it perfect for me personally so just definitely differs from person to person I'll be lowering the neck a little bit probably like an inch down it'd be a little bit more of a normal like look to it but still being able to peek out a little bit under like a sweatshirt or things like that and for me I don't really care for super long what's called sleeves on stuff I like a little bit shorter so having it like in the middle of where your arm and meet with still drop shoulder I think would look really good but being in the minority there but just something that personal preference for all this everybody has their own preferences from me something like that I think it would be my everyday wear for t-shirts I do plan on checking out their hoodies and sweatpants once we drop more the vintage II wash stuff and I'll be giving my thoughts on them in a video once that comes along but overall from what I've seen in the Facebook group with other people talking definitely worth the money you definitely have racer prices a little bit to be very worried about that if you're looking for best quality street wear blanks that you can basically buy a better quality t-shirt for pretty low prices made in Portugal using very high quality Cotton's I would say that reporter is our best bet and I would say they are someone that you should starting to buy from and if all else fails you spend $25 that $30 on a t-shirt and if you don't like you don't like it I guarantee you you spent more on t-shirts that don't fit you well and if all spills can wear it to that there's no branding on them I don't really know it's ink go buy one for yourself I'll leave a link to them down in the description below and well if you want to start a brand with these go ahead you're probably the best feeling t-shirts on the market for like branding with your own screen print on them and that has been today's video about reporter let me know you gets to give them in the comments below if you have any thoughts or different opinions leave them below I would love to hear them and I think would help other people with their purchases and if you want to I would suggest subscribing below

here is the best and because the rest of the apartment right now is a mess so that is what you're getting right now a wall enjoy congratulations i am in the market for a white t-shirt i want a crew neck t-shirt i feel like they're a little bit more i don't know put together looking uh and i have a very strange way about like myself i am very research oriented and analytical and i always need to look at all the options before choosing what works for me so uh when i realized i need a white t-shirt i was like well i gotta try them all on first like all the white t-shirts out there it's honestly quite annoying and exhausting sometimes to be like that but well that is me so what am i gonna do i obviously cannot try all the t-shirts on all the t-shirts in the world i can't that said i did order quite a bit and uh i'm gonna take you guys with me on this wonderful wonderful journey of figuring figuring out which white t-shirt is the best white t-shirt of them all asos h m everlane and cotton these are our t-shirts for today i think asus has several brands in it so we'll open them up we'll feel them we'll try them on and we'll decide what do we think about it let's go also can we all appreciate the fact that i did my eyes today for this video i was very nervous because i pretty much have not used makeup this year because you don't need it in quarantine but this was quite an endeavor see i think it turned out pretty cute making some effort over here all right okay so first a sauce let's see what we have i ordered it quite a while ago so i honestly don't remember very well what is it that's in every bag okay let's unbox this oh look at that so this is a stradivarius strategy values t-shirt it's a two pack it's actually a white and a black t-shirt so if it works it will be double bingo because who doesn't need a black t-shirt you know um so that looks cute [Music] then we have topshop this looks cute as well damn topshop boxy t-shirt in white i see you okay and then we go with mango mango actually doesn't feel that nicely done but we'll have to try it on h m let's see h and then a good old friend i first went shopping at h m when i lived in sweden on a study abroad it was a very swedish experience i was like what is this store uh and you know little did we know that they would conquer the world uh and i have an h m tish t-shirt divide from the divided line okay i have a t h m t-shirt from the basics line and i have more like a cream cream t-shirt also from the divided line everlane i've been obsessed with everlane their quality is so amazing they are transparent they are not very expensive so honestly like i could order so much from everlane i already have so much from everlane so let's see how their t-shirts do [Music] i ordered quite a bit of everlane t-shirts honestly quite a bit i'm just gonna try them on all already because like there's like five t-shirts here oh my god this is gonna be a long video [Music] did i order different sizes that's what happens when you order and then you forget um okay i think i'm gonna have analysis paralysis here but that's for small something i ordered something black what's black jesus okay everlane we'll get to you last but not least a brand called cotton k-o-t-n i learned about it from uh the instagram account of a fashion blogger her name is abby the instagram account is clothes and pizza and she is wonderful and she pays attention to sustainable fashion and i learned about this company from her comes in this you know brown baggie it comes wrapped nicely that's clearly when you know that you order from a good company they pay attention to details like that because they actually have you know they're not that focused on producing a massive amounts in the shortest time for the cheapest price so that's what they are cotton c cotton cotton uh and i have a white and a black t-shirt from them there first contender is from everlane this is a classic t-shirt a pretty good fit a little tiny bit of snug but i'm sure it will stretch uh it has a little bit of a more of a crew neck stitching here the classic one i like it it's a little more see-through than i would want it to be but um i mean it's also a white cotton t-shirt like what do you expect and generally i really like the feel of it i like that it's slightly elongated so that i can do the tuck you know the french tuck or whatever talk you want to do on it hello tan friends yeah this is like the classic t-shirt feels really good again organic cotton 100 and i like this kind of like accentuated crew stitching here through neck next is this i have so many plastic bags on the floor right now uh it's another everlane t-shirt it's the pocket t-shirt because it has a pocket um it's pretty good it's more of a boxy cut than the previous one so a little more on trend a little more relaxed uh i kind of like it more compared to the previous one because it's not as snug and again it's this very nice cotton which feels really nice and soft uh i like it another evalene t-shirt it's called the raglan tea it has this a-line cut to it here is the stitching over here it kind of needs a bit of a steam but you can get the feel out of it it has this nice a-line silhouette to it which i think really elongates your arms and the neck and makes you look very you know sophisticated uh i love it actually this is not something that i was looking for i was looking more for a regular t-shirt but this is just very nice [Music] it's kind of a regular white t-shirt but a little bit more elevated this is a t-shirt from the brand called cotton k-o-t-n uh and it's also a classic crew neck t-shirt uh the cut is a little bit wider than the previous evelyn classic crew night t-shirt um but it's really cute too the material is very similar to what everlane does maybe it's a little bit more see-through but honestly hard to tell and look at this nice touch and and their packaging there is a there's a photo of people who make this i don't know if these lovely ladies are making this particular t-shirt but they work at the company and cotton actually has a pretty elaborate website that shows their factories and how they work very nice option it's more expensive than ever lane and maybe i like the cut at everlane of the neck line cut better at everything this is tough this is a very obviously oversized t-shirt it's from h m um it's i'm in love with every white t-shirt apparently so that's gonna be that it has a bit of a drop sleeve here so i think that's what makes it look so nice uh and again the the nice crew neck uh like folding and stick i don't know how to explain but when they make this neckline so kind of like chunky chunky-ish but i love it um that's if i want to have a bit of a oversized boxy a t-shirt which maybe i do now i don't even know uh but this looks nice and obviously all asian them t-shirts uh much cheaper than everland or cotton uh i don't think it's like a crisp white it has a tiny bit of a nude in it a tiny bit of like a cream to it but uh and maybe i want a crisp white t-shirt i think i do um but it's nice too i kind of have the same t-shirt uh more like a new t-shirt that i borrow from mike all the time so i might not need this one by the way yes oversized t-shirts first go through your husband's boyfriend's partner's wife's closet might find some very nice items there another white t-shirt from h m this is from the basics line uh this t-shirt is actually much different from all the other ones because this cotton is much happier much silkier and much less see-through if at all from compared to all the other t-shirts that i've been trying on it also has this crew neck um it's boxy but not too much i can still tuck it in tuck it in uh or not i kind of love it because it has this heavy expensive feel to it like this could be like um like a nicer t-shirt that you can like go out in for the evening or something like it just has this very expensive feel to it because it's a heavier material we like it a lot the last h m t-shirt that we're going to look at today it's from their divided collection and it has a lighter feel to it the material is lighter compared to the previous t-shirt and obviously it also has this cap sleeve which some people like some people don't it gives you more of a like you know a bit of like a muscular buff feel of this that's how i feel in it uh it's a little more fitted but other than that it's a great t-shirt uh maybe not for me not so much since i already looked at so many that i i can tell that maybe this is not exactly what i want and what i feel like today but other than that it's a great trick check it out i am moving on to my order from asos and this is a t-shirt from topshop uh this is kind of uh reminds me of this raglan tea from everlane because of this a-line silhouette but this is actually not as a line now that i look at it it's more just like a boxy silhouette and the material is nice and heavy which i love uh it's similar in what the h m t-shirt was like in the way it feels like nice and heavy and expensive uh yeah i mean this is pretty cool this is small all the t-shirts i was wearing they are the size small so you can get an idea of what works for you and what doesn't i'm usually small but sometimes that could be medium depending on the fit and what not uh but yeah this is very nice again this is a crew neck with a nice neckline um and i love this one obviously needs a bit of a steam again but other than that like i feel so comfortable in it this is interesting this t-shirt is from stradivarius as you can see it's a crop t-shirt again size small and it comes as a two pack a white t-shirt and a black t-shirt and to make sure that it stays as a two pack they decided to tie it together uh so that's the black t-shirt and i just don't want to cut the tags just yet but you can see that they're tied together so that's how i'm gonna model it for you now tied together um i might actually get i don't know we'll see about that uh it's kind of inconvenient that i can't just try it on by itself uh but it's a pretty nice crop look it's a boxy fit it is a size small uh so true to size and um it's a nice material it's not uh too light or too heavy i don't know but uh it's nice it's a it's a cute t-shirt if you want a cropped t-shirt for your high-waisted jeans and obviously if you want a black t-shirt to go with it it's also there i actually do need a black t-shirt like that so they actually last t-shirt i just couldn't find it and then i thought i was done i'm like oh my god this is like an unopened bag still here this is a t-shirt from mango again it's within my asos order and i don't think it's gonna be a contender to be honest after looking at all these t-shirts i don't think so uh i feel like this neckline will stretch sooner than later i feel like i don't want my t-shirt to stretch right away and something about this t-shirt tells me that i will pretty soon so thank you for bearing with me and looking at all these t-shirts with me uh i think i will have to pick two because honestly there's so many great options and i feel like a white t-shirt is something that i will wear the hell out of so i might as well have slightly couple slightly different ones and wear them to different occasions or just around the house and so on and so on so i think i will certainly go with this t-shirt from everlane it's a classic crew neck and i think because it gives me some sort of like james dean vibes i don't know or like marilyn brando you know the photo where he's like and james dean also they do that they like stand by the wall and like they're hot and they wear a white t-shirt i don't know something about this crew neck here like it's a little rougher looking crew neckline here so something about that gives me those feels i don't know why but i will go with this t-shirt it's also slightly more fitted so i could like throw a blazer on top it could be a more elegant outfit uh because it's just a classic and the second t-shirt will be hold on don't go anywhere i'm gonna change and the second t-shirt is from h and them it's the one with the heavier material it's slightly more boxy and oversized looking so that's why i'm gonna keep it uh and i like it i like my little t-shirts combo what do you guys think um and then this one just makes me feel so comfortable thank you so much for watching my crazy t-shirt chaos here i hope it helped you understand more like what's out on the market right now there is a lot of great

one of my chores or tasks today is to take a shirt that doesn't fit me and somehow make it fit me target has these great new Star Wars shirts but they're in the young men's department so they're all athletic fit and they only go up to a 2x so I got a 2x and I need a 3x and a regular fit but I've got a little method that I use to kind of make a shirt work for me and I'm gonna show you that today give me a second here and I'll show you a full shot of what I look like in the shirt okay so here's a full shot of me in the shirt as you can see it's uh not doing me any favors and the sleeves really tight around the midsection getting some unflattering roll action here you can see the my shorts underneath the zipper and all that kind of stuff so not not perfect a little snug I also really don't like how tight the neck is so I'm going to see if I can stretch the fabric a little or work the fabric a little to make it work for me and I'll show you what the processes that I use okay here's a better shot of the graphic you can see it's really cute it's got sort of an 80s vibe to it the fabric is 55% cotton 45% polyester which means once I get this once I work the fabric the way I want to it'll probably pretty much stay that way we're gonna start off making the neck hole a little larger to me when you see the small crew neck neck hole like this it is a clear indicator that a woman is wearing a man's shirt woman's neck holes even for the crewneck shirts tend to be a little bit roomier not as tight so what we're gonna do is make it a little larger by very gently pulling on the fabric notice I'm not pulling on the seams down here when I pull I'm pulling above it now if worse comes to worse and you have a neck hole that will not budge and it's driving you crazy you can cut the neckline off just above the stitching here and it won't be you know the net well the neckline won't fall apart and then when you have like a seam in here too you want to pull in front of that seam and pull behind the seam so that you keep the seam intact okay let's take a look at it and see what it looks like now that we've stretched it out a little bit Wow as you can see that made a huge difference that opening is much much larger now in the shirt and will look a little bit more feminine so the next thing we're going to work on is the sleeves the sleeves on this shirt are a little short and a little tight definitely really really tight around here so what I'm going to do with this is the same thing that I did with the neckline giving it a good stretch being really careful not to overdo it with the seams remember to protect that seam they're a little widen the armhole a little bit and then to get the length that you want on the sleeve to be a little longer you're just going to stretch the fabric down notice I'm doing I'm like I'm sort of like taking it and gathering it up as I go down and pulling it across you don't want to just randomly rip out it be a little thoughtful the process so that is something I'll do I'll pull down on the sleeve more like that I'll repeat everything I did to the sleeve here I'll repeat widening the sleeve and I'll also repeat this process a couple of times to to make it a little wider here just gently pulling the fabric to stretch it so I'm gonna actually take a moment to go through and do that same process to this sleeve a couple of times and then I'll pull over the other sleeve for you and show you the difference and what a difference it makes just to stretch the fabric a little bit okay as you can see after just a moment or two of doing a little bit of light stretching on the sleeve there's a significant difference in the size maybe about three-quarters of an inch in length and width so this is fantastic we'll do this to the other sleeve and then I'll show you what to do to give you a little bit of more volume around the bottom of this of the shirt so for the bottom hem of the shirt you're gonna work it just like you did the neckline and sleeves you want to be very careful and mindful of your stitches that you don't pop them but you're gonna give it a nice steady stretch like this all the way around I like to do it two sometimes three times and you'll do it the entire hem all the way around and then move up the shirt gather the fabric towards you and start doing the same stretch for width across the front and back of the shirt I want you to stop though when you're stretching across the top of your shirt stop when you get to the graphic you do not want to stretch the graphic if you stretch your graphic it's going to crack you want to stretch the areas below it and you can work the areas above it and if you need to get more stretch in the fabric or for this area here across the abdomen or across the bustline you're going to stretch the fabric on the back of the shirt where there isn't too graphic you can work the living daylights out of this fabric back here one of the other key things I want to let you know too is after you've stretched the width of the shirt across the front you're going to grab the fabric and start stretching it lengthwise don't grab the whole shirt just like open it up put your hand inside of it like that and stretch the length if you only stretch the width of the shirt what you're gonna do is you're gonna make the shirt shrink it'll be wider but it'll be shorter so you do have to work the fabric in both directions both across and both down and just be mindful of the graphic and you should be great okay so I put the shirt back on for you so you can get a better look at it I don't know if you can see I try to shoot this so you can see it better but the neckline is not as tight up here a little bit looser a little more room it's not like choking me to death and as you can see it's no longer clinging to my midsection like it was before it's a tiny bit longer I mean actually have that blouse stuff a little bit but it's a shirts a little bit longer a couple inches longer definitely a few inches wider it definitely has more give in room in the sleeves sleeves still aren't my favorite thing I can still work on those because there's yet another step to this process the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to wash the shirt and then after I wash it I'm going to gently go through that same process of where I will pull the fabric across the width and then also the length to continue to give it length and give it a little more give in areas where I need it probably a little more through here and also the sleeves and the neckline so I'll show you that process coming up next well it looks like the shirt came out pretty good straight out of the wash so when I washed it I washed it in cold water with other bright colors and I did it on like a regular cycle light too regular cycle and now that I have a damp I'm taking a look at it and you notice that neckline that maybe looked a little stretched out before like you could see the waffling is no longer there there's no waffling because when I washed it it just maybe it tightened up a little bit I'm not sure but that's one of the things that you can expect to happen when you wash the garment naturally the fibers will tighten up a little bit so what I'm gonna do now now that it's damp is I'm gonna follow those same steps we had before where I'm going to go ahead and work on the neck a little bit be careful here because when it's wet it's going to stretch a lot it'll shrink up a little bit when it dries but it'll really really really really really stretch out a lot when it's wet so you know you don't want to go too far and stretch it out so much that it's completely out of shape so what you want to do though is when you are stretching the fabric every now and then stop take a look at it make sure it's going in the direction that you want it to go in and not like getting overly big or you know hold up the garment on the bottom and make sure your hem is straight all the way across and like your back your garment isn't longer than the front unless of course that's the way you want it so what I'm gonna do is the same thing like I said before that we did before where I'm just gonna gently pull the fabric out my issue that I had before was with the sleeves and I still think the sleeves look kind of small so I'm gonna work on the sleeves a little bit I'm gonna work on the neckline a little bit and probably the bottom hem or like the center section the midsection of the shirt and stretch it out a little bit and then I'm gonna hang it up and I'll show you how I do that I have finished stretching my garment and I think I have it just about the way I want it so now it's time to hang it up I have a little tip for you I use the joy Mangano huggable hangers I think you can get them at Target you can also get them on hsn.com they're great because they have like a little light flocking on the fabric it keeps your shirts and tops and even tank tops and things from slipping off and they're generously sized so you can if you're a plus size person these are great hangers they're not oversized but they are big enough to really accommodate your shirts so one of the things you get sometimes when you're hanging a shirt is where the end of the hanger is you get like a little point and then when you go to put the shirt on this little point of a little poof of fabric sticks out and it looks a little weird and it doesn't lay flat here's a little tip on how to avoid that so I don't know if you can see what I'm doing here but I'm taking this seam in the shoulder and I'm lining it up directly on top of the top edge of the hanger so when you do that this fabric in the shoulder seam is a little stiffer and it's not going to get that little pinch that you sometimes get with hangers but these hangers tend to be better about that anyhow because they come down on the edges on the bottom a little so you probably won't have as much of an issue with that but that's basically what I do I line it up like that and I hang it up so I'm going to hang this up and just let it dry for a day or two and see what it looks like I'll try it on for you and another day or two and we'll see what it looks like if I'm not happy with that I'll probably dampen it again and do another stretching session and then rehang it but I'll be back in a couple days to show you how it turned out well here it is the finished project as you can see a little bit looser in the neckline definitely plenty of room in the bust a lot more room through the midsection and a little bit more length the sleeves have a little more give a little more room and in general it's just a little more comfortable to wear so normally I would wear a woman's 4 or 5 X and if it has Star Wars on it or Disney on the front of the t-shirt you know it's going to be 30 to 60 bucks so eight dollars for shirt from the young men's section that's a 2 XL that I stretched into maybe the size of like a 3 or 4 X in a men's size shirt you can't beat that price eight dollars so you're not only stretching the shirt but you're stretching your budget and you know check out different places like Walmart check out Target and JC Penney's in their men's and young men sections you're gonna find great shirts anywhere from $5 to $15 so much more affordable and a lot of them are in unisex colors like this aqua there's pinks there's purples there's a little mermaid there's all different princesses check it out don't rule it out and you can save a lot of money so go ahead and try this yourself it's worth the investment of just a few dollars and a few minutes of your time you", "RaBffG1zLL8": "today we made it into downtown LA home\nof the fashion district where creative entrepreneurs brands and businesses come\nto shop and sell the latest styles now whether you guys are consumers or\nactually in the fashion industry chances are you've seen rolls of fabric like\nthese which actually go on to become the products that you wear now virtually\nevery brand and business gets their start with a simple t-shirt crew neck\nand hoody and more importantly is a very interesting fact is they don't actually\nmanufacture the products themselves in fact a lot of the times are being\nmanufactured in large facilities so as a consumer you need to know that you have\nthe option and the choice to impact the world at large\nby the businesses that you'll go on to support so in this video I want to peel\nback some layers and actually show you guys how products are created on a mass\nlevel and I thought it'd be really interesting to start with how these\nfabrics are actually made cotton the most popular fabric in the world is\ncreated from the ground up before being made into the fabrics you wear it begins\nin the field where it has grown and picked by industrial equipment and\nshipped to be processed during the processing stage the cotton is cleaned\nup removing impurities and then the soft fluffy cotton you see becomes a strong\nfiber the process here is designed to create combed and ring spun cotton that\nhas a softer feel this type of fabric goes through an innovative spinning\nprocess that's designed to thoroughly soften and straighten each fiber the\nstrands will then tightly knit and woven together to create a raw fabric that is\nnow strong enough to be worn next time you're choosing a shirt take a look at\nthe fine details to see this for yourself\nonce the fabric is completed and then gets transported to a dye house where\nthe fabric is dyed to the color specified by the manufacturer the\nprocess we're showing you here is unique to Bella canvas which is the largest\ncutter and dhyryam apparel in America we take you guys inside of the state of the\nart facility to show you what it takes to make quality apparel for millions of\npeople all over the world as you see once this fabric is dyed it gets\ntransported as these fabric rolls which are then laid out across large\ncutting tables the fabric is stacked up to a hundred and fifty layers before it\nbeing mass cut inside of this factory they cut three million units a week and\nI personally always wanted to see how these machines layout the fabric so\nlet's take it out for a spin what's the worst that can happen so right out of\nthe gate there's this machine here and it has like all of these different\nsettings and I see this little this thing so I could just move this and it\nworks I'm going to reverse though huh let's let's crank this thing up but the whole thing my privado I messed up this fall\nI dig I think I did a bad job that's that's that's bad huh - push the button\nthere that is odd this buddy right here tightens up the rope\nshameless crap okay I'm gonna try it again how much right right\nyou know at first glance these machine seemed to move themselves but what I\nfound out is that it actually requires some skill in order to tighten the\ntension of the fabric as it's being laid out the faster you go the faster that\ntrigger fingers got to be in order to keep up once the fabrics are laid out\nthe cutting machine arrives to cut the fabric in the shape of the required\ndesign this is the cutting machine that essentially takes all the digital\npatterns that are created during the design stage and they input it into the\nsoftware which allows this machine to just automatically cut the panels which\nare then shipped to the facilities where they're going to be sewing right here I\ndon't know if you guys can see the screen but it's literally showing you\nwhere it's going to be cutting next and as it's cutting it's actually vacuuming\nthe entire operation so it vacuums that in order to make sure that the seal and\nthe fabrics lay very flat so there's no differences when it's actually cut these\nrobotic cutting machines ensure every single piece is cut precisely as it\nfollows a designer's blueprint keep in mind not every factory has something\nlike this these machines make it possible to get a consistent fitting\nshirt every single time once the panels are cut they are placed on carts and\nmove to the next part of the process and so just wanted to take you guys behind\nthe scene here as we as we show you guys where this fabric is\ngoing before it's being sewn and it got my boy Brett got the man see\nright over there but guys an interesting thing that we saw here is as you can see\nright here these are actually not moving so it makes you wonder how is that\nmoving right so I wanted to show you guys something really quickly here in\nbetween these lines here there's actually lasers so there's a laser\nguided system that actually brings the fabric as soon as it crosses a path it\nactivates the new beams here so let's check this out\nmoving not moving and moving haha check this out go check this out\nbring the camera a little closer moving not moving and moving yeah this is how\nthe fabrics are transported in masses in order for them to be bundled and finally\ncut so what oh you would have thought these\ntwo crashed right now but they didn't because of the way that everything is\nbeing automated and I feel that automation in the sewing process and in\nthe manufacturing facilities such as this that's based in Los Angeles with\nAmerican workers it's it's the way well it really is the way of the future and\ncompanies like Bella canvas are able to still produce a USA strong while being\nable to sew in different countries and put out a quality product so this is the\nway that things are moving and like this fabric let's get moving over to the\nbundling stage we can show you guys how that works\nso these fabrics back here as you guys can\nis the bundling machine so it's it's making sure that the fabrics are safe as\nthey're being transported to the next facility which actually does the selling\nthem investing into these types of logistics allows them to keep a quality\nproduct from the beginning all the way until it's done the scale of this\noperation is huge guys and as you guys can see from the forklifts to the\ncutters to everybody that's that's a part of this operation it really is\nsomething that requires a huge investment in the production as well as\nthe logistics and the team behind it thousands of people are employed here in\norder to get this to actually work so you could imagine that it's it's easier\nto cut corners than it is to do things right so when a company invests in doing\nthings the right way it really makes a difference in the market and it really\nmakes a difference in the world with rap fabric ready to be transported these\ncontainers play a logistical role in transporting materials needed for\nvarious parts of the production process globally these containers travel and\ncarry mass quantities of gray's goods which come from all over the world\nwhich are then dyed in an eco-friendly way in Los Angeles a fun fact is that\nthe USA China and India produce over 50% of the world's cotton this business\nchooses to die unprocessed fabric in Los Angeles in order to reduce the\nenvironmental impact commonly associated with Daiya fabrics in other parts of the\nworld once they are cut and dyed the majority the production is transported\nto Central America where they are sewn up and shipped back to the US a\nfulfillment center since we know how fabric is being dyed and transported for\nproduction we are wondering how they ensure the sewing factors are taking\ncare of their people and environment we spoke with Xavier to get the details you\nknow Bella canvas is making sure that every factory that is part of our supply\nchain is 100% certified by ara which is a certification that is granted to\ncompanies that are fully in compliance with labor laws and regulations in the\ndifferent countries where we operate the efforts that we made to make sure that\nyou know the workers that are part of our supply chain are being treated\nfairly not only in terms of other compensation also but you know all the\nsocial benefits that they receive recently we were approve also to become\na participating company with the Fair Labor Association which is like at the\ngold standard for our industry we are in the process of certifying the entire\nsupply chain is a it's a lengthy process and it will take some time but\neventually the company will be fully activated with the VFL a North America\nis made up of multiple Latin American countries and although sewing also\noccurs outside of the USA Bella canvas promotes a USA strong initiative which\nemploys thousands of workers in the USA while also producing a line of apparel\nthat is made here in the Los Angeles facility so as you guys to see right\nhere in this sewing factory they have literally over a hundred and fifty\nemployees skilled employees actually sewing the t-shirts in right here as you\nguys can see on this stack these are the cup panels we were showing you guys\nearlier more importantly I just wanted to share with you guys some of my\nthoughts in and some of the things that happen in the factories such as this the\nskill that's required to actually do a job like this so this is my man Felix\nright here and I won't I won't disturb his work that much but as you guys can\nsee it requires very skilled thought so with that being said a lot of workers\nactually only do one part of every garment which then goes on to the next\nperson to complete it and funny enough to show you guys like how difficult it\nmight be my brother actually over here my brother actually knows how to sew and\nwe were discussing like hey are you okay so you're already making excuses do you\nthink you can do it or not alright so Felix get a mpirica ladder\ncomo la so this machine is like it's this is a Pegasus w6\nand it's very beefy so they have two needles so right out of the gate we see\nthat there's there's a reason why workers are actually focusing on one\ntask so there's a lot of little pieces to the garment and if you were to try to\nsew everything yourself you'd probably screw up the entire shirt or a won't be\nas efficient so my brother Caesar here is is skilled in this if I were to try I\nwould have probably lost my finger but look at this guy he's actually doing it what's going on here guys you're holding\nup my line we got it good thank you guys for bringing us behind the scenes here\nand our that my brother slowed down the production line now you have to get can\nyeah but but overall you guys seem to be running a really tight ship how many\nunits do you think about the canvas is producing on on any given day so about a\nweek we're showing about three million units three million t-shirts so the\naverage of about 600,000 teachers per day oh yeah that's crazy\nbut what would you say is like is one of the things that the workers here need to\nhave in order to be successful in this career how many years have they been\nsewing for so some of these people have been working with us from the beginning\nso about you know 10 15 years they've been here it's people that I come here\nevery day they're being they're been here ever since at the beginning you\nknow what type of fulfillment do you think\nthey find in the sewing do you think they need to have a passion to work in a\nfactory like this you definitely have to you definitely have to enjoy it\nbut as you can see everybody comes in here and everybody's pretty happy you\nknow not sad faces yeah yeah it's definitely something that it's part of\nour culture now you know we're a big family\nwhat's the products are sown they undergo a quality control process that\nensures every t-shirt meets their test it's pretty crazy to see that there are\nreal people working on every single t-shirt that you wear so this is one\nthat passed the test right here yeah this is one that can go out to a\ncustomer yeah definitely ready to go and I think that's the beauty of like what a\nlot of people don't get to see is the fact that even though things are being\nmass-produced there's real people are like handling\nyou're populating it and there's real love that goes into it or a real passion\nyou got to have a passion for sewing and you got to have a passion for this\nindustry in order to stay in it with what 15 years yeah so it's a lot of time\nand energy that goes into one garment and it's a lot of people that handle\nthat one garment yeah it's about from the beginning to\nthe end there's about 13 13 people that but you know the teacher goes through\ninto it's completed not counting people into distributions in there yeah\nliterally hundreds of hands are going into the making of your product that you\nget at home and I think a lot of time we do miss the fact that there is a\npersonal touch to every single garment you guys whether it's mass-produced or\nwhether it's this is could be considered handmade I mean it really is because\nsomebody's making it with their hands so with that being said I wanted to leave a\nlittle note here you think I can leave a note in this box yeah there's like made\nwith love regardless of whether the finished garments come from their\nCentral American manufacturing facilities or in LA they ultimately\narrive at the fulfillment center where they are responsible for organizing and\nshipping to distributors and brands all over the world many entrepreneurs and\nsmall businesses rely on Bella canvas and suppliers like them to stock t-shirt\nblanks that can use to sell their designs now this company doesn't stay in\nbusiness by simply selling random designs and a bigger challenge that they\nalso have is the fact that they're selling to customers of all shapes and\nsizes so design wise they have to cater to a very large market so\nwant to go ahead and actually show you guys the behind the scenes of what it\nactually takes to design for a mass markets for millions of customers all\naround the world and we're actually going to see how they choose the colors\nthat are guaranteed to sell through to a large audience let's check that out man\nright out of the gate so this is where you guys do fittings yeah this is our\nfit room we spend a few hours a week in here with models and styles and we just\nmake sure that the styles fit on our base size models the best the best we\ncan interesting what is so like as I walked\nthrough here I felt like my equilibrium was almost off because it obviously\nthere's a sound panel but we'll the purpose for a sound panel enjoy cool\nwell no this is actually the Ellsworth Kelly from 1956 it's a sound barrier\nyeah he's a California abstract painter it's actually the exactly just absorb\nsound like so we're not bouncing around the room and little easier to tolerate\neach other I thought I had like a real like I thought it was a real pain I mean\nI don't think I'd be behind a glass door if that were the case of a real pretty\ncool so this is where you guys fit your models because you guys designed for\nmillions of people different body types all right we did we tried right you try\nwe're trying our very best so so how can you walk us through how how you are able\nto do that we want to fit on multitude of body shapes and sizes we'll start\nwith a base size size medium men's for instance for a unisex t-shirt 3001 we'll\nstart with our men's medium he's our basic block and so we start\nfitting on him when we have it tuned up the way we like the way it fits the\ndrape performance will go on to the next size so we'll fit eventually a full size\nrun so if there's a small all the way to like 4 XL let's say we'll fit every\nsingle size yeah so we're trying to take those silhouettes into consideration so\nyou mentioned earlier that you like to work directly with the manufacturing\nteam so as a design director how does working with the manufacturing arm make\nsure that what you guys are creating is going to be something beneficial for the\nworld at large working on the ground level just getting to the factory we\nhave a communication line that help is build product the delicate design\nprograms that we have we try to make sure that there's no pieces in between\nour sewing and our brains or the to the design vision and the sellers are kind\nof on the same page we develop fabrics and samples we send them back and forth\nuntil we alekhya them exactly the way we see them fit in a production setting and\nthat's important to us so that's part of the reason we have that connectivity\ntissue between sewing and the design vision is that we close the gap on all\nthe pieces that would go wrong by seeing each other in person by working together\nas a team so far as that this is super detailed process they are very\nmeticulous about what they do and the whole team is here to make adjustments\nin case there's anything to be done so this isn't the first sample set that\nthey had to actually fit this is actually a rendition so what they're\ndoing is essentially making sure that it all goes to spec before it hits the mass\nproduction okay so we're just gonna run through the specs again really quick and\nlike for instance the shirt I'm wearing this is actually one of you guys is more\nlater styles so this is something that you and your team came up with yeah so\nwhat what what inspires you for new designs and how do those like how do you\nguys kind of maybe make sure that they stay in the market for a while versus it\njust being a trend yeah this might be a trend you know it's a raw edge\ntranscends like I can't say this will be in the word forever is very scary\nfashion forever don't really jive certainly so what we'll try to do is\nwhat I like to see is like make the very best styrofoam cup that you can see at\nevery single coffee station forever without it leaking it's keeping its heat\nall those other components that the Styrofoam cup would have but ours is a\nbasic t-shirt we can dress it in skin it in different ways that speak to\ndifferent trends like raw edge seam work or pockets out to the side or however we\nwant to address it the core block that you see is our crewneck sweatshirt which\nwe feel very comfortable selling to a large community people can buy them\nprint on them embellish them in that market but in this case they can buy the\nnormal crew of pullover with raw edges everywhere it's\nmay get slightly more trend forward or fashion forward it's not enough to have\na great designer fit today as consumers we need to ensure that our purchasing\ndecisions do not support things that are unethical and oppressing others\nthat's where businesses such as these are raising the standards by not only\ngiving people an amazing product but by being transparent and doing things\ndifferently from how they treat their workers to the green initiatives in\nplace that are minimizing the environmental footprint on the other\nhand there are real problems happening around the world with apparel\nmanufacturing the constant drive to compete on price in order to sell\ngarments for pennies on the dollar as a resulted in producing in unsafe\nenvironments where buildings are failing and chemicals are being spilled into the\nenvironment the way your favorite products are being made today will\ndrastically affect the way our world looks like tomorrow now as we wrap up\nthis video I hope you enjoyed the process that we shared and how to shirts\nare made in America as you guys can see this operation is huge and the brands of\nbusinesses that you support also go through a process like this now the ones\nthat are just getting started the ones in your community that friends and\nfamily are be are actually creating are able to leverage resources such as bela\ncanvases infrastructure to actually make their brands and businesses without\nhaving to spend the millions of dollars that is required to do something like\nthis but more importantly as a consumer you have the power to choose the way\nthat the products are being created you see where you spend your money is what\nultimately is gonna dictate what the market and businesses such as these\ncreate so next time you go shopping or next time you're about to consider a\nbrand keep that in mind and more importantly if you guys enjoyed this\ntype of video I highly encourage that you guys hit that subscribe button right\ndown below and turn on post notifications for the newest episodes\ncoming to this channel this is episode 1 of a series that we're

appreciate you guys I'll see you on the next one", "f2E25CDxoRA": "[Applause] cool guys welcome back to another video I'm Daniel and I hope that you fellas are having a good day dressing well and of course getting stuff done alright guys so it's gonna be a nice and quick one today I'm gonna be going through my top ten favorite go-to t-shirts that I personally find myself wearing all the time a lot of you guys always comment in each video what t-shirt I'm wearing so I'm going to be going through all of these showing you guys which are my favorite where I got them from in the price that I paid for them alright guys we are standing straight into it this is a very nice fitted white t-shirt from cause and I paid 25 pounds for this there's two kind of unique features through this t-shirt one is the high neckline which is the main reason I really mess with that I do just love a nice tight high neckline the second is that it's a very light almost see-through material I don't know if you look close enough but you can probably see my mic so it's a very nice breathable one perfect for coming into spring and summer alright guys so staying on the white trend this is my most expensive teacher that I do have this is the acne studio one again similar to the COS high neckline has that printed acne studio a very nice fitting t-shirt absolutely love this this is a lot more of a heavyweight material but it is also quite stretchy so the size every time I wash it it always just comes back to its natural size and I absolutely love it coming on to the third one guys and this is kind of like my most oversized t-shirt that I do have it is very oversized but this is definitely a lot more of a summer vibe t-shirt now the material of this one the reason I like it so much is it is that towel material I got this from All Saints it was on sale when I got it absolutely love it and yet for me this is my kind of more out there t-shirt because I do really like my t-shirts to be simple and played down but with the stripes going across and their texture to this t-shirt it just adds that little bit of detail that I absolutely love so guys coming on down we are entering a round of Col bloody Buxton this dude is just breaking the bank on me because they keep putting out good pieces I have three t-shirts from them the next this one and the next two are all called Buxton but let's get into this one first I paid forty pounds for this is the Col Buxton week a t-shirt is a lot more of a softer material really just sits on the body great for kind of like every day absolutely love this season my favorite black t-shirt completely it is that oversize fit you guys would be the common theme in pretty much the rest of this is just oversized it's just what I like love tucking it in I love having a little bit of that bagginess it's kind of just my style and personality that I really mess with but yeah very simple cannot go wrong with a nice black shirt especially when you tuck this in to some black smack-heads add some Doc Martens perfect you're good to go again guys called Buxton this is their warm-up t-shirt you guys know I did a full review on this there's the first stop I bought from them 60 pounds still love it to this day I love this is the slate colorway it is a great fit is and like kind of a boxy fit the material is a lot more of that heavy weight and license duty I love how simple this one is yet but because of the way they designed their t-shirt gives it that nice kind of vintage feel so it's a great way to add a little bit of texture to a very simple outfit and yeah it's a good colorway the last of the call back someone same warm up t-shirt this isn't happening the colorway but I call it the concrete one if that's how eyes up do it exact same use the other t-shirt nice heavy weight and yeah just honestly guys the Cole bucks and stuff like I'm not just like saying it for the sake of it like I messed with their stuff and anytime they drop a new t-shirt I'm most likely gonna cop it because this is the type of stuff that's always gonna be in my wardrobe as long as my style stays this way I'll always mess with their stuff so this next one is by Val Christopher I think that was a hundred pounds that is quite pricey but it is so unique and there's a lot that goes into it obviously it's quite a bit more tout oversized bit to it man I've actually been thinking about just doing a full video based on this t-shirt because in this little snippet that I've got it's not enough time but what I do really love about this t-shirt is it's the type of one that I will wear when I want to just make a bit more of a statement when I want a little bit more of a unique standout t-shirt but the reason why this is my top ten is because it's still a very subtle t-shirt yet it has its own amazing uniqueness to it obviously there's the so much going on I kinda just want to do a whole video on this but yeah I love it so for a lot of you oh geez you will remember this t-shirt it is definitely one of my go-to yet because we've been in winter I just don't go out for brighter colors but coming into spring and summer you're gonna see this one a lot more this is my small supreme box logo t-shirt this is what I want to just you know what I want is just be a little bit of a height beast for today I want to just be a supreme head you know I just want to be in that game very subtle very still minimal definitely my style definitely great balance between minimal and you're still in that kind of like Street way scene all right guys on to the second to last one and this is my burnt orange t-shirt again oversized boxy and you may have seen some expensive t-shirts my first t-shirt was 10 pounds from Zara I absolutely love it love the fit of it look the colorway of it perfect when you come into order and perfect when you're in spring summer winter whenever I love it guy size large fits really nicely colors great it's just a really nice way to add color to your outfit but without being too bold all right guys last but certainly not least we started with a fitting t-shirt so we're gonna end with a fitting t-shirt as well it's not always about the oversize fits this is the day's march one you guys would have seen this recently again when I add color to my outfits I like it to be in a more desaturated way love the fit of it I love the cotton love the heavyweight material of this and it's just a really good vibe for about three pounds and there we have it guys those are my top 10 favorite go-to t-shirts that I just always find myself going to let me know in the comment section down below guys what is your favorite go-to t-shirt and where is it from other than that guys I will try link all of these t-shirts in the description box down below and if you liked today's video make sure you thumbs it up hit the subscribe button and hit the bell icon go watch another video and if you want to keep up with me on the

time peace [Applause] [Music]", "8LV0Tic6Cuo": "hello guys and welcome back to my channel so the perfect basic t-shirt is something that can be quite hard to find and especially if the perfect basic white t-shirt there are so many different fits qualities and price levels in this area so I hope this video will help you in the search for the perfect basic t-shirt so in this video I am gonna show and compare no less than five different white t-shirts and what all of these t-shirts have in common is that they are all from brands if you guys have recommended to me also they are all either responsibly made so they maybe come from a responsible brand or they are made in organic cutting so this was one of the criterias for me to do this test going for a sustainable basic item is one of the easiest steps towards a more sustainable and intentional way of consuming fashion and I think it's something that everyone can do because the price difference between these t-shirts that I have found today and the ones that are conventionally made are not even that big the way that we consume fashion in general today is very selfish because the cost for you yourself is much more important than the cusp of our environment or the people in the production and that's where I think that the industry desperately needs a change so again going for the most responsible alternative on the market is a great way of starting this journey and to support initiatives like organic cotton or more transparent production and other things like that moving on so I've gathered five of the most important criteria in this area and let's just go through them I'm so sorry about my voice is still a bit scruffy after being ill last week it's just not going away so the first criteria for the perfect basic white t-shirt is that the quality or the break mustn't be too stiff but it mustn't be too slinky either so it kind of has to be in between those two so I can slip the flapper got the t-shirt I definitely prefer cutting above anything else so everything in be scopes or polyester which are both not very sustainable ways of making fabric for a t-shirt it's just a no-go for me I prefer something that is at least 95% cotton and preferably organic cotton so let's move on to the third criteria which is all about the fit personally I like to go for probably what you would call a boyfriend fit so it has to be slightly boxy slightly oversized and it has to have this crew neck like the one that I'm wearing today so no deep scoop Knicks or anything like that the crew neck is definitely the number one type of neck when it comes to basic t-shirts for me so the fourth criteria is that the basic t-shirt should wash well so the seams should stay at the sides at all times they shouldn't move to like the center of your belly after washing them one or two times if the seams tend to move when you wash your t-shirts lettuce happen a sign of poor quality and it's something that I myself have experienced when I buy t-shirts from very cheap high street brands finally one of the most important criterias and also one of the things that you guys are very frustrated about when it comes to especially white t-shirts is that it shouldn't be too see-through and that leads me to the nude bra because a nude bra is an absolute must-have in your underwear collection in general because it's just great to wear underneath like a very see-through button-down shirt but certainly also your white basic t-shirts it is almost impossible to find a basic teacher that's not just a tiny bit see-through and going for a nude bra it's just a great way of dealing with that if you're not into the hole peeking through underwear situation so I actually tried one out from a brat called organic basics which is also one of the brands that I ordered one of the t-shirts from it's a basic triangle problem no wires or anything like that and it's just super comfortable and I'm loving it already also the cutting quality from organic basics are often made in what you would call long fiber cotton which means that this fabric is just a lot more durable than conventional cotton and it will also look like new for a lot longer time okay so with all that in mind let's have a look at the five t-shirts that I'm going to show you and compare to each other today now as always everything that I show you in this video is going to be linked down below for you guys also I haven't tried any other t-shirts on yet because I kind of wanted to give you my full first impressions besides the teacher that I'm wearing today which is about six months old now and I'm going to compare this to the four others as well but that's just because this one comes from a responsible brand so I thought I just wanted to put that in together with the others I am gonna watch that just to see how well they wash and then I'm gonna give you my final verdict and then hopefully be able to pick out a favorites so that you guys can also pick out here on a favorite so yeah let's go so this t-shirt is called the cutting crew and it is from ever Lane so when it comes to the fit of this t-shirt it is just right up my street it has kind of a straight slightly oversized v and it has this crew neck as well when it comes to the quality it is quite thin also I can't seem to find any information on this t-shirt whether it organic cotton or not so I'm guessing it is just in conventional cotton but it is made in supima cotton which is kind of a quality March for Eveline so it is definitely better than the conventional alternatives out there when it comes to good quality but I would have liked it to be an organic cotton as well so that it was being made with fewer chemicals in the production as well also the fabric of this t-shirt is very thin I don't know if you're able to see it here but you can kind of see my jeans through the t-shirt and yeah it's just a bit too thin for my liking other than that the fit and the hand feel it's very soft and it feels great on skin and like I said it washes really well as well and also it comes from a responsible brand where transparency and good conditions in the production is something that's very important so so let's have a look at this one from organic basics this is the same brand as the nude bra that I spoke about earlier in this video there's just so much plastic waste in the fashion industry so it's great to see someone taking a bit more responsibility in that area all the teachers that I'm showing you today is in a size medium just to get that out there I'm also going to put that information down below but just in case I forget to say these are all in a size I mean you and I deliberately always choose a size medium just because I really like that slightly oversized fit so here is the one from organic basics I am not really fond of the finishing here at the neck it kind of looks like the fabric has been stretched a bit too much in the production so it kind of has these small wrinkles down here at the neck I think you'd be able to remove it by ironing at the t-shirt which is gentle something I really enjoy to do especially after washing my t-shirts is just give them a quick iron because it makes them look completely like new again so I hope this is something that you can remove by irony the t-shirt and it was made in a 95% organic cotton and then five percent ill estate and I can definitely tell when I move around in the fabric and I kind of I'm stretching like this that it's a bit more stretchy than the 100% cotton ones probably Everland so overall I really like this t-shirt I really like this very thick quality and the fact that it is hardly see through I bet you could even wear like a normal white bra underneath this t-shirt and you wouldn't be able to see it so that's definitely a plus but yeah it feels like a very proper great t-shirt oh yeah this is what I'm talking about when I say crewneck this is a proper crew neck in my opinion it just goes all the way up to the neck and it looks great with when you layer it your necklaces like this and yeah that is definitely a plus the one from organic basics is definitely a lot bigger than this one no doubt about that but it is definitely thicker than the very thin one from every lane so far this could actually be a favorite of mine I really like the neck I like the sleeves the perfect slightly oversized spit the sleeves are not too big they're not too long or anything so kind of has that boyfriend fit but not too much and yeah like I said it is made in 100% organic cotton so if you are to go for a sustainable basic from a normal high street brands and all the stories is definitely a great way to go so moving on this one is from weekday and kind of has a more corrupt and boxy fit than the others the others kind of went down to here that is definitely an individual matter but I definitely like my t-shirts to be slightly longer especially if I'm wearing boyfriend jeans like today where the jeans kind of sit low on my hip I just don't feel like there's a lot of fabric to kind of do this health tuck because it's so short if you're wearing high-waist jeans on the other hand there's not a lot of excess fabric so if that's what you prefer this length is perfect I guess also there's something odd about this color this one is what they call white on the website on weekdays websites but it is not white it is kind of like an off-white almost like a cream color I don't know if you can see it but I mean compared to this one from and other stories it's just not very white this one is also made in 100% organic cotton so again we're dealing with conventional brand that has kind of made an initiative to go for more sustainable basics the thickness of the fabric is great as well I don't really have anything bad to say about that I can see my bra I almost can't even see my jeans through this fabric as well so it has a great thickness so that is the fourth t-shirt take a good look because I'm gonna switch to the last one so here we have the final t-shirt this is from a brand called armed angels and it's a brand that I only recently discovered I've actually so ordered a pair of skinny jeans from that brand I'm gonna test out yeah this is 100% organic cotton as well and as you can see it is kind of more fitted than the other t-shirts so I guess this is what you would call like a woman's t-shirt so the sleeves are a bit more fitted and the body is a bit more fitted kind of sewn like a woman's body and like I said in the beginning I really prefer this kind of straight oversized fit so when it comes to the fit I am not completely sold on this one however I will say the length is really great at this t-shirt and also I think it's perfect to be wearing underneath Blazers because it is that fitted but to be wearing like this on its own it's not my favorite oh yeah I am gonna return once I have watched all of these t-shirts [Music] so it is now the day after I spoke to you last and I'm out back with a final conclusion to these five different white t-shirts so the conclusion is that all of the five t-shirts did really well in washing after a bit of ironing when they were dry they all have a very smooth surface and there doesn't seem to be a problem with moving seams or anything like that but obviously it takes a bit more than just one wash and also a bit more wear to really tell a difference but it doesn't seem like the surface will be peeling or anything so they're all super smooth still looks great and they did really well in terms of washing so one thing to think about in this process is definitely that cotton isn't just cutting you can really feel a difference in softness and weight if you turn to brands who are concerned about making cotton items in supima or pima cotton or cotton that are made from long fiber cotton so the reason why a long fiber cotton and supima cotton is so great is because you just get a lot thicker cotton a lot more durable and a lot more soft cotton as well they all have some pros and cons but if I have to pick out my own favorites it will have to be the one that I'm wearing right now which is the one from organic basics or the one from and Other Stories which is closely followed by one from every Lane so I really wish that you could feel the hand feel of this t-shirt from organic basics it's just so incredibly soft and I think it has to do with a tiny bit of stretch it just sits so nice and soft on your body and I like this kind of stretchy hand feel and also the thickness and the weight of the fabric and then after washing it and ironing the neckline I managed to smooth out these little wrinkles that have had right here so I think it will look great after countless times of washing and wear as well so if we look at both the t-shirt from and other stories made an organic cotton 100% organic cotton and then this one from organic basics they both kind of fill in the criterias that we made in the beginning of this video for the perfect basic white t-shirt so that was that the fabric shouldn't be to slinky but not too stiff either this one is definitely a lot more soft than this one because this one is after all 100% cotton and this has a tiny bit of stretch so there is definitely a difference in the softness of the t-shirt but the weight is quite similar to both of them then they both have this slightly oversized boxy fit with a classic crewneck that I like so much they wash really well both of them the surface is still super smooth no moving seams or anything like that and then finally none of them are too see-through but like I said in the beginning of this video it all starts with a great nude bra I really like the one from every lane as well like I said in the beginning I've had this for a while I've had it for around six months and it's been worn a lot washed a bunch of times too and it just keeps looking great the surface hasn't start started to peel or anything like that it's still super smooth the seams are where they should be in the sides of the t-shirt so this is really in my top three of all of these t-shirts because it just lasts so well and that is because it is made in soupy McCubbin so that just shows that cotton is not just cuttin you have to pick carefully if you want something that looks nice in the long run and that's really durable as well but the reason why it's not my absolute favorite is because it is just a bit too thin compared to these two this one and this one so my absolute favorites the one from another stories and then this one from our basics [Music] when it comes to caring for especially white t-shirts we all know that through time you can kind of get these yellow stains in the armpits which is just totally unsexy but it happens you can actually easily remove these stains by mixing a bit of baking soda with water so that it kind of creates a paste and then kind of scrub that into the surface or where the stain is and then leave it there for at least one hour you could also leave it overnight if you're dealing with a very rough kind of stain and then wash it normally and then that should take that yellow stain right off your t-shirt another thing you could do to avoid these yellow stains is going for a more and natural deodorant so stay away from antiperspirant a crystal deodorant or maybe make your own I'll make sure to put a link down below for a recipe for making your own deodorant I have experienced that the crystal deodorant is not always very efficient I sweat more through certain periods during the month and also if I'm really busy or stressed out I tend to sweat a bit more and having to worry about the smell of sweat it's just not fun either so I actually have both a crystal deodorant for kind of low-key days or if days at home where I don't need as much protection and then I also have a traditional antiperspirant but just without any nasty chemicals and without perfume so that it's better for very sensitive skin and it's just a bit more healthy than the conventional antiperspirant so that's it for this video guys I really hope you found it helpful and that it kind of made you wiser in terms of cotton in general and choosing great durable qualities also in terms of choosing more sustainable options again like I said in the beginning of this video going for sustainable eco-friendly basics is a great way to start other than lowering your consumption and maybe going for secondhand as well personally I don't even think that it's that much more expensive than the conventional brand so really everyone can do this especially if you lower your consumption you have a bit more money to go for great quality and more sustainable options as well so enough blabbering I think this video is getting a lot longer than I thought in the beginning so I'm gonna wrap up this video

gonna show you how to do real quick how to do heat transfer on cotton shirts using a easyweed heat transfer material very quick very easy excuse the lighting on in the back room so there's not a very good light in here and it's freezing so that's why I got my head in here oh no that's not why don't get my head in here but I'm gonna show you real quick so we're gonna take a full own full willing to take up 100% cotton shirt I'm gonna take our decal pre-cut pre-cut I cut this before the before I even thought about my video but here it is oh this is easy we easy we gold in black it's not took up next two colors but that's not how it comes why should he cut this one separate and then I just put it there nope okay so what you want to do is pre-heat your garment so you can get all the moisture out from two three seconds and then apply your decals or in this case your he press material make sure it's straight I've been doing this for quite awhile so just make sure you're straight and then you're gonna apply heat or you can apply yeah you apply heat for about 15 seconds and it should be ready now when you open this when you open the clamshell if you see a lot of steam come out its kiss either you didn't get you to remove all the steam don't worry it's okay as long as you he press it for 15 to 18 seconds you're gonna see a lot of steam come out one of the reasons why you're gonna see a lot of the steam come out is because it's freezing here I'm in Waco Texas and right now it's about 27 degrees so that's why you're gonna see a steam come off not you see a lot of it which is good so then you just feel it this is a pure hot um you can either peel it how to peel it cold excuse me doesn't matter if you feel like harder for peel it cold it's okay so what you want to do this is what I like using this material you see weed by sizes on people call it Caesar size or whatever you want to call it this is this is reason why I like using this one second so clamp it down look check it out check that out ready to go so if you if you're doing multiple colors if you're gonna apply another color and talk with this one this materials perfect perfect for that this is one second the NATO beef

method\nand sublimation printing and what are some key considerations\nto keep in mind so that you can make the right choice for your business although i know there are a lot more\napparel decoration methods that involve printing out there i wanted to\nspecifically cover these two types of printing methods\nbecause both of these methods can be done on the ricoma r550\nwhite toner transfer printer okay so before we jump right in if you're here\nfor the first time or you're new to this channel\nmake sure to smash that subscribe button to keep up to date with the latest\nvideos that come out we post every single week\nalso make sure to give a quick thumbs up to this video if you like content just\nlike this so as i said before i'm going to break\ndown the key differences and considerations for these two types of\nprinting methods but before we get into that i want to\nfirst give a quick intro on what heat transfer printing actually\nis now when we talk about heat transfer printing\nwe're talking specifically about a two-step method so what do those two\nsteps actually involve so step number one in this two-step heat transfer\nprinting method is actually printing a design onto a\ntransparent sheet of transfer paper then in step two\nyou actually transfer that design that was printed on\nthat transfer paper onto an adhesive paper using a heat\npress finally you peel away the adhesive sheet from the transfer\nsheet and then you press the design onto the substrate such as a piece of\ngarment using a heat press after pressing the garment you then peel\naway the actual paper and you're left with a design that's\ntransferred onto the garment itself the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer\nuses this very two-step heat transfer method\nto apply designs onto various light and dark color garments even onto\nhard surfaces such as wood aluminum or even metal if\nyou're interested to learn more about white toner transfer printing and\nspecifically about the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer packages\ngo ahead and click the link in the description below and check them out\nthere so now that we cover what is a two-step\nheat transfer printing system let's cover what is sublimation printing\nso sublimation printing involves a similar process where you're\nprinting the design onto regular copy paper or specialty\nsublimation paper and then using heat via a heat press to\ntransfer that printed design onto a substrate such as a piece of\ngarment the key difference lies in how sublimation works and the science behind\nit during sublimation when the actual\nprinted design is heated via a heat press\nthe toner on the transfer paper itself actually turns from\na solid state into a gas state and then it embeds itself\ninto the fabric when it cools it actually goes back to being installed\nand then becomes a permanent part of the fabric that means\nunlike a two-step heat transfer printing method sublimation actually adds no\nadditional layer of paper on top of the fabric and you\ncan't feel the difference of the printed image and the rest of the\nfabric okay now that we've covered what these two methods actually are\nlet's go into some key differences and considerations between these two methods\nthe first topic that we're going to cover between these two methods is\ndurability and feel as i briefly mentioned before sublimation does not\nadd an extra layer on top of your fabric versus a two-step heat transfer printing\nmethod actually leaves a thin layer on top of your fabric\nso the feel is going to be much different so right off the bat you will\nfeel a difference between the printed design using these two\nmethods now in terms of durability with a heat transfer printed design\nit can last about 30 to 40 washes depending on how large your design is\nand how it's actually being washed now on the other hand with sublimation\nbecause the ink or the toner is actually infused inside the fabric and becomes a\npart of the fabric it is a much more permanent design onto\nthe fabric and it can withstand a lot more washes\nin fact most sublimated designs will last just as\nlong as the actual fabric itself because\nyou're not leaving an extra layer of transfer on top of the fabric\nyou're not going to see any cracking after washes and the image is much\nless likely to fade with sublimation so in this category of durability and feel\nit is pretty clear that sublimation wins out in this category because\nit can last a lot longer and you don't feel the actual transfer\nimage on top of the garment alright the second item to consider\nbetween sublimation printing and heat transfer printing\nis the variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto\nwith sublimation printing you are much more limited in\nthe variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto this is because\nsublimation can only adhere to polyester coated materials\neven if you use something that is 60 polyester\nand 40 cotton which is really about the minimum amount of polyester\nthat you need in order to make sublimation work in that 60 40\npoly cotton blend you're not going to get as much vibrancy\nin your transfer design versus 100 polyester\nwith sublimation you also have to use only\nwhite colored substrates or very light colored substrates that means you can't\nuse sublimation on a black t-shirt or a dark mug\nbecause the actual design won't show on the other hand\nwith white toner heat transfer printing you can actually print on light\nand dark colored garments and you're not limited to anything with polyester only\nin fact with heat transfer printing you can heat transfer onto\ncotton onto polyester even ceramic and other hard surfaces like wood and\nmetal and therefore in this category of variety of substrates you can\ntransfer onto heat transfer definitely wins out in\nthis one because of the variety of things that you can do finally let's\ngo into the category of the quality of the colors you can print\nusing these two methods first off sublimation allows you to print full\ncolors and this can be super helpful when\ntrying to sublimate a photo for example or doing a particular job for a customer\nthat requires a very specific color such as one for a company logo you can\nalso achieve sharp vibrant designs using heat\ntransfer paper if you're printing your design\nusing a white toner transfer system such as the ricoma r550 so it really is a\nvirtual tie in this category between sublimation and\nheat transfer printing because you can achieve\nfull color vibrant designs with either method the real difference lies\nin the durability and the feel of either method\nalso the variety of substrates that you can transfer onto but fortunately you\ncan achieve the best of both worlds using a white toner transfer printing\nsystem such as the one that we have here at ricoma the ricoma r550\ni kind of alluded to this briefly in the beginning of the episode\nin that you can achieve sublimation and heat transfer using heat transfer paper\nwith the ricoma r550 and that's because you can actually swap out\none of the toner cartridges in the r550 with a specialty sublimation\ntoner cartridge so in conclusion guys both printing methods\ninvolve a similar process but yield very different results\nhowever in sublimation printing the ink or toner actually permeates\nthroughout the fabric and becomes part of the fabric itself in\ntwo-step heat transfer printing on the other hand the image simply becomes\nanother layer on top of the substrate thankfully the\nricoma r550 white toner transfer printing system\ncan achieve either method simply by swapping out\nthe toner cartridge so make sure you keep these considerations in mind\nwhen deciding which method to use to fulfill the needs of your customers\nat the end of the day it really depends on what your customer is looking for the\ntype of material they're looking to get printed on and that will drive your\ndecision on what is best for your customers\nlike i mentioned before if you're looking to get started in the heat\ntransfer printing business or you're looking to add on

going to need you some satin material some heat and bond ultra hold make sure you get the ultra hold a lint roller some scissors your cotton t-shirt and your image and i'm going to be doing a kids t-shirt fortnite for my nephew his birthday is coming up he's going to be having a four night party so i'm going to make this one for him so first you want to do is take your satin material on the shiny side and go ahead and do your sublimation on top of it you're going to do it as you would do any regular sublimation you want to heat press this for 60 seconds at 400. there we go so [Music] we are waiting for that we are going to go ahead and get our length roller and remove everything from our t-shirt that static material once you cut it it does stretch straight like some strings so it's going to get all over the place all over your t-shirt but not like so bad that you can't deal with it so just remove it from your shirt and wait for that look just about almost all of the ink came out of this paper i'm trying to remove this tape here but there you go there's your image on the satin material that's how you get that shiny look then you're going to go ahead and take this material and flip it over and then you're going to take your [Applause] heat and bond and place it on the back you want to cut this down and make it a little bigger than your image but not too much bigger you can also cut down make sure you cut your static material a little bit bigger than your your image as well so you don't waste that much material and then i'm going to go ahead and heat press this onto my setting so again this is the back side and you have to actually work a little fast but not too fast with this because once this get under the heat it automatically starts to melt and stick so you want to place your material in your heating bar it has a rough side well shiny side and then it has a paper side this paper side is going to be facing upwards the rough shiny side is the adhesive so you're going to make sure that part is laying flat on your material and this paper side is facing upwards and then lay that on top of there and press that for about a few seconds not long at all so it's like make sure it fits real quick like that then once you have your image on there you're going to go ahead and cut it to size now i did not cut this out straight but [Music] so once you have your image cut to size you're going to go ahead and remove the paper from the back and that's your double-sided adhesive that's why you don't want to press it for too long just quick real quick just to stick it because if you press too long your temperature is hot like it is at 400 for 60 seconds which is too hot you will melt the adhesive it will seep through to your image and then the back adhesive will also melt and your paper will stick to it you won't be able to get it off so make sure you doesn't you don't press too long in the temp if the temperature is high like mine right now because i did the sublimation 460 you just want to close it pop it back up so here's the image remove the paper so that's the back adhesive and you're going to place that on your t-shirt now this once you press this my temperature is too hot right now so same thing just close it and open it [Music] and there you go sublimation on dark colors and cotton at that still soft smooth feels real good nice shiny dope looking nice now if you do this on a white shirt the colors are going to be a lot brighter it's going to be darker on a dark color shirt because it has a dark background but on the light color shirts it's much brighter than this but either way it's still dope no matter what kids is going to love this adult's going to love it it's just dope i'm using vvi and i will put the link in the description box so you can go ahead and support my small business and i will also be carrying vinyl soon different type of vinyl especially pattern vinyl look at this here dope glitter pattern vinyl regular glitter vinyl all colors metallic pattern vinyl and this is um actually not regular vinyl this is htv so these are all heat transfer vinyl and then your typical normal htv here so with this glitter htv that i'm going to be having on my website soon is going to be different patterns it's already pressed on top of glitter and it also comes with the transfer sheets for this one and also for the pattern htv and i'm gonna have multiple patterns multiple colors that's coming soon so stay tuned to that but like i said once i get to 1000 subscribers five of my subscribers will be winning a set of

print custom labels inside the neck of the shirt just like this one right here anyway I will talk to you guys next time take care you", "XR2jVs1iJJ4": "everyone my name is Mark wacht and we're talking about my favorite things so during this quarantine time I think people are their wardrobes have become a bit of a mess I mean you're basically wearing loungewear or some sort of like t-shirt and sweatpants maybe through the entire day if you're working from home and I know a lot of you guys are working from home and so I have this favorite brand or this favorite set of loungewear and I just want to share that with you guys today but we're talking about reigning champ I'm not sure if you can see the logo here reigning champ so out of the reigning champ stuff I'm a huge fan of what we're talking about today and that is the t-shirt I've been trying to find the perfect balance of like this high quality garment but also very comfortable and something that I can wear during the core team during any time where I'm just like lounging around at home and reigning champ has been that brand so as you can see I have a white t-shirt on right now a white t-shirt is a complete and utter essential in any wardrobe whether you're woman man old young it doesn't matter you need a white t-shirt so I bought a white t-shirt like this I would say black is the same way getting a black t-shirt like this as well is very very important for your wardrobe but I also even have a couple other colors so this is a navy I have an interesting story about this particular t-shirt in a second and I also have the gray so man this is the four t-shirt like this is gonna last me you know if you're not taking a shower every day this might last you a whole week potentially you know so what are you looking for in some loungewear so obviously you want it to be comfortable I think you want the quality of the material to be high because you're gonna be washing this quite often you might work out in them you might sweat like crazy in them it doesn't matter you need to be able to wash them over and over and over again and that's harsh on the fabrics the higher the quality of the fabric is the easier it's gonna be able to kind of withstand that and stay alive for a long period of time on to the story that I was trying to explain so this is the Navy shirt from writing channel this is a you know something that I've had actually for over a year and and I think it still looks great I mean there's not really there's no holes there's no stretching there's no it looks like a shirt you can buy off to the rack today I actually got in an accident where I was hit by a car while running so it's a long story it was crazy like I was in shock and everything at that but I did end up getting like you might be able to see here like a bunch of scars on my arm but you'll notice that the scar ends like in a line right here I don't know if you can see that right there but that's because I was wearing this t-shirt and it's so interesting to me hey that this t-shirt basically survived a car crash and this left arm is where that that kind of like where it would have like scarred me here but and I imagine the t-shirt would be completely wrecked after that but it's fine I don't see a single rip or tear or anything like that so I don't know if that's the ultimate test like you shouldn't you know don't go get hit by a car just to see how good your t-shirt is it just gives you an indication that like this these things are strong like they can actually the the fabric is good enough that you can put it through the wash of bazillion times and you're just fine now if that's the case though that means that you have to spend the extra coin generally here's the brutal truth these t-shirts MSRP retail are like 40 or 50 dollars like that's a lot for a t-shirt you actually can go to Nordstrom Rack or their sales that happen every year I would wait for one of those sales and they drop the price of these to like somewhere like $30 so my recommendation would be to wait a little bit and then get t-shirt in one of those sales again I'd point that Nordstrom Rack is one of those places to get it I would also recommend that you get the main colors now you know you've seen in my stack here I have black navy gray white I mean that's about is that's about as universal unit you can wear those with pretty much any outfit whether you're indoors and in a quarantine in front of webb-kim or you're you know when we've got back out there you're like out and about and you just have a t-shirt and a jacket or something like those colors will work with pretty much anything it is gonna be more expensive than other brands but your most of that money is going towards the quality and the design and not so much the brand yet I think they haven't quite gotten to that point yet and so for me like these have outlived the the reigning champ stuff has outlived Nike stuff for me neatest stuff for me you know gap and then or public j.crew like that's that's the sort of stuff I used to have and I think this is kind of the next step and I don't regret taking that next step during this time I hope everyone enjoys their loungewear cuz they super comfortable yet super fashionable and yeah so there it is reigning champ is one of my favorite things I'm mark Kwok I'll see you the next one [Music]", "-csW7UlOrWI": "artist dirty Donnie gillies here on today's episode I am going to teach you my way on how to de-stress a t-shirt now I've looked at a lot of YouTube channels and I've done a lot of research and I've done this before a bunch so what I've done is I've taken different elements from different things that people have done I've tried them all and mix it up and made my own deal basically yeah just got to do everything that they do and put it all into one that's what I did so it doesn't work that well on a really stiff t-shirt those really crazy crazy 100% cotton shirts that basically can stand up on their own doesn't work that well on them but about five or six of my other shirts came out amazing sometimes you got to go through the cycle twice even three times but to get a two just properly distress a shirt for most shirts it's gonna work pretty good so let me know in the comments below let me know you think if you like my channel please subscribe [Music] warning the time wasted watching this video is non-refundable [Music] next episode is the full episode a week with Donnie this is a tutorial episodes it's a small one just a little episode I don't want to I'm not gonna put any Trevor cartoons on this so maybe I might put a little one in there but because people want to see tutorials according to my friends people want to see tutorials so I'm gonna do a tutorial they want to see more Donnie I want to see more of you doing art making things doing crafts today is a tutorial on how to de-stress your t-shirts so this bag of salt was about $5 at the nursery basically Home Depot has these and check this out so I got a bunch of my shirts in here and this is phase 1 phase 1 is in salt water so I got salt water about five days I'm taking out right now and I'm gonna be Phase two [Music] okay so first one is my heavy-metal shirts and this was already like a soft t-shirt so the system worked really well in this this is really really super soft of course it was already soft so that was I was kind of a no-brainer the second one was skinny Jimmy's shirt the design with my friend Ken this worked really well too this shirt was um was a pretty standard t-shirt it wasn't a super heavy shirt but it wasn't a like a softie so now it's a softie and system worked on this great this was a hard team this t-shirt was pretty hard Atari Matt to some music for Donnie TV and and I've done an episode on him he's amazing and I really want to wear a shirt nah the system worked really good on this this I ran through twice I ran through this the system two times and now it's perfect I love it this I ran through the system three times this was this was a regular 100% cotton shirt as well and it just was really really really rough it was a heavy one so I'm gonna Hugh I'm gonna use the Puma stone on this King gizzard and the lizard wizard t-shirt I really want to wear it [Music] [Music] again do this at your own risk don't destroy your t-shirts don't get holes in your shirts just be careful I'm not a hundred percent sure how good it is for your shirt to leave it in vinegar and salt for a few days or a day or however long you want to leave it in for but anyways I found that this system works on a really heavy shirts it's just it just really doesn't work that well but you can get some of that starchy feeling out of it anyways good luck let me know you think if you like the channel subscribe and like leave a comment below thank you for watching mm-hmm distress some shirts man [Music] [Music] it is [Music]", "OztZ9vM7pfY": "Beneful

from ever lane that I bought for 30 and this one that I bought from Walmart for a whopping $6 in this video we're gonna figure out whether or not they're worth the money that I bought them for hey team welcome back to another Levi's save the world Hildebrand episode the channel where we prove that you don't need to be a hero to save the planet today I'm going to be comparing a Patagonia ever lain and Jorge t-shirt to see if the price that you pay for a t-shirt actually impacts the quality of the product itself this video is a part of a series where I do challenges and experiments to test out sustainability practices in real life I boycotted Black Friday and Cyber Monday I only ate uber eats for two entire weeks and most recently I documented my experience living without a car in North America for an entire year this video like all of those other videos is brought to you by my patreon supporters on patreon I post exclusive behind-the-scenes updates on these challenge videos and everything else that I'm working on in addition to that you get to see a secret podcast that I release every single month where I talk about sustainability stories in the news and my own personal journey here on this channel trying to reduce my environmental impact so if you're interested in any of that or you just want to support this channel head down to the description to check it out for yourself but here in this video we are going to be breaking down my experience only wearing three shirts for 90 days every single day for 90 days straight so right off the top I have to acknowledge that this is not a mathematical experiment in any sort of way but I did take some measures to try and keep this as fair as possible all of the shirts that I'm comparing are made of a hundred percent cotton they were all made outside of North America and all of these shirts were worn and washed the exact same number of times see I even kept this tally my phone I wore them all in pretty similar conditions from riding my bike around town working out to working all day sitting at a computer I watched them in full loads of laundry and dried them in an open-air drying rack upstairs but one quick note about washing probably a whole bunch of you just thought to yourselves wait 30 wears and 5 washes that means Levi's Wars shirt like 9 times without washing it and I would say that you're wrong because 30 divided by 5 is 6 but the point is yeah I don't wash my clothes very often because you really don't have to in fact I bought that pair of jeans right there 4 months ago and I still haven't watched them yet [Laughter] Leah you love this stuff way too much the reality is washing your clothes is one of the fastest ways to wear them out these three t-shirts would have been in way worse condition if I was washing them with warm water and drying them in a drying machine rant summary you probably don't need to be washing your clothes as often as you are save the planet your wallet and your clothes by just washing with cold water and air drying but anyways let's go s see what happened for the final evaluation of these shirts I based it off of three very random criteria that I invented for the purpose of this video number one is fit does this shirt actually fit me the way that I wanted it to when I bought it in the first place and does it look bad generally number two is wear and tear does the fabric itself seem to have broken down at all as appealing as it stretched out etc and number three is cost does it seem to be worth the money that I spent on the shirt after 30 days of using it well let's start with the most expensive so full disclosure for the sake of this video I love Patagonia I think that they're an incredible company I made a whole video about them and what they do in a video a couple years back when I look like I actually worked for them I'm probably not going to grow my hair it again if that's a word for some people so don't unsubscribe just based on that alone the fit of this shirt has honestly been one of my favorites of the three begin with I know that this is very different and very subjective because every shirt fits every person differently but this cut just seems to really work for my body type wear and tear this shirt has held up extremely well once you get a really nice close-up on the fabric itself you can see that it has been used but the material has retained its shape and retained its fabric integrity really really well for the most part this shirt looks pretty well the same as when I got it 30 warez ago now in terms of cost for me the Patagonia was a very expensive shirt fifty dollars for a t-shirt that's just cotton in today's world seems crazy because that's often ten times the price of what you can get a similar looking gray t-shirt for but this has held up extremely well for that dollar value part of the reason why this shirt is so expensive is because Patagonia is a leader in socially an environmentally responsible fashion but we're gonna get into that later in the video let's move on to ever lane now full disclosure I made a video debunking ever lanes claims to be radically transparent but they are a higher-end brand and therefore they should in theory have a higher quality product fit and feel honestly I love the fit of this shirt as well it's been always quite nice and tight and slimming the only thing that's slightly different from the Patagonia is the fact that it feels like a lighter shirt the material seems to be I don't know how else to put it a lighter it feels like there's less shirt on me right now and that's not necessarily a bad thing but it does feel slightly cheaper wear and tear because it does feel like a slightly lighter material it does have a bit more wear and tear to it you can see some of the fabric coming away at some of the seams but really not that much considering that I've worn it thirty different times number three cost now for 30 bucks I would say that this is a good value shirt it looks good after 30 different wares and it costs less than the Patagonia it doesn't feel like quite the same quality of a shirt but overall I think it's a good value now speaking of value let's see what we get out of a six dollar shirt how is it even possible to design produce manufacture and distribute a shirt for six dollars it honestly baffles me but the outcome is pretty predictable fit and feel this shirt never fit me as well as the first two shirts did but you can obviously see that it's just a bag your shirt maybe this is to appeal to more people but it's clear that over time the shirt has just lost some of its shape now this shirt isn't ripped or destroyed in any way or dirty but I am not very excited to wear this shirt because of the condition that it's in after only 30 wears and honestly this shirt was starting to look used after about 20 wares or so wear and tear even without looking too closely you can tell that this shirt is old it's been worn and you can obviously see that all over the shirt even without looking too closely you can see that there's peeling happening throughout the shirt not just on high rubbing areas there also seems to be some weird discoloration going on around the collar number three cost now for six dollars it's hard to say whether or not it's worth it because it costs less than a burger at McDonalds I mean I guess with that in consideration the fact that it lasted even half as long as the others is impressive but like I said at the beginning how does a shirt like this even exist for $6 farmers had to grow crops materials had to be processed designs had to be created final products shipped delivered marketed and then sold to you for $6 now this is really where price starts to come into play because these shirts not only reflect the quality of the products themselves but the values that the companies that made them try to uphold except for like dolce gabbana and supreme and all that other crap you're literally just paying for the brand name in those cases so I realized while I was editing this video that you can really tell the differences between these shirts super well so I thought I would add in another test to illustrate the differences between these shirts that no one could possibly deny a blindfold taste test well no not at eight like a feel a field test you're gonna get blindfolded now okay go upstairs good there's the stairs wow you're really good at walking blindfolded holy smokes god I wish there was a cooler surprise then here's the first one okay second one okay okay yes here's the stretch test some give the bottom doesn't feel very nice though this feels kind of Pilli it doesn't have as much give still stretchy this one has more stretch than the last one but I don't know if it has as much stretch this one's the most stretchy this is the gorge one this is ever lame this is Patagonia no how did you do that they feel different this one feels kind of chilly in a bit rough okay this one feels this one almost feels a bit like creamier butter people know what I mean and this one's like an in-between I got a right though yeah that's really good those awesome I found that super interesting because without being able to see what she was touching Leah somehow managed to pick them all right I mean I'm not staging this I definitely could have but it didn't somehow she picked exactly the right ones based on yeah can I wear it yeah sure if you want alrights mine now so what's the difference between a 50 a 30 and a $6 t-shirt the companies that created them I chose these three companies very specifically for this challenge because they represent the spread of fashion options available to most consumers we have Patagonia which is a known social and environmental advocate ever Lane which has marketed themselves as an environmentally responsible company but they're not and Gorge that basically couldn't give a about the state of the earth now I've got to be really honest I was super nervous about this challenge because I was mortified that my fifty dollar Patagonia t-shirt was going to be basically the same as a six dollar equivalent unfortunately that's not the case now as you know I'm probably biased I think the Patagonia is an outstanding company because there are very few companies of its size in the fashion industry that have done as much as they have for the sake of people and the planet but right now we're going to talk about this shirt specifically it is the only one out of the three that uses fair trade sewing practices that means that the people who made this shirt likely made a fair wage for the country that they live in they're also the only one that makes all of their t-shirts out of organic cotton a material that is far better for the planet but this shirt is also a Patagonia t-shirt and I bought it three years ago and it's still in pretty awesome condition ever lain actually makes a pretty good t-shirt which I was resentfully happy to see unfortunately their claims of radical transparency greatly mislead a lot of people into thinking that they're more sustainable than they are instead of third party certification through Fairtrade sewing they simply link you to the place where your garment was made but unfortunately none of this can be confirmed because unlike Patagonia they are not a register B corporation but this is not a takedown video about ever Lane I already made that video but all in all I would say that you're paying in part for a slightly higher quality product but also for the idea that you're supporting an ethical clothing company I really wanted to like ever Lane and finally George the crown jewel of the fast fashion industry imagine all of the horror stories that you've heard about fast fashion and that's this puppy right here unfortunately this has become normal unfortunately we kind of proved that you get what you pay for a $6 shirt doesn't last very long so obviously I would love for us all to just buy those really expensive Patagonia shirts because they are the ones that are making a fashion model that works for us and the planet but I understand that not everybody can spring for a $50 t-shirt personally I own a number of Patagonia shirts but I bought them over a period of time I purchased them when I had the means to and when I could find them on sale the beauty of Patagonia and higher quality brands is that if you can find them used they're probably still going to be in very good condition for exactly the reasons that we just outlined here today but the best option is always to find secondhand clothing if you can and support the environmentally focused companies that are out there if that isn't available but I want to thank you for watching this video I don't want to hear your feedback I'm going to be making more videos where I do experiments and challenges to test different environmental practices and so if you have any suggestions please leave them down in the comments below and of course if you want to support this channel please consider joining us over on patreon these videos take an incredibly long time to do and they're not exactly advertiser friendly so having that community of people that supports what I do here makes an incredible difference but regardless of that I want

"aquMaT5PM1Q": "[Music] I'm a summary from Bali canvass and in a recent video we talked about all of our different types of fabric in today's video we're going to talk about the different printing techniques and discuss which fabrics are best with which techniques we're going to cover pasta solving water based discharge sublimation DTG and heat press and talk about which of those techniques work on each of our different fabrics stay tuned so let's start with a hundred percent cotton islander percent cotton is pretty much the easiest fabric to work with industry printing world and it works with pretty much every single technique except sublimation pauses all ink is typically the easiest type of seam to use in the screen printing world and it works great on a huge range of fabrications including a hundred percent cotton so with class assault me you're gonna have a hand to me name the ink lays on top of the garment it works great with hundred-percent Compton along with all that that works interacts with the cotton you're not gonna have to worry about dye migration dye migration is something that happens with polyester and I'll touch on that later but because of that it's gonna work great with it too before cotton white classes all aim this thing's great because it's got a lighter hand to it than some of the inks with poly darkness another technique we love for a hundred percent cotton is water-based so all of our cotton is 100% combed in ring-spun meaning that's got a super soft hand and what water-based is if that is absorbed into the actual fibers at the cotton you're not going to feel it like you will it pass us all in this field the exact same as a regular shirt we feel with no print on it so water base is great for any light-colored Cotton's or any darker colors as long as you're using a shade darker you can't use a leg water basing on its dark fabric for that effect you're gonna want to use a discharge discharge ink is kind of like the complement to water based ink but it's used on dark fabrics so in the sense that you don't feel a water-based print in terms of the hand same goes for discharge with discharge it's gonna work best on 100% cotton compared to you know your tribe lines or your heather's but something you will want to be careful with the test for is on different colors each color is going to take that discharge agent differently so make sure to do a wide range of testing before moving forward with like a big full quarter of a specific discharge print another thing to keep in mind is discharge doesn't work on that garments there's not enough contrast so with a light garment you're gonna want to use water base with a dark garment you're gonna want to use the district this is another discharge print that we did with actual colors so with this one the discharge agent removes all of the pigment from the gray fabric and replaced it with these colors like for the whites and the reds that you see in this print here so let's move on to DG ECG stands for a direct to garment printing we've done a few videos about this in the past and it works best with 100% cotton t-shirt 100% cotton is pretty much the DTG printers ideal garment with these TG is really important more so than the spring hunting to have a really really smooth surface you want to make sure you use a comb to ring-spun garment so a bell on campus is a favorite for GDQ printers as well here's another DTG print with a dart garment you're gonna want to lay down a face and like Kermit you can just go ahead and print the ink directly on the shirt with you to do so he transfers the next process we're going to talk about it also is super easy with 100% cotton heat transfer is if you place the vine olive oil a little variety of different types of heat transfer effects but basically with this you're going to just die when I heat press it for about 15 seconds for a 320 degrees which is pretty standard and the heat press cool lastly we have sublimation so sublimation is a process that only works on polyester so you can sublimate at all on a hundred percent cotton t-shirts so we don't have an example to show you about we will later in the video with so next we're going to cover Heather C we see how their CPC is another favorite among printers and it typically takes a pretty similar to our 100% cotton typically with Heather's you have to worry about the dye migration and polyester coming through ink when you're using classed assault but we did some extensive testing on all of our feathers and found that they were pretty much just as well with cotton white as they do with an ink with a poly blocker with a 50/50 or a poly so what that means for use free printers out there is you can use a more standard name with a softer hand and not have to worry about dye migration like you usually do with Heather's and that's pretty exclusive to the fella canvas collection the same might not hold true for other brands with plastic saw ink we like to use kind of a thinner lines on it that will keep the original feel of the garment showing below but you can also do like a full cover plastisol this technique is really popular especially with kind of like street programs so for this one we have like a puff ink below and this like full coverage class all sudden people like the feel of a print so it really comes down to customer preference on that one so next let's talk about water me spinning with water base it typically comes down more to the color of the garment then the actual fabric so light colored Heather will take water-based paint very similar to a light colored solid we love the feel again because your so discharge printing on Heather's won't work as well as discharge printing on 100% cotton because that discharge agent only works with the cotton fibers of the shirt so it's really going to come down to the color here's some prints that we did with just a discharge each end and you're still going to get a light in effect which is great but it's just really important to do your testing and know that you're not going to get as bright of a discharge result with Heather's as you would as 100% cotton DTG is another printing technique that works better on 100% cotton but it's also possible with Heather's with this technique you're going to really need to do you're testing a polyester yarns we'll take the BT GE differently than 100% cotton so with this print here we got a great result but it took the printer a lot of Rd to come up with the right amount of pretreat and the right ink settings to achieve this effect another thing you want to be careful with when DTG printed on any blends is make sure to wash and scratch test it because someone that ink might come off in the washer when you're scratching it it's not as durable on the synthetic yarns as it is on the natural under the second option moving on to tiger tribe ones are one of the softest fabrics on the market but because there are three types of yarns the poly cotton and rayon and each take it differently printing on them can be trickier than printing on the fabric so you've covered up until this point however as consumer preference continues to trend for the softer garment it's important to know how to print on tribal ones and choose an ink that complements garment so because try one is largely a synthetic fabric you do have to be aware of dye migration again this will really come down to color we tested all of our try once with three types of ink cotton white 50/50 and poly white and we'll be releasing those printing tips on our site by the end of the year but what we did notice across the board is some on some try blends the cotton II work just fine where other colors didn't need a Polliwog here to stop that dye migration from coming through the e so you can see on the blue the results vary a little bit and you actually do need that Holly Walker ink to stop the dye migration whereas the some colors like this play you'll find the 50/50 in the cotton whitening perform pretty much to say on some try ones you'll need to use your gray under base to prevent any dye migration with some of the trickier colors also another tip to keep in mind is using a stretch additive or softener will help keep the stretch with the garment in the soft hand feel we're pretty impossible tripods already have a super soft hands so you don't want to print a bulletproof shield on it we lot of water-based ink for this reason my moms will take water basing pretty similar to 100% cotton we did a past video about doing water base and discharge printing on our heather solids and try it once and you can see there wasn't too much difference between our solid men and our min tripod with water base you always want to be aware of the color different colors will interact they eat differently so make sure to test first discharge printing will also work on tripods but you're not going to get as bright as an effect as you would with 100% cotton so the end result will be a more muted effect you can see this print is with the discharge agent only and this has been discharged plus color added so you're gonna definitely get more of a muted effect than you would on 100% cotton with this charge director garment is usually not recommended on trial on fabric however the Bella cam is tri-blend reacts differently than most brands because the synthetic material acts more like a cotton than a plastic we also have the super soft surface for our dry ones compared to some other brands so it is possible to get a great DTG print but again like with Heather's you're going to want to do a lot of wash testing and scratch testing and basically a lot of Rd to get the levels right it's not going to be as easy as 100% cotton so we do recommend this technique on try blends for expert dgg printers only you can also keep press on our tribe lens one thing you'll have to be aware of is because there's a lot of synthetic material you'll want here it at a lower temperature and for a less amount of time so we usually recommend about 280 degrees for 8 to 10 second so because our time moms are 50% polyester it's actually a really good candidate for sublimation if you're looking for more of a vintage effect so with sublimation the ink is gonna adhere to the polyester fibers only so with this we had a much brighter print and this is after a wash you can see it's got more of this vintage faded effect which is really popular and a try one will feel a lot nicer than 100% polyester shirts so if you're a sublimation printer out there I definitely recommend experimenting with there try buns another cool thing is we're one of the whole new brands to have solid try blends so our solid white try blend is really great for sublimation now moving on to my personal favorite fabrication flowy color business flow is one of our best-selling collections because it's one of the softest fabrics we have but because it's made of synthetic fibers polyester and viscose and it doesn't have the cotton that printers are used to usually working with we know can be intimidating for some printers out there so definitely check out last week's video if you want to learn more about what I'm about to cover pasta salting works great on flowy it's one of the ideas to work with something to keep in mind if you're using pasta sauce Inc is you want to try to keep the original feel of the garment so you can do that by adding in a softener or a stretch palliative and on some darker colors you're also going to want to use the Polly bark of these water base contain is another technique that works really great on our Chloe colleague visco it's gonna keep the soft hand of the original permit so we love this when you're working with artwork that has more coverage like these butterflies here the whites are going to be more vibrant as with any water-based printing than some of your lighter colors that go grey so discharge printing won't work on Chloe poly viscose because there's no cotton content for the discharge agent to remove so if you're working with a darker color garment and you want to get the stopped and effect of a discharge print we recommend this water-based technique that we actually featured in last week's video so what we did is use a water-based poly blocker base and then use a water-based ink on top this print here has an amazing feel and amazing stretch and it's done with water-based ink on clothing when it comes to DC depending on the flow this is another one where we've seen really awesome results so DC you turning on our Chloe is recommended for experts only but because this is such a popular fabrication and you are interested and learning some tricks for how to do it you can check out one of our past videos double link in the description keep pressing on Chloe is actually pretty similar to try one because it's more of a synthetic material you're gonna want to heat transfer at lower temperatures less time some people might not think to sublimate on our poly viscose but it is actually an awesome proverb for that there's much more polyester content than the Pittsburgh one so you're going to get a brighter print than you saw earlier so this is 65% polyester so it's not going to be as bright as a hundred percent polyester but it feels amazing and the colors are only going to be slightly more muted than they would be with 100% polyester and you're going to get a garment that customers respond to a lot better than 100% poly and you can see you can also sublimate on lighter colors like a speech polyester is really big in the athletic market and while we don't have any under percent polyester T's in our Bella canvas line Bella campus also is a line Club allspark so we're gonna touch on the printing techniques you can do with poly using our pulse Portland so with 100% poly you're gonna want to use a plastic salty you definitely have to be aware of dye migration since the shirt is 100% polyester so you're going to want to use the poly e and/or a poly walker base as well just depending on color and if you're seeing the new documentation come through you won't really get great results using a water-based ink on 100% poly and discharge won't work at all because there's no cotton content in 100% poly shirt with etg we've heard it is possible on 100% poly but it's definitely tricky and we definitely don't recommend it as the most DTG from the fabric when you keep pressing on in a percent polyester just make sure you're using a material that's resistant to dye migration sublimation is really great because the ink actually becomes the part of the original garment so it similar to a water-based ink you're not going to feel the sublimation print out we hope you enjoyed this video we obviously couldn't cover a lot of the intricacies involved in each of these printing techniques this is meant to be more of a broad overview so make sure to do your own testing also make sure to ask any questions that you have in the comments below I'll try to get back to you and subscribe to your channel for a new video every week [Music] you", "ty0VTAZHG1E": "hey it's state will save custom t-shirts and team jerseys coming at you from Burlington Ontario Canada today we're doing a product review of the Gildan ultra cotton t-shirt what can I tell you about the Gildan ultra cotton well first of all Gildan is the world leader in the promotional t-shirt business this is their standard the industry standard for the promotional t-shirt we sell more of these t-shirts than any other t-shirt out there and you can pause the video right here if you want to take a second and look at the features of the shirt so before we get into the details of the shirt I'll tell you a little bit about the manufacturing process Gildan these ultra Cotton's are actually manufactured down in the dominican the dominican is actually one of the happiest countries in the world strangely enough it's a developing nation where your average person down there makes about 10 bucks 10 US dollars per day and about 50% of the country lives in poverty so the t-shirt is a 100% preshrunk jersey knit cotton it's actually one of the heavier t-shirts that you can buy in terms of the fabric weight why is fabric weight important because fabric weight impacts the wearability of the shirt it's really a matter of personal preference personally I like to wear shirts that are a little bit lighter in the fabric Department probably somewhere around the 6 to 7 range and if you kind of benchmark this against one of the more you know entry-level fashionable t-shirts like an American Apparel these are about 33% heavier in terms of the fabric versus the American Apparel so regarding the print ability of these t-shirts as I mentioned earlier these t-shirts really have a tendency to top up a lot of ink so what you want to try to avoid is you want to try to avoid putting massive full-color logos on these shirts because it will absorb up a lot of the ink and that image on the front of your shirt will like be having a thick coat of paint on the front of your shirt which will allow the shirt to breed or anything like that like for example the guy over on the left side of the screen right here he's got a really Inc intensive logo on a shirt where is the guy more in the middle has a better shirt because that logo is just strictly text it doesn't absorb up as much ink and it makes the shirt a little bit nicer away so the ultra cotton and its complementary shirts come in you know the manager of the unisex size plus there's lady sizes and there's youth and children's sizes as well plus it comes in a variety of style you can not only get a t-shirt breaking in a long-sleeve shirt you can get a pullover hoodie and you can get a zip up hoodie the reason why this is important to you as a consumer is because if you've got a wide variety of people or you're trying to launch a whole garment line you've got a wide variety of products to choose from with very well matching colors one other thing is that Gildan does an awesome job on making sure that their colors are consistent throughout the product line so if you get a navy blue shirt navy blue t-shirt the same pretty much the identical coloring the identical fabric dye is going to be used on their hoodies and their ladies t-shirts and their long sweeps so it makes color matching your products and coming out with a nice consistent theme across the board really easy to do overall we've given the Gildan ultra cotton a rating of 3 of 5 stars everyone's already familiar with the Gildan brand name so it's a nice easy shirt brand is recognizable folks think they're getting a great quality shirt when they get these so dollar for dollar I think if you spent a little bit more money you can get a you know much better quality shirt and have a much wider range of printing options on that shirt thanks for watching our review of the Gildan ultra cotton t-shirt if you need custom printed t-shirts or team jerseys you can reach us at WWF CA we'll talk to you soon", "iBKiHxTN_CM": "what's up everyone Rory

this video we're gonna talk about how you can start a t-shirt business from home with as little as five hundred dollars let's not waste any time and get right into it check us out guys we're going by calm type in Jordan shirt and here you'll see a bunch of t-shirts so these shows will cost us around $2 to make you will need around five hundred dollars to buy all the equipment and you'll be able to make these at home these are gonna be professional quality store ready t-shirts so let's take a look at this t-shirt right here let's click on it so this seller didn't do a good job with the listing the image is horrible and the shirt is all wrinkled but still he sold 115 of these t-shirts for $20 and so he's making over $10 per shirt let's click right here and this is how many he sold so just today he sold two three four he sold for these t-shirts so off of one t-shirt he made $40 you guys can make a ton of different t-shirts from athletes and musicians to movies to much more so let's talk about how to make these shirts the first thing we're gonna do is go on a website called jittery shirts calm this is the website where we're gonna buy our blank t-shirts we're gonna buy the Gildan g500 t-shirt this is one of the most common t-shirts and it's good because it has a tare weight label so it's very convenient the show will cost around a dollar sixty cents the second thing you guys will need a special inkjet principle heat transfer paper you can get these in different sizes such as eight-and-a-half by 11 and 11 by 17 the small one is called a four and the large one is called a three you will need light transfer paper for white t-shirts and black transfer paper for dark t-shirts when you're first starting out you guys should buy these on Amazon and then you can buy the wholesale and Alibaba for around thirty cents a sheet for the large ones the next thing you guys will need is a Epson WUF 7710 printer and the fourth thing is a large heat press machine so the first thing we have to do is mirror the image let's click tools flip horizontal and now ready to print alright so when you put it on the white t-shirts we're gonna insert an 11 by 17 white paper into the printer an image I just want you guys to understand one thing even though I'm printing with a inkjet printer the ink will never smudge it will be impossible to make the income off the t-shirt the shirt will have to be destroyed this is gonna be a professional quality t-shirt the ink is gonna melt with a thin piece of vinyl onto the t-shirt so when the paper is printed it's not gonna look too bright but when it's on the shirt isn't look much better the next step is to cut out all the white parts the image you can do this with scissors or if you want better results you could do this with a paper cutter don't worry if you don't cut it perfectly because the white areas are barely seen my friend the image is now ready to be printed on the shirt all right guys the next step we're gonna take a blank shirt we're gonna preheat it to get the moisture out we're gonna put the part of the t-shirt which will print on onto the heat plate wait for the silicone paper and press it for about 10 seconds you guys see steam coming out that's fine don't worry and now we'll do the same thing for some bottom the next step is gonna take the image I'm gonna align it on the t-shirt Airport and then we're gonna use paper tape or you guys can use special heat transfer tape to take the image on shirt and now we're gonna transfer an image onto the t-shirt and now I'm going to press it at 300 let's say 50 degrees for around 15 seconds so right now is a very important part if you guys peel while the shirt is hot you're gonna get a matte finish if you guys have the shirt cool off and peel when it's cold the finish will be glossy for this shirt we're peeling it hot to have a matte finish make sure you take the tape off very carefully and as you guys can see we have a professional finished t-shirt if you guys look on the bottom right there's a very small white scratch this happened because the paper was scratched before printing so always make sure to inspect the paper prior to printing otherwise the prints come out perfectly every single time it's almost impossible to mess with the printer we're almost finished we just have to do one more thing and that's to stretch out the shirt and repress it one more time for about 10 seconds to make sure the shirt lasts a long time now we're gonna stretch a shirt out to make sure it lasts a long time when I press one more time put the silicone paper on and do a very quick five-second press the show zone alright guys now we're gonna do a black t-shirt it's nice on paper for this example we're gonna put the small image on the a4 paper so when you're printing on black t-shirts the image does not need to be mirrored we're gonna use our cutter to cut out all the white areas and that we're ready to eat president image so now I'm gonna press the black shirt quick ten-second press so the next step is to carefully peel the top layer [Music] and now we're going to carefully line the image onto the t-shirt now I'm gonna put it into the heat press and press the image press it for around ten seconds at 320 degrees Fahrenheit now with no move the silicone paper do a quick stretch and our shirt is done alright guys the next step is to make our shirt labels the best way to do this is by making plaster salt heat transfer labels you can get these for around 10 cents if you order in large quantities just make sure the image is mirrored before sending it to the seller we're gonna go into google and type in shirt label template right here you'll get a template for the labels you guys can Photoshop your own if you want we will download one of the sample labels and heat transfer it to the shirt I strongly recommend you guys get the classes on cue transfers if you want flawless results every time but if you guys want to do it yourself and get a special Oki laser printer and special heat transfer paper and try it out there is a learning curve to this and the results are not going to be as good as the plastisol labels let's carefully tear away the gilding tag alright guys so we're gonna place our label onto the shirt place the silicone paper over it and heat presses and now let me slowly peel the label when the shirt is finished you will package it in a plastic bag which will cost you around five to ten cents you will then take photos of the t-shirt let's talk about two very important parts of this business the first one is reinvesting money back into the business so for example if you start with $100 you can make 50 t-shirts and $2.00 each shirt if you sell those 50 t-shirts at $10 you will have $500 if you take the $500 you can make 250 t-shirts if you sell the 250 t-shirts at $10 you will have 2,500 and so on the second thing is you guys have to make t-shirts which don't have trademarks and copyrights this is very important if you want to have a long stable business get creative and make really cool t-shirts I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please leave a like to subscribe and if you have any questions please ask in the comments below I'll see you guys in the next one", "s8xTUyguhr4": "check I got a thing for Vince's throttle engine as hot as Liz's watches into Roger Henson the frame cuz the game treats phony friendship all right man I'm excited for this video I'm feeling good this is a topic I really haven't discussed on this channel much and I know that may seem kind of odd and almost impossible but trust me I haven't made a video about graphic t-shirts really ever there's a ton that goes into these style tees the material the brand where you got it from the graphic obviously so I'm gonna break all that down for you right now let's do it I'm gonna start off with one of my favorite brands these should be no surprise to you I've had him in my collection for a while now I've shown them to you before but we gots to see they've been around for so long they are one of the original streetwear brands and a while back I was like okay there's so many streetwear brands out there let me just choose a few that I really identify with and Stussy has always spoke to me you know the skate and surf background I like that a lot so you know I've really been rocking with them and I don't mind investing a little bit of money into their t-shirts they hit anywhere from like thirty to fifty eight dollars so you know certainly expensive some of them but you can always catch them on sale like any t-shirt brand especially a streetwear brand puts tees on sale at some point this is also a stew CT and I just really liked their graphics stuff that stands out to me basketball skateboarding fishing paradise you know these tropical settings all that type of stuff I like you can buy Stussy tees in a bunch of different places if I find any sales I'll be sure to link them down in the description they fit true to size in my opinion keeping it moving I got a t-shirt from bodega and you'll find that a lot of the big sneaker boutiques are releasing their own clothing you know it took a little while for some of these shops to get a good designer in there and release some strong graphics and good cutting so stuff but bodega has consistently been releasing good clothing and this year they've been dropping a bunch of teas that are fire in my opinion it's local to me so I went in store tried them on and I bought a couple this is one of them it's the bodega Wireless tea so this one here is made in the USA god I appreciate that nice quality material it's got a small bodega wireless graphic in the front and then on the back large and in charge I don't know why but this just reminded me of when I had a sidekick and used to go into the t-mobile store to pay my bill I don't even know why I was paying my bill in store all the time what was they thinking why was that going in store to pay my bills do they not have online payment options I don't even know I used to really go into the mall and pay my bill every month like that's wild this graphic is a little bit more bold and loud than I typically would wear this year I just feel like wearing graphic stuff is really on trend and I'm comfortable with it so you know I had to support my local shop I got another tee I'll show you guys at a different time and then I was planning on going back but they sold out so if you like something make sure you don't sleep okay so switching gears a little bit and leaving Street we're going into the menswear side of things we've got a polo bear tee a lot of you have seen these tees you know they're in pretty much every polo outlet every Ralph Lauren store polo has been pushing these bear tease a lot this one's from the outlet and you know there's nothing wrong with buying a polo t-shirt or anything from outlet for that matter I buy a lot of stuff there you know you can try it on it makes it easy there's always a sale I got this a few weeks back it retailed for 40 bucks I think I paid like high 20s like 28 29 or something like that so obviously it's in this fun the summertime yellow color and then you've got the beach vibes with the bear just ready to break out a beach volleyball game this tee is definitely something I'll be wearing a lot it's just a distinct polo item and it's classic and I don't think that they're gonna go out of style okay next up I got a little side part for you guys because this is an important topic and I kind of wanted to cut it out from the rest of the video this is not a specific brand or anything like that this is pretty much talking about thrifting shirts or buying cheap tourist location type shirts so this is totally different it's no secret that you can buy great t-shirts of all different kinds at a thrift store that's probably going to be your best place to find a unique variety that's cheap so if you're on a budget and you're not hitting up thrift stores and you like those style tees I know what you doing so I thrifted this Florida tea right here I don't know how old it is but I just loved the graphic in the front it's an older Jersey Blanc tea but it's made in the USA there really wasn't any one that had worn this tea it looked brand spankin new so a lot of people go to the thrift store and they want stuff that's been washed it looks like it's vintage and it's old I kind of go the opposite direction I know that sounds kind of crazy I want to find an old t-shirt that doesn't have much wear to it and that kind of stuff is really hard to get your hands on but it does exist trust me people buy t-shirts in bulk or when they're traveling and they just never wear it and then eventually they donate it you'd be surprised how many newish t-shirts pop up at the thrift store that are still old stuff that's like five or ten years old anyway I have no idea how old this thing is but the design is really what sold me I love the palm trees the Sun set the font of the Florida logo on the top and that's the next thing I want to talk about location tees state tees souvenir t-shirts stuff that really isn't made to be worn in a street wear way but that's kind of the way I've been liking to wear these style t-shirts this next one behind me is a New Hampshire t-shirt I got this when I was up at Lake Winnipesaukee which I'm going to again this weekend I'm definitely gonna try to grab another one of these this is from Walmart so if you're ever in a random location and you want to find a good graphic State t-shirt check out Walmart my brother is actually the one that put me on to this so shout out to you Nick he's like we got to hit up the local Walmart and see what they have for teas I was like what Walmart for t-shirts that is one thing that I never really thought I was gonna do but Here I am talking about it in the video so it's got this cool hummingbird and floral design at the top and it says New Hampshire down at the bottom I wore this in a couple look books and I got messages and emails from people asking me where they could get this exact t-shirt I didn't think anyone was gonna care wherever you travel this summer go check out a Walmart or a tourist location or wherever and check out the t-shirts go for some pigment dyed tees or anything that has a cool font or graphic design on the front definitely do that while you're traveling this summer I know that's not necessarily a brand so I'm gonna mention a few other ones Carhartt work-in-progress definitely check out their stuff Jordan and Nike surprisingly has been putting out a lot of good graphic tees so check their but let's keep it moving because I got one more brand to show you guys and I bought a ton of t-shirts from them already this summer ok so getting back to the street wear side of things this brand has been killing it I recently dropped over a hundred bucks on their tees easily every release they've had I've seen at least four or five tees and other items that I've wanted you guys know undefeated is definitely one of the best sneaker shops around huge in California but they also make amazing t-shirts in my opinion I actually have never been to one of their stores which is crazy I got to get out to California in general just to hang out there but that's another conversation their clothing recently though it's just so fire this one is in this orange apricot color with a university type logo this one though is a little bit different obviously it's black and it's got this gradient undefeated logo but then the back check that out this is one of the coolest graphics I've seen on a t-shirt recently so you got a basketball player about to throw it down in black and white and then you also have that same script undefeated logo at the bottom here this is definitely one of my favorite newest t-shirt pickups I would say and I've been waiting to break these out because pastel colors this summer they're huge as well so say you've got some shoes they have like this pinkish purple color this tee right here is a nice accent to those shoes so be sure to let me know which one of these t-shirts you guys like the best what are some brands that you guys are wearing this summer leave it down in the comments section put us on to some newer or older brands that you've been wearing that we should check out there's so many that are out there so I really hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you hit the thumbs up if you did subscribe if you're new a lot more summer content is on the way I keep saying that because it's true and I keep bringing these summer videos so if you've missed any of them make sure you go check them out we're gonna end it with the summer lookbook so keep it out for that one I'll catch you guys next time peace", "FtYxUR34whM": "okay folks we are back with another product review from heart mind soul and the HMS nation today we are going to be doing our product review for the trusted Gildan guild ang mm altar a cotton t-shirt 100% cotton this is a great product and the reason why I wanted to choose this product for today's review is because he's holed up so well we've been printing t-shirts for over 20 years believe it or not and some of the very first t-shirts that we ever printed were in fact printed on the the guild an ultra cotton and be still be still hold up we still have we still have we still have teachers from 20 years ago and that's why this is a great value based product now it's not the softest of hand you know it is 100% cotton so it is a little bit coarse it doesn't have what it doesn't have a lot of a lot of other features like the dry like the dry fit or if you want moisture wicking it does absorb it does absorb sweat very well however so a lot of people in the kitchen industry tend to prefer the hundred percent cotton what else is nice about this they come in an awful lot of colors there's a very wide color selection they come in a large variety of sizes up to 5 6 X and a lot of different different colors that aren't available from most companies but the biggest reason why I like this product is that it holds up again so I got so this is a brand-new this is a brand-new t-shirt right here brand new Gildan 2000 shirt and this is one that I've had for at least two maybe three years and I have I have worn the heck out of this I have intentionally tried but you can't even see the you can't even see the label anymore here honest to goodness I have washed this just so many times worn this out in the desert wanted out camping let the dogs sleep on it and they still hold up I mean there is just you know look at this I mean you know four to three year old t-shirt you know the the stitching is still all intact the hems are pretty good here look around the neckline there's a little bit of a little of wear and tear but not too terribly much stretching here this is still a nice t-shirt in fact I'm gonna put this on when I'm done with a review and go do some yard work in it and and people love it they always can still see the design look at how nice that shows up this is this is the black one this is your we didn't print this design all this is just a sample shirt so I took it out and researched and developed it and you can see kind of how well this wood held up well this dark dark Heather anyways it's a nice really nice shirt here the last thing we'll enjoy your attention to is the discharge water-based screen printing that we did on the Gildan t-shirt and this is why I specifically chose this shirt for it is because it holds up so well because again this is a brand new one the only drawback what you have and use white ink is that there is titanium in it which will cause some cracking as you see here very minimal but it is gonna crack eventually versus the discharge ink which will never crack at all so either way you can find all of these designs on our HMS nation website or contact heart mind soul for a custom quote today", "fVJWMmDwH50": "We're talking about the Next Level 100%\nring-spun cotton long sleeve t-shirt. This is one of our favorite long sleeve\nt-shirts for a few reasons. First off, is the price point, it fits great into any budget and for just a\nlittle more expensive than a hundred percent cotton Gildan, you get a much\nsofter shirt. The colors, there aren't as many options as maybe the Gildan one,\nbut they're awesome because they're very standard. Instead of just telling you about the shirt though, about the fit and everything we do have our model. He's gonna come over and basically show this thing off. The first thing you're gonna notice is it does fit great, very tailored side. We have a seam right here that contours to the body just like every Next Level\nt-shirt. Next let's look at the neckline. The neckline on this is, it's bound on the inside, good stretch, a hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton. Just an awesome neckline. There's not too many special things about the neck on this shirt because it's just a standard crew neck. The sleeves though, awesome thing to note here, they're not baggy. How many of us grew up with a long sleeve t-shirt? Maybe you got it in sports and they're super baggy, you know like you think, who did they make this thing for? how many people are they fitting in here? No this shirt looks like it was made for Tyler, right here. Another thing is the sleeves. Normal long sleeve shirts have a big cuff this shirt basically just has a seam right here, so, there will be pictures on our site that you can look at for this but it's one seam right there so it's not a thick cuff. Great for pulling up it's just an awesome sleeve it doesn't feel heavy and as structured as other brands. If you compare this to the Canvas hundred percent ring-spun cotton one, you're gonna find that this one maybe feels a little more like an unstructured shirt a little more casual. I also love the\nring spun cotton in this very soft. Over the course of a good amount of washes it\nwill maintain its softness too. So, if you're looking for a great hundred percent ring-spun\ncotton long sleeve shirt. It fits a great price point, comes in awesome colors and a great fit. You look awesome in it Tyler. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this  video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "3DTegwqbJ6M": "hey guys how you doing this is home with liberty graphic designs i'm gonna make a really quick video on sublimation so don't go anywhere [Music] okay so i always say i'm gonna make a quick video right and end up ends up being like 20 minutes but i'm gonna try to keep it very short and uh like you guys know on my video sometimes i put a lot of information this is not gonna be one of those videos so okay so one of the things about sublimation it has to be 100 polyester though you can use some blends like for example 65 um uh yeah 65 35 right and you'll get like a vintage kind of look but um a lot of whenever we do sublimation we always stick to why well i'm going to be sublimating this fluorescent orange and then we're going to be doing some other colors obviously this is not white right but there's colors that we can use on this one like for example black blues reds you know stuff like that colors uh um dark color colors like that can be sublimated on this type of shirts so let me show you first uh how to do your uh like regular vinyl right on 100 polyester and and then we'll go from regular vinyl hdv uh to sublimation okay so i have a sheet right here and this is sublimation paper as you can see it's pretty big i just printed this it's 24 by 24 uh using the epson f570 so i'm gonna cut my artwork okay so the first one we're gonna make is gonna be this um fluorescent orange uh a jersey or shirt and this is gonna be actually all this i'm going to make like three different shirts i think it's three different shirts a lot of these are a friend of mine not for the same friend right but they're all they're all very good friends of mine so it's gonna be a like say for example a construction construction uh company this is all we need we don't need a bag i'm sorry we don't need a pillow okay so this is all we need you don't need a pillow for this because you're not going over any seams a lot of people will put the color on this side so you don't print it that's that's a really good idea me i don't care so i'm going to press this for one minute 60 seconds and i have other settings in here everybody prints with different settings i have my settings i have everything everything dialed in the way that i want it again everybody prints like for example they'll say 400 for 60 seconds or uh you know 425 for x amount of seconds me i got my own settings and i'm gonna keep those two myself so there you go that's the front and look at that that one's done and this is what it looks like dang it it's hot that's what it looks like it's nice and dark i mean it's really really black so again those are settings that i already already been playing with um and i printed this on an epson f570 so now we're going to do the back and the back is same same thing and you guys are going to ask yourselves juan you don't use a uh t-square no i don't use a t-square there you go that's the back and you see how dark it looks i mean dang it it's hot it's like really hot but look at how dark that is i mean that's like a true black i mean that thing is it's like it's really really black it's amazing right it looks really really good well you're gonna be like well it's a bright color yeah it is look at that it looks really really good so on this t-shirts right here there's no need to make a screen to screen print it none whatsoever you can use sublimation now let's move over to something a little more challenging black it's a black t-shirt and let me show you against this black t-shirt this is 100 polyester i'm going to show you against the t-shirt so you can see how dark my black my black is you see that you see how dark i am on the uh on the sublimation yep it looks really good okay so now on this one 100 poly no i'm not gonna use sublimation so for something like this if you guys have any sublime any uh polyester shirts like this you know you cannot sublimate black so for that we are going to use regular vinyl you're probably going to be asking why are you using vinyl you can screen print it well the reason why is because this is just one shirt that's the reason why i'm using vinyl so all i got to do on this one change my settings because i don't want to i don't want to heat press it for one minute so that's it peel it hot and then i just give it about three seconds without the uh without the the uh what they call it the carrier i'm not going to touch it because it's like super hot so there you go and by doing that that you know five seconds it really pushes the the uh what they call it the vinyl back into the fabric and notice how my shirts i'm not burning my shirts you see that sometimes when we saw blue maid you can see the part where you actually burn the shirt okay so now we're gonna move into yet another shirt and the next one is gonna be this charcoal gray so charcoal gray let's see what happens with the sublimation and the reason why i'm doing this video guys is so you guys can get an idea on how dark you can get sublimation to work so we're going to take our sublimation on a dark gray shirt so a lot of you is going to say it's not going to work because sublimation is supposed to work only on white t-shirts or light colors let me change my settings okay so let's see if our dark um garment worked look at that you see that so a lot of people will say somebody mentioned dang it that's hot it's like really hot a lot of people will tell you sublimation only works on white t-shirts no it does not depending on your settings and how good your you know your printer is this is how good you can make it look so let's throw a logo on the front just to kind of finish that shirt and then after i do this logo i'm going to show you something real quick [Music] also notice when i lower my press i went real slow when you're doing sublimation you want to go real slow if you don't if you didn't apply adhesive or put a heat tape on it you want to you want to lower your press real slow because if you if you bring it down too fast the wind uh that you create by pushing it down can move the artwork and that's the front of the shirt and you can see it's nice and dark really hot too see that so this is a very dark shirt and yeah you can still make it work okay so the next shirt we're gonna make is gonna be this um gray one and the color and this one is actually silver that's the color on this one silver and this one we're going to do a number and do a number on this one um this is a jersey for like a soccer team okay so except for the number and on this numbers this is really cool because on the number i even in i even did the logo of the team um so that's what it would look like on a gray shirt and it actually looks it looks really good okay so but one thing i wanted to show you and i'm gonna show you on this red one is this one's right here they get a logo on the sleeve so a couple of things you got to do on the sleeve if you're going to do a logo on the sleeve do it where the sleeve is actually folded just like that like it is and then put it right there or whatever is going to go right in this case it has to be right in the center of the of the sleeve well if we do that so usually stick your hand inside so you can get it right in the center and then you follow the crease right see that crease okay so when you're working with uh something like that it has seams i'm actually where i'm where i'm placing the the print there's no seam but the seam is on the other side so what you want to do is you use a piece of foam any foam would do just make sure that you put a piece of teflon teflon sheet on top of it so it will be something like this so you will put your sure like that right and see right now the crease or the seam i'm sorry the seam is right here and there's the crease so that that's the center of the shirt now if you put a piece of foam in there the this right here will sink into the foam and you can you can go ahead and sublimate it and you won't have a problem but if you sublimate it directly on the planet the blonde there's not going to be any room for that for the um the song part to go anywhere and you're going to ruin the shirt it's not going to sublimate um it's not going to sublimate properly the best way to do that is if you get a pillow but if you don't have a pillow and this is one of those heat press uh pillows so if you don't have a pillow you can go to walmart um hobby lobby uh joanne's or whatever where they sell a foam and you can buy a piece of foam that would be the cheapest way however if you're gonna go this route i suggest you put a piece of a teflon sheet parchment paper any type of paper to protect the foam from getting sublimation into the foam uh it doesn't matter if you get sublimation on the foam right you can throw it away but if you get sublimation on the foam or any type of um ink on the foam it's going to transfer over to the to the next garment so this is what it's gonna look like okay so if you use a foam make sure that you adjust your pressure because now uh you added a foam this thing is not gonna close see it just won't close so adjust your pressure try it and um and then go from there i already lost my my little crease make sure you put it upside down and now we can sublimate the sleeve there you go sublimate it using a regular piece of foam and you're gonna probably ask yourself oh you're gonna probably say juan you said to use to cover the phone yeah but if you notice i'm only using that little part right there so there's no way that the ink can get over there but just to be on the safe side make sure you use something to cover that foam you see everything is sublimated then this thing this thing is hot so so look at that i mean you can actually tell where the the sewn part was or the seam you can see where this the seam was right there i can actually see it but if you notice everything sublimated correctly so by using a piece of foam you can um you can get away from you know so um from these uh seams right here just by using a little uh cheap piece of foam one thing i forgot to mention guys uh when you're doing multiple shirts this is some sublimation okay so as you can see i went and got another shirt but one thing is very important that you do is make sure you put a protective piece of paper like on the other ones you didn't see me using that but i'm gonna show you real quick because uh sometimes the when you're doing the sublimation sometimes when you're doing the sublimation this is sublimation paper right sublimation will actually bleed through depending on what kind of settings you're using on your paper and what kind of paper you're using so it'll bleed through the paper and actually stain the uh um what do you call this the teflon the teflon sheet and then when you go to apply an or when you go to supplement another shirt or garment whatever it is you're using or sublimating masks t-shirts whatever you're sublimating that image is going to be imprinted on your teflon sheet and you can actually stain the other shirt or whatever it is you're using so i'm going to show you real quick uh what i mean by that because i didn't explain that on the video i was about to edit the video and i was like let me let me fix this real quick so let me show you real quick what i'm talking about okay okay so we're going to do this shirt right let's say for example on this one we're going to do the number this one's going to be number four so i've been doing this for a while if you guys if you guys don't feel comfortable just placing the the number or whatever it is you're gonna sublimate like that uh use a ruler so you're straight i've been doing this for a while so well i i don't use that anymore but this is what i'm talking about grab a piece of butcher paper uh even regular paper will work um let me fix this right so it doesn't slide on me this is what i say i'm look i'm in the market for another heat press because i like to thread my my shirts and this one i can't thread them so if i was to thread it see you know i'll be stretching the the shirt because it's already hidden at the bottom so that's what it means by threading a shard is is where you can put it inside the machine so that's why i'm i'm in the market for another heat press so okay so going back in this right so um several ways of finding your center you know you can fold it in half just make sure that your uh that your edge to edge but in this case we're just going to put it about right there and then the position and the numbers you want to leave enough space just in case they want to come back and say can you add a name so if you put your name your numbers up too high you're not going to be able to add a name in the top you're going to have to do it at the bottom so i usually i usually place my num my numbers about six inches from the color down um that's where it's going to go so and then this is what i was saying put a piece of parchment paper a piece of butcher paper even regular paper however this paper that you're gonna put in here has to go in the trash after you use it and i'll show you what i mean okay so now this is what i'm talking about um i know you're not probably not going to be able to see it on camera maybe you can but there's a very let me get this out of here um so there's a number right number four and what i was telling you about it'll bleed through the number or through the paper um depending on your settings so i don't know if you can see it but there's a very faint uh image in there of the number well if you don't if you don't protect your your heat press that will bleed through and you you're going to put an image on your um on your heat press or your teflon sheet and then when you go to when you go to press the other one you're going to have like for example not all the shirts are gonna be number four but i say for example we'll go to number five you're gonna have the number five and you're gonna still see the number four in there um trust me uh right here you can hardly see it but when you press a shirt and watch i'm gonna show you just so you can see it let me see if i can put a print um i have this material here this is what we use for some of the mask this is white so we're going to try to see if we can get that number to sublimate because you're going to be able to see it on the white print better than you can on this piece of paper so this is just replicating let's say for example you put another shirt in there um like for example the number five or number three whatever you know okay and after you use this paper pla make sure you throw it away um this is pretty cool it actually cleaned the ink that was in this paper it actually took it i mean it completely cleaned the the ink that's pretty cool yeah because i can't even see anything anymore but if we look at our print again it's very light but it's right there again i don't know how good you can see that on the on the uh on the video but it's right there i can see the number four right there it's going right there over here again you can hardly see it but if you're doing multiple shirts that's gonna get uh brighter and brighter and brighter and then you're gonna ruin a shirt okay so again i forgot to uh to show you this i forgot to tell you about putting a piece of uh a lot of people use butcher butcher paper um perfectly fine whatever paper you want to use uh if butcher paper is too expensive you can just buy a rim that's what i call it right a rim of paper regular printer paper and then just put it on top to protect the the heat press or the teflon sheet that you're gonna put in there that way if you transfer anything onto the the um not only the shirt but to whatever you're protecting you can throw this away and measure you can only use this once so use it once and throw it away get get rid of it don't use it again because you'll see how it actually um and this one you can hardly see it see this one i couldn't even i can't even see it but even though you cannot see it trust me you want to get rid of it just in case if there is residue of uh adhesive in there i'm sorry not adhesive of sublimation ink in there again depending on what your settings are and what i mean by settings is what how much ink you actually actually deposit on the sublimation paper i like to do a little extra myself because you get better prints that way so so yeah make sure you use some sort of paper so you protect your heat press so i forgot to put that on the on the regular video that's why i came back i didn't finish editing the editing the video so i came back and redid this one so you guys uh can see what i'm talking about okay now also on the other video i didn't show you uh how i was doing the sponsor and everything so let me show you real quick so it's really it's really easy for you to mess it up once you uh line up everything say for example that's where it's gonna go when you lower this if you lower it too fast did you see that how that one moved so that's what i'm saying be careful you can add adhesive just regular adhesive you don't have to go buy that expensive pro spray that you know you can buy of i don't know i can't even remember the johnson plastics i think sell some on a lot of people sell those you know pro sprays this is regular spray adhesive that we use for screen printing you can use this just spray a little bit so just enough so it'll stick wherever you want it to be at now even if i move the shirt that's not going to move well flip it over it will right um but that has enough enough adhesive for the for the graphics to stay on and it won't mess it up trust me the adhesive will not transfer it'll it won't stay on the shirt and it's just a little bit i mean i just sprayed a little bit so yeah you so you want to apply just a little bit of adhesive so the the um what do you call it the print doesn't move and then don't forget to put your paper on it because remember the reason why we put in the paper is so it doesn't transfer onto the heat press and that's it remember we grab this piece of paper and again on this one i don't see any transfer but even though even though you don't see anything get rid of it because there could be something there that you don't see because i literally don't see any any transfer on there but we're gonna throw it away and as you can see if you add adhesive to it um the adhesive completely leads to i mean it won't you won't have any residue and you don't have to use none of that you know pro spray that they sell and that's it now remove that shirt okay now if you do happen to transfer some ink into the teflon sheet either the bottom or the top one keep one of these bottles handy uh this is just a degreaser and what i do is i take one of my whole shirts and as you can see it's all orange so spray a little bit in there just like that this is just in case if you did transfer some and clean it and just clean your plant and you'll be ready to go the um what they call it the degreaser will take any uh residue that you left in there okay so i just wanted to i just wanted to point that out because i forgot to like let you guys know or you know show you that little trick but yeah thank you for watching guys [Music] you", "-fIXaDeYpjY": "hello this is a shirt works progra view for a Guilder and heavy cotton tee gto 585 grams that comes in a variety of cotton poly mixes depending on color and most of them are are under percent cotton but you need to make sure if you've got a preference you look at the colors and the information next to each one this comes in a whopping 48 colors which is a big selling feature for this includes antique colors and heather colors it's not quite as smooth as the soft style teachers from Giro down but a beautiful quality to wait to price ratio neck is a little bit thicker in the rib arms or world proportions the body is snug but not too tight the length is a little bit too much for me but I am assure us I'll show you what it looks like in a large okay so we've got up a size and as you can see it's quite a leap in size okay personally this one is too big for me I prefer my shirts to be a little bit better fitted so a medium size guide and with this particular product from Gilda I personally would buy a medium sized shirt", "BL4SjXrsX8w": "hey everyone so in this video I'm doing an unboxing for Banana Republic t-shirts so I got two different models so I'll really only be trying on two of them but I want to show you the colors and why I got them so first off Banana Republic t-shirts are usually around fifteen to seventeen dollars depending on the sale and I noticed a sale that was going on for a short while for ten dollars each and it's twenty-five dollars for free shipping so I purchased three of them and got free shipping and I was like you know what I already got three I might as well get a fourth one and because what I'm getting free shipping anyways so it's really important to kind of track the prices for stuff you really want and just pay attention to them also following certain forums or communities like reddit's frugal men's fashion also really helps because you get access to a community of people who are just as knowledgeable usually I think ready as a community can get pretty snarky or rude but that's usually when you're posting stuff and others comment versus if you're just a lurker there so so far I like that community I recently found it a few weeks ago and I knew the banana republic crisis inside I followed their stuff for years now so the two different models I got were the supima cotton line and that is the most popular line of t-shirts that they have and then the next line I got was the tech cotton line there was another lineup out there I think but tech cotton is the second most popular and second most reliable after supima cotton I've heard some of their other lines aren't as consistent with their quality I heard some of them will shrink into wash after a few Weir's by a considerable amount so I just wanted something that was very reliable and solid and so I went with their tech comm lines as far as colors go I went with the solid standard colors that you want for meals fashion so white gray and black and navy blue in this case I have enough black t-shirts so I just opted for navy blue grey and white one thing that's I noticed already it was some people were saying how Oh actually one guys said that Banana Republic is just gap and Old Navy rebranded but it's the same quality and that's not true you know I've been a shopper at Banana Republic for a few years now and just if you just put your hands on the clothing and feel it it's higher quality you can feel the difference and then if you look at the tags you'll notice that there's often a little bit of difference in the type of fabric that they use so for some of their t-shirts I've bought in the past Banana Republic adds in a little bit of bamboo or other fabric to their cotton t-shirts and that gives it a much more luxurious feel and I feel like they they put a little bit more attention in detail to the stitching and the fabric and how it finally like comes out and I can sense it because I've bought Gap t-shirts and I've bought Uniqlo t-shirts and many other t-shirts and Banana Republic has a more luxury style the only thing with it is that I think the fit isn't as good as it is with Uniqlo so we'll see if that's actually true Uniqlo is usually a bit cheaper although they recently raised prices so now their shirts are $15 each which is comparable to banana now which is kind of a bummer they used to be $10 each so I got a deal of a lifetime and right off the bat as I open this up I am not so happy look how wide it is and I always get this small cuz I fit really well with small so I don't know what the heck is going on here like I just know it's already too wide like look how wide it is that's that's way wider than I'd like it to be so I'm gonna put it on though usually they're small spit very well for me except for the sleeves which flare out where-where's Uniqlo sleeves fit really well off the bat but maybe you'll fit better when I put it on okay so material wise you know it's got that nice smooth material it's not too smooth it's a little bit rough but it's it has that like comfort that I don't get from the gap t-shirts and that's saying something because a gap and Old Navy and Banana Republic are under the same conglomerate company so they're essentially I think they they all come from the same factories is except the quality and the prices differ it's basically Old Navy the gap and then Banana Republic so I definitely feel there's something about the fabric that just feels a bit more comfy because the gap t-shirts are more rough as far as the width it doesn't it's not as bad when I put it on but look here I like to have no more than an inch maybe an inch and a half and I'm seeing two and a half inches on one side and maybe two inches on the other so it is it is unfortunately too wide I mean if I could if I didn't buy this online I would go to a store and try on the extra small but I can't do that and I hate returning clothing because it's such a hassle sometimes you have to pay for shipping you have to package back pack it back up I don't even know if they offer free returns for this so unfortunately I'm gonna have to keep it is it the worst in the no is it the best no look at the arms they flare out a little bit they're a little bit too long and then terms of the fit you know the chest fits decently but it's it's a little too loose down here like look at that look how much it comes out so I'm about five ten five nine and I fluctuating weight but usually I'm around 160 pounds so I mean think about that so honestly you know the best t-shirts for an Asian man like me have actually been from Arizona tea which is a company that only sells through JCPenney and I've been able to get a shirt winter on sale for five dollars a piece from there and they fit like a glove this doesn't flare out this isn't too wide and then I'll say right under Arizona tea would would be Uniqlo's t-shirts I've tried on a bunch of different t-shirts and yeah so unfortunately I'm not the most happy about this is it the worst thing in the world for ten bucks no is it the best thing for ten bucks no in terms of the makeup of this this one's a hundred percent supima cotton so this one does not have any bamboo in so about one tech Academy three subpoenas because I thought the supima were more reliable with the tech cotton ones they use a different like technology basically for their fabric this ones are supposed to be more moisture wicking and anti-odor so if you ever a big exerciser which I am then this would be great for working out in in terms of the fabric for this one it is also 100% cotton so essentially it's the same material but they're doing something a little different with how they mowed the cotton so here it is it's the same size small and as you can see right off the bat if it's a lot closer to my body it's much tighter all over look at this I got an inch on both sides maybe and that's it maybe an inch and a half if I really stretch it so that's perfect the arms they don't flare out there they're almost a perfect fit they flare out a little bit sometimes I like to have t-shirts will especially polos where there's a elastic band here which binds you to your arms so that it can't flare out this one does not have that which is okay it's mostly for polos where you have that stuff chest is fired a little bit tight in the chest you know belly's fine here of course overall I like this a lot I did hear rumors that this this one might shrink in the wash even more I hope it does not otherwise I would have to order and you know a size up and this would no longer fit but as of right now this one is probably the best option I sure about more Tech and less of the supima cotton that said I really hope these shrink in the wash by half a size or one size because they are a bit too big I'm a little underwhelmed by these and you know Banana Republic it's decent but unless you have really massive arms like if I had massive arms or like a bigger belly I guess Banana Republic all the way I mean I there's like the feel of their fabric is probably the best I've come across but in terms of fit which is more important unfortunately except for this tech cotton one I haven't had the best luck with them I still wear them and they're do good but they're not great I want it like really good this one's all right it's it's starting to feel a little bit tight here and here as I wear it longer but overall there's my review hope you like", "C6O3ltwiE84": "[Music] it was good job welcome back to my channel preset you guys tuning in to another one of my videos so today we're gonna be doing a quick clothing review I know it's been awhile since I actually did one of these types of videos but I figured I'd go ahead and pick these back up get started again I'll show y'all one of my latest cops so right here we have a Givenchy product and this is let me get you the name this is the Givenchy logo cotton t-shirt and I picked this shirt up from Barneys calm I'll go ahead and do a legit check and show you guys the receipt Barney's calm boom and I'm going to show you guys the product description as you can see it says a new trabocchi logo SS Kruti Javon c XL black so yeah y'all know my shirt is legit 100 percent off any really not much to get into plain black tea with javonni logo on the front in Paris at the bottom some of the letter in on on this logo was kind of missing kind of fade in a way and that's how it come why it's kind of faded away to see pretty much all the letters are kind of faded and the eye on Paris is pretty much gone tag on the inside is just a Givenchy tag and then you have jibun chi going all around the inside of the shirt I'm gonna go ahead and show y'all with this shirt it looks like own body so y'all can get a better look at it alright guys as you can see the shirt fits really really well great quality good materials used but I do want to stress about the sizing of this shirt so the shirt runs hella small so I had to go up to an XL and I normally you know what designer brands I just have to go up to a large but with this one I had to size up to an exhale and to be quite honest man I could have went up to a 2x because it still kind of fit a little bit snug like I can't afford for it to shrink on me because it'll be it'll fit just like the large that I initially bought so if you interested in this shirt or any debauchee products I definitely recommend you go up to sizes because if you get your normal size nine times out of ten depending on your body type it really won't fit you hopefully this video was helpful hopefully as far as like the size and then things like that I kind of gave you idea of what size you may need to copy if you're in the market for a bunch of t-shirt but as always man I appreciate you guys watching and I'll see y'all in the next video", "IHrOUlSARu8": "We've perfected every stage of our\nfabric development process to engineer the highest quality combed and ring-spun\ncotton on the market. The result is called Airlume. It starts with clean\ncotton about 25 to 30 percent of the cotton we start with is combed out \nduring our unique refining process. Because it contains impurities or does\nnot meet our standards. It's a common practice for manufacturers to dump some\nof that inferior cotton back in before spinning the yarn. But for us when it's\ncombed out it stays out. We only use long staple cotton in our Airlume process.\nThe staple length refers to the length of the cotton fiber. And this determines\nthe ultimate feel of the final yarn. By using only long staple cotton there are\nless stray fibers which keeps our yarn smoother on the microscopic level. This\nmakes for a tight even knit ideal for screen printing. We continue to innovate\nthrough the dyeing process. Using seven times less water than the industry\naverage and only using the most eco-friendly dyes. There's a right way to\ndo combed in ring-spun and it's through our Airlume process that we're able to\nmake the industry softest cotton.

Be Different.", "o7vSoC2w_A0": "hey guys we're going to switch gears a bit and we're going to talk about actually sublimation transfers i've been wanting to do a video on how to actually apply the sublimation transfers to a shirt and so i figured this is as good a time as any right okay so few things to know about sublimation okay sublimation is uh dye sublimation is basically just that you're dying fabric um with these uh sublimation transfers okay so one thing to be aware is sublimation does not print white so if you like you see this white right here that's going to be whatever color your shirt is okay so the other thing is you can't dye dark objects lighter you can only dye things darker so that's why it's important for sublimation to use a white or a very light colored shirt because if you put black on a black shirt you're not going to see it if you have pink on a black shirt you're not going to see it so you have to use light or or white as best but white or very light colored shirts as far as um a little bit darker colored shirts if you wanted to do like maybe a like a blue jean color or something like that you can do that but it's best to do that with an all black sublimation transfer black's one of the only colors that you can kind of still see on a darker shirt as long as it's not darker than the black so hopefully that answers some questions about that that's one of the biggest questions we get is why can't you do sublimation on dark shirts it's just because you can't see it so even if the the dye is transferring to it you won't see it on a dark shirt but you will see it on a white or a very light colored shirt the other thing to be aware of for sublimation is sublimation dyes only adhere to polyester fibers so what happens is when the dyes get heated up heat it up it actually infuses into the polyester so the more polyester content that you have in your shirt or um whatever you're pressing the brighter and bolder the colors are so if you have like a 50 polyester shirt with 50 cotton it's not gonna stick to the cotton but it will stick to the polyester so it'll be like a faded look so that's another thing to keep in mind the higher the polyester count in your fabric the brighter and bolder the colors will be another thing about sublimation is before you press it the colors are going to look really muted especially like blues and mints turquoise those colors will look completely different after you press it's weird so don't freak out whenever you print out your sublimation if you're doing it at home or even if you order one and it looks completely different it changes once it's heated it gets a lot more bolder brighter vivid and the blues and greens those change a lot so hopefully that answers a few questions okay oh another thing for sublimation you want to use a heat press or you can use the easy press 2 because you need 400 degrees fahrenheit and iron will not work unless you're doing like a little bitty tiny thing because you don't want to move it around at all when you press it you want to keep it like and not move it like it's got to stay still so easy press 2 will work because it does get hot enough or heat press is definitely definitely recommended iron and sublimation just do not mix okay so here are some other tips and tricks okay sublimation will go through your shirt okay so you always want to put something in between your shirt or you want to actually thread your shirt onto your press rather than just putting this on here like this pressing it because you're going to see this mama bear transfer all the way through to the back especially for thin shirts so anytime you're using sublimation you always want to protect your press with protective paper and then you always want to protect the inside of your shirt if you're not threading it through so for this one when i say threading it through i just mean opening the shirt and putting it on your press where only one layer of the shirt is on there that's always the ideal way to press if you can because then you don't have any seams messing you up or anything like that so this would be considered a threaded shirt all right so we're going to go ahead and put our shirt on here i'm going to move it to where the collar is not actually on the press anytime you're pressing it's always good to not have the collars or the seams on the press because anything like that can make it where your shirt isn't getting full pressure okay this is a bella canvas let me see this is a bella canvas shirt and it is i want to say 50 polyester 65 actually 65 polyester you want to have at least 50 but like i said the higher the polyester count the bolder and brighter these colors will be all right so we got our shirt on there we have our protective paper right now i'm just going to use this teflon sheet just to do a quick pre-press to get any moisture out of it all right remove that now here's another thing to be aware of for sublimation you'll notice that it's on this square okay now lighter colored shirts usually won't happen but if you're using like a more colored shirt a lot of times if you just put this down and you press it like that you're going to see that square so a good habit to always be in is anytime you're pressing sublimation just loosely cut around your image it just will soften that edge and just make it look a lot nicer another thing is if you're printing your own sublimations or ordering them sometimes whenever it's going through the printer you'll get little bitty dots of ink on the edge if you don't cut those edges off there's a chance that you won't see it and you'll miss it and you'll have like these weird little black lines okay and this does not have to be perfect this is just loosely cutting around so that you can really see where your image is and that you won't have that box around your sublimation okay um let me get one more thing one second okay okay another thing you always want to do before you're pressing a sublimation is use a lint roller and just get any loose fibers or anything like that off your shirt because sometimes if you have some loose fibers or anything like that you'll see these weird little blue and red marks after you press it because we're pressing for a for a full minute for sublimation so any of those little things getting pressed at 400 degrees for a minute can actually change colors and permanently affect your shirt and your outcome okay so we have our shirt ready we have it pre-pressed we have it lint rolled we have our transfer cut out our shirt is at least 50 polyester is 65 so we're gonna put the transfer face down okay so the ink side will be on the shirt now from here you don't want to put a teflon sheet straight on your transfer because what happens is once the ink um gets heated up and turns into a gas and any extra will kind of dissipate so if you use a teflon sheet that extra ink will just kind of sit on your teflon sheet and you'll need to clean your teflon sheet if not you won't notice it until you go to press something else and that ink will actually transfer onto something else so always use some protective paper you can even use um regular like copy paper is totally fine to just put on top okay so we're just gonna put a couple sheets of copy paper on there we're gonna take our teflon sheet and we're gonna cover it all with that okay and we're going to be pressing for 60 seconds at 400 degrees okay and y'all just be careful once this is done it will be hot so just be prepared for that okay once this is done you just want to remove your transfer immediately not let it move and then sit somewhere else or you get like a ghosting all right remove that and that is it so here is our sublimated shirt mama bear this particular design is available on the website as a digital download and it also is available as a ready to press transfer so that is sublimation is super easy it's not just for fabrics you can use it for any polyester coated item so there's tons like there's tumbler cups there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um sublimation for as far as washing this is permanent you can wash it and dry it like normal no issues and it will last a long time the other question i get a lot of times too is can you reuse the transfers they're not really made to be reused but sometimes like a darker transfer like this if you're okay with a much lighter version you can put it on there and press it again it won't be as bold and vibrant as the first one but you will still get some ink transfer but just be aware you know if you don't like it you can't take it off so definitely sublimation is permanent the amazing thing is sublimation it has no feel to it so all it does is it actually changes the color of the fabric so i hope this was helpful you guys we get so many questions about sublimation on the website you can order custom sublimations if you have an image that you

sublimate onto cotton apparel sublimation is an ink only transfer process that is designed for a hundred percent white polyester apparel only let's see what happens when we attempt to sublimate onto a 100 cotton t-shirt we created sublimation transfers for both polyester and cotton first we'll press the cotton transfer we'll press this for 30 seconds at 370 degrees fahrenheit [Music] now we'll press the polyester transfer also for 30 seconds at 370 degrees fahrenheit the difference in color vibrancy is immediately noticeable and after one wash the cotton transfer fades drastically but the polyester transfer retains its color to learn more about the sublimation process please visit our website at heatpressnation.com if you have any questions feel free to reach out to my expert representative at support.heatpressnation.com once again i'm jared with heat press nation and thanks for watching you", "7g27zU0bXnA": "I want to show you how to make a t-shirt facemask this is a design I came up with after looking at a lot of different patterns it has a drawstring as its main feature and ties in the back with like a little Slipknot so it's adjustable and we'll go over your ears and you can bunt it up or unbutton it to get a really good fit on your face I have two sizes this is based on other guidance I found on other face masks and so the finished size of the adult is about five by eight and a half child four by seven and a half what you need is a t-shirt that you're going to cut up and a sewing machine and thread you need a safety pin to help you put this cord into the casings and a chopstick might be helpful when we're turning the corners inside out and also putting into the key scenes if you're if they're clogged with the seam allowance or something to get them open seeking cord through so step one is you want to cut your fabric and so for the t-shirt I tried you really want to cut it with the long way of this fabric going up the t-shirt I tried it the other direction in it and it works fine enough this is the other direction and it kind of made the top a little bit wonky and didn't quite fit as nicely over the front if you have it stretch this way which is the direction the fabric stretching up and down rather than across the face you get a better fit so I recommend cutting it long ways with a t-shirt direction going that way for this is for the adult you want six and a half I mean six wide by eighteen inches long for a child would be five inches by 16 inches long the way that I cut this was I actually just took a little nip where I wanted them to start and end my six inches so I measured six inches out into the clip you can actually just tear hold this down here tear your fabric you can get a nice hair along the grain of the fabric and so it will be nice and even and not skewed one way or another this is also the same method that you need to do in order to make the drawstring later so you get your fabric the right dimensions and then you want to fold it in half with the right sides together and the wrong sides out for t-shirt fabric you can tell that because the wrong side it curls towards the wrong side so this is step 2 so it's folded in half this is the fold side and what you want to do is you want to sew along the edges here but you want to leave 1/2 edge gaps here here and here that become the openings for the casing so on this folded edge I actually started sewing I back stitched about a half inch away from that fold and then a seam allowance is about a quarter of an inch you can make a little bit more if you want like 3/8 all the way up to here and then this by back stitch right here about a half inch away from the seams where the seam is going to start again and I just moved my machine so this is not sewn it's open there jumped it over back stitched here went down this side backstitch tear jumped again another half inch again this is not sewn here it's just the thread where I jumped and then sewed and then you want to leave a couple inches here at the edge to turn this inside out so leave that opening so in step three turn everything inside out and you're going to want to press it so here's that opening that I used to turn I want to press those seam allowances down make those nice and straight press these up and this is where you can use your chopstick to get the nice corners in like that to turn it nicely and then press step four you want to sew again this is to sit on the edges and to make the drawstring cases so I started up here at the top back stitch and I sewed really close to the edge here about an eighth of an inch all the way over here and then I stopped about a half inch from the seam again this is where that opening is at the top and the bottom so a half inch away from the edge to make my casing then came down here real close so at eighth of an inch of the edge again and then that will help close off that opening that we had down here before this helps that edge stitching helps close that off and then I go up a half an inch away and then back stitch here so now I've got casing here and this is sewn down and that openings closed the last step is to make the cord so I showed you how to cut that cord you want a you know a long piece when you stretch this after you cut it it'll get longer so I think mine at least 40 inches now just play around with size to see if will fit you or someone that there but you want it I would say no more than an inch when you cut it or about an inch but you want it to be strong enough so it won't break but not too thick that you can't fit it through the K seams so you're going to want to insert it at the bottom and go at the top and then come out here and again use a safety pin just pin that through it and then go in and go out and then when you're done just not off the end maybe double knot them so they don't come through these are intended for people with like patients the vulnerable populations patients nursing home homeless I'm not intending these to work for healthcare workers I really hope that they get the actual medical grade surgical masks but if there's other vulnerable populations that you know of please make these and donate to them wash them and sanitary before you give it to anybody or make sure that if you're dropping off at a hospital somewhere or place they plan to wash them cotton is really good about that again these are cotton t-shirts just old t-shirts that I use hopefully if you have those around so again make these donate these if you're healthy don't have symptoms you don't need to wear these but there are lots of people out there who are vulnerable and hopefully our health care workers will get what they need but they might need them too so just make these donate these if you have any other questions please let me know or any other ideas of how to make these but I was trying to make something that people have lots of material and we all have t-shirts I've got tons of them so thank you so much if you've any questions please let me know stay safe stay well stay busy and stay positive thank you so much bye-bye", "wPYQAomgG9k": "hey guys it's Kayla from noted arts I run a small t-shirt company right now it's small I'm sure it'll be bigger soon and I make sure it's like the one I'm wearing which is it says blonde on it a cool message and I like it and like this one which we'll be talking about in a second the reason I'm bringing up shirts is because most people are searching for how to find the vintage field shirt or how to create the vintage field shirt on on shirts they have at their house already for stuff that they can find around their house and if you search online like I did over and over again you come across this recipe that says salt water and even baking soda sometimes mixed with water put the shirt in it make it sit and let it sit for three days and then come back and you wash it and it's great and it's good to go in it's perfectly vintage and comfortable and song that is false completely false okay the only thing it did accomplish from what I saw and I tried it a few times with different variations of the recipe same result it does fade color so if you are trying to fade out a dark color that's a good way to do it but it doesn't make it softer and in fact I think a lot of people are saying it makes it a little bit more stark to your rough on the skin so I did my own little research and I found a simple way to do it and it's really good okay so what you're gonna need is a shirt like the one I have here okay now you have to remember certain types of certain are only gonna get a certain measure of softness and vintage feel okay so if you have a hundred percent heavy-duty cotton shirt it's only gonna get so vintage okay or so soft because it it's simply a thick heavy shirt so it if you start out with a good brand then it's gonna get even better okay so what you're gonna need is a pumice stone or a pumice stone this could be found at a lot of stores in the beauty section for like four to six bucks I think and it's well worth it because I've used it a lot and it hasn't even degraded at all really a cool little tool there for what we're gonna use it for and then you have fabric softener which is also four to six bucks I think and I did Google this and ultra downy is actually you want to stick with ultra or whatever it is but ultra downy is actually one of the most effective brands of fabric softener and then surprisingly enough you're gonna want some tennis balls brand new tennis balls don't get used tennis balls I prefer about six maybe more of you if you're doing a lot of shirts okay so the process is you're gonna take the pumice stone first the first step and you're gonna lay your shirt down on the floor on a table and pin it down somehow on all fours or some other method and literally sand your entire shirt okay and starting from the shoulder all the way down and you're gonna probably want to spin this is including the sleeves okay very important even the collar on the collar send it up a little bit it what it does is it's gonna break the fabric up a little bit so that when you do put it in the solution later it'll be more effective okay and it's very soft on the skin when you're done all right so you're gonna sand it up and like I said two or three minutes after you do each side turn the shirt inside out so that it's soft on the inside too okay and do the whole the whole shirt should probably take you seven to eight minutes to do you thorough beat be firm and just do the whole shirt thoroughly and once you're done you're gonna take it and put it into the solution the measurement of this solution is one cup of water to one cup of fabric softener for one shirt tank I guess I should have done one for each of those anyway so you're gonna put that in your tray or bucket and let it sit for 24 hours that's what I've been doing and it turns out great I'm sure if you leave it in longer it's even better maybe a little less I don't think it even matters that much but definitely several hours okay when you're done rinse the shirt out thoroughly okay because it's gonna smell strongly of your fabric softener which is a strong smelling agent then you're gonna take it to the washing machine and wash it again now wash it probably with no soap but if you need so fun but wash it when you're done watching it this is where the tennis balls come in okay I'm gonna take the tennis balls and put them in the dryer with the shirt the reason for this is it's gonna act kind of like the pumice stone did and it's going to be abrasive on the shirt and add that little bit of breaking down to the fabric so that when you do wear it it's gonna feel amazing okay so dry your shirt remember one thing though this is goes for washing and drying when you do high heat it tends to shrink the shirt a little bit sometimes it doesn't last very long but definitely immediately once you put it on it will shrink the shirt so just make sure you wash and consider that little tidbit of information so that's basically how you create a vintage feel shirt from a shirt that you own in your house now out of materials you can grab its view on a DIY and I hope that's helpful once again if you like the shirt I'm wearing or the shirt I showed you earlier go ahead and check out noted art dot weebly.com and maybe you can get a shirt that I made and I do this to all shirts but either way thank you for watching and pee", "7ygO4ZIBZ54": "foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] paint the white color foreign [Music] [Music] be [Music] [Music] i", "fJH4ulFOIoc": "- Hello and welcome. This is Angie with\nthecountrychiccottage.net. Today, we're gonna talk about\nsublimation on a cotton shirt. So if you can believe it or not, this is a cotton T-shirt and I actually sublimated this design. So what is the trick to\ngetting sublimation on cotton? 'Cause you've probably always heard that sublimation can only be on polyester. That's kind of true. Sublimation can be on\nany polyester surface and it just so happens that\nboth glitter heat transfer vinyl and there's even a polyester\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, your sublimation will actually\nreact with those products. I'm giving two products a try today. The first is a glitter\nheat transfer vinyl, and I'm gonna link to all the\nproducts in the description below, so you can find those easily. So this is from B-Flex, and\nmost glitter HTVs will work. You do wanna make sure like they have some polyester content. And then they also have a\nflocked heat transfer vinyl. If you don't know what a flocked is, it's kind of fuzzy, and it's actually polyester, it's intended to be used\nwith a sublimation printer. So you can actually print directly on this if you have a sublimation printer and add it to your cotton designs. But we you are going to not use a sublimation printer because I know a lot of you don't have one. We're actually gonna\nuse sublimation markers. So I'm gonna use this Artesprix brand, this same technique will work\nwith any sublimation product. If you have a sublimation\nprinter, it'll work with that, it'll work with any sublimation ink like sublimation markers, it'll also work with infusible ink and\ninfusible ink sheets. So the same method on the\nflocked heat transfer vinyl, as well as the glitter\nwill work for both these. So this is the glitter that\nI'm wearing and then this shirt is actually made with the flocked. So I'm gonna show you how\nto make this cool watercolor effect on the design, just as an example, but you can definitely use this\nsame method for any designs. You could draw with the pens\nand your Cricut machine. You could cut something out\nwith like the infusible ink sheets and then add it on top\nof the glitter or flocked HCV. So let's take a look at the\nsupplies you'll need and then make our project. The supplies we're gonna\nuse are as follows, so I'm gonna use some Artesprix\nthermal transfer markers. So these are sublimation markers. Then we're gonna need\nsome protective paper, some heat resistant tape,\nand then you'll need some regular copy paper. Now the copy paper will need to be rated for use in a laser\nprinter or copy machine. Just check the back of the package to make sure it's rated to that. And then you'll need a plastic bag. So literally plastic bag\nout of your kitchen cabinet, I recommend a disposable brush\nbecause you can't really, I don't feel like you can\nget the ink out of it. So I always use a disposable\none and then just a little plastic cup or some water, and then some T-shirts. And we are gonna give this a try with two different products. This one is the glitter HTV. So it's a white glitter HTV. And this one is a flocked HTV. It's a polyester flocked HTV. So this particular flock, you don't have to mirror\nit when you cut it. And we'll talk about that in a minute, but if you have like a\nreally intricate design, you may want in some transfer tape to transfer it to your shirt, the transfer tape will need to\nbe something that's rated for heat transfer vinyl. I may or may not use transfer\ntape depending on how my design looks once I cut it. But if you're using a different flock one that's not meant to be printed on. You will wanna make sure\nit's a polyester flock so that your sublimation\nwill actually go into and have that chemical\nreaction with the product and be permanent. So be sure it's a polyester flock. Let's get started first by\ntaking a look at the sublimation markers and how we're gonna\nuse them in this case. All right, so I have my copy paper, and what I'm gonna do\nis pick three colors, completely up to you\nhow many colors you pick and what colors. So I'm gonna go from\npurple to a dark blue, to a light blue. And what I'm gonna do is\nactually write with these on this plastic bag. So I'm gonna write with\nthe purple up at the top, and then I'm going to\nwrite with the darker blue somewhere over here to the side, and then I'm gonna put\nsome of the lighter blue over here on this side. Now what we're gonna do\nis add some water to this. So this is just a cup with\njust a little bit of water and our disposable brush. And we're just gonna\nstart with this purple and add in a few drops of water. Basically, we're making\nour own water color, but with sublimation ink. So now that I have that good and watery, I'm just gonna take some of that and I'm gonna put it on\nthis laser copy paper. So I'm gonna go all the way across this with my watercolor design, because I know that my\ndesign is long and skinny. If your design is small, you can just do a small area or you could do the whole piece of paper. Next, we're gonna do this blue. And what we're gonna do right here on the, the plastic bag is drag some\nof the blue to the center here and drag some of this purple\nand mix those together and create a completely different color and add that right under the first. Then I'll grab some of the blue, add that, and we will do this\nlightest blue and add that. Again, you can do this\nhowever you would like. There are no rules to this at all. And you can even go back\nand add some more color if you wanted to at this stage. So let's more purple to that, just completely up to you. How you want yours to look. Then we want to set this aside and allow it to dry completely. So it's really, really wet. I'm gonna allow that to dry completely. Now I have a few that\nI've already completed and allowed to dry. And here's my two designs. As you can see, like they're kind of\ndifferent, kind of the same, and we're gonna use\nthese and cut the design on our Cricut out of\nthese pieces of paper. So let's take a look at the design itself, cut our paper that now has all\nsublimation ink right on it. And we're gonna cut our glitter\nas well as our flocked HTV. So here we have our Cricut\nmat and we wanna place, this is the glitter and\nthe glitter goes face down on the mat or shiny side down. And then I've set my dial, I'm using the Cricut Explore Air two. This will cut with any Cricut machine, but I set my dial to custom and I picked glitter iron-on from the material list. And I'm also going to pick more pressure, just to\nmake sure that it cuts all the way through. And then I also mirrored my design. So anytime your material\nis face down on the mat, you want to mirror the design itself. So now we can cut the\nglitter HTV with our Cricut. (machine cutting) So once the cut's done, we can eject it from our Cricut, and then we can remove\nthis one from the mat. Now, we will want to also cut\nthe paper that we added the sublimation ink to. And we wanna cut that mirrored as well. So what I did is I took the paper and I used a pair of\nscissors to cut fairly close to where I had painted my design. And I want to put that at\nthe top of my Cricut mat. And now we can cut the same design we just cut from the glitter, we'll want to cut from\nthis piece of paper, using the Cricut. This time however, I'm gonna set my dial to the paper setting, and then we can cut our design. (machine cutting) Once that's done cutting\nI will eject it as well. Now let's take a look at the\nweeding of these designs. So now for the weeding. So for the glitter, I just cut off the excess\nlike with a pair of scissors so I can use it for another project. And then we just peel back all the excess. So we want everything around the outside as well as in this case, I\nwant this center home piece to come out and I'm just\ngonna carefully remove that. So what I would like to do\nis actually use the home for another quick test or project. And I also want to leave, in this case, the centers of these letters and just remove the word itself. So I'm gonna just gonna\nkind of carefully do that, leaving the centers of\nthose letters in place. So I'm gonna do that for the entire word. And then we'll talk about\nweeding the copy paper with that sublimation ink on it. All right, so there's that\npiece completely weeded. So now let's talk about this copy paper. So we're basically\ngonna do the same thing. In this case, I can probably just lift up the Tennessee itself maybe. If you have problems with curling, what you want to do is flip your mat over, and remove the mat from the material and not the material from the mat. And we'll also wanna get out the centers of these letters. So I'm gonna pull off\nthis large piece first. In this case, it'll be two large pieces. Then we'll grab the\ncenters of those letters. Like I said, I kind of have a plan I wanna try to use the word\nhome for another project. We'll see if that works. So I'm just kind of\nbeing gentle just in case I can get it to work. And what I like to do is kind\nof put those pieces right here, so I don't lose them. So I'm gonna be working\non some other stuff and I can just put them\nright there on my mat. And I know that they're\nnot going anywhere. All right, so I've got the centers I need, the two large pieces I\nneed, and the glitter. So let's talk about the\nflocked version of this design. So first things, first, the flocked itself I needed to cut on the green mat. The blue mat was simply not strong enough. I cut it on like a fairly new green mat, a purple mat would probably\nactually work as well. So you need a little bit of a\nstronger grip for the flocked. And then the second thing\nI'm gonna talk about is the fact that there is\nright now as of this airing, I did not see any flocked\nheat transfer vinyl setting on the Cricut. So I tried the glitter. So I did the glitter iron-on\nsetting, more pressure, and we are gonna see how well that worked. So this one we're gonna leave that, there's like a backing paper. Again, we did not mirror the flocked, and you will see why in a few minutes. And the cuts actually look pretty good. So I'm just gonna kinda\npeel everything back. And the T is separate from\nthe rest of the words. So we're gonna peel it from this side. 'Cause this one says Tennessee, while the other one said home. And again, I'm leaving the\ncenters of those letters and this is fairly\ndetailed, so I may go ahead and show how to use transfer tape. Again, if you have a simple design, you could just peel it from this paper. So there's our Tennessee, worked great with the settings that I used. And then we can just weed\nthe paper in the same manner as we did the paper for the home. Again, this one is mirrored. So you wanna mirror for the flocked, don't mirror the design itself, but mirror the sublimation drawing, and you will see why when we press, but that's gonna be\nimportant to get it right, is to not mirror the flocked. And again, it has to be a polyester flock. So don't mirror that. If you purchase the same\nbrand that I'm using and then mirror the actual\npaper that you added that sublimation ink too. So there's that. So I have everything I need on this mat and I'm gonna leave it there. These pieces are super, super small, so I don't wanna move those. So I'm gonna leave that\nand I'm gonna go ahead and get out my easy press and get set up to press these. All right, the B-Flex glitter presses at 295 for 10 seconds. And I have my largest easy press so I can cover this large\ndesign in one press. Now I'm going to first just\nkind of heat up the surface a little bit, getting your\nwrinkles and moisture out, and then what I'm gonna do, I know that I'm gonna be\nsublimating on this in a minute, so I'm actually on top of\nmy largest easy press mat, but I'm gonna stick a\nsmaller, easy press mat, the medium size one inside the shirt. And then I'm gonna use some\nprotective paper to cover that mat up. I wanna make sure that\nit's completely covered where my design is going to go. Just so I don't get anything on my mat and nothing on the back of the shirt. That's just for sublimation. If you were just using\nthe glitter by itself, you would not have to do that. All right, so now the shirt's cool, we're ready to press. We're gonna locate the\ndesign on the shirt. All right, and the carrier\nsheet's already on this, we just need to press, so we'll go ahead and put that down, press with medium pressure\nfor the 10 seconds. And then when the time's up, just remove our press. And we can actually start kind\nof peeling this right away. Just be careful that it's not so hot it's gonna burn your fingers and everything looks really good. We'll just make sure that E stays, okay. So now that design is on our shirt. Now we wanna make sure that's cool. It's already pretty cool, before we put the sublimation on. So as soon as the sublimation\nhits anything hot, it will start to transfer. We can go ahead and set the easy press. So we wanna set it at 360, and we are gonna set it for 100 seconds. Let's do 120. So it says 90 to 180. So I'm gonna do 120. So this is heating up. Our home is cold. So now we can locate our design. And to do that we're gonna\nuse heat resistant tape. So don't use any type, you wanna make sure it's heat resistant. Then we can start taking those pieces that we weeded earlier, placing them on top of this glitter and taping them into place. Now, remember, these are\nthat laser copy paper that we did the watercolor effect on. So they have that sublimation ink on them, and we've already put our easy press mat covered by butcher paper inside. So we know that everything's protected. We will just put this into place and\nyou can just tape it down really well. You don't want it to move during the pressing process. And we'll also have some centers, so I'm gonna leave that\ncenter open just a minute, and we'll tape in just a second. So now I just have the\ncenters of all those letters. And again, we want to make\nsure to put those face down on their corresponding letter, and then we'll tape every\nsingle one of those down really, really well, making sure\nnothing moves when we press. All right, so to press this design, we will need to cover\nit to protect our press. So I'm gonna use a piece of\nthat protective paper again. So you have the paper, then\nthe sublimation ink design, that glitter HTV that we\npressed underneath that, the shirt, another piece\nof protective paper, and our easy press mat. And then I have the back of the shirt and another easy press mat just under there to protect everything. And now we're gonna press\nat that 360, 120 seconds, and you don't want anything to move. So we're gonna press it down, press the C and hold it with\npressure for the full time, not allowing anything to move. All right, so after the time's complete, again, we don't want anything to move. We're gonna lift it straight up, and then we're gonna allow\nthis to cool completely before we move this. All right, this is completely cool now. And we are going to start peeling back. And see what we got. So you can see that effect\non that glitter HTV, that kind of watercolor effect, where it's going from like a\npink to a blue at the bottom. And there, you have it. So sublimation on glitter HTV. Now let's move on and see what happens when we use that flock. Alright, so for the flocks\nwe need to be at 305 for 10 seconds. So I went ahead and set\nmy easy press to that, and that's going to be\ncooling down while we work. I went ahead and pressed\nover the top of this, just to remove any wrinkles or moisture. All right. The flocked, once again, we did not mirror it and it\nhas lots of little pieces. So we need to get it from this\nbacking paper onto the shirt. There is transfer tape that's\nmade for heat transfer vinyl. This is a piece of that here. You could also use a\npiece from an old project. So this was just from\nthe glitter I just used, that we just did the home, and I can just press that right onto here. So it's rated for use\nwith something like HTV. And so I can just use it as long as it'll kind of lift up from there. And the only thing when working with this, when working with the\ntransfer tape and HTV is the transfer tape is never, or I don't find it's ever\nlike really, really sticky. So you just kinda have to play with it and kind of peel it back. Just kind of play with it, peel it back and just make\nsure that it's staying stuck to your, whatever you use, transfer tape, an old carrier sheet, whatever. And then watch when you get to\nthe centers of those letters, they actually stay down and into place. So I'm just gonna keep\nmoving across this piece, making sure everything\ngets stuck to this tape, and then we'll press it\nand add that sublimation, just like we did on the glitter. So here's our piece completely\non this transfer tape. So I can just flip that over carefully and add it to our shirt. Now the easy press has cooled down to 305 and I have it set for 10 seconds. And we're just going to\nmake sure this is about in the center and that it's straight. And then, once again I've\ngot an easy press mat inside of my shirt covered\nby some protective paper, because I know I will be\nsublimating here in a few minutes it will just save me an\nextra step here to do that. So we're gonna press this 305,\n10 seconds, light pressure. And we'll remove that easy press. And you can actually remove\nthis liner while hot, just to make sure that it's not so hot it's gonna burn you. And we just want to make\nsure everything is stuck. Now we have that flock right on our shirt. And remember, this is\nthat polyester flock. So we can put our\nsublimation ink right on top. We are gonna wait until this\ncools off so that it doesn't start sublimating while we're adjusting. And then we'll do it just like the glitter where we'll put it in\nplace and tape it down. All right, so everything\nis taped down well where it won't move. And we're gonna put our\nprotective sheet on top of it. So protective sheet, the paper with the\nsublimation ink face down, taped down well to the flocked that's already attached to\nour shirt, protective paper, easy press mat, back of the\nshirt, another easy press mat. We're gonna press this down. And it's 360, 120 seconds, firm pressure. Then once your time is up,\nyou wanna lift it straight up so nothing moves. Then we went to allow this\nto cool completely before we remove the paper with the sublimation ink. All right, I've allowed this to cool. And now we can reveal the\nmagic and see if we have that watercolor design on that flocked paper, on that flock HTV. And it looks amazing. Totally awesome. All right, so there is how\nyou add sublimation ink to both flocked and glitter HTV. So it's super simple. And I know the first question\ny'all are gonna ask is how well does it hold up in the laundry? Well, I'm gonna tell you right\nnow that I have already ran these through the laundry\ntwice, both of these shirts. So you can see that\nthere was like no fading. That is absolutely 100% fine. Yes, you can still laundry these shirts and not have any problems. So if you were to use\nsublimation ink directly on the cotton without the glitter HTV or the flocked HTV between it, when you went to throw it\nin the washing machine, it would fade. So it would give you like\na really distressed look. It would be kind of semi-permanent. So a lot of it would come\nout as you laundered it. And I don't know how long\nit would last actually, but I actually ran these through twice just to kind of see what\nwould happen the first and the second time. And both the glitter HTV from B-Flex as well as the flocked can be dried. So actually ran both these\nthrough the dryer as well, no issues at all. So if you're gonna drop down\nbelow and ask that question, there's your answer\nright before you ask it. But if you have any other questions about anything we've covered today, feel free to ask those in\nthe comment section below. Also head to the description below, grab your supplies to give this technique a try for yourself. If you've wanted to try sublimation, you hate polyester shirts. I've heard that over and over again. I hate polyester shirts, or maybe you want to put it on a hat and all you can find are cotton hats. This is a solution. So glitter, heat transfer vinyl, as well as the flocks. Now the flocks you wanna make sure it has a polyester coating. I know that multiple glitters will work, but the flocked I am not sure about. So the only flock I tried was this B-Flex that's made specifically for sublimation. So I would definitely give that one a try. And I do not know about\nany of the rest of those. So if you are looking at another brand, I do not know if those will work. And I have only tried, I've seen other people try other glitters, but I've only tried\nthe glitter from B-Flex just to let you know that as well.

I think you saw those in the video, but they also come in\nother colors as well. If you are interested in\nexpanding beyond the basic colors, but you can do the technique\nthat I use, where I took those and I kinda mixed them\ntogether on that plastic bag and create kind of all\nkinds of your own colors just by buying one pack.

Thanks y'all, bye, bye.", "1hviuk2-2EQ": "today we're talking about the alternative apparel ladies one hundred percent ring-spun cotton t-shirt now we like this t-shirt for a few reasons first off because it does come in a unisex option also so although this is the ladies cut if you're ordering for a large group you can order the same colors across unisex and ladies this does have a great fit the fabric is super soft because it is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton my stead of just telling you we do have Maya here she's going to come over and show it off first thing you'll notice is it does fit great the tailored side seams naturally accentuate the curves we have a side seam here which means it's not going to be tight it just means it's going to be snug it means it'll stretch with you as you move awesome one hundred percent ring-spun is a great fabric thread cone also very tightly knit so it means it's going to stretch really good we love that about this t-shirt the sleeve length is great kind of mid bicep here the collar a little higher its standard crewneck some crew necks on the market in one hundred percent ring-spun they do offer a little lower but this one here a little higher the bella version has a little lower of a neckline if you're looking for one hundred percent ring-spun does mean is super soft and like I said the thread count is very high which means there's a lot of threads per square inch giving a bath wash kind of like more I'd say a little thinner feel because the thread comes so high in such a thin thread too now with this comes in a lot of colors we recommend with any ladies you're just created straight across the chest there's no worry about the logo being too high to low with this neckline standard print positions about two to three inches below the collar we love this shirt though because one hundred percent ring-spun cotton means that the price point is good alternative apparel is a brand you can trust and because the unisex version like I said you can order this for a large which is a great thing now one hundred percent ring-spun you might be thinking I hear cotton I hear cotton you didn't say cotton there but a cotton what about shrinkage what size should i order well with this shirt you don't really have to think about shrinkage as much as maybe right away ordering one size up then you'd normally order anytime you're doing one hundred percent ring-spun we recommend that it's if she would normally wear a small in this we put her in a medium because it just has that little more generous and over the course of a lot of washes the light for the shirt it can naturally shrink although it should be and it's stated that it's preshrunk we love this shirt for a lot of reasons and I guarantee when you put it on you're gonna love it also thanks man thanks I McQuoid monkey soft scale we rate this t-shirt a 2 thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at co-ed

embroidery adventures with the Brother\nPE 800 we are doing t-shirts in this episode I'm using 100% cotton t-shirts I\ngot these from jiffy shirts I will link them below I'm folding my shirt in half\nfirst marking the center line with an air soluble pen and then using my ruler\nto mark the center line I pre treated the t-shirt with terial magic which is a\ntemporary fabric stabilizer now I'm going to cross the chest I lined up the\nunder sides of the sleeves and did a horizontal line and these are going to\nbe my grid lines for hooping for this shirt I use two layers of sheer cutaway\nstabilizer and I did this because it's a white shirt so I didn't want it to\nsee-through I'm hoping this shirt I also put a layer of water-soluble\ntopper over it since it is a knit I'm using my 5 by 7 inch hoop and now I am\ntaking the t-shirt away lifting it up so that nothing gets caught in the\nembroidery machine so this shirt is actually for friend named Melanie and\nthis is her business logo Melanie loves Tampa Bay I'm also helping her and make\na youtube channel so I'm a link her channel below if you are interested at\nall in real estate homeownership and Tampa Bay life videos we've been making\nsome fun things so I had her logo digitized from a shop I found on Etsy\nand I will also share that as well now one thing I did struggle with was the\nheart in the logo it was rather dense which is why I use two layers of\nstabilizer instead of just one that helped prevent it from curling and it\nkept the design nice and flat as I'm stitching out the design I'm\ngoing through and cutting out my loose threads during the process I just found\nit was a little bit easier so that the threads didn't get caught under\nstitching later on and this whole design probably took about 25 minutes yeah I\nknow now I actually had two different\nversions of the logo digitized it cost about ten bucks each I had one that just\ngoes horizontally and then I have a stacked logo as well so we're actually\ngonna do two shirts in this video for whatever reason these designs stitch\nout better when I loosened the upper thread tension I believe this was on 1.6\nor 1.8 and this is again a hundred percent cotton knit but because i\nstabilized it with the terial magic as well made stitching out this design a\nlot easier highly recommend that stuff I know it's probably tempting because this\nis taking so long to like walk away take a bathroom break I would not do that\nbecause the minute you walk away that's the minute something goes wrong so for\nthese shirts I actually literally stood over the machine just to make sure\nnothing was out of place and everything was going smoothly okay now I'm removing more of the\nconnecting threads with my seam ripper and some tiny scissors then I'm going to\ntear away the water-soluble topper flip the shirt inside out and cut away this\nstabilizer and actually the scraps are big enough that I could probably use\nthem using one of these smaller homes and there's t-shirt number one all right\nonto t-shirt number two use the same process fatir ile magic the two layers\nof the sheer cut away and I actually used painters tape to try to keep the\nshirt out of the way the rest of the shirt and that worked out pretty well all right\nsame thing on hooping this shirt cutting away the excess stabilizer here trimming all those connecting threads\nwith my seam ripper and the little scissors and then pulling away the\nwater-soluble topping stabilizer and there's t-shirt number two hope you\nenjoyed that look at what it takes

"what's going on guys in this video i'm going to show you all the different ways you can make t-shirts for your t-shirt business let's begin alright guys so we're going to talk about all the different ways you can make t-shirts we will talk about direct garment screen printing how to make t-shirts with a vinyl cutter how to make t-shirts the professional laser printer we will talk about budget ways to make t-shirts and print on demand we will also break down the complete process and talk about the pros and cons of each before we get into all of that let's talk about how to buy blank t-shirts and the different types of shirts you can buy there's going to be many websites where you guys can buy wholesale t-shirt blings in this example we're going to use jiffy shirts.com just so you guys know you don't need any kind of business license anyone can purchase from these sites these sites will sell t-shirts anywhere from one dollar and fifty cents all the way up to around eight dollars if you guys are going to be selling cheap t-shirts on ebay you can go with something like the gildan g500 t-shirt these start at around 1.50 but if you guys are gonna be selling high-end t-shirts for your fashion brand it's better to go with something like a bella canvas or an american apparel shirt these are more expensive also just so you guys know white t-shirts will always be the cheapest if you're getting black or colored t-shirts they will be more expensive if you guys are starting a high-end streetwear company in my opinion one of the best shirts you can buy is the american apparel 2001 shirt now if you guys buy this t-shirt be very careful they have a cheap version of it which is called the 2001w this is a horrible quality t-shirt don't buy it it's nothing like the regular 2001 that's made in the us t-shirts will also come in different styles regular t-shirts and fashion t-shirts regular t-shirts will usually have longer sleeves and the more loose fit whereas fashion t-shirts have a short sleeve and more of a european fit a shirt like the gildan g500 is going to be made out of regular cotton and is going to have more of a cardboard feel to it whereas a t-shirt like a bella canvas or an american apparel is going to be made out of ring-spun cotton which means the shirt is going to be much more higher quality and it's going to be much softer all right guys let's talk about the different ways to make t-shirts just so you guys know no matter which method you choose you will need a heat press machine and i'll leave a link in description the first way to make t-shirts is dtg printing which stands for direct to garment printing this means the blank t-shirt is inserted into the printer and the printer prints directly onto the shirt this is great for one-off prints or if you're making t-shirts with pictures these printers usually cost over ten thousand dollars and one of the best printers is the epson f2100 this is industry standard the good thing about these printers is that you don't have to purchase them outright you can always finance them for around 300 a month just so you guys know websites that make custom t-shirts like printful and teespring they all use dtg printers these printers print extremely high quality and the image will not wash away or fade you can also make black t-shirts without a problem the printers also print in white color so you can make black t-shirts if you're printing a black t-shirt you will print the white ink first and then the printer will print the colors on top each shirt will cost around two dollars to print if you use factory epson inks before you print on the shirt you will also have to spray it with a pre-treating liquid this will make the colors very bright and will also protect the shirt you will then heat press the shirt and the shirt is ready if you guys do buy a dtg printer i really suggest you get a real professional heat press which costs around a thousand dollars so let's talk about the pros and cons of dtg printing the pros are prince professional quality t-shirts very high detail it's very easy to set up and print it's very fast to print you can make black t-shirts with white ink the cost to print is very cheap and you can make one-off t-shirts the cons or if you have bad credit is going to be expensive next let's talk about screen printing screen printing is the oldest way to make t-shirts it's also the most popular way screen printing is the cheapest way to make shirts if you're mass producing one shirt let's talk about how screen printing works screen printing is not for when you're making just one shirt like dtg it's for mass producing one t-shirt first you will need to buy the screen printing machine if you guys don't plan to open up a print shop you don't have to buy a huge one you can buy a small one you can get the machine for a couple hundred dollars you will also need to buy a large format inkjet printer you will need to buy transparent film screens frames a uv light machine and inks the way screen printing works is that you will have to make a screen and frame for each color that's on the t-shirt so if your shirt has four colors you will have to make four screens and frames the first thing you will do is divide the image by color in photoshop and then you will make a screen for each color layer you will buy transparent film and then print each layer separately on your inkjet printer using black color you will also print registration marks on each sheet so that you can align perfectly you will then buy emulsion you will take your screen put a motion on the screen put the film on the uv machine and put the screen on top of it you will expose the screen to uv light for a few minutes the printed parts that did not hit the uv light will then become very fragile and you can easily wash them away with the water hose you will then put the screens onto the screen printing machine and you will use a squeegee and apply ink to every shirt if you guys have a large screen printing machine you can make a lot of t-shirts very fast inks for screen printing are extremely cheap so it's very cheap to make t-shirts the cool thing about screen printing t-shirts is that you guys can also do all kinds of metal colors metal colors such as gold and you can also make fall t-shirts so instead of ink you can use glue and then apply foil and make metallic shirts you guys can also add rhinestones if you want to make rhinestone t-shirts let's talk about the pros and cons of screen printing the pros are you can start a professional t-shirt business with around 1 000 the quality of the t-shirts is going to be great and they will withstand a lot of watches the cost to make a t-shirt is extremely cheap and you can also make all kinds of cool t-shirts like foil the cons are if you plan to make just one t-shirt it won't make sense because the startup time and cost is just not worth it which leads to the next con and that is that it takes a long time to set everything up also screen printing can take up a lot of space and can be a messy process also unlike dtg printing which requires a digital file you have to store your screen somewhere and that takes up space now let's talk about one more thing that can be done with screen printing which is kind of cool and that's plastisol transfer sheets what a plastisol transfer is is basically a screen print that's printed on either a clear film or a white piece of paper and then sent to you and you could heat press it onto your shirt so you don't have to actually do any of the work the only thing that you need is a heat press machine and you're good to go there are a lot of companies that provide this type of service and you guys can get plastic solid transfers for very cheap one color starts around 15 cents the only thing is you guys have to pay a 25 feet to make the screens so if you guys don't want to buy all the equipment this can be a great alternative now the next way to make t-shirts is by using professional laser printers so no guys this cannot be a regular laser printer that you have at home this has to be a special led printer an example is a okie printer which prints white and color these printers can cost up to ten thousand dollars depending on how large they can print and whether or not they print white basically the way it works is that you print the design on the transfer sheet and then heat press it onto the t-shirt you will print the design on one shirt and then heat press it onto a glue side of another sheet and then peel it and press it onto the shirt you guys can also make metallic fall shirts this way simply print on one sheet put the foil over it press and peel the foil the best transfer sheets in my opinion are forever transfer sheets they're the highest quality let's talk about the pros and cons of laser printers all right guys so the pros of laser printing is that it's fast and easy it's not messy and you can also make all kinds of unique designs such as gold metallic foils the cons are obviously it's expensive also the good quality transfer papers are not cheap and to be honest with you guys i prefer the results of dtg printing much more than laser alright let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's with the vinyl cutter alright just so you guys understand with the vinyl cutter you cannot make picture t-shirts the way vinyl cutting works is you insert the sheet into the vinyl cutter and the vinyl cutter will cut out your design you guys can buy different color vinyls and you can also buy unique vinyl such as glitter and metallic you can also buy special vinyl such as 3d vinyl where after you heat press it the vinyl becomes puffy you can also layer different colors together and have a multi-color design you guys can also buy cheap vinyl cutters such as the cricut machine the machine will come with a 3d designing software you will simply make your stencil you will then insert your vinyl and the machine will start cutting it out after that you will need to weed out the parts of the image that you will not be using you will simply take a weeding tool and remove the unnecessary parts you will then heat press the image onto the t-shirt and your shred is ready let's talk about the pros and cons of vinyl cutters the pros are vinyl cutters are cheap and you can make great quality t-shirts easily you can also make unique t-shirts like glow-in-the-dark foil and glitter shirts the cons are you cannot print photos and unless you guys are importing from alibaba in large quantities the photos can be expensive all right guys very quick let's talk about how to get tags for your t-shirts there are going to be many websites such as custom labels for you where you can order woven tags and paper tags free t-shirts these are very cheap if you order in large quantities they can run as little as 10 cents per tag you guys can choose if you want sonar tags or if you want iron on tags when you order your t-shirts off of jiffy shirts you would simply cut the tag off if it has a tag or if it has a tearaway label you just tear away the label and apply the tag we talked about plastisol labels earlier you guys can also order plastisol labels on websites like etsy you guys can get these for as little as 15 cents per label alright guys very quickly i want to talk about a couple of budget ways to make t-shirts first ways you guys can get an inkjet printer and use transfer sheets it's recommended that you guys get a printer that prints a3 which is larger images you guys can get a printer such as the epson wf7710 this is a great option also this printer can be converted to a sublimation printer if you want to go that route you can get a sublimation spray spray it on a blank cotton t-shirt print the sublimation print press and you have a sublimated t-shirt keep in mind this can only be done with white shirts these printers recently went up in price so if you guys don't plan to do sublimation you can get any regular printer that prints a3 for cheap when you guys print on the transfer sheets you will use the original ink now this information ink these are great ways to start a side hustle but if you guys want a real t-shirt business i suggest you save up money and go with either dtg or screen printing let's talk about the next way to make t-shirts and that's print on demand this is one of the best and easiest ways to start a t-shirt business and requires no startup costs but the catches you guys need to be somewhat social media savvy and know how to drive traffic to your store with print on demand you don't have to buy any equipment or blank t-shirts this is all done through a third-party company whenever you get an order they make the t-shirt and send it to the customer make sure the designs you guys upload are in a png file which means it's a transparent let's talk about the pros and cons of print on demand the pros are you guys don't have to buy any equipment or t-shirts and there's no startup cost the cons are if you guys are making these t-shirts yourself it will cost you a lot less also you need to learn how to drive traffic through social media for this to work alright guys let's talk about how to make designs for your t-shirts if you guys know how to design t-shirts yourself that's great but if you guys don't don't worry you can go on websites such as fiverr.com and have your designs made there you can pay anywhere from five to twenty dollars to have a design made when you guys are finished make sure you always get a master adobe illustrator file or a photoshop psd file this way if the files need to be edited you can always do that alright guys i hope this video helped you out if it did please hit the like button and subscribe

[Music] [Applause] [Music] that's [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign um", "a-JPA3d-DtY": "what's up YouTube back again with another new video now for the past 2 or 3 weeks on my Instagram live I've been teasing this video idea and since then a lot of you have DM me like yo is that video coming out when's that video coming out and here it finally is Street where brands that use the illusion now this is not gonna be the roast session that I know a lot of you want but don't worry I do have a video that will be a little more critical coming out within the next month or two so be sure to stay tuned for that and basically where we should start this video is saying what Gildan is now Gilda is a clothing manufacturer based out of Canada that produces blanks so you got your blank tees blank hoodies crewneck sweatshirt etc etc kind of similar to like a Hanes Fruit of the Loom American Apparel but I wouldn't necessarily say that Gildan is completely bottom-of-the-barrel low tier in terms of quality but I also wouldn't put them at the top upper scale either but the big kind of thing with it is that they're really cheap in terms of pricing I think it's a dollar 20 to a dollar 45 per blank t-shirt and there are a lot of street wear brands that are really popular right now that have been using Gildan blanks and there is nothing wrong with that but when you look at their profit margins and like the way they price things you would swear that they're selling you something of an amazing quality when instead you're kind of just getting a lackluster basic product and obviously there are some people who are aware of this and don't care because - like cool hype I just want it - I don't care but there are other people who I noticed were not aware of this and they're like - yo what the hell is this I paid $200 for this and it feels like [ __ ] and that is not a knock - Gildan and it's not a direct knock necessarily at the brand either because I do know some brands are gonna be like well well we think our name is worth this motion therefore we shall charge this much but where the problem lies is some of these brands claim to be all about the youth and the culture of street wear but how are you all about the youth and the culture of street wear when you're kind of like putting out a free [ __ ] product in my opinion like you're using a $1 t-shirt right with the most generic basic logo screen-printed on and you're gonna charge another 149 dollars or more for that tee I just don't see the logic in that and I think that's where the main fault is is a lot of these individuals just they spew out all this [ __ ] like they're all about the kids and they're all about you know street wear in general but in reality it just seems like they're all about making a quick buck and never sending out your products so we're gonna start off with the first brand that comes to mind and it is anti-social social club often refer to as anti guild and Gildan Club or anti shipping shipping Club because a lot of people never get their [ __ ] now I totally understand when you start from humble beginnings you got to use something cheap because maybe you don't have the capital to start off printing your your design on a higher quality shirt but anti-social social club is pretty big now and to my knowledge a lot of people who are still buying this stuff tell me that it still feels like the Gildan stuff that they were selling a year or two ago and I mean I don't know maybe it's just the hype maybe people really like me but I personally can't justify that and I would like to tell people like I'm not trying to knock on anybody's hustle but if you're not sending your shirts out like you're already selling a pretty low-tier product with a pretty generic logo but if you're not even sending your product out as you can see all over the internet people are saying that antisocial social club doesn't even send their [ __ ] like the shipping is horrible the customer service is horrible so I guess the customer service is essentially antisocial maybe maybe that's like the whole stick with it but I just don't get it and I just think that's really bad on them because people I've seen people comment on their Instagram pages like yo how are you driving a McLaren but you can't ship out t-shirts to people so I don't know but if any of you thought that antisocial social club was something of like a high quality I would say it's not I've felt some of the stuff in hands and although I do say that their t-shirts are kind of not horribly priced I think they're 30 to 40 dollars and when you compare that to some of the other [ __ ] on this list that sounds like a downright bargain but when you consider that you're probably not going to get your shirt in the mail maybe it's not a bargain but anyway moving onto the next brand we have the pablo merch and what what else can I say the Pablo March essentially to emerge so I guess you can cut it a bit more slack because it's not like some dedicated brand for the most part and they sell their shirts for I believe forty to fifty dollars as well and it depends also with the hoodies and the long sleeve which are also gilding as far as I know and I don't know like I get it like in the past Kanye's used on hands beefy T's for watching the throne those were only like 40 dollars and there was more design element to them and I just don't want anyone to be fooled like oh I'm paying $300 resale for this stuff so it must be good no you're paying for high you're literally paying for high it's a one dollar t-shirt bro like don't get it twisted all that [ __ ] on [ __ ] on Aliexpress or eBay that people are like just printing their own [ __ ] it's about as close to real as the other [ __ ] because like I said it's just gilding tea with some pretty basic screen print it's really easy to replicate and although I'm not condoning making a replica if they're both killed in its kind of the same [ __ ] right anyway moving on to the next one which is V alone now a lot of people have been really mad with this because I guess they weren't originally aware and there are the alone shirts that can cost up to one hundred and fifty dollars and I've had a source tell me that the camo shirts are Rothko and the black teas are Gildan and then someone took a picture and put it on Instagram of one of the V lone pop-ups where there's a bunch of Gildan boxes like right behind the cashier or something we're just pretty [ __ ] hilarious now I know they can't prove that the V lone T's were on Gildan for the most part but based on what I've seen calcium in person I'm pretty sure those are Gildan blanks ID I know for sure the camo [ __ ] that they sell is Rothko which also is not really that expensive of a brand but hey I mean I guess profit margins are more important than the culture and next moving on to one that actually caught me by surprise now I do have to note though this is fear of God but fear of God does not use guilt in for all their stuff they do have the majority of this stuff is cut and so but there's a few capsule collections like I think it was like a LA or like a Celtics or some type of [ __ ] shirt as well as these other ones that have like Bible verses or something and apparently those shirts were several hundred dollars but they were gilded tees so I don't really understand like Jerry Lorenzo kind of portrays themselves as being more high-end but I'm sorry no high-end designer would ever use a one dollar one it's not even a five dollar blank like come on like it would be cutting so and I just think that's kind of [ __ ] because a lot of people think I'm paying this much this must be a great high quality item or maybe some people know oh I'm just paying for the name but when you have a lot of these designers or like these friends of rappers etc claiming to kind of be on that like Gucci level or just like on a higher level of design but they're selling you stuff like this because when they really did care about you or like their fans in general wouldn't they want to put out the absolute best product they possibly could especially when you consider everybody I just named like all these brands or all these artists or designers or like rappers whatever they all are rich now so even if from humble beginnings they had to use lower-tier blanks to kind of get their brand rolling they're all rich now they could up the quality easily but no like they don't want to [ __ ] up their profit margins so I don't know I just it puts a bad taste in my mouth knowing that there's a lot of these people that make all these claims that they're totally a hundred percent about the culture yet they do stuff like this so it kind of shows just because something is expensive does not mean that it is of a high quality and like I said before this is not a knock on their hustle but it is a knock on some of their ethics and some of the [ __ ] they spew on social media like don't believe just because they tell you their about this or their about that that's actually the truth like actually look behind the scenes sometimes and realize that these people don't give a [ __ ] about you for the most part and no this is not a knock on Jerry I'm not trying to go out anybody right now I don't want anybody to get this twisted but come on man like in general all of you have the ability to make something better but Niek in particular send your [ __ ] out bro like you're whipping MacLaren's and Ferraris like okay it's turning into a [ __ ] round now but yeah do like send your [ __ ] out to people get better customer service instead of buying all these [ __ ] cars and [ __ ] or at least just admit that your [ __ ] is [ __ ] like your customer service is complete [ __ ] but yeah anyway I don't [ __ ] with these brands anyway so I guess it doesn't really matter but I just want to let a lot of the younger kids know that a lot of shifts low-key not with the [ __ ] so yeah thank you so much for watching sorry it broke out into a bit of a rant but the real rents are coming pretty soon so make sure to stay tuned for those and yeah thank you so much for watching make sure to follow me on Instagram to keep up with the livestreams and peace out YouTube [Music]"}
