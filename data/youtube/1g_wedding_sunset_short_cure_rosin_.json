{"ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "d0rcYuLzY0Y": "yo what up youtube uh today we're gonna do a quick review i got a couple minutes before i go look at some houses what we're gonna do is uh check out the rosin extracts um they got some [ __ ] heat okay and i'm super stoked about it let's get into it let's see what's going on so now what i like about this is i got i got mainly one strain on my order i got the garlic cookies right and now the garlic cookies there's two jars here right garlic cookies same strain but what's awesome about this company is their delivery service provided it in two textures so you can get it in the fresh press which is going to be you know directly from the press not cured not turned into butter not agitated nothing just this is from the [ __ ] parchment into the jar fresh as can [ __ ] be and let me just that looks perfect i i there's not there's not one flaw that i can see there i mean that's just absolutely phenomenal beautiful i want it in my lungs all right now the normal rate for the price on this is about ninety dollars pre-tax i purchased these on the black friday special so i got fifty percent off so this gram cost me with tax included fifty six dollars delivered with tax which is an amazing deal for this quality concentrate an amazing amazing deal so now that's the fresh press right now what i said is it comes in two different textures now this this is the cold cure this right here same exact string but man oh man the cold [ __ ] cure just looks ridiculous doesn't it like actually ridiculous that soft butter the nose on the the cold cure is unbelievable like it reeks see the only cold cure definitely got the nose yeah it's not even close so the fresh press definitely lacks that nose it definitely lacks that nose but man it's i think i think the fresh press looks better i prefer the look of the fresh but i feel i feel like the texture and the smell on the cold cure yeah it's like a no brainer what we're gonna do right now taste test let's get to it let's get to the taste test real quick i'm gonna get you a nice melty shot too boom but first we need a pearl if you ain't using pearls you're [ __ ] up all right get yourself a turp pearl gemtana.com shameless plug shameless plug get yourself one they're lit they're lit as [ __ ] all right so let's heat this up real quick we're gonna throw the yoshi egg in there come on and if you're watching right now make sure you hit that subscribe like vid like the video all the good stuff we post a lot of content we're doing our best to get more youtube direct content to you guys um took the day off of live streaming today um to create some more youtube dominated content the domination of youtube is upon us and we shall rise it feels weird filming stuff on youtube just so you guys know because it's just me in this room staring at a camera with like nobody else talking to me i feel like i'm streaming a year ago and just all by myself again i dead ass feel like i'm streaming a year ago right now this is hilarious all right so now we're going to torch this up we're going to get it nice and hot i do have uh to clean up the neck of the nail a little bit i left some residual oil we have a video coming out of how to take care of your terp pearls uh we also have a how to dab video coming out soon so be uh be sure to check those out as soon as they drop janna just filmed and is editing a uh video about how to take care of your tert pearls so if you're not sure what pros are and you you kind of you kind of want to dabble into the upgrading of the dab game be sure to watch that video coming out soon all right we're gonna get this nice and toasty i should be heating it from the bottom but i wanted to clean that neck off because it was a little bit oily it's key to make sure you heat from the bottom because that allows everything to heat evenly you know you heat from the side right a lot of people heat from the side what's happening to the other side of that nail it's not getting the same heat so you want to go from the bottom evenly distribute that [ __ ] heat get the nails nice and toasty and we're rocking we're rocking now we're going to make sure we're in the view of the cam and get our temperature gauge right just our temperature gauge tells us the temperature of the nail super important if not you're going to be taking hot dabs no one wants to do that this ain't 2009 anymore shout out mac miller all right so we got that going now what we're going to do is we're going to get a dab of the cold cure first shout out to stoned wolf for my awesome dab stand over here that i use every single day it holds all my tools and accessories okay so i got a nice chunky size that's actually my first step of the day don't tell anybody okay we're cooling down i'm going to take this dab because i have the yoshi egg in there probably like 5 20 525 degrees something like that optimum temperature optimum temperature now we're going to get this melt shot damn this shit's gonna look nice i can't wait i'm excited i'm excited the melt shots are some of my favorite there's some of my favorite guys i'm pumped pumped let's go all right we're still cooling down takes a while for these nails to cool down you know it's it's not like they instantly cool down so have some patience if you don't have a uh like a temp check or a pocket temp or a terp monitor whatever the hell the device is timing is always an essential thing um you know start with 60 second cooldown and then adjust from there if it was too hot go 65 seconds too cold 55 seconds you can always adjust all right we're getting down to our temp range oh look at that shot that's sexual i'm just gonna say it that's [ __ ] lit shoo let's go let's move this out the way so we just get we get clean clean melty i want just a clean melty right there oh baby all right we're cooling down 5 45. here we go it's almost go time it's almost go time cap engaged we're ready all right cheers guys i went in at 5 17. look at those trichomes just melt here we go oh i'm telling you the garlic i'm about to start drooling holy [ __ ] god that tastes good oh my god that tastes good that's a 10 out of 10 on flavor important part though clean your damn nail you leave it dirty you're [ __ ] you leave it dirty you are [ __ ] q-tip gang q-tip gang get in there get to work i used probably about three to four q-tips each each dab but that that ensures the longevity of my quartz nail get most of what you can then you're going to go ahead and take an iso dipped q-tip right now this has iso on it and this will help you get any bit of the residual oil clean that mother inhale guys stop leaving your nails dirty leaving your nail dirty is like walking around with body odor you got bo clean that [ __ ] up i want you to smell good once you look good all right now we're going to switch pearls and we're going to get into the fresh press see if there's any flavor difference because honestly i don't know if it can get any better than the the cold cured garlic like i just i don't know that tastes perfect like that actually tastes perfect all right let's get a dab on this the fresh press is definitely not easy to handle like it's it's definitely it can it can shatter a little bit especially if you have it in your fridge or your freezer wherever you're keeping your terps nice and cold um but damn it's pretty damn it's pretty dude like that's just pretty looking sorry for my extremely shaky hands i could never be a surgeon just beautiful half just outright beautiful hash all right again see this is the fun part boom pick another pearl let's see what we're going to do what are we going to get let's go let's go pokeball let's go pokeball dry off the excess iso it's very key boom i'm gonna do one more end of a q-tip just to ensure there's not any excess oil on there because sometimes hey you know like right here it's definitely turning a bit yellow so there was something left over there was a little bit there you can see that little bit will will chas or nail i mean it's it might not seem like a lot but it could charge your nail okay grab your torch here we go heat from the bottom we're gonna heat from the bottom guys very key we'll see if i just put this on here raw or i'm gonna edit it i don't know i think i'm just gonna put it up there raw raw edit we'll watch it if it's raw you guys will see this part if it's edited you won't see this part [Laughter] drop a comment if you saw this part [Laughter] you know i have fun making [ __ ] videos dude i really do i enjoy i enjoy this [ __ ] this is fun oh man first half of the day get you get your mind going dude make sure you're uh following us on twitch too we stream every single day haven't missed a day i've missed six days in the last year six days only in the last year so we stream we stream basically every day so the link will also be in the description if you're watching this solely on youtube come hang out there's some cool people in the chat too some really cool people actually all right pokeball is engaged we are in focus temp check on boom put it under your nail make sure it's under it correctly i like to put the temp gauge under the pokeball or the terp or whatever you're using just because i feel like that's where the most heat is going to be so you get your most accurate reading um i got that ready i have my dab ready charged up baby charged up let's do the damn thing let's do the damn thing oh this one i didn't heat up as hot so it's cooling down a little bit quicker no it's not it's it was it was lying to me it was lying to me your boy might be learning some magic tricks too i've been practicing today i'm not going to show you right now but maybe i'll show you later we might be learning some magic stuff too that's the dog i don't know if you can hear my dog barking probably not with this mic but she says hi all right so we're cooling down right now we're at 640 degrees we're looking for that smooth 525 520 this is a little smaller pearl so i can go 520 i can go a little lower honestly height with this this pearl's about to go hypersonic though i hope you're ready i hope you're ready to just go hyper [ __ ] sonic with this pearl [Music] hypersonic cheers guys shout out to everybody still watching these youtube videos oh 5 15. it's so clear flavor was still amazing 10 out of 10 on that one yeah that's just really good hash rosin i think people should try this go give these guys a try two thumbs up i like later", "IzJ7q1VNPaQ": "[Music] p2pt [Music] [Applause] then [Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up y'all p2 peeps and today we're going to be checking out something completely new to me this is cold cured rosin man and we're gonna be trying out a new brand this is have hash sticky papayas cured roth that's all right here guys so be sure to check that out i don't think you know for those who couldn't read it 71 thc five percent of terps and one and uh what's it called point two five percent cbd the main terps in here limonene caryophyllene and linen this is uh lionel sorry but yeah so i haven't had the strain sticky papaya and i also haven't had cold cured rosin before so if you guys know uh you know what kind of effects cold cure rosin is supposed to impart onto the product you know let me know down below and um yeah so after i do we're just going to get this hit ready to go here is the hash itself you know what i'm saying it looks really good i really really like it it's got a really nice consistency to it very easy to pull off and snap off but you know it's also i mean oh i wish i wish the lighting was a lot better because it is a beautiful beautiful color so i just heard the hyperion just finished up its heating so we're going to go ahead and get a fat dab out of this one right here like that you know what i'm saying so i hope you guys can join me for this big one and uh you know cheers everybody i can kind of smell it actually as the hits being cooked up it smells pretty keep like a like a really keefy flower man like i don't know explain it [Music] [Applause] cheers surprisingly i can kind of say that that does kind of taste like a papaya man like a kind of sweet papaya you know papaya kind of has like a small tartness a really high tartness and kind of tang there but uh yeah i'm getting i'm getting both of those too as well so it's really really smooth so far and i'm not sure if that's because of the cold cure of the rosin or if this just you know the rosin itself we oh my goodness yeah that's a that tastes really good and it's pretty strong it's already hitting me pretty tough now so i'm gonna make sure you know just double tap this make sure it's all cleared out before um you know talk a little bit more about it but yeah so far i'm picking up sweetness little tartness um i mean honestly that the depth of flavor here is very exquisite and most rosins that you know have really really good depth of flavor um and you know this one is definitely another one of those i don't think i've had uh any of the i mean the only bronzers i've had that lack this kind of depth of flavor was the honey butter and the low farms aged cured ones but those are on the a lot of their they're much cheaper than this half hash one you know this have hash the punch extracts and the other rosins that i'm sacking this up to you know the stizzy uh they're about 80 to 90 grams so you know the i'm not expecting honey butter or global farms is uh rosins to have the same depth for only 40 or 60. damn there's still a little bit in there the sick cup is just kind of burning it too efficiently so it's just been too much wait time so while we wait for another hit to cook up let's just talk about anything the other notes i'm getting here so we talked about how the flavor is you know that flavor is really nice the sweetness tartness a little tang they're almost kind of like a papaya um in the potency here the high is setting in very smoothly it is not like it's not like that you know it's not hitting me like straight off the bat it's not setting in like a freaking truck you know it's not punching me uh the way some other strains do and i kind of like that so the reason being why i like that is it just feels like a smoother setting high you know i mean sometimes i don't really care whether something is straight up smacking me immediately sometimes i like it when that [ __ ] creeps up man and i feel like you know most people can appreciate that as well you know it's not like it's a it's a surprise i know it's i know the the hit is coming i know it's gonna hit me i just you know what i mean i just like letting that set in so this one is a one that sets in pretty slow even with that big old hit so who knows maybe we should go ahead and take another i think we should in just a sec here but yeah i don't know whether this is worth uh the price i got it for so this was about i think 85.90 out the door and once again i'll show you guys how that is looking it's really nice the color consistency all that stuff it's it's really really nice but again you know since the high isn't setting it immediately like some of the other things i have here on this channel do it is definitely a little bit uh you know harder to ascertain whether it's completely worth that 90 price range yeah my nail was [ __ ] dirty as [ __ ] there dude oh god that's gross and just that one nail too man i'm [ __ ] sorry but um anyway um what i was saying was you know don't know whether this is completely worth that 90 just yet but it is setting in still and i'm i'm getting more lit by the second and honestly i think so yeah you know so far since it does hold up you know in terms of flavor to a lot of the other things i have tried for the price range i'd say maybe it is worth it at this point in time but let's take another rip and see what's going on i did have two rips of this prior to filming this a day or two ago um but you know i i didn't get i don't think i got like a great opinion formed off of my sesh there because i had uh mixed it with something else we're gonna get another dab here going and see what else we could figure out here you know what i'm saying thank you guys for joining me for this session if you have enjoyed the video so far please don't forget to like comment subscribe all that [ __ ] man i should really really helps out the channel and uh you know it's growth and i'm very appreciative for everyone who contributes uh you know to helping this channel become what you know i'd like it to be so now that tiki papa is hidden i say that while i think this could be worth 80. this is definitely uh it's going it's starting to outrank that stizzy rosin's high especially since it's not even all the way set in yet and i am starting to get fried it is starting from around here and like floating up it's like the eyes like floating up and i can kind of feel it coming off to my arms and stuff too maybe it's hitting all the sore spots um but it it's it's phenomenal so far i'm liking it now now that it's been able to set it and our hit is about ready to go too so uh i think we're just gonna get even more toasted maybe we'll have an update video or something you know like 10 20 minutes something into the high whatever it may be but uh we'll see what goes on man cheers everybody hope you can join me for this next rip [Applause] [Music] [Music] we gotta clear the rest that's in this chamber there's still for sure a lot more for the most part it's really smooth aside from me taking super huge dabs i don't think i would be coughing if i dab with this it's really really smooth like really smooth i'm getting more of that papaya taste now too yeah it tastes like a really pretty a pretty mildly sweet papaya nothing too sweet i know papayas aren't really the sweetest fruit though not everyone has had the pleasure or experience of having a sweet tasting papaya but let me tell you that [ __ ] is something else it is really good closing thoughts on this man all right yeah i think this is worth its price it was a very delicious delicious tasting rosin you know this entire time even when i've been torching it you know the second hits have tasted phenomenal too um i will say though the first hits tasted a lot more like cool in a sense like it tastes like cooling or cold you know i mean i guess you could cold cure but it just tasted like uh like you know like something was cold and it felt really really nice on the um you know on the throat area you know i'm saying on the inhale felt very very smooth almost like this almost like similar to that sensation that slight sensation you get when you hit a menthol i don't like menthols as uh anymore but uh you know obviously they were enjoyable at some point for me so you know those i kind of get a little nostalgia feel of the you know the coldness you know sensation and stuff from this uh on the inhale um opponent-wise this is really [ __ ] nice i now that the eye is setting in and we just took another down saying you know we're only gonna get higher so um i'm very satisfied so far with this uh i do think the uh consistency as well is something that is very very potable about you know i i for for me i like it when i can work with my rosin very easily like this you know i was able to just pick it up no problems drop it in no problems you know i don't really care much for the the goopies the goopy kind of rosin and stuff like that i prefer you know my live roster to be more of this consistency so that's great there and um yeah i mean i i packaging looks pretty cool uh it's it's definitely not one of my favorite those uh in terms of design i think that there's a few other brands who have better designs out there for you know their packaging but that's not the important part the important part is this stuff and this stuff i think is pretty worth so that's about it for this one guys i hope you enjoyed the video and if you did please leave a like comment subscribe all that [ __ ] um and yeah i hope you guys are having a good one and i hope to see you on the next one for the next rosin we'll be checking out will be this punch extracts another tier one live hash rosin this time it is white tahoe cookies actually in fact i don't think i showed you guys the video for our other tier one live hash roster that we have which is also a punch extract the watermelon gelato so i'll probably try to get that video out to you guys pretty soon so thanks for watching everyone and i'll see you later", "w6_hcimqjtU": "what's going on world hope everyone's having a good corn team because I know it's getting a little frustrating staying indoors I've taken to the streets in the middle of the night just to drive around the block to get some semblance of normalcy if the fifth if you will for xx Monday I have a reasonable stock so I'm okay I'm happy about that I wish I had a few more things but you know what that's the American Way you always want more than you have today we're going to be smokin on some papaya cake cold cure it's my morning dad it's probably like I look my little puffs go speaking in there look at her and she pretty she just shown will leave her you guys here just kind of out of her anyway so yeah I'm gonna do a big blob here eyes it's this morning there's been a rough morning already I kind of frustrated I feel bad frustrated with my son beat bad made one happened with this toy so I've been spending I haven't dabbed yet I've been spending the morning changing the sheets cleaning the mattress putting a fan on the mattress to clean off the cleaner and cleaning up toys so now I'm sitting down heating up my dirty dirty break my Chaz Evan Shore and we're gonna go in on smash overheat but who cares get the tur Pomodoro will make everything okay zooming it's charged you know what never ran this thing out of charge I've got it to where it one one or two bars or it down but I've never ran it out of charge we'll have to see how that goes still have this oh this holds at the distillate I keep taking grams out of it oh there was a there was an ounce and a half in here so that's probably why it's just now - it was down to an ounce oh I better get my dad going we are at somewhere in the fives and I like to be about four thirty five hundred so let's take a look at this rhenium rosin oh forgot which side the camera was on and the lighting for one year so you can't really see but it mm oh so fire and with that there with that kind of glob we're gonna need to read I'm whoa oh I could've been ugly I hate when you lose hash or if you go to put it in and drops out somewhere just so let's go ahead and attempt read this game I'm sure it's way too cold ah yeah pretty much one more bladder one more blackened or all right get that in there see you're all right we are added 9 540 which I a bit hot so we're just gonna sometimes it's good to move here try bombing around because different parts of thing might be different sheets if you can heat it perfectly so we're right about 500 maybe a little less cheers everybody long enough temps get a little Wiggy Wow instantly happy PR nice Oh perhaps a little bit too much heat on the Redeem and that should do it there oh sorry is there going is a feeling it hash hash rosin live skew hash rosin live rosin even sometimes diamonds with a nice glob like that I am I don't know about you guys but it gets me right behind the eyes and then gets my sinuses running Terps so again hope you guys are making the best of this quarantine situation I know it sucks I will be asking products for 4/20 if not try to grab some now while you got the chance for now that's all peace", "XmyRYtIMcnQ": "all right getting this instagram live started today roz and ryan thanks everyone who is tuning in uh roz and ryan should be here in just a minute i literally never know what to say before these things get started so let's get it going for himself all right cool he is connecting now hey hey how's it going man hey it's going uh pretty darn well how are you doing pretty good over here yeah oh you're at the lab yep yep i actually uh went to the house for a little bit figure i'd come back and do it uh at the lab so okay awesome well thanks for joining me today uh i say this every time but for everyone who's tuning in i'm going to say this about three or four times throughout the segment you've probably seen it uh solving this hash q and a with the man himself roz and ryan in the lab super stoked uh if you've got a question pop it in the question box at the bottom there's a little question uh there's two little boxes it's a lot easier to keep track of it i'll keep an eye on the comments but uh how you doing today ryan it's been a little bit yeah i'm doing good as good as i can with all the crazy [ __ ] going on uh in the world right now yeah case in point i'm i'm here at my house and you're at the lab mask on you guys have a covid protocol yeah we're all in our own little stations we've all got to have the masks on we've all got to just do the normal uh stuff over here but yeah we've actually kind of had to space out our areas a little bit um especially with trimming and everything like that as well um just trying to stay as separate as possible really yeah well still making tons of hash have you guys ever seen a lot of demand it looks like sales are definitely up yep yep and we uh just expanded not too long ago so we're just trying to see exactly how much we can pump out in a day with uh keeping up with quality and stuff right now awesome so you guys are kind of pushing the limits right now over at oleo huh yeah i think they're washing around 50 pounds a day right now wow that's crazy uh i see foxtrax wrecking we got a ton of night ton of great hashmakers in here thank you guys for joining us so i'm gonna i'll go through some questions man and let you take it away um if there's something you want to talk about feel free to just jump in but for everyone who's tuning in who's you know not as familiar with you or your work as maybe i am uh tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got into making hash in the first place yeah i'm in the uh the rosin presser at olio the rossignol extractor um i've been with the company for almost about over four years now uh started as a packager went on to hydrocarbon extractions and eventually you know went to the solventless world and this is you know my love uh this is where i'm gonna stay awesome so what what made you take the jump to solventless if you were doing hydrocarbon before it seems like a lot of hash makers i've talked to on the show had a very similar path yeah honestly it was just it being presented to me i never had access to uh fresh frozen material uh back in florida or even when i first moved here so getting to work with fresh frozen and as soon as we were starting the wash process we needed somebody to press uh you know toots is washing all day so i was you know the first to just kind of raise my hand it just was a very lucky little little uh position i got to be put in honestly that's awesome so you've been with ole has has it been oleo for the past four years or so have you been with some other places too um no well the company we started out before oleo um we split with but yeah i've been with oleo since the very beginning of oleo about a little over four years now wow and has the company changed a lot since then i bet yes honestly we've gone from just the the basic growth practices that you know we had before we've really had to alter to spit just for solventless hash you have to alter your tech in such a way you've done so much trial and error i think we've just come so far as far as quality since the beginning has just been incredible to see uh our team is still small we we've only hired a few more people since the beginning so we're still a small little company so you guys run a pretty tight ship over there uh you are the only person pressing rosin for oleo right now is that correct i actually got an apprentice at the beginning of the year my buddy adam's been helping me um just with the the quantity that we're trying to push out uh it helps to have somebody that's able to prep bags able to do second presses can i can trust them you know doing the whole entire process if i'm not here um stuff like that it really does help uh after about six or seven hundred grams a day that's when i notice i start needing a little bit of a hand six or seven hundred grams a day okay you guys are seriously moving some product and you know i've personally noticed that quality has obviously just continued to go up and up and up to be you know one of the top hash companies in the state i mean what are you watching right now that you're excited about what's new uh in your lab as far as new stuff um not too much i'm trying to think we just got a bunch of like ice cream cake crosses and a bunch of other new things that we're about to pop um that are going to be coming through the line here shortly but honestly right now we're focusing on our main hitters getting those to the highest quality we possibly can like honestly we're focusing on consistency right now i'm not doing too many like new texts or worrying about any you know new things i'm really trying to dial everything in right now so to just get that super consistency that's scaling your consistency that's the name of the game right now exactly exactly we got to keep this consistency as we grow and expand i don't want this to fall off at all yeah so obviously the hash that people are smoking is a reflection of your work uh what are you guys doing to ensure that consistency because shelf stability is such a hot topic in the industry right now and i know you guys are actually absolutely one of the best at that you know how are you guys scaling that consistency it's a lot of note-taking it's a lot of keeping the things that work and ensuring that we keep those going every single time even if it takes a little bit more time we cannot cut corners uh that's where i feel like a lot of people fall behind as they scale up is more corners are being cut as you do it um we're always just trying to get better i don't even think you know we're satisfied just yet as hash makers about where we are so i think it's that too is i'm never really satisfied with the press toots is never satisfied with the wash and that is a good thing we're always pushing uh the growers are never satisfied there's no real peak you know just yet um as far as shelf life and consistency and stuff we just it's so funny but i i never have like an actual sop that i'm following every time most of my stuff is visual it's just gotten to the point where i can see how something's coming out in the jar and i know you just it's playing with the hash so often you get used to it that's the only way honestly um interesting involved in the hash that's the only way so i mean you know that's definitely the skill of the hashmaker to know the resin and one of the things one of our previous guests said that i'd love for you to comment on is that you know the a true artisan hashmaker will know what a material can make in terms of textures it not dictating it the other way around so when you're pressing stuff it's telling you what you can make with it would you say that that's true or not true no it is it is to it to a degree so i can take a strain and make you know a variety of consistencies with it but when i'm squishing that strain i can tell i'm i want to keep this one fresh fresh i want to i know it's if it's super sticky and after sitting for 24 hours in the jar it's just leak and terps i want to keep that as a cold cure batter i don't want to heat i don't want to put that one in the oven you know what i mean so it's certain things to look for like that where you know kind of what it wants to do exactly like there are certain strains that uh i don't really like to put in the oven but i do it only because we get requests for you know the jam um there's certain strengths vice versa that you know i think jam out great some people like fresh press so it's all different yeah well explain to me a little bit more about and just as a disclaimer to you and everyone who's watching you know share as much or as little as you feel comfortable you know we respect the hard-won secrets and techniques that you guys have put your time and energy into but when it comes to a cold cure versus you know in the oven and warm cure for some of the people that are tuning in can you explain the difference between those two yeah so the cold cure is getting no additional heat it's even sometimes literally put in the cold to to gain that terp layer over a period of time this isn't something that happens overnight either these certain batches that come out extra terpene that have that nice turp layer i think you should honestly in my opinion you don't need that extra heat you should be able to make some nice batter out of that just as is uh sometimes the batches need a little bit of extra help though the heat people look at as a bad thing or like you're ruining something um but we've done enough we've done so many terp tests it's going to alter the terp yes it will but it's not going to destroy how many like the terps you think it's going to destroy but in my opinion if you have that natural terp layer and there's those are our really good batches if something's coming down the line that i post a picture of and it's got that amazing tour player on top you can almost guarantee that i'm not gonna put that one in the oven okay so the cold cure common to the popular phrase is often room temperature is that what you're saying yeah and i know other people call their cold cures different things so i know uh other labs might have different things but our cold cure batter is no additional heat whatsoever and usually it's stored in the fridge afterwards and stuff like that too so it's just no additional heat whatsoever okay interesting you know a topic that we discuss all the time on these q a's is you know what the terms mean and that so many different terms are out there in the industry yeah so it's really like personal like what what you want to call it you want to call it the jam you want to call it sauce you want to call it cold cure um i and there also is you know i know ways to you can put the batter in for weeks at a time and also get that same turf layer it's just a matter of time as well we can leave a jar out for a day and see a little bit of you know that layer you can leave it in for about a week in the freezer and just start begin to start seeing that as well okay so is does that kind of come down to the the actual terpene concentration of the hash itself or like what are the factors there i mean it seems straightforward but as someone who doesn't press rosin all day like you do i you know i trust the experts here what do you see there i think it's strain and how well it came out in the ground um it's because you can have two side-by-side you know runs of whatever and the one that uh performed better in the garden that that was healthier that healthier plant is probably going to have a higher terp content um yeah there's so many different little variables honestly so have you seen you know differences in hash in the same strain just depending on like how it was grown that that's how different you're saying it is yeah yeah totally totally wow and what's the method to grow that you guys are using over at oleo um ours is just a basic uh like cocoa grow i think they're using like 15 gals they're pretty big pots um we use a steak method it's just it's honestly it's like a basic basement grow kind of blown up you know what i mean yeah so taking what works the masters of the staking over there that's awesome so do you get a kind of pick some of the material that comes to you or how does your process selection with toques work yep so yeah toots is the the man to pick all the strains and stuff we kind of just go through we know just based on history most of the time unless we're doing a pheno hunt the history of how well the strains wash so we'll be able to go through you can literally we'll go through and pick right away this is going to this this is going to that um sometimes if we have little splits at the end we might get extra uh bho might get a little extra so it sometimes at the end we'll we'll split a strain or something or just to see how it performs in bho if we haven't done it in you know a little bit okay so do you guys test wash or you know do you commit to a big wash and just go for it or how how do you not lose your ass there no no uh twos likes to do a little testers before he goes in with the big one um it just some of those washes especially the size they are now you don't want to take up half your day um just washing something that ends up just doing horrible it really is it's a downer yeah yeah something we've heard a lot in the pursuit of the best flavors a lot of duds out there are there any strains that like you loved but they just didn't yield enough to be a regular production plant so many i i honestly i wish i could write down all the ones that we thought were going to do great and then just didn't do good or the ones we really wanted to do well and then they still just no it sometimes it's just not meant to be honestly you can love the term there's actually two that we have around that just they're not really good washers but i will keep the j i think we'll keep the juice man six forever just because it's so damn good what is the cross on that one i'm not super familiar with that strain um that is papaya and fabuloso nice so do you guys are you seeing yourself running a lot of crosses from oni it seems like you guys are kind of the masters it seems that they do so well that you're like all right well let's try another one let's try another one um but yeah we're going through a few few others right now i wish i had some of the ones that are going to be in rotation soon that we're popping um i wish i had the names of all but yeah uh oni just does well for us it seems like they breed for hash oh are there any other breeders or geneticists that you've seen coming through the lab a lot or that you just are personally fond of um exotic swamp boys canerado i feel like i've said the same ones on other podcasts and stuff but those are just like the staples um yeah i know there's other ones out there yeah have you been pressing anything cool uh last week or this week that you're excited about because for people who are tuned in who are in colorado you know what what can people expect to come out of your lab soon let's see let's see what i i'm here oh man we got some la cush gas tanker i did juice man six gas man which is a combination of gas tanker and the juice man um our day glow has been coming out amazing um it's a citrus strain nice yeah um and we got a bunch of ice cream cake and gmo mixes as well wow stack lineup coming out of the lab exactly um we got some lucky charms um that it's one of the first few times we've ran it so i was just kind of seeing how that one did for us how did it do because i've heard of that strain like maybe a while ago or maybe i'm thinking something okay i'd have to look at his chart to see what it did on the ice hash uh it actually it didn't yield the best for me either so i don't think it probably did that great for him but yeah yeah i actually can't say i'm the most fond of the flavor either but whatever some of them aren't you know keepers so but um chem d uh is making a comeback our old school chem d i-95 oh nice yeah so that is a that's a super gassy one that i've always enjoyed um since i started here really well what kind of strains do you like personally i mean you as i think a lot of people respect you obviously for your posts and being a terrific hashmaker but tell everyone like what are you into personally in hash i'm into terps uh i honestly it's literally my like just my mood i i don't smoke indicas at a certain time or sativas at a certain time it's honestly what i'm just feeling like tasting yeah uh i'll take big old banana dabs in the morning and i don't i don't care if it gets me sleepy sometimes i just want that terp you know it really just depends on my mood i've really always loved fruity and citrusy stuff i know that some people you know really don't go for those but i love them man um i'm not actually a huge fan of cookies or cake strains but they yield so well you probably have to press them all the time exactly some of them are good uh like cookies and cream and stuff i ta i think tastes great it's like a uh i got i like i like everything honestly nice so a bunch of different profiles i you know personally a huge fan of the balancing the orange terps i think that's my favorite profile tropicana cookies gets me every time do you guys get much of that in your lab uh yeah we do some trump uh i we like to see how it uh turns out cause sometimes you know wash is purple and we have yet to have that like purple rosin just yet but we're always we're always hopeful kind of yeah well that would be cool to see and i know a lot of people who are tuning in i'm sure would love to hear a little bit more you know i think you're widely credited as being one of the people that's really taken the jam consistency and made it popular um is that a shelf stability thing is that a personal preference is that consumer demand like where did the jam come from and kind of how did you figure it out um well it came from just watching kind of what others were experimenting with on instagram and i was just trying to follow along and with the information that i was getting i just knew was not correct so that came down to just doing a whole bunch of r d in the lab um but yeah it honestly comes down to a personal preference and shelf stability issue um the fresh press as everybody knows if you don't leave it you know put it back in the fridge and you leave it out within a day or two it's you know it's starting to degrade it's starting to butter up you're losing terps you're you know you're kind of have a lesser product than you did just a few days prior if you don't remember to put it in the fridge um this was just literally how can we mimic live resin and make a product where you don't have to put it in the fridge it actually it's nicer to dab after it's been left out at room temperature um it's like saucy it drips off that dab or you know like you can see the visible crystals inside of it i think everything about that was just kind of appealing to me okay that i mean that makes a lot of sense and i remember a while ago you put out some test results on your jams that took a ton of comments to get through that people you saw a higher terpene test result after you had jammed it is that right i mean and we've done this a few times and i'm trying to get a the the most you know accurate representation of the sample so i'm not trying to pull terpenes from the top of the jam jar i was trying to mix it around and really get some of the crystals get some of the terps and then compare that to our classic rosin and almost every time we saw a significant increase and when i first posted that it was more of asking a question it was more of can somebody explain to me why this might be i know it caused a whole bunch of controversy but uh i don't know i i really do think it's just the ratio of fats that are gone in the jar and other factors i i don't think it's actually like there's no way it's actually like growing terps out of thin air there's i know there's no possible way i just wanted to know why the ratio was different um and i was trying to take accurate you know sampling um i'm not just taking the juice off of the top so so what kind of is your current thought on the matter if it's a little inconclusive right now i honestly think it's just a ratio thing i think that the terpene profile is altered slightly and it's actually uh depending on the strain as well you notice some of the fruitier strains they get altered a little bit more than some of these gas ear strains uh at the by the end of the jam process so it's there's a whole bunch of things okay so solid changes i mean i remember one of the things that ken wall told me a long time ago was you know he was a chef in it in a former life and he said that he modifies things just like you said it doesn't necessarily destroy things so on the topic of like the warm cures you don't think that you're necessarily always losing something when you're warming it up in the jar or explain that to me it seems like it's slightly altering the uh the terpene profiles honestly um certain monoterps turn it's it's it's it's honestly pretty complicated i wish i knew the science behind exactly what was happening inside the jar but um i can tell you that it there's it's the fats you can visibly see them melting down um all that all the opaque lipids that you normally see in rosin you can watch them kind of melt in the jar which if you were to ask me this two years ago i would have said that the terps would have melted way faster than the fats inside the jar but it's clearly not the case so now it's kind of the other way around yeah honestly i've we've just done so many tests now it's just so strange but i mean i love the jam i smoke the jam i'll dab the jam all the time i i thoroughly enjoy it i don't feel like it ruins anything yeah no i i it seems extremely shelf stable and we've bought a ton of oleo at the office and cliff who's one of our uh one of one of our top dudes he smokes a lot of oleo and he said that he's had some of your jams out at room temperature for like over a month and they literally do not change it all nice awesome that's awesome to hear yeah are there any other consistencies that you guys are putting out a lot of i mean it sounds like you're not super big on the butters is it a lot of just jams and fresh press or what do you guys mostly put out fresh press um we're doing cold cure uh and heated batters and then the jams as well and then we also are doing the rosin pens right now well tell me a little bit about the rosin pens how long were you guys working on those because we've heard that the viscosity is a challenge yes it's a challenge and finding that the hardware has been painted honestly we've had quite a few that we think work and then we'll go to do a mass you know drop of them and we'll get a few complaints about the hardware it's never usually the the flavor the anything like that it's the hardware it's pulling through it you know all this [ __ ] it's kind of hard to find like a really good hardware and we don't want to copy another you know high high-end brands pens and go with the same one because everyone will think you're just kind of copying somebody so we're trying to find another pen that's you know also going to be able to perform like we wanted to i mean what what do you think some of the hardware is lacking is it you know not is it getting too hot is it i mean i know that there's just two things honestly i think it's finding a perfect aperture hole it's finding the perfect voltage because obviously these things you don't want to heat up really like you would uh any type of other you know dabbable product you want the rosin to be heated at i want it to be a low temp dab kind of like yeah i want these things to be not burning the hash so it's been a challenge for me to find something that that works on a mass scale that people don't complain about or i don't know it's that's been our biggest issue honestly not funny strains or you know different flavors to put in the pens it's it's all about the hardware really right now and i think we've found one that we've kind of have been using for a while and i think we found to be reliable but we'll see in the long run uh what we end up sticking with yeah so for anyone who's tuned in if you know someone that's in the cartridge manufacturing game please tell them to put a little more time and energy into some rosin cartridge hardware because this is something that we've heard repeatedly yeah i know there are some great ones out there and stuff like that and um i personally know some guys that are doing great stuff out there uh with the carts but it i don't know i guess the the managers here we just haven't found one that works on a mass scale just yet so yeah and the voltage thing is worth lingering on for just a second because um mikey from harvest moon gardens on california i went to emerald couple while ago and he said that the low like the 2.6 if you're really using much higher vultures than that he thought that the it was really just burning terps and not giving you the optimal flavor profile do you have like a voltage that you guys have found that works best or like a range i would honestly be the last person to ask i am not i am i am even i'll take a rig on the go man not a cart man person to ask about the pens but i honestly want to say they're in the low twos but i would i would have to ask uh our pen guy shane so the the proper way to get the real full flavor profile cannot skip the rig yeah i mean if you're on the go though it's just so nice to have a little pen but i know i understand why people love pens too um but they're just not for me it's literally a personal thing no no and i say that knowing that i think rosin cartridges and i'd love to get your input on this are probably the best way to open up solvent lists to more consumers and more casual users who might not be the level of connoisseur that you are but they still want to enjoy a super high quality product would you say that that's right exactly a lot of people are just intimidated by the torch and the nail and everything like that when you're first starting out just to see that i guess is kind of intimidating we've been doing it so long that it's second nature but i guess if you uh are dabbing with somebody that isn't used to it that's that could probably be pretty intimidating especially if you glob them out too hard and then they're never the same but exactly well we are about a half hour in here this conversation is absolutely flying for everyone who has tuned in we've got ross and brian with us this conversation will be up on instagram about five minutes after the hour i will get that posted and then in a week or two we'll have this up on youtube as well if you've missed any of it you want to watch the whole thing so i'm gonna throw in a question from the audience here uh we've gotten a couple let's see um foxtrax is asking how much are you pressing at a time i'm pressing about 20 grams at a time i do uh two really small bags side by side on my press um and i'm using the two and a half by four and a half bags i'm plugging you in here i don't want my phone to die while i'm doing this here oh you're good um so i have two tiny little patties side by side on the press okay 10 grams in each one so about 20 grams at a time okay so you're doing the small presses have you seen better results on your end doing a small press it sounds like you've been doing that for a long time yep i love the small presses i i get more clarity in the presses um i don't get as much of the micro bubble thing going on um okay yep i i really just love the quality control that i get over the the small presses i'd rather do more and it take longer honestly to preserve that quality that you're looking for it sounds like you guys are obsessed with that which is key yep exactly awesome and when you're pressing do you press at a variety of different temperatures depending on what you're trying to do i mean again you don't have to tell us your trade secrets but like no what what's your temp range and what do you like to do with your press i can i can tell what tempo i'm gonna press it at just by how sticky it is the bags are in my hands while i'm prepping them um if they if they aren't really that greasy i can you know press up to 200 degrees if they're feeling real greasy and nice i could drop it to 170 160. so it really just depends um how the quality of the hash in the heads okay so is like 160 around your lower threshold have you ever gone much lower than that um back in the day when i was doing experimenting when i first got your guys's press i was oh is this bothering you two with me being the other way here [Laughter] it's the it's the audio that matters for the most part but that's that's better if that will work for your phone there it's balancing on a little charging cord there um no um oh yeah what were you saying oh just talking about you said you're doing some experimentation on like a really lower threshold yep um so when i first got the press i wanted to see literally how uh how how low i could go uh so i was pressed at like 120 130 but um you would get hash come out and stuff and it'd look amazing but the yields are just so low in the first press that you're essentially just having to go in the second time and get you know everything out again and if you weren't going to do a third press it was almost like that second press was the first press so it all is just like a fine line okay so you could go up and temp a little bit get just as good quality and then not have to press it three times basically exactly it's finding it's finding the the golden temp is what i call it's where i can get an amazing first quality press nothing's even close to buttering on that first press i'm still getting a decent yield and then i can go back and squeeze the rest of the hash out the second time so when you do your second press are you going up in temperature or are you just hitting it again um if i'm already up in temperature near 200 i'll keep it the same i don't ever go above 200 degrees on anything either even second press um but usually i will go up a few degrees and i'll hit pressure quicker full pressure and it goes for two to three times as long okay so that's just getting it all it's literally getting all the hash out okay and do you pretty much do a second press every time or do you get it all out sometimes um some of the really greasy strains um you'll just get an amazing first press yields you'll get like 75 80 almost in the first and then you'll just have a little tiny bit in the second oh so for those ones it's just kind of using all parts of the buffalo exactly those those really good heads and stuff though uh most of the time like you said will come out in the first press okay and as far as clarity goes have you noticed that that has a lot to do with when the plants are pulled or the strain itself like clarity is such a hot topic i'd love to hear you know what your thoughts are on color and clarity so color is where that comes into play pulling early and stuff is color uh we don't really believe in having that white hash is really the the biggest concern for us honestly we've i mean it looks great don't get me wrong but yeah if ours is yellow but clear as can be the clarity is where i feel like the quality comes in honestly oh so key distinction there and a good correction for me color clarity often confused or used interchangeably you can see very different things pouring out of a press but if you look closely it's all just bubbles um but you can also have amazing blonde white hash but it's super clear that's when you know you have that quality so what do you think so that opaque nature translucent nature of it what like what does that mean when you're looking for something that's really clear what is it that's a quality indicator in your world yep i i that's all in the grow um that's if things aren't right in the grow you're gonna get a ton of micro bubbles and foamy foamy hash going on oh and do you have any idea why that might be tons of additives in the grow improper flushing a lot of people think you need a bunch of stuff that you really don't need um for making that for making the plants pretty intense and bigger and all this other stuff where when it comes down to the tri-cad you're actually just kind of uh screwing yourself over so growing uh plant and buds for shelf or you know bag appeal that's a total it's totally different for solventless especially because you're really just resin farming i think that's the exact way to put it yep we have buds that if if we were to go sell those as flour they would look so mediocre you'd be like what is this but you you actually look at the trikets they're so bulbous and the ratio of the the heads to the actual surface area of the buds it's like that's what you're looking for it's like those thin membranes the fatty heads so do you guys ever get down with like a microscope and look at the plants yeah they're they're checking them out with the loops and scopes all the time that's awesome that that's so cool so okay for everyone who's tuned in that's a super important nugget of wisdom is just if something doesn't look like it's gonna make the high times cover uh it could still be a total winner for solventless it sounds like yep that's another thing too uh with having these like big old dense buds sometimes it's not that those dense nugs that are really going to wash good anyway you got to get inside the nug so sometimes a little bit fluffier is uh better oh and you know we hear a lot and we see a lot that hybrids are hybrids and indicators seem to be the things that are pressed the most especially with hash has that been your experience are there any sativas that you've been messing around with too well there's very few sativas that we found to wash honestly i was just reading somebody made a post the other day about some haze cross that looked pretty interesting they said wash pretty pretty decently but on our in our experience we haven't had too many sativa washers man we've tried a few times and they just yeah they don't yield oh that's too bad do you do you think that's because of that bud structure because i'm sure twox would have a lot to say about that but i think that's super important in the wash process i honestly think it's the the trikes uh the shape of the trikes and just how they attach themselves to the to the membrane of the plant itself um i think that needs to be looked into more than just the actual blood structure of the plant um because yeah you would honestly think that those would wash great because you can get inside all everywhere you don't really have to agitate it too much you would think that all those uh trikes would just fall off in there but sometimes that's not the case sometimes you know there is no real stock for it to fall off of sometimes it's like attached to the plant itself and i don't know sometimes those just aren't the good washers even though i would love them to be i love lemons and like heavy orange like hazes and stuff like that but yeah we've just found that they don't uh they don't wash that well right so for commercial production it's not going to pass but it's like trichome detachability and i think i just wanted to stop for a second everyone's out of here so okay yeah you're like okay yeah nice well there's roz and ryan and flesh uh for everyone who has not seen some of the weakness trichome stuff do you follow i think it's schwall i'm hoping i'm pronouncing it right but they yeah thank you for correcting me i know i i actually don't i don't know how to uh pronounce it either so i just call it swallow but okay well that sounds better than what i said so i mean have you seen those macros of the weakness micro uh the weak neck trichomes yes and i also seen it was he the ones doing some of the uh the uv pictures with the the macros and stuff like that i don't know i think so okay yeah oh that's interesting because it seems like that's exactly the topic that you know we need to learn more about is more about detachability so that you could identify something before you ever wash it exactly yeah that'd be really nice to be able to do yeah well again anyone who's tuned in please help us out here uh if you've got something that you could bring to the table to get some more macros and help us learn a little bit more that'd be great so yeah like fox just said like the length of the trichome stock like honestly it makes sense the longer it is the more bulbous the head it just wants to get knocked off of there yeah okay and do you wash or excuse me right away for this would be do you press a lot of mixed micron for the most part do you guys do single micron pressing how do you how do you make your selection there so every single batch we do has 90s and 120s they're pulled out of our first wash so we separate those and i press them separately and then everything else even 90s and 120s from the second wash onward that's all our mixed micron all together 40 to 179 you technically if you want to get technical um i like getting technical yeah so so yeah we uh we do mix micron of every single batch and we also do 90 and 120 of every single batch okay do you guys ever play with sift or you guys just do ice water it seems like we're about to here pretty soon uh we have so much going on that um i think we're gonna introduce kind of another line maybe down the road cool of just a little bit lesser quality rosin um made with some of our partners dried like our trim material and dry sifting that and kind of refining our dry sip technique and maybe doing some rosin with that down the line um that's something we've just kind of talked about cool and do you see promise for solventless based edibles or like food grade oil i mean i'd love to get your take on that um yeah i know i mean i even enjoy a nice hash edible high a little bit more than a distillate um i enjoy that body buzz i enjoy that heavy um relaxing high that the hash edible seems to give me more than the distillate edibles so yeah i think there's a huge market for that um and people in general that are just against distillate even though you know how it goes yeah i think that you have done a great job historically as long as i've known you and in your post and following you about being pretty neutral when it comes to a lot of the extraction topics and not necessarily saying you know one thing is the right thing to do but you're right that there's a there's a lot of opinions when it comes especially in the solving this community exactly so everyone's got their opinion so i i just like to say everything you know is my opinion don't get offended but yeah yeah i'll smoke it all i'll i'll eat it all yeah i mean it some of i mean distilled edibles are the most common obviously or co2 but it's a little one-dimensional to me that that's my issue yep yeah so anyway i don't want to talk about this a little too much but that's funny that you know there is there are some distinctions there is that something that you guys might do one day or is that not really on the menu that's probably one of the things that's not going to be on the menu um edibles is a whole different beast within itself um with [Music] the fire department and the just the uh the other things you have to go through the hoops you have to go through with an edible company are so different than with a extract company or a grow i don't think we want to get into that just yet so yeah kitchens exactly we'll leave that to the um to the professionals if we ever go down that road we'll probably team up with somebody or do something like that no that that's awesome uh all right i need to make sure that i can i can put uh some questions to you because we're getting a ton here but i can't get through them all all right here's just a quick one just for fun what do you think where are you at with the added game uh ttrs for sure yeah that's where you drive right i i wish i just drive a base tt but it would be nice to have that five cylinder no that's awesome i see pictures of your car all the time and uh i'm pretty envious because that thing is awesome so okay uh addie makes a great car check out his pictures if you haven't already um do you press in a cold room um no actually it's just room temp right here so this is uh this is like 68 to 70 degrees in here yeah have you have you ever pressed in a cold room or do you think that that's important or not um honestly i could actually see that being i actually have never pressed in a cold room so i don't know um it might actually be really easy to collect the rosin now if it's all nice and stable it's pretty stable at room temperature so i could imagine it might even be like that shatter that you have to be careful of folding the parchment so it doesn't fly away yeah so i don't know honestly yeah hey well honestly good ours is just you know room temp though um and we have a lot of people will probably wonder like i have my can you see the oven right there uh-huh it is right next to the press so i'm always pressing and just watching what's in the oven i don't have a set timer that these are going in oh okay visual okay so do you have any advice for new hash makers that are trying to learn and to you know read the resin that the way that you do what what would you tell those people well honestly the first thing i would tell them is to get acquainted with the plants in the grow that's that's what's going to help more than anything when you're with these plants all the time you're going to be accustomed to the resin that they're producing you get accustomed to the resin it's all just like a chain so honestly that would be the biggest thing i would i would say honestly is get used to the plants being around plants get used to the hash play with hash as much as you can even if you have dry sift play with that if you have bubble hash it's it's trial and error it's playing with hash it's it's um you gotta want the results too it's not gonna come you know the first time is usually the worst for most people unless you have just amazing luck but yeah yeah it's there's only up to go from there so it's just playing with the hash all the time so you've you know clearly had some hits and misses along the way so if i'm taking something out it's don't get discouraged but keep going yeah i mean there's literally been batches i've ruined here at oleo because i'm trying to do r d or messing with stuff it you cannot get discouraged ever um you might have a bad batch in a room come out um there's all these things that are going to happen if you ever grow anything in your life you're going to know that it's not just you know that the sunny days there's there's like a gardening is hard work those guys in the grove they crush it they are doing way more physical [ __ ] than i am uh pressing rosin nowadays when i used to grow and stuff myself and harvest and make my own hash you really see the whole picture um of what goes into this yeah okay so you started with growing you know obviously a lot of labor of love and i've heard from so many of the other hashmakers we've had on the show that like the respect of the plant is where it all starts so your experience with growing probably helped lead you to where you are just like you said at the beginning oh it definitely helped so much learning learning about the plant helped me learn more about hash in general yeah yeah no that's that's awesome and i know i've been a lot of fox tracks questions not even all right well we'll see if you feel like answering this but if you don't want to give away your secrets you don't have to but any general advice on how to help people with their jam this is probably why half the people are tuning in right now yep so like i said everybody it's all visual if you put something in and you set it for a timer for an hour you could come back to it being completely decarb and you can't do anything but make mediocre pens with it because even then you put it in the oven too long to make pens with it um i have my oven set at the same temperature as most of the time i'm pressing 180 degrees fahrenheit it stays at 180 degrees fahrenheit um i actually have a little sticker on it now that says like do not touch it because i've had a few people touch it but uh yeah it's 180 degrees it all depends on how much is in the jar and the different strains also can take a different amount of time if there's more fats in the strain if there's more thc there's more chirps so when you're doing a strain you're checking in on it a lot it sounds like to figure out what that time is because i'm sure it's variable right yeah it's all variable and all my batches aren't the same size either so if i you know do a batch of juice man and i have a 150 gram jar but the next time i do juice man i can't just try to guesstimate a time it doesn't work that way honestly okay so and i mean it's all visual and what are some of the visual cues that you're looking for to know if it's heading in the right direction or not you will first start to see the rosin begin to bubble and it almost starts looking like it's boiling up um it's still completely opaque uh it'll start to turn into that butter you'll notice your fresh press your transparent fresh press will turn into a butter and then the butter will start to like bubble up and you'll start to it'll look like a batter inside the jar and then as it begins to melt down even further you will see from the bottom up it actually starts to get transparent again you can see the fats inside the jar melting down until it almost looks like a lip it's completely liquid almost in there i could reach inside there with a gloved hand be careful it's all hot yeah and tilt the jar on its side and it will completely move it's it's just like the water in my glass it'll move like this it'll almost move like that yeah there'll be a little bit of foam on top yeah it completely changes the way it looks i've posted a few pictures of right before i pull it out of the oven but i should honestly post a few more so so i'm reading somebody here writing too it will get darker too so don't be scared of that it'll it'll look darker then it will eventually become once it crashes out and you know the thc starts crashing so tell us a little bit more about this because this is a question we get a lot about you know the nucleation and the crashing out of the thca how does that process happen and when does that happen so i'm gonna actually uh here let me show you here because i'm in the lab this is why i came here hell yeah yeah and let me show you too so here's like my little station as i'm pressing i'm literally looking over just just seeing how it looks that's that's my timer literally just oh it's all visual and here's here's oh here's all the crew i drew nice sketching it out well yeah here let me show you something real quick yeah give us a little tour yeah so uh this is like the post production area you can see there's like the back ovens for the bho and everything there's you don't use vac ovens though you're just using straight non-pressurized yep i just i just use this little convection oven oh easy don't need anything crazy yep yep just just a little one um we got just our like packaging areas and stuff over here nice so you guys have a tidy operation yeah i don't want to get too close to anybody i'm staying away yeah so this is like our freezer room where we keep all our frozen stuff and this is like little my little uh like rosin station so i'll have all like my bags and stuff and i'll just kind of prep you can see that this fits perfectly [Music] oh nice yeah okay so it's just nice so i don't even i'm not i'm not even working in a cold room it's just staying cold from the uh from the freezer no that that's cool do you have any samples we could take a look at or is it all packed i'm actually going to show you right now what i have going on back here this is what everyone tuned in for this is my nucleation area so it's literally and i pulled this off normally you would have i don't like any light going in there so i have you just like a little cloth on both sides just kind of is that because the light degrades some of the cannabinoids and terpenes exactly and these are going to be some really good ones i'm going to be posting pictures oh i can see the liquid from here i mean that's like half liquid it almost appears look at this yeah wow this one's crashing out like crazy so again tell us a little more about the crash process while you're walking us through here this one so yeah so they all get put on the heat map after they go into the oven and they're all oven for very times like this one barely got put into the oven this one's gonna be a batter this one's gonna be better and i'm not gonna open up any of these just yet they're not quite ready um no they're coming we can see it open them up but yeah so these will be better i mean you can see this is like going to be a really wet batter thin layer on top yep yo yeah okay i see exactly what you're saying it's all it's almost like honey that has been in the microwave or something yeah so these are almost going in order of time based on the oven so that one then this one which is a super wet batter which went into the oven for even longer yeah okay once we mix that up it's gonna look insane i might post this one up a video of it tomorrow and this one was melted in the oven for the longest and now it is really crashing out you can see there and you can see it this is how when i say it looks darker at first you're going to be scared because it's going to look like this but then it's going to get lighter as the thc begins to grow so it's this whole conversion process that's interesting yeah it's it's really cool and usually they don't sit for longer than two or three days oh so that okay that's that's pretty quick eight eighty percent of them are done within two days that's awesome i wish i could smell it that's the one thing that i'm really missing right now yeah oh cool any anything else in the lab that we should see or that you're allowed to share i mean honestly it's just uh the basic stuff that the vho set up is the back here we have our c1d1 room it's all explosion proof yeah we got our pen set up over here it's it's pretty uh pretty basic no that's awesome and i think what a lot of people don't realize is how some of the best hash in the whole world is made at a station just like yours and literally at yours that it's not this gargantuan production line that it's like one man with a team behind him working at a press making some of the best hash in the world i mean i don't think a lot of people understand that yeah literally i got one assistant helping me out now uh but for a while it's literally was just a one-man team and we can go we can make now we know we can make 25 to 3 000 grams of bras in a week no that's cool right here and i'm uh i'm roughing you guys today thanks i appreciate you rocking the shirt for the ig live man i know you've been with us for a long time oh yeah for sure well we've got about six minutes left here and i've got maybe two more questions to ask for everyone who's tuning in uh remember you can catch the whole thing on instagram right afterwards if you want to listen in tons of good info here totally recommend listening to the whole thing rosin rather ryan's got some great info and then it'll be on youtube in a week or two as well so what do you think what's the future of solvent list in your world man where do you think solving list is headed right now uh honestly i think everyone's just the the quality game is gonna improve everyone is just stepping up their game and uh you just see everyone else and it kind of at least me i'm i'm loving it i'm seeing uh what these other guys are doing and i just want to keep pumping out fire and get new genetics for the lab and putting out new flavors and consistency keeping keeping this up um that's what i just really want to see for the future so same quality at scale more flavors better are the better are there better qual right okay good again another good correction even better quality is where we're headed i mean do you think solventless is is the pinnacle of cannabis concentrates again it's just my personal opinion of course yeah i do i really do now that's great and are there any other hashmakers or people that you would recommend others who are tuned in would follow like who are who inspires you honestly this is one thing i wish i could i wish i could write down so many people that have like helped me out through this whole entire thing there's honestly been so many um i know sam um mile high um he's he's been one of the nicest kids there's honestly so many locals around here that i've gotten to talk to and meet that have been great um but yeah i i really i wish i could link up with some some more of them too um i feel like i'm in my own little world too i'm you know out here i kind of do my own thing but yeah i look up to so many different hashmakers it's ridiculous i i wouldn't even consider myself you know at the very top of those guys well i i i think being humble is a is a great attitude to have when you say sam you're talking about sam wise uh you used to used to work at essential extracts yeah yeah yeah i think he's a great guy there's so there's honestly so many other guys out there i could be shouting out right now too but yeah that the the hash game right now is just it's incredible and is it demand is it people want to get into this like why is solvent what's going crazy right now what do you think i really think people are realizing i mean just other than the cleanliness of the hash and just the whole organic aspect of the process um it's just going to come down to people that always wanted the best flower they're realizing now that some of the best flower is making some of the best hash and it's just that connoisseur mentality of people always wanting the best and i think people are out there you know looking for that that's why like the black market is so strong right now those home grows that are killing it um people just want to smoke really high quality heads really honestly what it comes down to is uh is quality um yeah oh that's awesome so with the remaining time we got left i got one last question for you what advice do you have for just new hatch makers in general we talked about really becoming acquainted with the plants the flower what about in the process of learning you know what advice would you give to anyone who's tuned in right now just be open to you gotta be open to learning you gotta want to learn um you have to love hash and the plant itself um you got to be excited to dab what you're what you're making i i honestly think that's what it comes down to is like being so excited watching it come off the press that you cannot wait to dab something and for others to want to dab it that's the only way uh but honestly working hard is what got me here i started as a packager just letting your your dreams be known um i always want i moved here to make cash this is what i wanted to do i had a goal and i you just got to work hard and eventually you know the right people will take notice um that's really all it comes down to that's awesome how can anyone find your products uh you guys are in just colorado right now is that correct yep just colorado right now we'll see what the the future holds yeah and you can find some drop locations on your website or how do you get tuned in with the olio drop so people can pick up some of your fine products yeah um we got a website um we got the instagram uh dabolio 710 it's got a link to our site and stuff they should be posting drop info as well um and just call your local dispensary ask if they carry oleorosin or any type of oil products okay awesome so for everyone who did not write that down just took a dab or is super stoned and won't remember i will put that in the description uh of the instagram post too so everyone can find out where your rosin can be found awesome thank you guys so much i seriously appreciate you doing this and i appreciate everybody that's watching right now thank you guys so much yeah thanks for taking some time out of your evenings everybody i know it's uh after work for some people so appreciate all your time make sure to check out the full video on youtube in a week or two when it comes up ryan thank you so much for joining us i appreciate your time man thanks again eric all right hey take it easy you", "MiaJTRLYTHY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] yeah we back at it let's go can't nobody hold me down how did you gopro [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] so oh

once your gloves warm up it's time to swap gloves [Music] i've been doing that to everybody i hop on their live stream and the first thing i say is daddy is here i don't care who it is i did it to me sonic i did it to [ __ ] uh pedro this morning i did it to josh last week [Music] remember it's not the twist it's the stretch that's my treat that's the secret you guys it has nothing to do with the twist the twist is just an easy way to stretch it it's the stretch though that's all it's about oh and that's the end of that i'm gonna start snapping on you [Music] actually not if i find that right now i'm gonna dab that [Music] i said nothing imagine taking the whole thing i mean you could just depends on where you want to take it [Music] [Music] so [Music] flew over by the rig oh no it's gone it's gone that little tiny piece is gone then because it ain't there it's all good it's like the tiniest little [ __ ] piece [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] me hmm hey not bad for a little 25 160. i haven't make one of these in a while now let's see what we uh we got yield wise right i'm curious are you curious i'm curious hello 0.0 grams 11.1 out of 17.7 nope it went down to 11. so we got 11 grams out of 17.7 that's a 62 percent return on the 25 and 160. not bad at all it's not bad at all hambone how do you want this you want this in some jars you want to do some parchment you want in some ptfe what's up what's up what's up tell me how you want it i feel like i should shove it into a couple of jars but right now i'm going to take a dab roni so beautiful [Music] break me off a piece of that [Music] oh i think that's a good enough dab i'm sorry hambone i had to do it don't get mad at me bro [Music] come on i love your dog but i'm about to dab it [ __ ] out of this i don't care how much it is i'm gonna store this here for now i'm sure i'll be back later how many different jars do you want that's what you got to tell me i don't know how many jars you want it's it's 11 grams so i can split it up into however many you want all right i'm sorry i'm gonna have to sit down for this this is a this is a a boy sit down it's like a dab this is the type of dab you take standing up and it's gonna tell you shut the [ __ ] down boy what's wrong with you all right [Music] coffee going and i found a little [Music] thca chunk to throw on there [Music] death [Music] step by dab i'm gonna give you some some [ __ ] love on instagram right now [Music] now bone garden that killer collab that y'all never saw coming what's up athena alex back burner what's up let's get it just pressed up a little bit of that hambone gardens this is the 25 and 160. yo yo yo this is the hambone gardens 25 and 160 right here hopefully you can hear me now that i turn the music down let's get it fatal tester dab we don't take no baby [ __ ] dabs around here oh yeah oh yeah i don't want to miss this one hmm jesus take the wheel um hmm oh yeah don't sleep on it that was the 25 and 160 let's go oh my god that felt like i was smoking some of my own [ __ ] ham bone you did it again you know what i like about hambone the first thing he told me i don't care about quantity i care about quality don't go for yield go for the high quality bet money homie that's what i like to hear [ __ ] me my bad i knocked you guys over that's what i like to hear my farmers say because if they're going for yield they know the quality is not good but if they know the quality is good they don't want you to go for yield keep the quality good oh my god yes sir that was like smoking on some of my own homegrown gave me the dab sweats it was smooth the entire time it cleans up extremely easy regardless of how big the dab was i mean hard to tell it is it's clean in there man it's nice so holy oh dab switch my turf caves are [ __ ] running but it's time to get into the full spec presses we're gonna fold up some parchment real fast for that and then have at it man good yes good dab good good good dab probably a little bit bigger than i should have gone for this early in the morning considering i still have work to do man [ __ ] turd caves sweating holding [ __ ] devil's ball sack it's warm in here now [Music] it's smoky in here too jesus louises i think we're gonna go with a 180 on the full spec see how it how it flows if the flow isn't there we're going up to 202. word word let's [ __ ] go all right so here's the plan parchment first okay and you guys are gonna get plugged in right now while i [ __ ] no every time i plug you in it [ __ ] disconnects when i [ __ ] unplug it so i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with that we're just gonna fold up our parchment real fast [Music] [ __ ] hambone [ __ ] ham bone good [ __ ] dude good [ __ ] [ __ ] hats off my hat's off i don't give a lot of props to a lot of people because a lot of people don't [ __ ] grow really really high quality [ __ ] like this i'll take it all day long brother you know something that's not often talked about is the uh the relationship how you have to grow with your farmer or hasher whichever way you're going you have to grow and collaborate together to improve the end product 25 and 160 mix micron test press dab let me add this real quick before i forget last time i forgot to [ __ ] do it um pull up my [ __ ] chat here god damn it oh my god that dab has my head spinning right now like i just down the [ __ ] bottle of patron all right yeah man that's that's that's no [ __ ] i don't give a lot of praise to a lot of people so ham bones my dude you crushed it and i got nothing but good [ __ ] to say for i can't wait to see what you do once i put a 20 kino in your head [Music] brick by brick by brick by brick by mother [ __ ] brick we are about to build this hatch house so something in my gut now is telling me to go up to my 202. something in my [ __ ] gut what is it what is it what is it it's in my gut it's in my [ __ ] nope it's deeper than my gut it's my nuts it's my [ __ ] balls my balls just spoke to me and they said why are you going to do something different than what you normally do don't change [Music] [ __ ] i don't know balls my brain is contesting you i just saw some [ __ ] on the press with the 25 and the 160 at 175 that was leaking but it wasn't a whole lot of it to leak so it couldn't really you know but then again am i just making excuses dilemma what say ye the people so i know i watched pedro's press this morning actually it was van ness how much pedro and i have very different styles of pressing but we both get very very good results at the end and i think that's a very good example of how different paths can lead to the same house you know um and ultimately because we both are experienced hashers both he and i know how to end up working the material after the press to where we can make it look the same you know in the end anyways you know the post-press manipulation is just really stupid these days with what you could do okay there's this next to the largest one we're gonna do it now a small one and this is the one we might test for 180. but i don't know i feel like we're entering the doodoo zone those of you that watch my stream know about the duder zone at 180 uh really 180 or 200 it's kind of like doodle [Music] dude hmm all right [ __ ] it let's let's test it on this small one that's what the tester is for right if this tester doesn't [ __ ] bleed beautiful [ __ ] terps i'm turning up the tab mister [Music] the [ __ ] go is in the house bro we've been bumping your music hard you've been busy making music [Music] he was live on instagram this morning too [Music] [Music] so oh my [ __ ] oh i just got that [ __ ] my balls just tug doggy from the inside you're like don't do it it's not hot enough it's not going to bleed fast enough don't do it [Music] so [Music] so [Music] what's up elite welcome to the grow room gang homie i appreciate the support nah [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] by the way if anybody's curious my directional flow fold is the easiest most least complicated easiest to collect off of method that i found i watched all those [ __ ] videos on youtube and these [ __ ] origami guys doing all this stupid [ __ ] not real origami but i mean all these rosin press dudes that are just doing the [ __ ] most and i feel like man one piece of parchment right you fold it twice on the ends so that way you can pinch that fold in and it doesn't leak out right you fold these sides good put a good crease in them okay don't fold the back too hard don't put it too big of a crease in it you might get a blow out if you the bigger the crease the bigger the chance for blowout all right then for me i know i need to cut off a little bit right to get it to flow into the jar where i want it and then fold it in half like you're making a [ __ ] paper paper airplane all right you guys remember this old school [ __ ] paper airplane [ __ ] from no time but you're not making the regular slow glider you're making that [ __ ] that fast one so you want to do the the um right that's what you're basically doing you're making that oh that paper plane right now when you open that up you get these beautiful folds where everything leads straight to the middle okay and you open it up what can i say except you're welcome for the tech that i share on this channel there you go now when it flows it's just you open it up you collect off one sheet you don't have like three different pieces of parchment to collect off of i mean come on kind of [ __ ] that's not good tech man you gotta [ __ ] collect it off of like three different pieces of parchment just so you can make it look cool i don't like that [Music] oh no too much what happened let me lose please talk to me seamless can you talk to me calm down you guys it happens it happens you know how many times i've accidentally muted somebody or put somebody on timeout all you have to do is accidentally rub something across your screen for like two seconds of the charging wire your hand if it's in your pocket whatever and you can like literally ban half the [ __ ] chat it's ridiculous i've done it like three times to people ocean's account was banned for like a month they didn't even use that account anymore it didn't even use it he was like [ __ ] it i'm getting on a different account [Music] so crazy that is craziness all right y'all remember the tech all right paper plane tech don't fold it straight to the the halfway point where the the fold is because then you might jam your rosin flow up a little bit especially if you keep it closed like this i don't like keeping it closed like this then the rosin gets everywhere it's more messy right that's why i make these folds [Music] my boy came straight back to the car what is up you couldn't resist it my tummy hurts i gotta go doo-doo but i'm too embarrassed to go at work on the public toilet i go home i need to [ __ ] on my own toilet i have a medical condition you don't want me to sit on your toilet it might spread the doctor said i can't share toilets with people it's a medical condition i'm not allowed to talk about it [Music] all right 180 one shot at one eight with a small bag we got 33 left on the battery so now i'm gonna set up the tripod and get you guys plugged in and in a good spot sorry my terps are running in that last dab that [ __ ] really [ __ ] sent me to the moon for a minute [Music] i can't even [ __ ] can't in front can't even front i straight blasted me to the moon and back [Music] now i'm just trying to get a cool spot for you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] good all right good fresh gloves um all right [Music] so [Music] [Music] um so i've got to figure out where i can get you that you're not going to be in the way because [Music] what i'm doing is more important than what you're seeing so i'm not going to be dead but you know this is what it is players all right first press test press 180 fahrenheit wedding crashers full spectrum hashtags and this is the smaller of the presses first can be a test see how it responds after temperature [Music] so [Music] i'm not even using any pressure i'm just letting that the hydraulics go down and towing basically right now [Music] so [Music] oh oh [Music] um uh h [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] um [Music] is foreign [Music] this is at a 180 right now oh it's just get all the terps out baby is [Music] happy mess is [ __ ] beautiful let's go [Music] [Music] um okay so let's keep it at 180 i feel like even a 1800 six all right let's see how it flows again at 180. whoa is that a bottle of tomatillo so you can stop carrying around your bottle and head to am pm instead right now buy any hot dog and get a second for a buck only at 8 00 pm too much good stuff buy one at regular price get a second of equal or lesser value for one dollar selection may vary by site while supplies last fire i got it pretty damn dry too all right well i feel like that's all we're gonna get out of those we might be able to push a tiny bit more yield out at the higher temps but uh that's why i raised it two degrees to try and keep the flow a little bit higher um beard hairspray did i put something in there uh there's nothing where do you see beard hair is that bro what are you talking about [Music] [Music] show me [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] so sorry guys i'm bumping you around i gotta get the bag [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] who's your daddy [Music] wow [Music] um uh [Music] quality over yield keep it as low pressure as you can slam in my throat from allergies keep it as low pressure as you can and uh get as most like the most out of it that you can i get 95 of it like at the lowest pressure you possibly can and then ramp it up towards the end and get everything else out like i'm just barely hitting one ton right now [Music] [Music] uh [ __ ] this flow made my balls drop i've never seen anything squirt like this before oh squeak now [Music] well at least on his like sound stream or sound files why you got to play spanish as just because his name's hotto what the [ __ ] what's up roots just barely hitting two tons now is division anger is near the higher pressures [Music] [Music] i cannot breathe okay now we're three and a half almost four tons low pressure low temperature low and slow remember you guys talk about this low and slow or hot and fast no do do zone she passing the doo doo zone you get dookie every strain has its own doodoo zone but a good starting zone is typically between like 180 185 you start hitting that doo-doo zone and then you come out of it around 195 200 usually increasing pressure up to 5. people want to know what psi that is i'm sure five tons on this press right well one one ton is 2000 psi this bag is a two and a half inch by four inch bag it's probably only three inches though um it was actually it's about four inches i can see right here so it's four by two and a half all right so here's that ten so if i'm at five that's ten thousand divided by ten so i'm at a thousand psi going up six times we're gonna cruise it on up to seven eight watch the flow see if it increases at all if not then we'll pull it bacon vape is giving you guys the [ __ ] honey terps straight from the flowers and nipples secreting the nectar straight to the bee that's me i process it for you turn it into the honey here you go [Music] going up to 10 tons 2 000 psi just give me the tips just give me the tips and i'll start the show i could take another dab of three more eleven thousand at 11 tons now 12. i think it's safe to say we've gotten everything out of there let's call it delicioso now if the yield is not what i'm expecting off of this [ __ ] we're going up in temperature i don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] how good this looks but we gotta test it i think because and we'll see what the bag starts with the back i feel a lot of weight on the parchment which is not a bad thing i don't care as long as i got out of the bag it's all about how this bag feels right nope it's all it's all gone there's nothing that is full extraction mode right there let's go [Music] [Music] well 182 is all right [Music] and i feel like i want more you must know expect 20 yield or less what you're talking about [Music] [Music] one remember you have to evaluate each and every strain they're going to react differently right now whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i feel like 182 is good but i feel like i'm gonna give it two more degrees go up to 184 okay just because i want it to hold a little bit more flow [Music] for flour it's about freshness you guys you guys flour flour flour you guys wanna talk about flour rosin i'll teach you guys some flour rosin who wants show of hands class class who wants some flower rosin tech while we watch the flows [Music] so nice stoney hell yeah okay okay calm down calm down no no spamming no spamming let's sit in the [ __ ] hallway kid you're on timeout um all right here's the thing you guys the trick with flower rosin is this i'm going to tell you and this is i always have a lot of unpopular opinions but i always have flame product so take it for what it's worth if you have to process flour the trick is my quick dry method okay making sure that it is fully bone crispy no fresh green fresh hay smell whatsoever okay pack it into bags as soon as it's done don't put it in turkey bags and burp it and blah blah blah blah i mean dry it on the branch until it is bone dry almost too dry you're not smoking it okay and despite what a lot of hashers like to perpetuate without actually having tested themselves okay humidity when you're pressing quality material does not [ __ ] help okay it does jack diddley ball sack squat for you i will tell any hasher i don't care how popular he is or how good his product looks i'll tell him to his face that's [ __ ] okay what matters is how fresh the buds are okay if you get it properly dried and you pack it into bags really fresh i mean like that night the next night right and you press it either really low and slow or kind of on the hotter end to 10 to 20 and fast okay and i guarantee you your yield is gonna be [ __ ] amazing humidity has jack diddly ball sack to do with it because i press my nugs as dry as possible i purposely avoid getting them too humid okay so it's about how fresh the butt is how well it was grown and then you process it at the proper temperature so that it doesn't sit there on the plates for too long and you will end up a really high quality product i kid you not i've tested it for myself all the different types of boveda packs curing it blah blah blah none of that matters what matters is that you press it you press it as soon as [ __ ] possible off the plants as soon as it's properly dried you know that's the key that's the key i've had hash rosin or i mean flower rosin look better than some people with hash rosin because of that that's all you gotta do [ __ ] humidity packs [ __ ] all the [ __ ] press it fresh it only matters if you if you're storing it and you need to keep the humidity proper cool you're not storing it you're pressing it within 48 hours minimum i mean maximum i press mine within like the first 24 hours if i'm gonna be pressing flour but i mean what do i know what do i know we're not even at a ton yet this shit's on fresh frozen this is not fresh frozen either this is dry this is sbnb quick dry method this is what i talk about collaboration with your farmers i taught him the tech so that he could bring me high quality material that was prepared the correct way and voila we have a winning combination that's how you collaborate with your farmer to make each other better man people don't understand flower rosin can be really really really clean and good and almost as good as hash rosin the only difference is you know the flower is going to give you a more in-depth complete entourage effect and the hash rosin's going to be a little bit lacking in that department but it's going to be a more pure taste a more pure concentration of flavor on just the purity side of things no not even a three week dry holy mole i'll do a video on my quick dry tech i know a lot of people want to know about it but i'll make a video i think i'm on top chat am i trolling i'm on top chat [Music] [Music] so thank you [Music] [Music] low and slow and high and fast don't always have the same yield it just depends on how good you are and if you can maneuver the material well enough if you find the appropriate temperatures for the low and slow then yeah you can really get a good yield out of it you know and really extract everything out of it but just by by nature and science you're going to get a slightly higher yield using a higher temperature because there's only so much that you can make up for by applying additional pressure the rest of it has to come from heat those are the only two factors at play here well if time heat um and pressure right so you have to find the the proper zone for the low and slow the proper zone for the hot and fast so that you maintain yield air quality on equal planes up to six and it's like what have you done increase the pressure up to about 10 tons here start getting everything else out of [Music] that [Music] earth wind and fire get her get her get her get her get down 12. 12 and a half calling it five four three two you know nasty mcnasty september to fill out 30th is don't forget to respond and make sure to count all kids living with you most of the year even if they aren't family members when babies and children are counted the programs that support them and their families get more of the federal fund you may need for the next 10 years is that the full extraction there's definitely nothing left in there [Music] uh i don't know full extractions i don't know yeah winston yes sir doing everything i can to extract the most out of her and uh see if i can't help him get a good indication of you know its potential there's no better way to find out the potential of a strain in my opinion than washing it and pressing it um in my opinion that gives you the ultimate ultimate experience of how good it can be really what's the yield what's the terps what's the [ __ ] you know what's it look like is it mostly terps is it is it a high thc content as well is it a good ratio i mean you can really understand a lot of that just by looking at it come off the plates by looking at it and feeling it as it comes out of the freeze dryer i mean there's just so much information there if you know what to look for as a hasher you know yeah that flower was [ __ ] on the money no doubt [Music] [Music] [Music] so oh no you lost a leg hold on get back on there that's fine we gotta give you there give me the sugar give me that [ __ ] baby looking [ __ ] fine as hell in there come here go find us over here give me some sugar baby very good from the time dude look at that [ __ ] flow [Music] so so i'm going to slightly disengage this press that's fine that's just the handle i'm going to go up and move my ram over just a touch because it's slightly off center there we go and then we'll keep the press going not advisable to do if you're not an experienced presser is [ __ ] restarting your press mid press don't do that a lot can go wrong but if you see something's wrong and you have the ability to fix it fix it don't settle for less that would have resulted in a less than optimal yield the bag may have potentially blown out something that needed to be corrected and corrected back on back on track man it comes to flow again yes look at that flow though back to our regularly tuned program go go hashing waterfalls ah no high pressure doesn't cause blowouts improper packing of the bag and increasing pressure too fast causes blowouts i press my flower up to about 16 to 17 tons on this press and my hash up to about 12 and i stop around 12 usually um laughs hey morty you're back okay i'll pull up the girls one monkey down and monkey number two what's up we're gonna be asleep uh nope she's not asleep but what and her cameras move but she's not standing up she's laying down so i'll give her a minute increasing pressure up seven times um angie it's time to take a nap lay down please oh good girl thank you increasing pressure up to 12 tons there's some good stuff in there still this one went up to 13 tons on this one give the good old countdown one two we're counting up because i'm high three four five we're done yes very sexy oh my god oh oh oh oh gosh goodness damn bone make a good team keep this up this is beautiful but what that yield do beautiful extraction full extraction is a good one the terp fiends will be happy your terps will get you high a little sneak peek got a little sneaky peeky oh yeah check some work [ __ ] real quick i usually don't have any meetings on mondays but i got to just double check that we're good angelica lay down it's time to take a nap please darn kids um ugh drippity drip drip drip we're literally at one ton right now just barely at one time don't believe me look so so we're up to three tons now i got really [ __ ] spaced for a second um [Music] [Music] oh [Music] let's go up to five times i think we got just about everything at that low uh pressure we're gonna get five times now give me my terps my need mass [Music] don't eat straight rosin i've talked about it before it's not good it's a it's a really concentrated essential oils if you get really good terpene content in there and it can burn you pretty good you can get chemical burn i put decarb rosin in my uh you know mouth and i tried a little straight glob off the press underneath the tongue doesn't feel good going up to uh seven eight oh i'm gooey mortgage

daddy products is that 184 uh [Music] the key to being a successful hasher is knowing what to look for when you're pressing and washing and knowing how to take those those signs into consideration and change certain aspects of what you might be doing at that time pressure temperature how long you're washing how rough you're washing how long you dry it for etc etcetera etcetera there's so many things that come into a play even before you pull it down off the plant so tuning in to the daily dabs we do this daily not pressing every day but we're depressing washing doing some grow room [ __ ] dabbing and talking industry tech all right 10 tons now um 12 times [Music] and we're good [Music] [Music] i'm just getting [ __ ] highs again i'm just getting [ __ ] high again [Music] [Music] please

time so you call that heart [Music] [Music] hmm that's how you do that and then go back through you give it the old finger banger ring fresh gloves squeeze fresh gloves if your glove starts sticking it's time to swap gloves but you can pull that finger really tight and then hold it there and i gotta get the rest of it off real easy damn cool we use the dab tool for the rest of it ready might as well hit it while it's ready it's nice and warm [ __ ] it let's get it [Music] so [Music] [Music] so now i'm going to swap up to use this end it's longer i can get further down so [Music] don't use no [ __ ] drills you guys jesus i've seen people using drills with the dab tool attachment stop knock that [ __ ] off put some [ __ ] elbow grease put some pride into your work and stop risking putting metal shavings into your rosin just please stop it i don't know who in here needs to hear that but stop it it's really worth it well i'm not gonna get it perfect right now i used a day or two at least push that down [Music] [Music] okay now we're going to take the rest no give me my glove back ah give me my glue back [Music] apparently that finger is too warm got most of it down now here's the trick we'll pop it nice and tight i'm going to turn my plates down to where's that 84 i'm just going to put it on 84 right now i don't feel like adjusting the singles but normally i'd go to like 80 but uh 84 is fine and then uh what we do then is once i see the plates um drop below like 150 i'll go ahead and put this whole jar on top of the plates and it'll allow everything in here to come down to the bottom and combine together so i hope that helped some of you guys show you my process you know what i'm saying rosin on my arm i know it was just a tiny little speck of that thca flaky [ __ ] i grabbed it excuse me no no no real like jar tech really it's just enough to um get it to settle down you know that's why i lower the temp and i wait to put it on the plates and then uh what else fire right here fire fire fire set this aside dab time yep this is a special dab it's a fresh dab with a full speck [Music] don't forget to give your damascus the weekly wipe down with uh with vegetable oil otherwise it will not hold its shine it will start to lose its uh shine luster finish oh [ __ ] balls [Music] quench it [Music] yo i'm gonna start keeping my damascus in a quench filled with [ __ ] iso fresh iso better holy [ __ ] now for the tradition around here for those of you that are new it is time in the stream uh the only way we can in the stream is to clean the spoon what's cleaning the spoon you know when you're done mixing up cookie dough your kid probably not nowadays i don't know if you still do it as an adult but you take the spoon what's left of it or the bowl and you scrape it up then you eat it right i don't know if anybody else ever did that but we're going to clean the spoon holy [ __ ] [ __ ] dab a row that's gonna be a big one i have cleaned the spoon would you agree that the spoon has been cleaned the spoon has been cleaned oh i'm not ready i'm not ready that is a one to two gram dab i guarantee it can we weigh this for confirmation yes we can i would really like to know [Music] i honestly feel like this will be a waste if i take a whole gram dab of this okay let's see what we got now okay tear that little piece of parchment [Music] out [Music] one point one i'm not going to be a jackass and waste this high high quality rosin i don't need a full [ __ ] granddad right now but i will take a half of that there is point six on here now so all of this going straight into the bang here not going to waste super high quality material like this i mean come on look at this so this one's just for the youtube because i'm gonna die i feel like i'm gonna need to sit down but you guys are on the chair so never mind [ __ ] it i'm gonna try and bring you guys a little closer and almost [ __ ] up the only big spicy chicken nope why isn't everything about going on a big dab they want to play a [ __ ] advertisement no no no has just the right amount of spice it's not hot magma in your mouth spicy but it gives you a little kick in the pants not a bad kick in the pants a perfectly spicy savory tasting kick in the pants from am pm get two big spicy chicken sandwiches for just four bucks am pm too much good stuff two for four dollars or one at regular price for 249 at participating locations for a limited time or while supplies last [Music] you haven't even used the shovel here um cheers everybody thanks for hanging out i hope you

wedding cake and this stuff i i pressed a quarter of it yesterday it came out amazing uh so i had to go back and get more so right on here we got two nut smasher 120 micron 14 gram bags and we're pressing this at 200 degrees on my crd 20 ton drip tech rosin press and if we're lucky we're going to get a chance to show you how it tilts and how it how it drips it right off the plates so here we go hope everybody is having a great thanksgiving hope you're staying safe staying medicated being good to each other out there it was a very low-key day just myself my wife and our and our kitty zina warrior today and watched a little football watched a little movies and now it's time to make a little video that's what we're doing today i hope everybody got some really good flowers some good concentrates whatever it is that you'd like to do with cannabis as far as medicating i hope that you found something that that works for you uh i definitely have this stuff is an indica heavy hybrid very endicoline and it is incredibly incredibly body heavy uh it will pouch-lock you so let's see here just let that heat start to work a little bit before i go up to full pressure let me know what you guys are hitting on in the comments please uh subscribe and and hit the thumbs up if you like this video and the videos that i put out uh bring this pressure up a little bit now see if we can get him to start sweating a little bit gotta keep adjusting the lighting as it as those plates come together it gets harder and harder to give you a good view of things so please bear with me as i readjust things a little bit here to ensure that you're still seeing what's going on now let's start with sweat already you see that the very front edge at the top of the left hand bag and right down at the bottom in the front edge of the right i'm bringing the pressure up gently don't want to risk a blowout at that medicine i'm going to bring it in a little closer for you see that look at that all right let's bring her up to pressure look at that material move look at it move as i add pressure to it look at that beautiful beautiful medicine continuing to bring it up that material still moving once i get where i feel is full pressure on this i will tilt this thing forward and we will see if any of it wants to drip i think we're good right there so bear with me here as i back out of this i'm gonna move the camera a little bit here so you can see what is going on lighting the face down here okay so here we go tilt it and see if it gives us anything there we go all right let's see if i'll get that a little bit better for you look at that medicine [Music] look at that that's what i'm talking about [Music] youth you know a lot of people say they don't like flower raws and they prefer hash rosin or whatever you know what that's fine but quite honestly i get really good clarity really good purity from pressing high quality high thc flower and i swear by it and it isn't just because i know that hash rosin is supposedly better but it's it's also a lot easier to produce i mean once you've made it into bubble hash pressing that into rosin is not all together that difficult and you get amazing yields because you're already pressing the concentrate however you press flower that takes some skill and take some serious skill to get right to get get it so you're not having contamination to get the kind of clarity and quality that that i am getting off this this is a real serious serious thing that i do uh and i specialize in pressing flower rosin i don't have access to enough material to do hash pa it is what it is you know but i make real real decent flower rods this is garbage in garbage out the better the material i get the better the rosins bigger the yields every time okay so let's tilt this back up now readjust our our shot back out we're gonna put this back over here get our lighting right back where it needs to be let's bear with me a moment now you seeing this are you watch this [Music] oh baby look at all that beautiful medicine tell me that isn't just amazing the smell is incredible so pull it off of here again bear with me as i readjust lighting and move things around here me uh get back down to what you need to see now okay so there we go oh yeah pucks came out perfectly no blowouts everything went where it was supposed to go that's what i'm talking about so we have that and in that so i am going to just kind of give you two times look yeah that's a good good shot right there let's see what's going on and there we go got a nice glass jar here i'm gonna tear it on the scale so i know [Music] 26.6 okay so this is my favorite tool this is a skillet skillet tools um you can get them in kits you can get them singly i prefer these i think that they uh they hold up well uh they work well for me and just look at that beautiful stable gorgeous rosin that just gathers up real nice real easy indication of quality right there oh my look at that wedding cake oh yeah get you some of that look at that now if you are a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient with a card and you bring me dispensary flower the higher the thc the better uh i will for free do this press it into google for you turning green into golden think of a lot worse ways to spend my time to tell you the truth this is therapeutic for me i love extracting it especially like medicated this is a lot of medicine right here picks right up hope i get it all in the jar i can tell you after pressing it yesterday waxes up beautifully overnight just at room temp room temperature cure in the jar waxes up amazingly excellent flavor immediate body effects from this strain for me okay your mileage may vary but quite honestly i am very very pleased with the results i'm getting from wedding cake and as long as it's around i will continue to get it just keeps producing okay look at that look at those highlights as you pull it across it's all gold copper and we got those and dripped off those two little jewels will just sit right there as we figure out what our yield was from this ounce all right quick calculation here okay here's here's the yield 32.81 32. minus the tare value of the container which is 26.6 6. and that gives us a yield of 6.2 grams and let's see i'll have to get back with you on the yield percentage because i shoot this video with my phone and unfortunately my calculator is on there too so we got 6.2 gram yield from 28 grams of wedding cake processed to 200 degrees through a 120 mesh micron screen thank you very much for joining me i want to thank crd for making excellent rosin presses at some of the best prices in the industry everybody's have a great thanksgiving stay safe stay medicated be good to each other look at those meds", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it guys and won't you tell the folks who you are I'm Josh I'm the processor here tops off campus for a little while longer this is my keys my process hey guys I'm Mike thanks for watching if you like to see please like share and subscribe we love you Josh", "sthSo86p8Gk": "my folks got a little squishy poo my magic there's your all track test for the day folks", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer pressure thanks for tuning in [Music]", "6klJ1KfIQEk": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps and today on this very windy day we're going to be checking out some more affordable rising guys so yeah like i like i said in the title this is another one of the cheap roses this is the lowell herb co lemonade aged cured rosin so this is about 55 a gram out the door and like i said for rosin it's pretty cheap so i'm not sure if you guys seen the video yet maybe you have or maybe you haven't released it but there is another cheap brand of rosin called uh honey butter and they make some great stuff so um gonna see if this can top that so the honey butter rosin is 45 dollars that's 55 and rather normally floats around 80 to like 90 bucks a gram so very expensive normal uh you know in any normal circumstance so yeah hopefully these you know products encourage more affordable rosin to come out so let's take a look at the stats shall we this is the pink lemonade hq rosin once again uh here's the backing for y'all right there just in case uh it didn't it doesn't focus this is the stats 656 percent thc uh 1.65 milligrams of cbd so that's probably about uh 1.6 uh cbd there uh i don't think yeah we're not seeing too much of yeah no there's no cannabinoid percentage here but i do like the packaging of this this box is super sturdy like listen to that it closes like that it feels like uh like a jewelry box you know when you open this thing up if you feel like a little bit like royalty or i guess a little fancy maybe not royalty is the right word but yeah so this is the cured rosin that is inside and it smells phenomenal guys it smells a lot like flour of course like most rosin does and it's got a really really nice soury cut heart kick to that smell so a lot a lot on the nose for uh you know that pink lemonade name you know you like you like having that uh that sourness of course from the limonene and a little bit of sweet tartness there from whatever wherever else that might come from sorry guys i'm only really familiar with limonene as a profile but yeah we're gonna take a fat glob boys a fat glob right there and then i'm gonna let you guys know you know how it feels when i'm tasting all that good [ __ ] so cheers [Music] hmm oh uh [Music] it's still quite a bit to go here boys whoo try to finish it on one rip so i didn't finish it there it is that should be the last of it [Music] okay okay so what i'm tasting and what i'm feeling so i'm going over the taste before it tastes a lot sweet or not a lot sweet a lot of that like limony kind of uh you know citrusy kind of limey kind of like or a lemony flavor yellow tininess at the end there with the slight tones of sweetness not too bad on the taste actually you know like i said it tastes a lot like smoking flour so i imagine excuse me so i imagine this is how the pink lemonade strain you know tastes now like terms of potency this thing definitely hits hard you know a lot of people see aged or or aged cured silver they you know they see cured resin cured sauce all that stuff and they just automatically assume it's old weed and you know that's right in some regards but not really you know like hearing something doesn't necessarily make it worse or old you know i mean i you know well don't say old because technically curing something you know the product is going to be older than when it was fresh but you know it's curing something isn't bad at all i used to love curing my nuts you know keeping me in the jar for a little bit longer letting them lose a little bit more of that moisture just so they can dense up more and get to uh a kind of like i was about to say consistency but you know a kind of level of you know that i like you know like i like then snugs with a little bit of moisture i don't like it too moist you know i don't want to touch it and feel kind of like feel it kind of wet i like it when it's a little dry there's some bounce to it but um not not too much uh fresh wet kind of smell on there that's my preference though but i do think that sometimes uh you know fresh flour hits a little bit harder than uh cured flour but honestly guys it really is dependent on the strength yeah but yeah in terms of don't see guys this is this is a hybrid first this is hybrid as it says on the box and um i don't know if it leans anywhere uh specifically you know whether it's leaning towards sativa or indica uh right now this isn't the first time i've added this you know i've had in a few other videos maybe you guys have seen those maybe you haven't but um yeah this it's uh it's a little it's always been a little bit rough for me to decide what this one is i feel like it's because the lemony cup taste throws me off and i start thinking oh it's a sativa but like you know the effects get get me kind of stuck so like i just feel like you're not gonna be going out to smoke with other people or hang out with people who don't care if you're loaded i don't know you should go hit this before going outside and starting your day you definitely could get away with it if you got used to the high but me i think i'd like to be a homebody with what i'm dabbing on this one so without further ado i'll take one last hit for you guys and uh yeah so this one isn't as big as the last club because guys i can't lie i'm pretty faded right now but uh we're gonna go ahead and take one last one here for the video and i hope you guys can join me so get the bulls pack some dabs ready get your carpet or you know smoke up that joint and uh cheers boys just drop that in all right here we go all right thanks guys for joining me for yet another video and i hope you guys join me for yet another hit cheers hold on still a little bit more in there sometimes i miss my old rig you know dabbing the old way for those of you who are curious i know i get that question a lot but um you know like i said i'm just waiting to get a new rig and then i'll probably be dabbing again on a banner because i have turp pearls and all that stuff that i should be using okay yeah that's about i'm gonna do it for the video so once again our flavor profile we have here it's a little sweet a lot of that you know limonene kind of lemon lemony citrus piney um honestly it's really delicious you know like any rosin this tastes a lot like uh flour would taste i think you know in terms of its taste you know because flour has a distinct taste when you're smoking it then a concentrate does you know sometimes concentrates have their own kind of taste and i feel like that's just because uh when you extract something down to its very like essence like most concentrates pretty much are you're like you're gonna lose some stuff you know there's definitely some uh compounds in flour that make it taste more you know more distinctly um yeah and uh in terms of potency well this is a hybrid you know i did get i am i do feel kind of like a tv high like in the upper area but um you know i could definitely fall asleep off this too if i laid down or if i uh you know didn't want to do anything this would be a great strain as well i feel like this is a good hybrid because like i said i can't really tell where it lies but you know me personally i feel like it's laying laying there on the indica more side but um yeah the way this is hitting me is more like a 50 50 split i feel like i'm just saying indica just because i like indigo but yeah thanks for watching guys and if you enjoyed this one please like comment subscribe hit that notification bell all that good stuff please i would love to see you guys again on another video see you guys later peace out peace", "sZmL9nmBD6c": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's a point eight eight twenty eight is what actually the poem is gonna leave [Music] I get

with star shining a total ban against which I agree yeah a presence in high grade this is brought a resin ranch GMO so right now he's preparing the bag yeah [Music] ten little rap on it screw this heavy really productive oh this is abstaining thinking to the truth [Music] just test the speed nicely the press is still have enough in the speed of the plate clothing there we go this is dupe I'm

transform the center that's it oh it's some lamb lamb wiggity wow you guys really you can't really even see it on the paper there are spots in the tape help me see the light are you falling on Tosh late look go eliminate some time for Hannah oh well yeah yeah totally now you can see those little squares here I figured it was worth its buy the expensive what can i yeah bamm-bamm spaghetti land no it's all right cooled off a bit now collect it up no but you just do right off the bat just take that one gram you're talking about mm-hmm put it right over yeah off these rips that's a purest of the pure 100 scale you do what I say I have to do a second pressing not focusing on very well it tried to focus on it for a second yeah it goes in and out I got to figure out what it's focused thing is the giving it doesn't have it one that you can choose but I found it and that's perfect well it's so good that you're and yeah it's just serious oh yeah that's a good view of it you sure you just saying have smellivision order oh man oh wow the odor of this Rand Paul mouth dude whoo oh no oh my baby sure of it just like that that stage Nicholas pull that off a bit a little bit simply a 50% yield I'm sorry to say oh oh there's still more yeah boom there you go that's like a dream well I'm curious because if but like it should be one third of the ratio just cuz this is gonna end up being like super small amount of diamonds who want to get a fatty amount or like an even ratio or some Island right now what bank with some some good amount so it's like a pretty deep sea some diamonds and then like even it might be less than I have a grandma last time today know why empresa nice oh there you go oh well then gold out then some ranch farmers and definitely farming that resident whether that's fire two grams that's pretty good there was what was it on the way through 70 yeah that's two point seven half that's like stir-crazy out Jesus 77% whopping their services in Wildman oh so yeah I don't know what the ratio I guess would be one still do this one again of a higher temp oh yeah turn it up right now yeah so yeah we got Graham to make the goods out of those may not be the better yet okay yeah guys so you're getting exactly you know one young put these into this much it's really easy Matt yeah it'll be all right calculated okay so I'm really anxious to fight at this stuff yeah [Music] oh gosh here's a little trick associated to one if you lock your fingers you just take the glove off your finger [Music] yeah pretty honking way back [Music] hit honestly though we don't look that much better than his hash I mean I said there's more definition Oh Barry speaking yeah now watch week watching the watch walking with the [ __ ] oh okay there was very much done with him really [ __ ] activated now the bird about ten minutes oh really right there I thought yeah yeah that's literally the most gorgeous [ __ ] time the second squish real quick here 180 degrees now Wolverton 160 oh nice all that in just one blow real oh I figured this would have to go hi yeah but maybe we should have no such is who fear why rural Oh so he said why do you whip it for consistency people are commenting hell yeah well size micron byesies I believe we're using 25 right well I'm not sure what size micron bags of the hash to use there but 25 microns 92 149 there you go I know that and then yeah my silkscreen here's 25 micron which is a little lower than you really need to go for doing hash rosin 37 is my usual but this stuff is really I just makes it really clean and then it's also double usable uh EE used as the thing that we wrap the rosin back into to make the HCA extract out of it the [ __ ] daddy so thanks and then yeah Emily and a weapon it does it just kind of kicks in the nucleation process which helps to cause it to butter or change consistencies which you need it to be in that kind of tacky ER consistency or less less messy before you can actually make it into the THC a effectively otherwise most of it was booze out of the bag this one was on with right this is what the first grand that we didn't live yet this is the second ground that you whipped on camera and writing it so you can see the difference between the two clearly this one was just whipped for it you know a little while that one it was not whipped at all looks beautiful says hell yeah focus three people in the house now yeah those look [ __ ] beautiful thank you sir sup neighbors so these guys following Instagram resin ranch extraction yeah they know what they're doing yeah this is hella dense split in the house starting yeah gotta know they're easier than love well my limiting factors are out of my hands you know if people are knowing the product and they're isolating it clean methods then most pretty much just skate by on this end serious you know thank you John 4411 thank you very much this is donated lemon start out Thank You Man that's [ __ ] awesome when life gives you lemons you squish them muhfuckas into some dank but yet so one form this is kind of a nice little squarish shape book yeah and get it butter in the form that we want to wrap it in the final bag well that's the wait until the father to do that but you can get that shape oh dude Thank You lab max flashier than that [ __ ] yeah bro just enabling this little infants of it yeah well we gonna have some lemonade oh that is that fresh hmm gonna get myself a second time remember it's still beautiful color oh wow yeah it's still clear yeah how are you playing oh my god yeah I get the time yeah yeah whoo garlic comes out in 2021 I guess forget that so what'd you guys think can unicorn swim - or just fly the thoughts was a rosin master as the rosin teenage ones are the thoughts that keep you up at night yeah I mean obviously they can breathe in outer space but so that yeah of course they can swim in cool BAM there's the second press meat usually makes it a darker color but it's still yeah it's totally fun that's the same way oh my god we ready to go try to have with that yeah as I was thinking yeah [ __ ] yeah I know if we can just shut this down now it's like make that into some tea later or something no she should be there awesome dude yo thank you a third squish light but I mean that's fearful if you want to or anything but yo thank you for this [ __ ] thing we'll do whatever so parts you come on soon cool fine y'all have a good night bhai de Cerio thank you guys for tuning it well yeah [Music]", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "3RnV-yDwYco": "yo yo here we go check this out it's my cold room they're my babies right over there Terminator chirp

take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it

out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot I already forgot what this one is again that's the coach tasted positive and he's more paper towels real quick cuz my house got so high I forgot to clean the [ __ ] banger after the last job that's [ __ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to grab another roll of paper towels real quick [Music] [Music] damn [ __ ] oh yeah [Music] oh [ __ ] [Music] in the filter [Music] oh Jesus son 525 that is a very very high [ __ ] gasps Jesus [Music] [Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with this I can go three eighty and still get clouds [Music] you need some sort of cloud [Music] all right [Music] my emails from 7-10 coils and you have promo codes with them but up go my man go in the house [Music] did I even bring the [ __ ] Paper Towns yeah I did oh yeah okay don't really need to take another dad titanium holy [ __ ] [ __ ] son if you don't swap that over some glass you can get like a full email kit for around in 250 years [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] that olive oil will get you bro oh alright you [ __ ] I'd have been dying for this dad for some reason or she dies or more yeah I got ahold of the giveaway winner and he commented all over my YouTube video and everything that following morning Jesus sweet baby Jesus my nose is already like crying thinking about these Turks [Music] Oh titanium is not 2008 oh my gosh bro oh [ __ ] that's funny I've already got throat tickle mmm take him to any dab my throats already got that little scorch to it oh but I'm a man up and finishing [Music] [Music] [Music] we [Music] that's how you beast down and down right there [Music] fire [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'll have a lot of patience going back up there to deal with kids right now oh yeah [Music] cruising today today is flying by I feel like I woke up two hours ago [ __ ] took five dives I blinked and boom it's already about four here had to clean that tonight [Music] just blowing our play too much [Music] the function on Agentry is crazy [Music] so FPV ahead I wasn't enough cloud for you where are these jars just ridiculous [Music] [Music] [Music] well can't even open it with one hand [Music] you're saying horrible with the [ __ ] up-close [Music] so so good [Music] this lighting is any different was natural lighting appear it's that cookie dough [Music] all right you guys [Music] I'll catch you guys on the next one I'm gonna call it a night I had a bunch of other [ __ ] I gotta get around to these", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all

off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this

bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch on the outside i could take so i don't have to dip into the jar or anything i'm i'm weird right now you're like call that fresh press man i wish i'll give you a melt so like wood that's runs wow wow that flavor is intense now that i haven't dabbed it in a while in a while holy [ __ ] it is intense um hitter hitter hitter hitter hitter goodness q-tip foreign all right fire all right here we go we're gonna collect the rest uh i don't have a tool i can even stick

i could [Music] oh [Music] wow [Music] took a little warm took it at 5.25 [Music]", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "q9oZhsc3gd4": "hey it's found at roughout studios and welcome to part two of our special series of cannabis expert aching dry ice Keefe turning it to rosin and then to e juice in this part 2 we're going to be taking our dry-ice Keef and then we're going to press it into rosin what you're going to need to do that is you're going to need some micron bags we're using 25 micron screen bags those are the ones that came with in my press rosin press we're using the dry ice key from our last video we'll be using some parchment paper and the my press solvent list machine you can pick that up at my rods and press calm and save money with the code roughhouse the first up is going to be to load the micron bags this could be kind of a tedious process and it helps if you freeze your material first so we have frozen that Keef and it makes it a lot more sandy and easy to deal with and less sticky and we're taking about two grams of our Keef and we're going to put it into our 25 micron bag now I got my cameraman to help out a little bit because it was a little bit tedious but it found the easiest way was to kind of spoon it in and then we're going to just kind of tamp it down lightly in the bag to just sort of evenly distribute it we're not like jamming get into or anything like that just sort of kind of make it even across the bag as much as possible okay so now we're going to go ahead and fold and trim and seal it the plates on this machine are square so we're going to try to keep it as sort of a square shape as possible and then I'm taking the back of a grinder and just sort of very gently just pressing it flattening it out just trying to get it to distribute evenly across it and also to sort of discover where seam is going to be and in that case I'm going to go ahead and trim off some of the excess bag so I'll have enough to fold over but I don't really need it to fold over all the way because the bag can trap some of the rosin and then you could also use the machine if you want before it's heated up and I press it down that just kind of sealed a corner of your bag to get a harder seal there don't squeeze the rosin or the kief itself but just the edge and then you can fold it over it's a little easier okay now we're moving on to the next up we're going to actually press the rosin I'm using it inside of a doubled parchment paper just so we don't have any blowouts or anything and then I'm sliding it in right into the center of the press we're we're heating at 180 degrees Fahrenheit that's we're gonna press that and it's all the way up to the hundred eighty degree heat just about there are two degrees away so we're gonna go ahead and start closing that down now instead of just clamping it all the way down originally what we're going to do is for about a minute and a half we're just going to like to let the press barely touch it just to distribute the heat and then after about in a minute and a half or so then we're going to go ahead and close it all the way down for the remaining two to two and a half minutes of the press now we're gonna go end up pressing this for about four minutes at 180 degrees and we're leaving the temperature the same the whole time after about two and a half minutes or so it starts to ooze out and come see after three minutes or so is oozing out the side in the backs and just a few seconds short of four minutes we're gonna go ahead and pull that open you can see they always love these shots here of pulling the paper back and seeing what you have in there and this really nice looking good amount of yield in there and just the smell I know you can't smell it in the video but it just had a really great smell and the consistency is really nice as well sort of tacky and sort of thick all right so it's looking really good and so now we're gonna chill it before we scrape it I've had that for a couple of minutes inside of a little cold pack just sandwiched between the cold pack chilling and you can see the little pieces of it flying off as it has turned into a shatter now really nice consistency here and also a really nice taste really looking forward to the next episode where we're going to take this and turning it into a juice now if you don't have a press I'd like to check out a really good one please check out my rosin press comm they have a really awesome press a great design it's lightweight weighs less than 15 pounds it's very portable and you can get it at a good price at a discount with a code ruffhouse and the checkout so again the thanks to my rosin press comm for setting up and sponsoring this video and I could just gonna take a second here just finish collecting this up it always so much fun I'm collecting up your rosin when you've done it it's kind of a most fun part of it it's just getting all of the goo together you see there we've got almost seven tenths of a gram there that's the perfect amount that we're going to need to make our ejuice so be sure to stay tuned to roughout studios because we're going to be using that Terps USA terpenes to make this EGS in the next episode so also be sure to visit roughhouse studios.com for hundreds of cannabis torture videos made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "2Qk9HH3Qslc": "[Music] hey guys it's Eric from peer pressure thanks for tuning in we're gonna be checking out some punch-drunk live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it

now we're using the my press portable rosin press today they're also a sponsor of Raphael studios if you use the code roughhouse at my rosin press calm you'll get an exclusive discount and also you'll be helping to support Rafal studios here's what you'll need to do this you would need a rosin press of course and you'll need some high CBD hemp we'll talk more about that in a second you need some parchment paper a pollen press a cold pack that you'll want to freeze in advance you need a scraper tool we use that to scrape up the oil at the end and also a scale now when it comes to the materials what you want is to probably get hemp the hip is high CBD in this case it is 16.7 6% which is really high in CBD and it has a 0.23% of THC very lows to eat THC so this would be good for our purposes the first step is going to be to preheat the press we're going to use a pretty high temperature of 220 degrees Fahrenheit that's higher than I would normally use for cannabis for this experiment today we're going to be pressing 2 grand pressing and then a 1 gram pressing so first you'll want to weigh out your head and then you will put it into the pollen press and then you add in the weights and then some pollen presses have a little t-bar this is just a simple screw together on both sides but you screw together really tightly as tightly as you can and then when you press it out you have a nice concise puck that'll press a lot more efficiently now you want to take that puck and you want to place it in your parchment paper I would recommend using 2 layers I'm only using one in this demonstration but that's not how I know you need probably to use 2 because it can bleed through because it's a real hot temperature and then once you have your puck centered in the parchment we're going to now place it in the press and you're also going to Center it and depress and now we're going to what I call a pre press and then over the next say 30 to maybe 45 seconds we're going to be slowly lowering the lever adding a little bit more pressure every few seconds and not to a fully press it yet but just this is to allow the heat to distribute through so for about 30 seconds we're going to pre press and let that heat fill all the way through from top to bottom on that after the 30 seconds or 45 seconds you're going to finally close down the lever and give it a full press after about 30 seconds or so of that you'll start to see the hemp oil protruding it from around the edges and it'll bubble and run and you'll want to leave this on full press for one to two minutes because we're using a high temperature you don't want to go too long because you don't want to burn off all your terpenes but it is more tolerant than cannabis is and you can see we got a really good yield there so the next step is the cooling step and normally I would have not opened it up and removed the puck to show the camera like I did a second ago I would have taken it directly from the press and put it right until they folded over a compressed bag like you see there and let it chill for about one minute and what that will do is to slow down the heating process and to preserve our curve beans in our flavor profile the next step is to scrape it off and collect it I find doing that with the compress as a backing to the paper makes it a lot easier to remove the oil and you see I garnered about 11 percent yield on that first pressing with the 2 grams then I pressed a 1 gram pressing of the same hip and I can see now I did I have that less of a yield but with one grandma have a better percentage of a yield and in fact on that one I got just at 17% yield a really great deal so it's really happy with the way that my press did it pressing the CBDs if you'd like to purchase one please

"while medical cannabis is already available in more than half of American states and recreational cannabis nears its cusp of national legalization ensuring that the weed you buy from your local dispensary is as potent and as pure as advertised is still a bit of a tricky proposition especially when it comes to shopping for concentrate when you're buying flowers themselves you can check for the presence of chirping crystals on the surface for at least a rough estimation of its potency and give it a quick sniff to clue in on how it will likely taste but when it comes to concentrates you're generally at the mercy of the person behind the counter to set you straight of course if that sounds like a bit of a bum deal you can always make your own and that's where the rosin bomb rocket comes in this 13 pound tabletop rosin press is designed specifically to convert the THC crystals present on the surface of cannabis flowers into a solvent les dabble hash it does us in the same manner in which diamonds are formed within the Earth's interior through a combination of heat and pressure it's super easy to use just plug in the press turn it on and wait for it to heat up to around 210 degrees Fahrenheit while that's happening you just need to take the biggest stinkiest stickiest nug of cannabis that you can get your hands on and wrap it in a piece of heavy-duty parchment paper once the press is sufficiently hot separate the press plates wide enough to fit the paper wrap nug between them and then press the plates back together over the next two minutes or so the combination of heat and pressure will liquefy the rosin causing it to flow out of the flower and onto the parchment after you've extracted the rosin just wait five minutes for it to cool and coagulate then boom you've got yourself some concentrated resin which can then be scraped together and used in whatever dabbing method you prefer whether that's vaping it straight with a peak or crumbling it into a joint or over a bowl of green to give it a THC rich kick while the rocket is much quieter than similar presses that rely on hydraulics for pressure rather than its electric motor it is purpose-built for home use so don't think that you're gonna be able to start your own hash production business just because you happen to pick one of these up the other stumbling point for the rocket is its price this machine will set you back a solid six hundred dollars roughly the price of a mid-ranged average what's more you can achieve the same general results albeit with a much lower level of accuracy with a standard laundry iron or hair straighteners and some wax paper still if you're serious about your dabs or just don't trust the man with your hash stash the rosin balm rocket is worth a look",

the heat start to uh get in that butt a little bit right just slowly press down on it let that heat soak in to warm it all up get those terpenes all nice and flowing right once you get that down about 30 40 seconds then you're gonna crank her down alexa set a timer for three minutes all right let's see you see her starting to milk up over there oh yeah now i rehydrated this bud uh with the of course with the raw hydro stone you guys know how i do it rawhide just done for about four and a half hours i think it was and uh it felt it about right where it needed to be at it could have been in

this is priced at 190 degrees 160 micron bag by rosin evolution bags if you look up here is the rosin evolution logo so yeah that's what the bags is if you're interested you can get them on instagram they're not too uh they're not too bad of course it is a lighter temperature so you're not going to see her squirt or get any kind of drippage like last time but you will it will butter up almost sugar up instantly as you can see i can already start seeing now this is the most boring part about the video i just sitting here watching it for the next three minutes see she's starting to do

seven eight or nine so we're at 29.29 right there and that's that's uh just the first press and we still got a little bit right there as you guys can see and uh we still got that plucked up and uh put it in the pot and see what we got total so yeah good good guild so far [Music] you", "zOxoyfpTVeQ": "[Music] alright guys I'm gonna go in here I'm gonna try to get some awesome that my guy on Instagram makes Greg 17 Greg he's got the seventh in between the Greg definitely is gonna count the follow right there i'ma go up in there tried to get some of that rosin and I may get some other things too that you guys like I said we'll see in the future and we'll see what they got alright I got a couple different things here as you can see I've got a couple of pre-rolls I've got a live rosin as well which is one of the main reasons I went by jungle boys I wanted to try their live rosin batter which Greg 7/10 Greg he makes that it makes a lot of it and you can follow him on Instagram with the 7th in between the Greg and that's how I even find him on Instagram an amazing page that guy is just absolutely way ahead of anything in this industry he's more than an expert that's for sure so I had to pick up some of that you got jungle boys full mouth jungle boys rosin jungle boys and jungle boys clothing that's all their pages and of course Greg and I'll mention a couple other ones down in the description for you guys to follow first of all let's look at the prices I we got the joints right here and as you can see there are $12 a piece including the tax so I mean they're lower a dollar cheaper than the joints we got back home and that's here in LA now there bud is a little bit more expensive I have that on another video for you guys if you're buying recreational it's 26 dollars a gram so I just got some pretty rolls right here and I've already actually smoked that Topanga Canyon that was just an amazing experience right there it was like great be I see with like a hint of like almost mint and it was it was really amazing so I already smoked that one and I'm gonna probably smoke the jungle cake in the morning twenty nine percent THC 291 milligrams total their strains are really high like that though they come in and extremely high some of them do now I smoked another one out here the last time though mimosa that was only like 16 percent and it was actually one of the better strains I smoked so twenty-nine percent on that one we also have cookies and cream and this one is coming in at 27 percent 277 milligrams in that 135 percent total cannabinoids Topanga Canyon yeah that one I just smoked was nice 25 percent it's that was like a in akadama net hybrid it was a oh gee Topanga Canyon oh gee really good really good I was like a great be gassy skunky with a hint of mint almost does what I would have to say describe that like and the other thing we got is the live rosin and that is a hundred and ten dollars a gram now we don't quite have anything like this back home and of course I can't really you know compare this to back home but I had to get some of that it's a hundred and ten dollars a gram recreational and I think it was a hundred dollars a gram medical I could be wrong on that price but it was one hundred and ten dollars for me including tax recreational for for this one gram right here", "N3vDm9HXWOU": "welcome back to turkey eyes in today's episode we're going to be pressing one ounce of fresh frozen full plan ice water hash we get big yields using the directional flow method as well as show you how I butter the rosin after being pressed [Music] let's go over the items we're going to be using during this week's episode we're going to need parchment paper any brand will do I always go with the unbleached version pressing bags I ordered these online in a custom size to fit my pressing plates perfectly allowing me to maximize the amount that can be pressed at a single time as for micron science I go with the 37 micron because I mainly deal with ice water hash or teeth if you're going to be pressing flour but with ninety micron and I always remember to double bag your product a couple Dobb tools and a set of tweezers lastly obviously the material I'll be pressing you already know from the title we're going to be doing a single press of one ounce the material I'll be pressing is fresh frozen ice water hash this was from one of my previous grows it's a blend of green crack barber bud and Harley Quinn bx4 this is also material that's been freeze-dried I'll be doing a video shortly covering how I made the ice water hash and using my freeze dryer so be sure to hit that subscribe button you can notified when that gets posted as you can see the material is getting pretty sticky once it comes out of the fridge making it very difficult to talk the pressing baked properly [Music] using one of my job tools I packed though ice-water house down into the bag as evenly as possible my hand I give it a good pre-press evening out the material as best as I can at this point the ice water hash has already become warm and it's very sticky not allowing it to be moved around much in the bag [Music] for today's press we're going to be utilizing the directional flow method a benefit of using it is that it allows you to watch the flow during the press you can see the flow from start to finish allowing you to adjust the variables accordingly this becomes very helpful at all stages as you're about to see I forgot to double bag my material which resulted in my bag being unfolded squishing out the ice water hash out the one end this became noticeable immediately allowing me to stop the press right away unfortunately I forgot to record me collecting the material and just putting a second bag over the other [Music] [Music] I stopped the first pressed short not noticing the flow of the rosin still happening [Music] I then folded the pressing bag in half and did a second press giving additional amount of yield [Music] letting the freshly pressed live hash rasa sit for a few minutes allow it to cool carving the rosin eyelet cooler temperature helps with a collection of it using a long-handled dab tool makes the collection of the rosin very easy since the second press was very short I'm going to collect all the rosin together after collecting it all into one patty I like to put it into a glass jar it's process butters the rosin to texture I find more appealing [Music] I simply put the glass shard in between the two plates with the lid tightly screwed on and let it sit for about one hour at 150 degrees Fahrenheit then I open the jar stir the rose and whip it around mix it up place it back in between the plates I had a hundred degrees Fahrenheit for ten hours after the ten hours I collect the rosin out of the jar and place it into a storage container if you enjoyed this video don't forget to hit that like button [Music]", "gchd4DQLVa8": "what up guys welcome back to the gy o channel your cushko today just gonna show you guys a quick trick this is that schism here that we got from our scissors scraping our scissors while we were trimming and I mean you can do a lot of things with it but I'm gonna just show you a simple way for most people at home to turn it into some gold and then I'll show you how much I get instead of using it as a bowl top or we're just gonna press it into rosin I got me a rosin pouch I showed you guys in the video how to make the most out of your waist with your trim just buy some silk at like jo-ann's fabric make sure it's you know the sterile bleach is clean white kind and you can buy this real cheap compared to buying rosin bags and make as many of them as you want with a sewing machine and then a cheap little 9 dollar hair straightener I could use a t-shirt press or the big rosin press but just to show you guys at home how easy it is we'll use this cheap one I used for years it gives you a little better control anyway so you can see your product but I'm gonna press out this 2.9 grams right here I got a scale and my bag and we'll see what it weighs up to when it's done and what it looks like okay so there it is I pressed it five times on the paper just by folding a sheet of parchment in half and then running it long ways so you can keep pressing it so this was the very first press this was the second press third fourth and final fifth press and I dried and cured my scissor hash and just like I would pot to make sure didn't mold and then I put it in a clean bag and I progressively pressed with more and more time and longer and longer presses until it was done and the material became pretty dry in the bag it still got a little stickiness to it and if you want you could throw those in solvents to run get your return out of them as you clean them and then run the solvent but for me I just like to do it like this it's real simple and easy fast it only took me a minute go ahead and pull it off and then we'll see what kind of weight we get out of it all right I did the best I could clean it up let's see what we get just out of curiosity with the sucker tear out and it came out to one gram so we got about one-third returns which isn't too bad but there's a couple of different things you can do with this you could tap e-tec it which'll turn it really nice and white I'll show you guys how that looks and then you can also freeze it put it make it into a long stick freeze it and then microplane it into a fine powder which will be a full melt beach sand but that's a couple of different things you can do right now I'll show you guys the taffy tap technique all right you guys could see it now by whipping it it'll turn it really creamy like this it's dark in the dark spots cuz it's thick but if you guys got a ball and just keep you put your vinyl gloves on you heat it up with your hand you just keep stretching it apart pretty soon it'll turn really really white I'll show you guys what it looks like when it gets all done alright so I'm pretty much done playing with it but what it does is it gives it a little even consistency it's really hard to zoom in in here and it makes it really nice and light colored and that's a thick blob but I'm gonna go ahead and dab on I just wanted to show you guys quick little trick give you some good product plus you guys should smell this it increases the smell big-time like super big-time by heating it up slightly through friction it creates more Terk smell as well as a improves quality of the you make sure that it dries good by airing it out like that there it is all right guys have a good one be sure to LIKE subscribe follow we got a bunch of new videos coming up", "0peKkiKvhH4": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

stuff and then he even also applied it to the flower that i had as well which it wasn't even supposed to be applied to it but he just gave it to me along with the rest of that stuff so i do want to

she's looking very saucy saucy but more like you know nice and buttery and light in color golden she's she's beautiful she smells good really good it's funny because this is gmo like the other the gmo and the garlic breath as you could tell you kind of just get an idea of the kind of strains that i like at least so that's what she's looking like for 50 bucks of some premium top tier kind of from a brand that's good you know top tier [ __ ] can't beat it cannot beat it so we're gonna go ahead and pack us up a dab of this and get going for the day because we obviously still haven't smoked a joint left but oh yeah you guys already know comment like subscribe any uh products you want to see or that you know of that you're familiar with and want to see checked out leave them down below and let me know we out thought i was gonna end it but honestly i figured i'll go ahead and give you guys the preview of the dab itself go ahead and take it and take it with you with y'all but it's not like they're shooting somebody out there that's probably the garbage that they're tossing somebody's doing something in the dumpster or something breaking down some kind of crap but the gmo so cheers to everyone out there that's smoking and talking with us this stuff tastes man just fantastic as well so i always recommend grabbing any olio or 710 labs that you can get your hands on if you're ever out there for sure don't ever pass it up squadly a1 gotta get the q-tips on deck for all my e-rig users you know what's good also let me know down below what you guys think you prefer carla or peek puffco let me know and is it worth getting the pro i'm thinking about moving up but i haven't made i haven't made the decision yet i haven't pulled the trigger so i'm pretty content with this the regular one it works pretty good for now so that's the olio again do not snooze or pass up on any although you ever see if you can afford it and want to buy some it's worth it i definitely recommend getting some but yeah let me know what you guys's thoughts our comments are on like whether you believe the puffco peak is more your thing or the card of magnus you're the cardo mega the carter the focus card uh just got me high already talking about history and [ __ ] [ __ ] uh yeah let me know if the focus card or the puffco peaker you know would you prefer song again like comment subscribe and we out",

going to be taking a bunch of trim and lar from a recent harvest and I'm going to be showing you how I go about making some simple safe solving this crisis if hash [Music] there's many different ways that go about taking care of your trim in life and this is simply just one of them and by no means of mine expert I'm just going to show you what I do in terms of sifting my trim and life to further extract the cannabinoids just to get as much as I can out of the plant with that being said I'm going to leave a link down below to a video with bubbleman and D for 20k going over the dry sipping process and in that one particular video they really do go over a lot of key points so I do recommend watching that video as well after you watch this video of course guys come on now when it comes to dry sipping trim lar for actual flowers dries in the name so make sure the material you're using is dry enough otherwise the trichomes they won't fall off the plant matter as easily now I'm using trim and lar from a recent harvest and after hang-drying the flowers for 10 old days I trimmed the flowers up and place them into jars for curing and I left all the trim and larf from the harvest on these screens to further dry I had it on the screens for over a week before placing into a freezer bag and storing the trim in the freezer for future use now on top of making sure the material is dry enough to dry sift also ensure your material is as cold as you can get it during the process of sifting the cold temperatures causes the trichomes to become brittle and more liable to break off the plant so it's best to store your material in the freezer right before getting ready to sift it try to set up your work area for sifting in a cold environment I'm using my basement and I live in Canada where it's currently minus 12 outside and my basement is sitting around twelve degrees Celsius or about 55 Fahrenheit if you happen to have a garage or perhaps a spot outside that is blocked off from the wind you may want to put on a jacket and take your sift area outside this way you can achieve the best yields from your trim [Music] now let's talk zip screens so each zip screen has a different mesh count which allows different size materials to pass through your top screens are classified as you're working screens and the top screen I'm using is the ninety lines per inch this is the main screen you're gonna be working all the material over it the trichomes will be breaking off and falling through to the next screen which is the hundred and ten lines per inch this screen is an important one because it's going to continue to allow the trichome heads to pass through while catching most contaminants which are going to be your decapitated stocks and pistol hairs the trichomes will fall on the screen or roll around until dropping through the screen while the contaminants toxin hairs land flat and gets stuck on top of the screen now this leaves us with the very bottom screen which is the 200 lines per inch this screen catches all of your trichomes it has a few purposes from being the final catch system of your trichome heads but is also used as a cleaning tool to further clean and purify your drive shaft heads of contaminants this is where you can take some farmers grade hash or Keith and further clean it down into pure heads there's multiple techniques to go about cleaning your dry state further from the carding technique to static dry sifting I'm gonna leave a link down below to a couple detailed videos on how to further clean your farmers great hasher Keith [Music] so the way I sent my tram in large is I like to do it in three separate runs the main difference between each run is going to be the time and the amount of agitation the material goes through the first run is going to be quick and it's going to produce the cleanest heads while the second and third runs are going to produce the most amount of heads but they will be dirtier and not as pure the first run through the screens very quick the material is simply being dropped onto the working screens and then picked back up off the screen and set aside for run to the main point of the first run is to collect the nicest and cleanest heads the longer the material is worked over the screens the more containers will fall through into your pile of clean ash so for the first run it's important to be quick and diligent and avoid being too rough and leaving the materials on the screen for too long [Music] now as I drop the material on the top screen the trichomes are going to be falling off and passing through and hitting the second screen and then rolling around until the finds will hold a pass through to the bottom screen so what I like to do is collect what's on the bottom screen already because it will be the cleanest pile of hash with minimum contaminants I will set this aside on a parchment and then bring back the second screen and I will just give the top of the screen a flick to cause the material to bounce this allows majority of there are many trichome heads to roll down to the bottom screen these are still very clean heads but because I'm flicking the screen more contaminants are gonna pass through which is why I like to collect them in separate piles keep in mind this is just what I do you very well could flick the second screen right away and just collect it all out ones and label all of that your first one the reason why I do with this waste because that first collection with the least amount of agitation is always going to be the most meltia sand cleanest heads that you can do and in the quickest form [Music] to prepare for the second run I just make sure the screens are clean because any condemned is left on those screens will block the trichomes from rolling down through the screens to the bottom so after every single run I will brush the screens down I also like to put the material back into the freezer too brittle up the trichomes usually a wait about a half-hour before starting the second run [Music] the second run is where I start to get rougher with the material on the working screens I will start to move around the material with my hands for about 10 to 15 seconds and typically for speed I move the material to the side of the screen and then grab another handful and drop it on the screen to repeat after a couple handfuls I will remove the material and place it into a bin for its third run and then continue on until the rest is finished [Music] now there's plenty of ways to go about dry sifting your material and you don't need to do a first second and third run personally I don't like to clean the hash so by doing a quick first in second run it allows me to collect a lot of trichome heads that require less cleaning the third run is where I spend the most time working the material and will end up with more farmer's grade hash that requires to be cleaned to further purify it from contaminants that's where the carding technique and things like static dry sifting come in handy they help further clean dirty hash from removing pistols and decapitated stocks [Music] oh that's good piping hot though last night I only ended up doing two runs just ran out of time it's gonna take way too long to do the third run and it was getting pretty damn late I am gonna do a third run probably like next week sometime I placed all the trim enlarged back into the freezer what we ended up with is like three point four grams of second run sift on the first run the quick run we ended up getting like the Eagles a gram so what I'm gonna do now is actually I want to press some of this the second run hash out into some rosin this is gonna be maybe my third time overall ever pressing hash out into some rosin I'm gonna do all of this wish me luck this is the very very first run and then this is also from the first run but that's after I added the screen a bit so probably a little bit more dirty than this stuff so we're gonna go ahead and take a dab of this and will it melt it probably will I mean I've good suspicion it will never timer Londa we're at a minute at a minute so this right here is a point four and probably gonna end up doing all of it let's go oh yeah she bubbled oh yeah that was super low ten in WoW is that tasty oh yeah you can see it evens these little dirty in there whoo that was nice okay guys well let's get set up the press some hash [Music] [Music] okay so first up we got a bag the hash now I've seen on Pedro's grow room he double bags his hash frozen I've seen him use a few variations I've seen him use 237 micron bags and I've seen him use a 25 micron bag with a 160 micron bag so no reason why I'm gonna go with this variation of double bagging so well let's get this stuff so I put the three point four grams of sift the second run sift into the 25 micron bag you know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna just pack this down a bit with my body weight and then so the 160 micron bag I don't know if I should have packed that down before or after look at that so there we go we got 3.4 grams of dry sift inside a 25 micron bag which is also double bagged inside a 160 micron bag these are from rosin evolution and I do have a coupon code down below along with a coupon code for the low temperature and press what you're about to see in two seconds so I think I need a pair of scissors just to trim this up and the way we go give me a second so that way we could just fold it a bit and get ready to press cool so the way I'm going to be pressing out this sift is using a directional flow method now it's very simple and what it just does is it presses all of the rosin of the front and it keeps it from going out the sides of that so you're going to basically cut this parchment to the correct size and there's a simple s just like that and then you fold in each side this is the way I do it very simple takes no time to set up and then you're good to go yeah because I'm pressing out some dry sift I turned down the low temp press down to 71 degree Celsius which I believe is about 160 degrees Fahrenheit and yeah anyways she's ready to go so let's press some rosin [Music] I'm at one minute right now [Music] I really don't know how much pressure to add I don't want to blow anything l things just gonna wait two minutes it's about now and I think we're good oh wow this looks four-way go and suck your blood that alone so that alone is 1.75 grams 1.77 grams and still got all this stuff on it and this looks definitely worthy of press pressing twice so okay guys that's this week's video I really hope you enjoyed it don't forget I'm not an expert when it comes to dry sifting you can actually grab farmer's hash and clean it down and there's multiple ways to do that so a few videos on that will be down below I'm also gonna link Pedro's grow rooms Instagram profile and YouTube channel down below as well as he presses a lot of hash rasen so if you guys are interested in learning more about that that's where I learned this double bag technique my phone just made a noise guys I'm not gonna redo it we're keeping it also don't forget that links to everything you see in this video there down below included the coupon code so if you're intrigued by anything check those out you want to help me out please just leave a like if you got a question or a comment just drop those down those helped so much and that's than that we're gonna see you next week for a video and I know I'm gonna go take me a dab of this hash resin peace out guys [Music]", "ZlrTMplIa0A": "and inside the bag for the extended period of time there don't want any of it to come out for the first cycle 10 minutes and 100 degrees second cycles on 110 degrees for 10 minutes and you just bump it up by 10 degrees every time basically so we're just now about to bump it up to 130 and at this point once it's at that temperature I'll put a little bit more pressure on it there's a little most likely hold in place now so you'll start to see the bag wet up sometime around the 20 minute mark or so if you got no pressure on it if you see the bag wet up before that you got too much pressure on and basically gonna waste some rosin so now that's my timer reset the timer so this is actually the 31 minute mark basically we got it at 130 degrees gently apply some extra pressure I really like this particular press the long speak because you can really dial that pressure in your just 1 psi at a time lock it in place right there right around 5 psi now you get in real little tight here for our extreme close-up we got done you can see that the bag is just now starting to Wed up little color a little little wetness to it sit there we go extreme close-up extreme closeup yeah I know that it's good actually zoom in on the part where I'm trying to get it to the right well you get the idea it's very much there at this point when is dripping I'll do it you actually want to do and I'm not sure how damn okay yeah Wayne's World Wayne's World okay yeah but it's uh you get it actually see a little bit of moisture on the bag now at this point on the archery six psi yeah it's still pretty [ __ ] slow and steady at this point there's gonna be a lot of a lot of waiting a lot of thumb twiddling maybe some song and comedy well I honestly I wanted to start up because I think that it is very interesting and the steps are important and what you were explaining to me with all really intense so I was like damn I should play you know I think we pretty much kind of caught up the most part it's like the main thing is is just going slow and steady at the beginning because I have went too fast at it before and the laws and all goopes out and you know there's still THC a in that rosin that oozed out initially so you basically didn't harvest the THC a from that and your first terrine layer will end up being not just terpenes at that point it's well that's a point voice as close up as you can get it apologize for the loud air compressor yeah whatever those mic here here that we're going to end up with the best deal that [Music] the overall purity of this resin ranch there's just not much in the way [Applause] so I'm imagining that the THC percentage of this stuff I don't really know there's no on that sticker there wasn't no yes there's no way to know but imagining that the rosin is somewhere over 80 85 % THC and with this method being as effective as it is you're out really you know losing I have gotten fairly low THC a yields in the past while using a lower quality rosin starting product I'm imagining this time we're gonna have somewhere over 50% that's the hopes so any other weed nerds in there yeah when you actually do start to put the pressure on you'll get a very clear looking drip coming out of it that's the terpene fraction there the terpenes are more viscous than the rosin itself so yeah the first thing that you'll actually see is out might end up being an actual liquid and drop I'm not sure hmm it's just like I said it's my first time doing it with this high of a purity so yeah yeah sure what's respect with it but I've seen some [ __ ] come out before that literally just looks like you know nectar okay but yeah the first couple that come out be like a higher yield of terpenes that come out and then the ones that come after that will be cleaner but lower yield and those ones tend to be a little more shatter II well find out what we're gonna get today pretty much every product and end up with a different consistency mmm pan upon you know how it was stored what it was sprayed on it what it experience in his life cycle which and resident rancher seemed to really optimize his growing environment probably pretty [ __ ] clean oh yeah a lot of times cleaner stuff will be a little more shattering or stable on this side most okay I'm just bumping up the temperature a little bit higher again 140 now you can see that there is a good corner of moisture formed but nothing's actually squeezed out of the bag yet we're just at 7 psi now slowly creeping up oh yeah not really smelling it yet yes yes sir yeah so this is technically mechanical separation process this is what they call it okay mechanical terpene fractioning or mechanical separation of th da hmm we're gonna we'll do a little experimentation with mixing them back together in a form of solvent free diamonds and sauce pressure a bit more around ten well I can see the other side it's got white so witnesses leaving yeah at this point it's slowly starting to separate the more viscous terpene layer will kind of get pushed away TJ there so that's essentially that's the only thing that's actually coming out of the bag his wax is a little bit spencer pains they're like to at some point it'd be really cool to check it out and see like you know what percentage of THC is left in the terpene fraction and you know obviously have to find out what the rosin was going in what the turkey fraction was and then what the THC a just to get an idea of how pure of a separation we're actually getting here mmm oh yeah okay now you can really see it started so yeah there's some different ways we can handle this at the end is uh most of the stuff I see in the stores mm-hmm has a pretty pretty dark tinge of yellow to it that means that there's still a little bit of the terpene fraction left in the thca and the more times you repress it after we get the separation done we can just keep repressing it full pressure and full heat hundred eighty degrees and it'll just get cleaner and cleaner well I had one that I did there just was like perfectly clear crystal another one I tried I didn't go as hard high and it was still very amber colored mm so it's up to you how you want to play that I mean obviously you know weights too much time in this situation since you already off work well we'll just we'll do it at the what I would consider to be like 75% only done okay if we keep going at it and keep going at I mean you could add a whole extra half an hour yeah 40 minutes on total faith and and it doesn't really change the purity of that publish oh yeah you totally honest that's perfect see the diamonds and kind of mixing it back into its own rather than any way I want to see I think it would be crazy cool the way down each time to separating out there's less in the terpene or less in the THC a fraction so right here do you think doesn't work on a larger scale or would you have to like yeah most definitely would you're wondering to a certain point though I don't think you could do like a full plate full of it hmm maybe you can just I feel like you could end up being a lot more of a mess because with the viscosity of rosin you press out a whole plateful it doesn't like this spillover the edges whereas this stuff if it's really viscous it could just like drip down into the mm-hmm the inner workings of the press there mmm that's why some people do the extra parchment folds and get that I mean the directing flow and whatnot right but I've actually had a lot of bad luck with those causing the bag to slip around you can't see the bag properly to like tell when it's ready for pressure it makes it way harder for me to not blow out or [ __ ] like that yeah that's all I've kind of stepped away from the directed flow parchment typed okay particularly when it comes to making actual rosin almost impossible the low-pressure involved with this will be more forgiving those I'm going to be possible to do it without blowing out yeah but it's really I mean sometimes it's hard to see what you're doing when you need those directed flow pouches okay one thing I've had problems with in the past is I get the flow proper but then too much of it still goes out in the back it causes a pressure buildup back there and that can actually cause the parchment paper to explode mmm in the on the backside two more minutes will bump up to 150 degrees and start putting real pressure on this thing okay that's the first big cyclic fold real cycle yeah that's when it'll start to you might have a few drips pulling out of here and I'm not guaranteeing this stuff is gonna be super clear mmm we've had some of the past that came out they were like that's a terpene separation right there oh geez oh you twist the later ones they started being smaller that's trippy and more stable mm-hmm that's what these are yeah so basically it's just climbing 150 degrees now once it's there up crank up the pressure until I started see some action now we're over 40 minutes into it and the the thta's probably pretty well bonded at this point and not likely to accidentally use out hmm it's safer to put pressure on [ __ ] up and I cut this just a little too short I can't mm-hmm clip it up too damn magnet move it right up to the edge of the plate since it's so small and go see otherwise see how incredibly viscous and clear that liquid is yeah that's a first way that's pretty cool you can see it pretty well on your phone we'd live literally clear oh I smell it now Oh oh man that stank mmm really both the garlic and mushrooms and the grandpa house brought the grandpa mouth right out come to call GMO yeah you didn't miss a whole lot as I was saying earlier jots is a really slow process on this start here but it's starting to ooze up pretty good now it's just her peens basically right there I did my job all the thca is still in the bag and that's just the terpene fraction losing out that pure good the strings you got running the Sun and job what you running deep purple and golden goat just I just asked my correctly if I remember correctly and I meant to ask you what what that golden goat is but if I'm crazy so ministry haven't you heard of that one yeah am i right is that that is Red John okay gotcha Oh an IT guy see okay golden girl goes out the purple and raw cookies yes he's gonna [ __ ] what's up sounds like a nice nice harvest on your horizon there [ __ ] yeah yeah I remembered because of the golden goat and the deep purple he said I have a great memory I'm not strange but I happen to remember that but Frank does have a really good memory okay golden goat that's an interesting one though both of us at some time we never heard of that that's dream new to me star fans kind of a plant encyclopedias I was surprised to hear him say as well unknowable yeah I'm no plant encyclopedia [ __ ] yeah yeah is that more on this a teabag Purple's from rip yeah one thing I've grown by him was uh that Apollo 13 law school but I know is there's at least now as well back to well now yeah 150 degrees now we've been doing this for about 45 minutes just now starting to actually eat out hell yeah he said yes the steamboat leaving however I remember perfectly 16 - 17 Dave finisher nice nice mmm yeah I like those uh pineapple Citybus well some really good pineapple taiwan citizens [ __ ] bee's knees i have nine exists but yeah this Frank knows I'm not the biggest fan of three strains but a couple of them every now and then hit right I like those uh stinky foot you know burnt rubber diesel fuels like those things that stink but yeah you like this GM oh boy uh than ever it's just so funky literally it's like uh uh you know this is the only way to describe it in word I'm pretty sure that's effectively descriptive of it funk aroma 150 bumpin temps bump intense at this point we're ready to just go blasting away at it with you know it's not gonna blow up now we're just gonna put the pressure on I'll be back in the chat in a minute I'm gonna use my camera really brought the grandpa mouth right out he says all right we are at full blast at this point heart rate swap heart metallic case oh boy and that's just crazy really yeah literally very clear clear now and that's technically terpene separate right yeah that's just a sure play there should be fairly low in THC compared to everything else okay I love them kept all the Terps or all the THC a in the in the back school all I can say if you want to make a good diamond sauce yeah you mix this back in with that okay get multiple runs of this after it cool off a little bit you can get hopefully get it off of the parchment sometimes they're a little more staffing this one looks like it's probably like so we got a question from Joe or one one he said what strain have you guys press that at the best return uh sfv or this GMO honestly this GMOs it's a six star we pressed it had a 77 percent from hash to rosin but we'll find out what the yield is on rosin ca ca in the past my highest yield on th EA was I got like twenty percent so it's usually like I get like sixty percent or something fifty percent maybe from hash to rosin and then out of that you know a 20% of that to go in the form of THC a so that comes out in the form of this goopy stuff on the parchment paper but I'm feeling like this is gonna be a much higher yield because of the actual percentage of THC in the rosin was higher this probably was 88 90 percent THC a rosin it's a traditional market source so there's no testing though on it but it is pure let me tell you that you know test to its purity there's like no particles in there they shouldn't be in there so listen my Jimmy the tool scraping I call right now it's already still really just doop that's clear oh man that's crazy the jar oh my goodness wow that is a Wow wait at certain angles you can see that it's just a little pissed rip of [ __ ] nothing oh my god yeah right there it's clear it's a bird oh my god it looks just like the mouth it was like attacking this hmm yeah it's not working off through the paper though it's like way to biscuits to get off the paper don't take yourself either huh smell that Wow yeah that's the whole garlic that's crazy usually like a lot more shattering or at least of that waxy kind of pliable material or you know you can play with it kind of hmm this is just straight-up liquid I feel like freeze it so I get it off that way Oh can't see [ __ ] listen now because it's all white it out yeah that's too close to the light now oh yeah yeah yeah that's crazy yeah like I'm hanging out at Black Oak branch and really good bands on the stage and you know Saturday night people are just doing all that Saturday night stuff that they do like over here then the band says something about yeah it smells like somebody's cooking popcorn out there in the crowd sure would like to smoke some pot I mean eat some popcorn this security guard comes over and he's like dance we could smell popcorn oh okay everybody all right [ __ ] yeah security guard enjoy some popcorn and then Karen comes over she's like y'all can't do that here this is Kate Wolfe teach I mean that happened to a friend of mine golly so it's still part thing - mmm yeah uh we'll get a little bit more Terps next time or I mean sorry a little bit less turps each time after this now ya know how well we're gonna be able to do this song that was dining this also well pretty much what I thought we're getting more in the form of THC a in them sauce what I was thinking originally also is like I don't know what the room is from them but it's like it looks like it's like whipped rosin that just has the diamonds in it I think I think it's really rosin it's it's a probably a proportion of terpenes rosin to th EI and then whipped while heated oh Jesus and then the Diamonds added after ours she's hard to say so yeah the proprietary tech is their own method it's hard to recreate but they're the I feel like it's some form of those combinations of things heat whip proportions of ingredients okay so now we're doing full pressure full heat which is a hundred and seventy there's allegedly happened other cables allegedly ladies unless you'd leave the glove did not fit what's the quick actually I will do another did not have inhalation relations with that woman miss Merrow in ski [Music] I'm getting my night and scandals all mixed up hold on [Music] this is my monetary a buddy [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like the only thing straight up the parchment actually it's angled so it kind of pulls up all right now at this point it's just cleaning up we'll just do this one more round and we'll call it at that point okay that would be a hour and 10 minutes cool yeah and then I think we're just now had an hour in 10 minutes actually since it's 5:14 we started at 4 right you know yeah so yeah any any bit of time from here now isn't really gonna do much else except for just change the color of the TCA a little bit it's why it gets lighter so like I said right now there's still some terpenes stuck inside the bag mm-hmm and slowly over time you're gonna push all of those out and then you'll just end up with a purer and purer the8 I meant I guess is that terpenes come out of darker as you're gone oh no they actually get lighter too Oh crazy yeah it's okay in my experience it's just like less of it each time but it didn't like clear so that little bit of color that is there isn't gonna be there that's for me okay but yeah it's probably not even gonna be enough to actually collect it's just pushing it a little bit further out of the inner bag into the second bag at this point then sometimes what I'll do is I'll actually pull apart and collect it all the THC out of there and put it in a clean bag and then repress it again at this point and that gets like at this point the bag is just being a sponge pulling extra Terps out of it that would be in the ga mm-hmm that's how you end up with the clearest most pure crystals well we don't have to go that far into it I'm sure it's just so he's stupid as is mmm and for the sake of brevity let's just call it now in the middle of the cycle you see this like I mean basically nothing yeah but each time you do that it's just a little bit comes out of there it would be in here Oh guys I think so now this is the goods it's the goods you're right back in the chat I'm gonna be videotaping it so like I said it's like a sponge almost of sorts it's it's soaking up the turkeys at this point okay home amount of the inner bag in the bag will be a lot cleaner [Music] Oh busted out just a little bit Wow that's crazy-looking no dude this is already pure white at this point it's already like oh my god here oh my goodness dude so we're back from Colombia with our goods oh that's crazy-looking that's pretty nuts looks like the absolute [Music] all right I got the parchment tear it out you can figure out how much we actually harvest it here now that it's on a brown paper he can see it better so yeah almost exactly 50% it's probably more accurate way of it ma'am 147 yeah that's great point four seven always one grand it is really good I couldn't maybe not went as hard on it and could have Lily over 50% me just have to slice it yell okay Oh [Music] [Music] just heat the press up to 190 degrees and just let it sit there slowly over time it'll get there but it's for Holi actually have that was off I had no idea so I just found that we can do it that way now here's the cool thing if this was a little bit of light - Wow no it's badass so here's the coolest part about it is this is this is the is the most stable THC substance I've ever played with my life at this point once it's solidified into this crystal just whatever glassy type deal it takes over 200 degrees to reheat it so I could literally just sit there and hold it my hands forever it'll never melt to my finger at all even without gloves on this is the most stable THC product I've ever seen can you go grab those um other turf players so fast yeah we're under the freezer I don't have to breathe yeah hi [ __ ] yeah oh yeah do you know this year still got some THC left in it it's hard to get it all out but what I generally do with that is just like throw it into a little bit of tea you know at the hot tea so I end up with like a little bit left on there so we'll play around with that and make them mix up and stuff and then we'll smoke it later tomorrow or whenever you're free wanna do that oh I'm definitely down to do some salt Atlas diamond dabs yeah [ __ ] that I'm gonna sapphire yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah this still is not coming off it's like [ __ ] on the tasty treats watch the whole rosin press on that and the Diamonds press yeah dude [ __ ] yeah that's awesome so I don't know that we're gonna get any more actual in there and what we should do is just get a different jar and then put th ck again you hear this oh yeah ASMR for you the sound of THC a doobie down [ __ ] yeah no for joining us very much happy Friday we'll be smoking some very soon but yeah thank you very much stars I'm [ __ ] master of ceremonies here thank you sir", "-t7wYRlkFVY": "yo what's good everybody jp here checking in respect my region.com back with episode two of a west coast youtube review featuring calya extracts rosin uh today's product we're gonna be reviewing the ice water extract it's a sun cake rosin your boy justin is back so we're gonna dive right in one dab each we'll talk about it two dabs four out of ten saying yeah yeah let's do it all right let's dive into at least some of the percentages real quick 68.5 on the thc 77.08 percent on the thca cbd 0.32 and cannabinoids total 77.08 so in terms of rosin is it the most potent rosin we've ever dabbed no it's not but no but sun cake right i have a feeling this is going to be cakey earthy piney maybe a little spicy hopefully yes yes and this is the i know the exact cross this is sunset sherbert crossed with ice cream cake something so right off the bat it's like an indica dominant height not a wedding cake okay cool you know and i feel i feel i feel this is gonna provide like a real nice that's some good color y'all hi that's my producer got that like snotty hash color right for sure this this definitely has a better color than the other one yeah right this just gives that look of like wow this is six star a grade what is the what's the um you check that out i mean i'll give you a little you know just so you can see it it doesn't say the uh the use the 70 or whatever yeah it should if this sticker might have uh oh it says it on the lid so you to 120 [Music] all right i'm excited man again i believe i've dabbed italia with you a couple times maybe two or three times at this point i i can't sit here and honestly say that i can name one strain or remember one and so at this point you know i'd really like to give these ones a fair shot and the attention that they deserve because i think you know calgary does get recommended as one of the best rosin brands in the state of california yeah when i go places so they definitely have the most exclusive drops uh it's something that's hard to acquire like it was hard to acquire that sweet and sour as well as this sun cake because uh it just sells out very quickly in the shops so now make sure you line it up this time there you go you see you see saw the first time it was showing you a lower number but once you get in the middle diameter of the banger gave you a proper reading all righty turf timer no octave no technology errors on this go we are doing it the right way all right also this is a highly educated quartz banger both of them are the same same thickness same everything so yeah this is the way the dad works on instagram italiax.com i like it i like it fresh frozen it says nothing but fresh frozen they're uh you know tell you that's why they call it it's ice water extract because it's coming from fresh frozen interesting interesting get your dad ready oh no [Music] you take dabs at whatever temperature you take that which is traditionally hot in my experience so we both have these turf timers set we both have these two timers set for 500 degrees okay once it hits 500 like to kind of let it sit till like 480 470 and then go in for the dab what is that that's usually how you get the nicest milk this is sun cake sunset sherbet times ice cream cake you dropped a video thank you sir you're gonna go no it's too hot still all right see i'm saying you take harder grabs harder sometimes when it's a little bit bigger you might you got to go like 20 degrees a little you know that's a nice milk i've been dabbing rosin since you were in diapers that's a nice melt yo look at that oh let me tell you it is delicious that [ __ ] is loud yo i do that [ __ ] [ __ ] smack me in the face oh wow mine still says 490 484 479 475 all right so in terms of the flavor that i'm getting sweet sweet pineness sweet sweet gassy earth and in terms of like the kind of high that i'm experiencing it's it's both energetic and relaxing in terms of the body height right it really does wash over your body and i had you saw me crack my back earlier before this episode oh my goodness wow this is wow took away all the aches that i had because i literally just had so much pain a second ago i had to roll on my back wow gone yo wow what do you think hit me with more than one word on this okay this is this is you know this is more than terpy this is like where you're like you're like trying to figure out like what is that is that vanilla frosting is that is that like a cookie you know but um ice cream cake and sunset sugar you said yeah that's delicious so super super i like the chirping profile if if this was a girl this would be my type um and i definitely go for this one over the sweet and sour because the sweet and sour was you know i think by the name is kind of like hybrid sweet and sour i like sweet this is some cake this is the crust it's it's a different kind of high at the end of the day this is ice cream cake gassy pine sweet gassiness i mean makes you want to go back for more like that we have a second dab to review it out of 10. well my i went like super low in my [ __ ] oh so you still have a second down today all right well [ __ ] okay pass me that torch really yeah you had to see that was the last little bit yeah and that tastes like i'm telling you i get that i get the really nice vanilla ice cream i still have the taste of it all right college yeah i still even need a vanilla ice cream on that side is this the first dab where you don't actually need a second dab or almost like sun cake they should have called this your angel was that angel cake they should have called this [ __ ] like heaven cake vanilla [ __ ] clouds it is sweet tiny gassy the nose on it is wonderful like as soon as you start like that's the word nutmeg i was like what smells that word that's that's not the side of this wow it's literally loud that's what i'm saying it hit when you smell it you're you're like your eyes squint yeah it's impressive i have a score of mine out of ten the second dab is not going to do it you know aside from human error [ __ ] it up so for me my score out of 10 is going to be 9.5 that would that's my score no no you told me what what genetics this is but it needs to say it on there yes and then i need the terpene information on there and that's the last two points for me the last half point point two five each i got you this is a problem that's a perfect product i would i want to dock them for the branding instead but repeatedly over and over people recommend kalyan as one of the best and so am i always at this point it doesn't matter the bartenders don't care that it looks like this they still think it's one of the best so i'm not going to take anything for that right 9.5 for me where you at i'm at 9.5 as well i'm at 9.5 as well i think uh wonderful i think yeah like really you hit it on the t with exactly what you said that if call it if you just provide that little bit of information so it would have been a 10 out of 10. like that yeah this is great you know and the packaging is not even that bright or like poppy but you know once you dip into it i mean you know what you're going to have a box like a cool acid wash box version of this but let's be real let's be real but it has to shout out to colleen because they the collabs they do are actually where they go crazy with the packaging this is actually a collab that's sweet and sour right that's the vesuvio gardens uh yeah yeah that's dope well big thank you guys you know calio you guys do a big shout out appreciate you guys checking in coming in hot at a 9.5 from both of us definitely go check out the sun cake rosin sweet and sour on the previous episode we'll see you guys in the next west coast video review respect my region justin curious love y'all peace", "HRhYgCOtrz0": "so i'm gonna be making a tincture today uh using everclear and some of the pucks i have left over from pressing yeah and don't worry guys uh nylon doesn't dissolve in you know alcohol unless you're adding extreme heat so i'll add a few more and then i think uh we're ready to add the everclear that's why i didn't play basketball all right so now i'm going to add the everclear and pretty much fill it up to the top so yeah guys like i said earlier uh you don't have to worry the nylon's not gonna dissolve in the alcohol so yeah uh i'm sure i'm still gonna get a few comments even though i've said it twice now but [Music] all right so got it to pretty much where i want it and uh just put the lid on just going to make sure the lid's uh nice and tight so you can take a quick look i'll let this jar sit for a week until i touch it again [Music] so after the week i'll take it out and see if it's ready to use or if i want to use heat to expedite the process so yeah that's how i go about making my tinctures take it easy guys", "LOElLD68v8s": "get a good life [Music] [Music] we're back we're doing another press with some xxx og we're at stage one move it overflow this is the quarter pound sum triple XL g flour rosin just straight flour we're only at stage two stead of two more stages to go we're at 2,300 pounds of pressure we're running this at 109 degrees or under 90 degrees we just breached up to stage three we're still pressing we're gonna scoop this to collect or again where if you guys just joined us one of bras endeavor so we're at stage three and counting each stage is about 53 seconds the liquify time was 30 seconds 160 second total stages total cycle 45 46 thousand 46,000 pounds on the on the game we just went up to stage four so we're at 7,000 pounds of force which equivalent to about a hundred and forty thousand pounds 75 tons of pressure under a hundred and thirty one hundred under 130 square inches of surface area it looks like this is definitely going to reach what the test was the test tested at twenty nine percent return and I'm pretty sure that this quarter pound is going to throw about 25 28 grams let's see we'll see it's almost off the parchment paper under there when we are at Stage four we're fitting it fish finishing up this full cycle you guys just joined us is more we're here at a stiched area here shooting a function video this is what the will be you're going on YouTube the self collecting we're at ninety three percent ninety three percent runoff so you got eight percent maximum amount of oil being stuck within your your your parchment paper so there's no need for scraping it's almost all self collected yeah we just finished the cycle we're back at home so let's pull this out it's for what have we got in the oven here what do we got okay that's quite a lot of oil I mean that's a quarter pound JK there was a twenty eight grams per bag for bags let me lift this up and show you guys what it looks like [Music] it's just these pouches every single time they come out like this", "3Z_HBWCa8ng": "hello senior storner fans it's the real senior stoner back at you for the big reveal okay everybody i've spoken about it i've hinted about it well it's going to be unveiled today we're gonna do the unboxing of my rosin tech that's right my rosin tech rosin tech big smash here it is okay by the way just so you know what i'm doing i'm following along on my ipad because i really don't know much about it and i want to try to help you guys understand what's here first of all i bought it because it was plug and play plug and play man i mean this thing supposedly right out of this box is gonna be ready to go so let's take a look at what we got here first you're gonna have your rosin tech owner's manual you want to look at that okay now i bought a couple extra items with it i bought some extra parchment a lot of it i bought some gloves okay but let's look at what they say well actually why don't we let everybody see the unit let's how do we do this the foam has to be peeled away let's peel the foam away gently remember this is act carefully for shipping okay premium filter bags i'm just putting all these little things aside before i start doing anything here with you all there's a lot of stuff to put aside here wow okay comes nicely wrapped remember you're smoking something that's going to be shipped across country or internationally here it is this is my rosin tech nug smasher this thing is heavy my son-in-law had to come oh my goodness and put it up here i wouldn't be able to move it there's no way i'd be able to touch it and move it okay so what you want to do here is you want to understand that now that you have a tool like this you can basically make any kind of material you want you have full pressure control i bought it because it was a higher end model this is not a starting model okay this is called the big smash now i'm not gonna turn it on right now but i'm gonna kind of get used to it weighs about 60 pounds four tons of pressure is why i bought it and dual heated six by two plates so what you're getting is a wide surface area that's what you want and you're getting the pressure that you need also because let's face it i'm a big concentrate fan wouldn't it be nice for me to be able to make my own dab materials here in the house okay so features this is right off the rosin tech website of this product four tons of pressure six inch by two inch solid aluminum dual heating plates eating heat even heat distribution because the microprocessor uses a precision temperature gauge and here's what you have zero to 415 degrees it's a total digital control a digital automatic timer you can see here where the numbers will come in digital format it's a standard one it's a household current you plug it in 800 watts 10 amps and i will say i'm really excited to use this more so uh than i can even talk about so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna now put website away and let's look at it here step one getting started follow this step-by-step guide blah blah blah okay once you plugged in the press and flipped on the power both screens will light up and the plates will begin heating i don't know if i want to do that right now the digital top controller will be the heating plate as well as timer for length of pressing the digital controller at the bottom will only control the bottom heating plate and there's probably a reason for that and i'm gonna learn about that and then on set you hit the set button once you're in an edit mode and that allows you to hit temperature control step three is up or down the arrows to where you want it to be and then make sure that you press the set button to change it wow once you've found your desired temperature press the set button until you return back to normal mode and to start the timer press the time button on the panel let's see there's a set button over here there's a timer button over there you think senior stoner can do this i don't know i'm scared already there is a button okay and then once you've found your desired time press the set button until you return back to now you set to the left time set the temperature on the bottom heat plate use the right control panel okay and follow the same steps i see an up and down control panel not a right left control panel hold on make sure i'm looking at the same thing here i'm reading it wrong okay i mean i have to say hold the separate and hold it again okay that's turning it on okay fellas i've turned it on temperature in the bottom plate heat plate up well what i haven't talked about is what you have to do is you have to take special micron filter bears and special rosin tech parchment and use that i'm gonna watch the video on how to use this item okay i might even call rosin attack and get a technician online to help me through this but but forgetting how overwhelmingly new this is to me okay and it is new to me forgetting about that you know what this is one cool puppy i mean there are going to be a few items here that i have to do to get it working i'm going to have to get this plugged in back there there are a couple plugs to plug in let me turn it around and let everybody see what i'm talking about okay i wonder ah see the plates rise up like that when you push the handle down you see that plates are rising up with the handle down reason i'm doing it is i want to pull these cords through they didn't tell me what to do with these chords it looks like you're going to connect one to the upper plate and one to the lower plate is what they do but i don't want to do it without talking to somebody very cool and that's the lowering okay so design wise it is simple check it out i think i figured the whole thing out that easily ready you're going to do this which is going to bring and it sounds like old-fashioned technology right jack type of thing you're going to bring your weed in here in a little bag and then you're going to put the pressed paper on it both sides and it's going to be at whatever temperature you need it to be at and there's a specific ratio in a format for this that people use i've i've seen it but i haven't paid a lot of attention to it now i'm going to follow up and find out what the temperatures are and what i'm gonna get out of it and i might even be making rosin tonight we're gonna see it's that simple because this thing right here once it connects with the top plate once it gets up there you see that once it gets up there that's the key once it's there you're going to get four tons pressure and heat and then when it's done all you do is turn this knob and it hydraulically lowers that is really cool i mean this is about as automatic as you can get i'm totally impressed what is in this package i will say what i'm not impressed with i don't see unless i want less they're in the box i don't see good instructions everything on the internet now you know what i mean so what they want us to do getting started follow the setup guide to set your temperature and length of press it did not say assemble it so it does say shoot an email to support at rosin tech products which i'm going to do i'm also gonna go get the video uh from youtube and see how other people have done it what i'm interested in in finding out frankly is what exactly do i have to do now i get i get it i get it what you have to do with the press you with the heating and thing like that but what i don't get is the assembly part i'm a little frightened i see two screws here also what are these screws for there's no instructions on that um and let me turn it back around so everybody can see what i'm talking about i'm sorry just my nature you know one of these goes there and one of these goes there but which one goes where you know what i'm saying so does it say anywhere nope it doesn't say anywhere but it does have a serial number on it i did buy it directly from them so we're gonna find out i think the important thing for this video is for everybody to not be afraid okay first of all you don't have to spend as much money as i did and buy this one you can buy smaller ones there's a variety of sizes they have and there are tons of companies all right let's just face it this is what i chose don't be afraid of it what i'm trying to do trying to do is become vertically integrated i'm not growing but i would like to cut my concentrate price down if possible you know i'm having a hard time with that in my head lately and i think this could be the way to do it my standards are very high for concentrate many of you know that it's why i felt like vertical integration was the way to go because it's like anything else if you can control what goes in you're controlling what comes out and that's what i intend to do so this has been the real senior stoner with the unboxing we're not talking anything else but here we did an unboxing and our first look at our rosin tech nug smasher okay everybody the excuse me the rosin tech big smash it's called the rosin tech big smash thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video please subscribe shoot me some comments i respond to everything have a great day everybody cheers", "-wgdsrRAqSE": "what up everyone shaw here would you lie today let me take a little bit i just got off work [Music] big [Music] [Music] leave some comments below what y'all like to dab what you guys like to smoke as always like i said you can request music you can let me know send me videos i like to post everyone else smoking too so we could do a big collab i would like to go on facebook and do a group chat do a video recording and have everyone spunk together y'all leave comments on what you think below you", "xXSM2AHVEgQ": "[Music] saturday october 31st and me and clayton are back here at kenner herb farms and we're getting ready to press some rosin so come on in here and check this out together some flour to press some rosin yes this was fresh frozen and we're gonna work it over a little bit with the the blow dryer here to get some of the moisture out moisture out of it and then we're gonna get depressing right on yeah it's a little micron mesh bag so you can see you can see through the bag so as you press it the oil is going to come out through the bag onto the parchment oh yeah [Music] hey this time that's a great place [Music] and so right there's the rosin guys all that right around the edge we are here making some kiss my hash that is what we are making hell yeah well i am pre-weighing out our bricks all right what kind is that this is our cheese mix this is all dry sift dry ice crystal sift hash and you just don't get no more organic no moisture added back to it minimal plant matter no solvent no no chemicals in it hashes worldwide eat it you can make it in edibles you can top your cannabis bowls with it you can smoke it by yourself if you got that laid out come very very hot so that's your wax paper well this is this here is parchment paper yes same okay pretty much the same so brushing the excess off wow smell that i guess you can't smell it through the phone right here i can holy [ __ ] i wish i could just have that in a bottle and just be able to oh yeah oh yeah make that a cologne oh yeah hell yeah that's the end result right there and then we'll cut it into little one gram portions and so now those are zipped up and in there and then they'll be packaged later on all right that's our [Music] legal washington hash brand right on [Music] do [Music] you", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "ihTked0nFtI": "greetings youtube it's been do buds and i'm here tonight to do a press for you guys of uh this gmo cookies super so frosty going to be pressing this out tonight yeah so we're just going to get this stuff ready bagged up i'm going to be using julie tech 100 micron bag for this press using bottle tech uh we'll be back when we get this stuff all nice and ready all right this is what we're gonna that's what we'll be working with tonight gmo cookies yeah so we're just gonna tear out this cup so all right so that's what we're going to go ahead and do for the first press and we'll be back let me get this bagged up so i got my paper ready got the book ready i'm going to do this at 203 so that's what i'm going to do is press that so let's get it all right we got this first puck in here all right so this is what we're getting on the first squish away the puck can see see how much that is but uh it's five grams going in so let's see what the next puck does there we go second press so this press is a bunch lower temp it's also just still five grams but uh it's looking a lot the second uh bag i think the color is a lot it's a lot more golden yeah so again this is a five gram press of some gmo cookies and uh yeah it's all single sourced flour rosin this is a third press from the two pucks and this is what i got out of it so pretty sure i squeezed everything out of these guys and uh yeah let's go see what we got quick look at what i got going in the veg tent these girls are happy they're gonna get transplanted pretty soon into their five gallon homes that's what we got going maybe i'll stop by the flower room as well so we got going here in flower let's take a look at the dosie though stacking up nepali pink right here got my gmos in the backs they both have gotten tore up man i think there's a little bit of thrip issues i got to deal with i'm probably just going to chopping them down quicker than later save what i can for hash and yeah we'll see down here i got my two supremes and same with them both the dosito supremes nepali that we're going to be coming down within the next two weeks so i'm not too worried but the gmos they're not going to make it to week 12 with the thrift damage i'm not even going to [ __ ] with it i'm going to get them out of here soon just hash them out and uh yeah get this tent cleaned up super clean as clean as i can this whole room actually make sure there's nothing left in here and uh bring in the next round yeah this is kind of hard i don't have a tripod right now it's in the other room uh so i'll just get back to you once i collect all of this and yeah we'll see what we got from here so just got done scraping up everything from the first five grand press of the gmo so what we got i don't know if my phone will zoom in so anyway guys i'm still you know i'm learning this i still have a lot to learn when it comes to pressing rosin i wish i could be making bubble hash and pressing out the bubble but it's just too warm where i'm at in socal and i can't afford to set up a cold room to make half so right now i just got to settle for uh pressing my flower and uh honestly i really enjoy the full spectrum that i get from the flower rosin so anyway i'm gonna go ahead and collect up the rest of it and uh let's see what we got we're gonna get to scraping up the second stuff the second batch of the gmo i wish my camera could pick this up and smell so good all right i got this uh second press of the another five grams this is the one i did at 195 and i mean it's just greasing up it's so greasy i'm sorry my phone just won't pick it up she doesn't do justice um i'm gonna go back into these little little dots i don't like to leave a mess but uh yeah i'm gonna go ahead and add this to the pile of the gmo and i'm gonna let that sit and cure for a few days and have at it anyway you guys thank you for uh watching this with me and or i'm faded thank you for uh tuning in and if you like the content of my page please uh hit like and subscribe and join me on my journey of growing and pressing rosin i wish you all many blessings and love peace", "LlrJgCBATaY": "what up y'all chill boy bacon babe I just want to bring you guys a quick video showing you some different rosin I just got this gorilla glue rosin back from my boy who vac purged it for me because basically I collected on top of some dry ice and so the rosin collected moisture so you threw it in the back of him for me and as you can see at that fire fire looks really good really nice color see right through it so there's that one and again people will say that looks dark but it's funny because this is a gram actually this is a little over a gram and this is the same thing straight up clear but yeah oh the dust and the hair and it that people think right my shits clean so there's that right and then this will give you a different view so there's that and then I've got some of this gorilla glue which is the stuff that I've been smoking on for the past couple weeks and this is a thick little puck right here but it just goes to show you kind of the different consistency that you can get there's kind of squeezing this down just from how stuff cures you know this stuff is more stable and then I've also got some black sugar rose rosin that I pressed out earlier today it's a really low yield err so I don't really do it often but I got a gram and a half off of just under 10 grams so that's what I normally get around 12 to 16 percent of the range I think I've pulled on it it's got just a really cool color to it it's really stable grab this here you get y'all just breaks off so it's super stable and so I'm gonna go ahead and actually take a hit off of that I'm gonna go ahead and close up this big guy here close that up and that's about 36 grams right there so I'm gonna try and get you guys a cool shot of me pretty much dabbing this and the clean email hopefully I can cut through here clean get a nice strip off broke all right so you guys can see what that looks like and let's see if I can get this for you and this is fire [Music] superbomb super stable all right peace out", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I

green and today we're gonna do a hash press pressing video I'm gonna show you guys how I'm gonna press all this into hash this is all my bubble hash as you can see it's really top grade it's finally dried out now guys so we're good to go to press it and make some hash hash balls so I'll show you this a little bit here it's pretty sticky but that's pure milk guys beautiful stuff stay extremely sticky so I'm gonna do my best guys I got myself in here what it is is it's uh turkey oven bags you just get at your local grocery store and then this wine bottle I just filled it up with boiling boiling boiling hot water so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna give her [ __ ] with this and by then I have an iron on standby but I'm not gonna need it I was gonna use it to try and D kharbut but the bottles gonna melt this stuff like nothing and I'll show you guys that one side yeah once I get you set up so what I'm gonna do guys is I'll set my camera up and everything and then I'll get back I'll show you guys how its melting and stuff when I start to press it and we'll go from there okay guys so here we are what I did is I just moved it onto the onto the plastic the oven bag and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start melting it and pressing it with the wine bottle over there I need to use oven mitts because I'll burn myself with the bottle they're not really oven mitts but just some [ __ ] there what you want to do is you want to have your paper nice and flat across it all I'll grab your bottle and then just sitting it on there I can see it starting to milk you guys see that see how it's melting trying to keep you guys good view there but I'll have to start adding pressure guys because do this two-hand thing but see it melting guys so you kind of got to use a little bit of your weight as well and that's a slow process but I'm just doing this so I could show you guys the melt and then I'll start hammering it out so you guys can see that melt there now all right see how beautiful it is just melting all together it's like a liquid so anyway guys I'm gonna luck I'm gonna continue to roll this I gotta be somewhat quick but I'll roll it for about a half hour or so and then then I'll roll hash balls but right now the thing is is to get it D carb and I gotta do this then I need to flip sides but you could definitely see it melt you know what I'll finish this and then I'll show you guys oh well it melted but it's got to continue to melt remember guys this is just hot water in a wine bottle i boiled it to 103 degrees Celsius I think that's around 220 Fahrenheit that's what you don't want you don't want that Ripple it's alright though I'll fix it look at that guys your milk just from a wine bottle over top of it Pierre Pierre Pierre unbelievable a Pierre milk does caramel just from dropping a wine bottle on there for a couple seconds anyway guys I'm gonna get at it and I'll give you guys I'll update you guys in a couple minutes okay guys so it's coming along pretty good I just wanted to stop here for a second and I'll flip it over show you guys look at the full health or what guys so now I flipped it over and I'm gonna do the other side it's only been about five 10 minutes of pressing and I want to do this for at least a half hour guys so I D carve everything properly and and just so we do a perfect job on it see it's too hot now it's like an oil pushing I'm pushing it all up okay guys I'm going to continue like this okay so I just keep rolling you guys and then I'm like moving the paper around as well I'm like turning it but it's really hot guys when it's pushing all the one side I just got to roll it on pretty much just gentle no wait it works out pretty well now I gonna let it cool a little bit flip sides look at that guy's that's not beautiful Dan that's nice the way that's melting I can't even apply pressure to this stuff because it just rolls it all into one spot but it is definitely D carving and that's what you call well-known people so I'll be good and I won't need to reheat the bottle okay guys that's good enough for me now now that's how I'm gonna let it cool a little bit leave it awesome that's breasts Oh unbelievable a very very nice stuff very nice okay so I'm gonna let it cool guys then I'm gonna do my thing have how I'm gonna make my hash balls so I gotta let it cool though before I start trying to take that apart so I'll get the video back up in a little bit here I wish you guys could smell this right now it smells so delicious guys look at how beautiful that is nice very nice full melt wine bottle 100 degrees Celsius a little trick I learnt from the pro in the game not even half as good as that guy but definitely produce some decent looking hash good tasting hash and Ashley gets you pretty good in high okay so now I have this part on so I can show you guys how to get your hash back to hell you have to how you'd want to have it fold it in half try not to get your hash like stuck in the creases of the cellophane see that yeah [Music] I didn't realize how I have that Sylvain they didn't realize I have it folder so he put the sound guys for the annoying [ __ ] I wish I knew I had this bulb it I thought it was just one sheet guys so you see you just kind of keep folding it until you get it to the size lon yeah smells a little crazy so crazy yes I should be telling you guys what I'm doing here sorry I kind of just got stuck in the moment but yeah I'm just trying to get the ball down sighs now you know you got to stretch your paper let's get stuff cause it's stuck in the creases guys so I'm gonna do one more fold here trying to grip the bag sorry about the sound guys pause this and fix it oh you guys I'm sorry about that I didn't know it was a double wine bag sir those I'm trying to fit into a nice big bowl and I'll do this for about five ten minutes and then it will make a beautiful beautiful ball so pretty sticky stuff okay guys there it is follow hash now I'll let that sit and cure for a bit probably perfect full mouth that can't even stay as a ball guys flatten right oh it's unbelievable that sir days sorry I gotta go there my suffers

of high society I appreciate every single one of you and for my Spanish speaking audience bienvenidos a mi canal en este canal for mamas marijuana de calidad aqui in California here it's almost a full mark as you guys can see by the title of it of the video this strain we are smoking today is wedding cake and it's live rosin once again one of my favorite type of wax waxes same brand 710 labs it's wedding cake doesn't say much it all all it says it says THC milligrams is 742 over 39 milligrams and then CBD milligrams is 1.43 milligrams there's Graham here cost me $79 I'm gonna tell you guys the exact amount at 779 with 77 cents with a discount with a 30% discount that I got from flavors in riverbank California it's $23.99 and then the state tax is four dollars and 26 cents county tax 14 cents and then it says state MJ tax $8.37 and then it says City MJ tax $2.80 total tax fifteen dollars and 57 cents it's incredible what they're taxing everyone and dispensaries nowadays I don't know if if it if it arranges between you know between cannabis cannabis dispensaries if it's different but where I went this is how much the taxes was total tax was fifteen dollars and 57 cents so at the end of the day it comes down to seventy one dollars and forty cents is what I for this garam you guys can check it out see if you guys hopefully you guys can see it I'm going to try to cover my information about my personal information I hope you guys can see that and down here let's see if you can see this and then it says flavors and then it says the address riverbank California everyone I've checked other dispensaries and they do not have this 30 percent deal going on so I'm assuming it's just at flavors yeah that's basically it everyone I believe this this gram here is a hybrid on the hybrid side it just gets me going and gets me wanting to do stuff you know not just be sitting on the couch all day you know couch locked check this close up wedding cake live rosin cheers 273 subscribers everyone you know you guys think there is other types of life on other planets in the universe you guys think there's other life forms or other planets a lot years away from Earth so honestly I think my opinion I'm gonna say yes there there is aliens on other planets is um how how would these aliens look they definitely have to be they definitely have to look different I'm assuming aliens are real I want to say I want to say aliens are real everyone just because I watch a lot of ancient aliens and everything they talked about makes sense it's just I've always been fascinated about if there is other life forms on different planets you know light-years away and I want to say there is you know just because we haven't reached reach them or we haven't been able to get the technology to explore other planets doesn't mean you know they don't exist I want to say they exist we've seen I've seen countless times of some type of signals signals earth gets from outer space and there's an episode of ancient aliens about Tesla Tesla the mad scientist how he was gonna make anti-gravity energy and how that was all gonna solve everyone's energy problem you know and then I don't know everyone everyone please go take take the time to go check that episode out on ancient aliens on Tesla's inventions discoveries or whatnot everyone I think there is alien extraterrestrial life on other planets different universes in the universe in the galaxy all that and I want to say earth used to have from watching ancient aliens I want to say earth used to have advanced technologies but from what I for my understanding it's um something keeps happening to earth where we get wiped out either by a comment asteroid whatever it is and Earth's ends up ends up being uninhabitable enough talking let's take this dab we're gonna go ahead and try to drop off we're going to go ahead and try to drop it in drop and dab everyone if I had my [ __ ] cap I would be able to car cap this unfortunately I lost my carb cap I need to buy a Clark cap and that little ball I was talking to you guys about this is a who now my other nail broke and honestly I was getting tired of it it just I I was I have never came across that type of malware I had some class work inside of it I'm sure it's they had to do something with for having to do with low temp taps but I usually don't have time and take a little time dives Oh honestly I think love time dad's just like ruin your day I want to say just stains your nail this is a new nail I honestly like it it's super thick from the top if you guys can see it and yes I've already been using it that's why it's dirty right here I gotta clean that out but um I'll have to show you guys my other dabber my silicone dabber I have to clean it first before I show you guys the nail on that one is super cloudy I tried to burn it off as much as I could it wasn't happening I think it has to do with with me torching it to red-hot and yeah just basically torching it red-hot I looked it up and it has to do with yeah torching it red-hot it makes it so dark or cloudy or whatever for whatever reason I don't know comment if you do know but we are officially at 73 subscribers everyone cheers 273 subscribers and Counting I try to get thick smoke in here for you guys so you guys can see thick smoke just because I when I used to watch smoking videos that was one thing that I enjoyed watching was the smoke you know how how alpha battle with dabs are you taking now you know seem just just smoke it's on it's time using it I guess you can say yeah ancient aliens everyone I suggest go watch it if you have the time it's on the History Channel we are at 73 subscribe made a donation account everyone and basically it's the reason why the reason behind me making a cash app for these donations are because I am not monetized on YouTube I doubt YouTube wants to monetize me smoking marijuana if the donations are going back to the channel yeah so basically the the all the donations I get from cash app will be going to this channel I'll be putting it all back to this channel to create more content for you guys thank you everyone for watching please take the time and like comment share and subscribe stay positive everyone and until next time Cheers", "wpHNpcakOoY": "you know what up YouTube with your boy baking babe and today it's just a chill session hang it out the grow room doing some cleanup on the workbench and getting ready have a little smoke sesh right let me show you what we got here some of the gorilla glue it's like such a [ __ ] getting this thing to focus just right while also getting close so you guys can kind of see that fire fire fire also got the big ol slab of rosin here about 35 grams that I've been slowly curing over the past couple days because yes rosin needs to cure too when you press it out there's moisture in the bud and that moisture ends up in your rosin and then as you let it cure and suck the the moisture out of this with desiccant what happens is it goes from being very shiny like this and very runny when you run the knife through it to very like like a clay so my phone zoom on this side [ __ ] no of course not anyways let me show you what I'm talking about just quickly here so here we got the slab and then if you look right here in this little spot I'm gonna try and do this without looking at the camera here you can see when I grab this did you see how it's kind of like sappy see how it makes that little string based on how that string looks and how the edges of this swipe looks like when I swipe you'll see the edges kind of move still and that's the moisture allowing that to be very kind of viscous right viscosity or whatever the [ __ ] you want however you want to say the viscosity of it is very like moveable stone right so when it's dry that edge stays solid for the most part it won't move once you put the knife through it it'll make its part in the ocean and then it'll just stain out of walls that go to the side will not move if there's a lot of moisture they'll still sink back down so that's one way I look at and see if it's dry anyways cleaned out the the rig today super clean I hide it in the fridge for a little bit so the water is nice and chilled got the bowl banger really nice and clean and it was just I guess it was a productive day because I cleaned out all of my little what do they call these again puddle pushers puddle pushers I got a couple of those I got the flower ball and then I got the thick quartz banger here I like this bowl but not as much as the banger the beggar who stays hotter because of the thermal barrier but it gets dirty and it's harder to clean because it's double walled whereas the single banger it's just one think wall so I could torch the [ __ ] out of it and it gets cleaned pretty quick the thermal banger it has the double walled installation right there so it's really hard to get that inner wall and especially in between clean and then I also picked up this one for the email which is awesome and just a skinny bucket which helps prevent oil from getting all the way back up in here when you take your dabs that's like really really clear the [ __ ] out of the rig some of you and there's no need for that when you carb cap I'm your dad that's all you need to do you don't need to hit it hard and clear it like a bar grip not until you the very very end otherwise all you're doing is sucking all that oil that's in the bowl straight back up through and getting in this nail and you'll see it just flow up and go straight in and that's what happens when as soon as you cap it you try and it's super hard just keep hitting it normal that's my little pro tip so without anything else to say I'm just gonna go ahead and take some dabs now you guys I got all the care packages together they are sitting right here I know you guys probably don't believe me because I've been for fascinating on this trays alright so let me show you what I got in here I mean we fix this camera and bring it down some I'll show you what I got okay so [Music] first off we got [Music] d'etre I can get all youth off all right Snoop stray really nice badass right and then I threw in a bunch of uh just slaps but I had right so these are all in here all these different slaps you got a gram of my gorilla glue rosin and then I also threw in I had a bunch of seeds that have been gifted to me some of them I even bought but I haven't been growing from seed out here I've been growing from clone only just because it's more reliable and I have to cater to certain markets so for me I don't have time to pop seeds and I'm gonna hook you guys up with some seeds so they're all different one of you guys is gonna get these to see these concave and its original packaging you know and then one of you guys is gonna get you know some of these sharks bread and a couple other different strains in here one of these guys gonna get some Martian candy some blueberry blueberry in there and then some cheese quake as well so those will be going out this weekend because I have to go out of town next week to Chicago for work and yeah that one's gotta go so look for those in the mail I have all of your addresses still this is a very healthy sized AB it may not look like it holy [ __ ] it is okay [ __ ] this camera so torch it up I hope you guys are having a poo amen it's been a very very big learning experience for me over the past couple weeks basically in this whole harvest I put everything I had all of like my last dollar my last you know a little bit of energy everything went into harvesting as much as possible with as much quality as possible and then pulling it all down and pressing it into rosin I mean I pressed a pound and a quarter of a bud in terrassa took a lot of time a lot of work I learned a lot and then when I went to go sell it all I couldn't sell a gram of rosin for 35 bucks work - for 60 I tried got this local taco sash or the you know it's a local session where vendors come together like a flea market and sell all their stuff but if you have anything good it's not it's not worth your time because you can't get your money I mean my [ __ ] is fire some of the best stuff there I haven't I didn't see anybody stuff that was better to be honest and that's not just Tooting my own horn there she is you have to cater to the right market right so where I went this sucked this session is a San Bernardino and it's kind of a low-income area and I'm taking high quality product they're trying to get rid of it and even out that grade of a prize people would rather spend $25 for the 16 grams of this outdoor [ __ ] right here you know so it's hard to make your money in a place like that so what I really learned is don't get your head down always keep pushing and find the right market for you if your product is really good quality don't sell yourself short by trying to go and sell out and a forum where people are cheap and not going to eat what it's worth find a different market right you know you gotta cater to the right people so that's something I learned also you know before I started pressing all the rosin out for this this harvest somebody offered to buy all my bud you straight up and me and thinking oh I'm gonna turn him into rosin it and make even more of a profit and then I couldn't get rid of it when I did that so I learned never [ __ ] say no to money if somebody has cash on hand you [ __ ] get that money you get that money because no matter what you think is gonna happen tomorrow what deal might come at the end of the week it may or may not come and then when it doesn't come you're going to go back looking for that you know potential buyer or that money that was on the table and it's no longer gonna be there and then what are you gonna do so another thing I learned you know the other one is take fat naps so here we go Cheers let's get you guys up close and personal so tasty whoa now I thought I may not have seen like a [ __ ] huge dab not a huge load Tim dab I got a [ __ ] puddle in here like this [ __ ] up real quick guy wasted to taste it one more down because one is never enough no matter how good you think it is so what more do you guys want to talk about real quick let's talk about reclaim holy shoot there's a lot of reclip it's like [ __ ] three or four grams it's really dark but that's because the whole time that all the three claim was being produced boom the rig was set to about 600 610 when you do that you're gonna get that darker stuff right and that's why I went and rinsed out and cleaned out the rig really good today because I'd like to start collecting some more fresh reclaim from just my own use which I dab at way lower temp most people set that emails like 700 maybe 650 at the lowest I've seen most people I dab my [ __ ] at like [ __ ] 550 like even with the torch torch it and let it go all the way back down to about 570 or so before I even think about hitting it and you just get a much better tasting hit much cleaner and your rig will love you for it because when you collect this reclaim instead of getting that really really dark stuff right there you're gonna end up getting more of like amber colored distillate try it try cleaning your Riddick clean your dropdown clean your bowl take smaller dabs yes smaller don't waste them smaller okay and then hit it at a lower temp and carb captain clean your bowl after every [ __ ] hit if you can I don't clean it clean it between every minute with Mike I don't bust out the iso or anything by just q-tip it and then i make sure i tortured up really good again before i hit it and then make sure that you're checking the inside of your bowl for carbon deposits because sometimes i should'a get a get built up and then you'll get little pieces of like black [ __ ] in your drop down and you're like what is that how did I get anything in that it's the carbon buildup from the bowl so I kind of want you guys to see what this actually looks like so I'm gonna grab a square these turn proof squares it was a kind of kind of an investment but damn in are they worth it I love these PTFE squares there are thousand of them for like 125 bucks so just a quick little pinch on that nothing crazy [Music] so you could kind of see what that looks like it's not as dark as it looks over there it's actually really light it's got a nice color to it and if I were to have to smooth that out you can see even better there so this is same thing as this super fire it was super super fire so hey thanks for chillin with me man if you guys are still tuned in on this long-ass video you guys are [ __ ] you guys are with it [ __ ] dude would it there's just four sixty five let's go [Music] super fire you have to excuse my weak ass scoffs right now I'm like still fighting uh whatever the [ __ ] I got sick from sinus infection inner some type of upper respiratory infections so at that time no flower all right one more down because two is never enough and I let that one get a little too cool for six feet nice but so what Christ it tasted so I would like to do a video that is more concentrated more focused you know I don't really have a script for these videos I don't enter them because I don't have time and if I try to edit them they never get posted because they just sit on my can here and I don't have time to do it so I'll try to bring you guys raw videos but if you guys have like a Q&A type of situation you're interested in let me know drop it in the comments I would love to do like a live session once a week where we just come together have a little sluggish everybody chill smoke and you guys can do a Q&A I mean I don't know everything not even close but I know a lot and I know I could probably help a lot of you guys out weed garden questions processing rosin whatever you know me I don't have any secrets really so whatever I know is free knowledge for you feel free to pick my brain if you guys are interested if you're in the Southern California area and you're interested in having a rosin Crescent bill I do custom-built 10 tons Tony Tom presses with gauge without gauges manual hydraulic or air operated all the plates are custom made by me controllers made by me all of that so hit me up also if you're interested in having your flowers pressed drop me a comment or shoot me an email a doc Jay Madrid ma driv a 9 @ gmail.com I'll leave it in the description so for those of you that don't know when you go to a store to buy rosin know what goes into the rosin right quality and quality out usually 20 to 25 percent is average on decent flour so with that said you can expect it to take anywhere from 4 to 5 grams to produce one gram of rosin with that said if it's quality flour here the average price per gram it's ten dollars a gram that's the fair price usually you can get it a little bit lower if you're buying more than that you know you can get like a 35 or $40 8 but it's a 4 gram 8 sometimes but if you know like the hookup you should get it a little bit cheaper anyway it's best set if you go to the store and they're charging 90 dollars a gram for rosin it's a little pricey but understand that you're paying for at least 4 to 5 grams of really good flour you're paying for the mesh bag the parchment or the PTFE you're paying for the time to pre-press it all to press it and then collect it and then if the person that's you know pressing the rosin knows what they're doing it also takes time to cure it properly so don't feel like the prices that you see are too high if you see fifty dollars a gram $60 a gram for rosin you better scoop that [ __ ] up big fat dab Cheers [Music] set my [ __ ] temperature gauge aligned [ __ ] [Music] she is so [ __ ] good I wish I wasn't sick I can't even take a fool hit me without coffee a time's the charm hit me up this time s rosin time", "Ra6Dn9tq7ks": "[Music] hey guys what's up welcome back so here we are today we have a fantastic video planned for you and I know this because it was one of the most watched videos on my original channel and is above and beyond by far the most requested to be re uploaded here on the new channel but instead of doing that we're gonna clean up a few of the little mistakes that were in the first video and just make it a little better and we're just gonna make a whole new video so before I go any further I'm making this video for educational documentary and safety purposes only I do not support promote condone or glorify any dangerous or illegal activities be smart about this guys this is simply a PID controlled heated plate system nothing more nothing less so again this is well within YouTube's Community Guidelines and does not glorify promote condone or support dangerous or illegal activities so the DIY PID heated plate system we all know that most of the confusion is wiring the whole thing up with the PID so if you're just here for that look in the table of contents at the very beginning of this and this will give you a timestamp to that point otherwise let me go over the components real quick what they are what they do kind of how they their job and also how to search for them because I'm gonna give you Amazon links to everything you see here will have an Amazon link even specific drill bits and taps if you don't have that stuff already but if an Amazon link goes out I want you to understand what this actually is so you can search for it on your own or something along those lines so not any further let's let's get into the components here what this consists of mostly is the PID the relay the thermocouple heaters aluminium plates a mounting system and a box to put it all into as well as some wires connectors and m5 screws and some really basic stuff again so everything will be down below the main component itself is the PID this is the brains of the operation this is what's going to control power to and from the heaters to turn them on and off to then heat the plate steers at higher temperature so this guy control your temperature and basically again be the brains of it it's gonna do that in tandem with two things that are supplied in the kit that I have here this is an Inc bird 106 ITC 106 VH and this is basically good for US and European it does a hundred to two hundred fifty volts very common very easy to work with anyway it comes in a package with a thermocouple ready wired up already has your terminal connectors and a quarter twenty screw end that we will put into the plate side as well as it comes with a 40 amp relay now you can use the 25 amp relay and save yourself five bucks but yeah it really doesn't matter things are so cheap and either way it's well within it and this is what's gonna actually cut the power according to the PIDs signal now again I believe most the confusion of the build will come from wiring that up even though it is very simple we'll go over that next down the line is the heaters now these are the these are and were the most challenging to obtain in the original build and that's because they come from China these are called cartridge heaters now that term cartridge heater is what you guys need to know when these links go out of stock or I miss some or this or that so this specifically is a hundred watt AC cartridge heater so that means it's going to use AC or alternate current power which is what you have in your walls and it's going to use about a hundred watts of 100 watts which is 100 watts of heat in this case so if you can't find this specific one they make 120 watt ones they make 200 watt once they make 40 watt ones they make 80 watt ones they'll all work but I'm specifically recommending the hundred watt ones for the ease and compared to the original build I believe people are stocking these stateside now and we will be able to get them much quicker so anyway very simple cartridge heater cartridge heater is your search term and that's what's going to get you to the right product so next we have the plates themselves now these are the these are the bronze of the build the PID was the brain these are the well I guess technically the presses but this is what's going to be heating up and actually applying pressure to whatever you have under here so what these are are these are three by five plates now on the original one I did a big 6 by 6 plate build and you can still do something like this this build will still work it actually the plate size is more or less irrelevant at this point what you're going to be searching for is bar stock aluminum and again this is a three a three inch by one inch by five inch long profile so when you're searching for a loom aluminum bar stock online eBay Amazon whatever it may be what you're actually searching for is this width and height so again this is one inch by three inch and then I have it in a five inch long segment here and I have two of these now the links I provide you to Amazon or to a supplier named stoner metals he has some really good profiles available both 3x5 style and bigger five by five six by six style usually impairs fantastic shipping I got these plates these ones like two years ago for like 18 or fourteen dollars shipped and I got my big 6x6 ones for under $30 shipped to my door so I really support him and his his little thing anyway any aluminum bar stock that fits your your needs or your profile will work now with these plates also comes a little bit of machining we have to machine some holes in here for the heaters to slide in we have to put a ground and we often the thermocouple spot right in the center there so we can know the temperature of the plates now this is very simple I'm not here to show you how to drill and tap but I highly suggest you have a drill press for this though it can be done with a hand drill it's not ideal and for this build I'm going to be using four heaters two in each plate and what that's gonna do is that's essentially going to guarantee me a very quick heat up time with the first six by six build it was a little slow combining one heater and massive plates now we're completing two heaters into smaller plates I've already tested this the heat up time is like two minutes it's awesome now to mount this to the press we've done the same thing as we did in the old build and this is the floor flange this is a one and one and one quarter inch floor flange for plumbing um it may look a little more familiar to you guys with the wings on the side here it's a nice circular floor flange what I did is because you have to get the one and a quarter to make it go over most sized Rams check you might be able to get away with one but nonetheless it's wider than these narrow plates you see this this half would hang off here which is totally fine if you don't want to dine this off you can leave it on there it's just aesthetics at that point on two screws is more than enough so anyway I marked it cut it off so it fits on top of the plate really really nice two screws m5s to mount them on there very simple very easy and it goes I'm very quick the last part is we have to set the set screws and this is what actually kind of pinches the RAM and holds it still in the first build I had a collar that went up and you can see it was kind of big and bulky well we don't necessarily need this extension and we drilled right through the collar that's already built in on the floor flange and it worked fantastic m5 screws right through there again I used a drill press but be careful if you're not and five pinched in there very nice last of the major components of the build is this project box and this is in the first build I used a basic junction box from Home Depot anything that's gonna clean up your build flow work even if you had a wood box there's nothing of temperature or anything as long as your connections are good you can make a wood box but this is a ABS plastic project box from bud Industries is very cheap it was like seven or eight dollars shipped perfect size really cleans up the build and all we had to do was machine a forty seven millimeter by forty seven millimeter square so the PID can slide right up in there just like so and then two holes on the back so we can have power come into this box and then power go out of this box to the plates that's it and it closes out very nicely and in the end will look very good next to your plates so in the end you should have a system that looks somewhat like this very clean ready to go and mount on to any press system that you have for a build like this I suggest six tons to twelve tons you don't need definitely don't need more than the 12-time but if it's a cheap twelve ton press it's probably really around ten or eight so you get the picture anyways six to twelve tons for this build the most you're gonna need you have bigger plates you can go twelve to twenty you have smaller plates and go less you get the picture lastly there are some key components here we have sixteen you can get away with eighteen but a 16-gauge power cord one or two of them works fantastic once you can actually just bring in power from the wall very simply to your box and then another one so you can actually connect the plates from the box that do carry power with a nice jacket instead of just running wires you can run a jacketed power cord that's a little more protected so you have to go buy any extra sheeting or anything like that and if you're really in a pinch you can take one eight foot power cord and cut it in half and you have a four foot power cord and a four foot extension a little jacketed extension run there last couple little components here we have some peach I believe these are PG 11s yes PG 11 gland connector or cable gland connectors only need two of them very simple and then we're gonna need a handful I believe it's five or six I use WAGO connectors but you can use a wire nut you can use any kind of quick connector wire connector or you can solder but anyway if we're gonna need about six of them I'm gonna recommend the three packs they work very very well but if you happen to have like a variety pack with the five packs for the twos they were will work for somebody you need a lot of more threes than anything without further ado let's get into the wiring let's talk about the schematic the wiring and then we will I'm going to do it all for you outside right out here in the open and then we're gonna do it you're gonna watch me shove it in the box because it's hard to show you shoving it in the box because there's that that technique of shoving it in the box you got to make it fit and that parts not pretty but we will show you up show you in a nice open space where all the wires go explain the diagram let's get into this okay guys so let's wire this up let me talk about the wiring real quick that will actually wire it up so what we are looking at here is one of my beautiful diagrams if you would rather look at the instructional version it'll get you to the same place so go ahead and the instruction version I believe it's on page 4 the instructions looks like this right here or if you forget that one you can turn your PID sideways and the 106 VH has it right there on the side all the terminals that are gonna get connected and what they are but lucky for you guys you have me and I have created this beautiful drawing see there's a lot of colors I think you want may understand what's actually here but these wires are what obviously are confusing so before we go too far let's actually check out what the wire what the colors of these wires represent what they're doing and kind of where they come from on this diagram so we have both AC and DC current going on in this setup it is mostly AC there's only a little bit of DC but here's how they're all represented the black solid lines the big black solid lines will be the AC hot and that's going to correspond to when we actually do get our power cords we have a black wire that is our AC hot now the next one is in silver because we're on white paper this is actually gonna represent our white wire being our AC neutral and you can see the third one here green is ground whether we're on DC AC doesn't matter green or yellow will always beat your ground and they can be the same after that we're gonna have a little bit of a DC like I said we only have a little DC action and that's represented by some dotted lines and we're gonna use red and blue so we don't confuse the black that's AC hot so dotted red is DC positive dotted blue DC negative and like I said green ground is always going to be ground whether we're grounding a DC connection an AC connection it is always grant and lastly I have the thermocouple as a blue and red combined little solid line and that's because right here the thermocouple comes as one piece it is only at the last two and a half inches here that it splits off into its positive and negative and they clearly it comes clearly marked as blue and red so when we get to that it'll be very very clear so is why the thermocouple itself is a little different because it's technically DC but it's generating its own current so and as you can see has everything that it's going to go on we got the PID up here got the relay here got the plates here got thermocouple and some wiring in here we have cable glands essentially coming into the box here so this is the full set up bam bam what the hell's actually going on right so it all starts with this all starts with the PID and the entire premise of the whole the whole operation is on the back of the PID and as you can see right here you got some screw terminals you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you got eleven and twelve up the gut but those aren't even used so don't worry about it but that obviously correlates very nicely to my drawings of the PID so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and as you can see from this overhead view we have Liars coming in and out of it let's explain that so all these are as screw terminals you unscrew them you put your wire or your connector on there screw it down it's tight good to go okay so we're only going to be using six out of those ten or actually technically twelve but six out of the twelve screw terminals on the back of the PID here we're gonna be using numbers three and four for the thermocouple three for the negative of the thermocouple four for the positive of the thermocouple when you're using terminals six and eight six for the negative DC to the relay and eight for the positive DC to the relay and lastly is numbers nine and ten nine we're going to use neutral alternating current and ten is going to be the hot from the alternating current so this nine and ten this is your power from the wall if that's the the easiest way to to realize what AC power is just the power from the wall that's cool how about we we wire it all up so start off I got the P you sit in there we got the relay sitting right here we have power coming into the box right here and we have connectors on it ready to go and then we will deal with the power out in just a second so just as the diagram goes let's start with the easy one so you kind of guys see you guys kind of get the hang of it and that's what the thermocouple see it's all one wire except for the very end it breaks out and just as I told you we have negative or blue going to Terminal three we will put them in and screw it down and then we have positive coming out to Terminal four so let's get that under the terminal connector there and screw it down secure so now just like the drawing shows wires three and four blue and red coming out the side the actual PID has wires three and four and blue and red coming off the side let's just do the same for the rest of it the negative DC goes to right underneath sometimes it's easier to turn it upside down so screw terminal falls push the wire in secure it down same for getting a positive DC and while we're at it let's just connect these two you can see on the diagram we have six going to terminal six of the PID going to terminal 4 or negative of the relay and eight going to three let's do that right now take your black go to terminal 4 of the relay screw it down nice and secure take six or excuse me take eight or your positive from be PID and do it to the positive of the relay nice now we're really moving along guys we got the thermocouple connected and we have the relay connected to the PID lastly we're gonna need to get power from this wall plug power here see the other end of it's at the wall comes out wall plug power here when you get power from here to the PID and we're we are going to do that with a black and white wire going from its corresponding power to be correct terminals so for the black wire which is the hot or the the actual power wire here that is going to go to number 10 technically the polarity of this alternating does not matter because for you guys in Europe you have 240 volts and this works for that as well too but for the sake of sanity here let's mmm keep it consistent because what we do run through the relay is going to matter so the neutral AC wire or the white wire is going to run to Terminal nine so now just like we did we have a white a black and a green we're gonna connect the black from terminal nine to the black from the wall connected and secured we're gonna connect the white from terminal nine to the white coming in from the wall power in secure very nice very easy well the next step now is we need to get power running out of this box and we're going to do that you could easily do that by just linking from these open connectors straight over to your the power cord jumper coming in and that's what we're gonna do for most of it except for the hot wire so before we go any further let's just do that we're gonna take the AC going out or the power out to the plates and we're connected to the white of the power in directly BAM and we are going to connect the grounds together now this is green to green and the only connection now the last link between power going power coming in from the wall and power going out to the plates is this hot line and this is where the real a comes in the relay is going to interrupt coming from power in to power out so we're going to do that by connecting from power in so power in right here we have this terminal it's going connect connect to the relay they can connect anywhere can connect to two or terminal one doesn't matter that's going to connect to Terminal four now in my drawing Terminal two so now we have power coming in and it goes to the PID but it also takes a stop here the hot line takes a stop here at the relay now we not take the oh the last open terminal here have the last open terminal on the relay terminal one we're gonna put a wire from here sure and this goes to from the relay all the way to power going out to the plates so now we have a full connection within the relay we have DC power signaling it when to turn on and off and we have the actual power break down below now guys we are to the point that all of this would be inside of this box and at this point only tooth well two things are gonna come out that'll be our two cable glands and one is our power going into it it's actually not coming out is going in and that's right here this goes in and stays there well coming out is obviously the AC power but in addition to that we are going to buddy it up you can go ahead and unwrap your thermocouple now and this is going to run out the back of the plates as well so from here on the thermocouple lot once it reaches outside the box the thermocouple line and the jacketed extension carrying alternating current power to your plates can be looked at at one wire or package of liars okay so this is all inside the box like here we have everything hooked up we have our power coming in you can see this nice little stubby just for demonstration so you see this is would be from the wall going in and like I just talked about you can consider what's coming out as one set of wires because out of this cable gland we have the jacket extension and the thermocouple coming out one so they will both run to the plates and at the other end of them you have the thermocouple quarter-twenty screw that's ready to go into your plates and you have the three wires of the jacketed extension exposed again black for hot white for neutral green for ground so we can set this off to the side now save that for the last connection and what we're gonna move on to is the plates and you can see a little demonstration here but I'd rather I'll just show you so what we have here are the four heater holes you can see these four main holes one two three four so two on each plate are the heater holes that's gonna be done with the twenty one sixty four-bit just bored in there no threads no nothing so that's that's really nice and easy because the heaters just drop in if you want to use a little bit of paste at thermal paste or anything at the very tip to just kind of give it a little suction they can but these should be securely in there really aren't gonna go anywhere once you get your your press and plate system mounted up nicely so we have the top plate we have the bottom plate the center hole what you're looking at here in the top plate because you only need it on one plate because we only have one PID system here is the thermocouple and the reason we're gonna do it on the top plate is because heat rises so this is gonna be the hottest point if we put the the temperature at the hottest point you know anything that's below it should kind of err on the lower side so say you set it to say 200 degrees you know maybe the bottom plates not a perfect 200 degrees but it's like a 190 195 that's a better error than being hotter than you anticipate it for the non measured plate so the thermocouple that's pretty simple as well - that is literally just a screw right in and make sure you torque it down just nice and tight unless you have a a blind tap that bores all the way down you're not gonna get it perfectly flush so this is where I suggest just a little bit of thermal grease or thermal compound in the bottom of the hole so there's no air pocket down there and the temperature matching will be as accurate as possible then lastly what we have is the ground and this is what's gonna make sure that if anything were to happen if any short or anything were to you know arc or anything this is gonna run back trip your circuit breaker and everything's going to be just fine so what I have is I have two green wires here and I put terminal connectors on them you don't have to you can just kind of wrap the wire around the screw but terminal connectors make it obviously cleaner in a little a little nicer these are just getting screwed right into the plates so I have some m5 screws that we've gotten ready here and these will get terminal connected right under there now this is a step I believe some of you guys may try to skip technically the press will work just fine without it but this is a safety step so I suggest you do it and do it correctly so all this is doing again is making sure that if there were any short or anything this would run back and rip your circuit breaker so so now we need to hook up the the wires in so what you'll notice here is there are two wires coming out of each heater ones gonna act as a hot and one is going to act as a neutral now there's no indication it does not matter you could switch these at any point and it's still gonna run fine it's just a resistance heater in there so we're just gonna grab them randomly and so for the top and bottom plate gonna take two wires just grab two wires give them a little twist together and we are gonna put them inside one terminal so one terminal two wires going into one terminal of this way go three connector now if you have a way go five connector for this multi heater build here would be ideal but just double-check that both wires are securely in that Wego terminal you're good to go now take two random wires from the top plate or the bottom plate excuse me the other plate whichever the other plate and do the same thing and insert that into the next one on that same connector again double-check that they're secure by tugging on each wire so now we have four wires connected to this this one way go one from each heater that leaves four wires left out for wires remaining and we're gonna do the same thing but to a separate connector so start with I suggest when you're twisting them twist them from the same plate that way we can separate them later so take the two that are on the top plate here twist them together just a slight twist we'll put them both into their single terminal of the way go and again make sure they're secure and now we'll take the remaining wires from the top plate and do the same thing so we're gonna twist it together right here and stick it in the remaining or itten in the center there's actually two remaining excuse me again always check to make sure this is secure because this is AC power this is where we want to be safe so if you have the juego fives use them here anyway now we have one more to do we're gonna take these grounds and we're gonna connect these two grounds together with a juego three as well okay so now what we're looking at here thank you that in your view a little bit more is we have three juego connectors here which correspond beautifully to the three ends of your jacketed extension so we've already put the thermocouple into the heater plate again make sure that's nice and tight and has a little bit of thermal grease to help it securely in now at this point we are just going going to connect the power out these three terminals to their corresponding connector now like I just said the polarity here doesn't necessarily matter because we've connected one of each heater together and one of each heater together here so whichever one we decide is hot or neutral that's going to be it it doesn't necessarily matter but the obvious one here is green to green ground so this is what makes the connection so we have both plates grounded which will also ground your press and anything else touching to it we have that grounded and then the last thing we're gonna do is take will designate this one the neutral here this group will be the neutral so we will connect it to the last remaining open way go make sure that's nice and secure and then our hot make sure she's twisted up nice and into the last remaining way go so three-way goes three wires in our jacketed extension power out so the last thing we're gonna do is we just have to put the flange on here this is the floor flange that we built already we've put our m5 set screws right through the side bore holes here so m5 set screw right there through the side and then we've already tapped the top of the plates to the corresponding holes right there easy as it gets this is kind of the last step formality if you guys didn't realize this needed to happen this needs to happen and wha-la that is securely on now let's go mount it to a press so I can show you how it works actually let me get this stubby out of here get this ready to show you guys mount it up plug it in is we just have to put the flange on here this is the floor flange that we built already we've put our m5 set screws right through the side bore holes here so m5 set screw right there through the side and then we've already tapped the top of the plates to the corresponding holes right there easy as it gets this is kind of the last step formality if you guys didn't realize this need to happen this needs to happen and voila that is securely on now let's go mount it to a press so I can show you how it works actually let me get this stubby out of here get this ready to show you guys mount it up plug it in and just verify she's working it will work through anything here we have the plate system sitting here ready to go we have not plugged it in yet because before we do I want to go back into the box you have the box we have our power coming in going to where it needs to go signals everything's there you can secure it the relay down with a little bit of thermal epoxy or you can use some very short screws or you know dremel or grind off the back of the screws if they do go through the project box but just secure it down so it doesn't move around and the one key thing we need to do in here is I want to put some electrical tape over these contacts you have these exposed down here these are what we go on to cover so we're gonna take a strip of electrical tape and we're gonna go right over both of these just to insulate them electrically so that way anything rattling around in here won't have any issues so now you can see just got some electrical tape over the connectors here are the terminals here and here for both the AC and the DC the AC is your main concern there you don't want this thermocouple sheathing touching that in any way but the DC side you also don't word out over there and there so we have everything completed ready to go ready to plug it in let's mount it to the press and then we'll plug it in let it start heating up double-check our temperatures make sure things are good so as you can see it's sitting here this is pretty much everything the press comes with I mentioned before anything from 6 to 12 tons will do you're right for this build the more you want to spend on your press to get things like pressure gauges other things like that that's up to you pneumatic doesn't matter but anywhere from 6 to 12 tons with this size plate will get the job done bigger plates more pressure or towards the upper end of this range smaller plates less pressure towards the lower end of this range now the mounting system here it's basically most presses come with these these steel blocks these are great but the one issue we have with any press and any heated plate system is these get hot and we don't want the press to get hot so we need to insulate the plate somehow now there's two points of contact from the plates to the press and that's the bottom plate and it's the top plate to the RAM the bottom plate gets the most contact it pretty much will sit on whatever you put it so what I use here it's just wood most of the time I'm pressing or using this heated plate system under 200 degrees at most 220 and I haven't gone that hot in a long time so a piece of wood here I have a just a little I don't know what this was at the time maybe maybe a little more than 1/4 3/8 piece of plywood or so and it's obviously gotten a little darker and you know be careful we use some kind of insulating material based on your pressing temperatures so I'm kind of silicone pad many of things anyway the bottom plates like I said the biggest contact points also the easiest to insulate the top plate is a little interesting and I don't actually have an insulated now I have too much issue with it but ideally if there was a little silicone pad or something we could slide down right into this into here where the Rams gonna sit that would be our our ultimate line of insulation but as long as you get the bottom and you you press your material quick don't leave all day turn it off you know you should be good to go so no further ado let's get this get this press mounted that all we need to do is when you need to align the plates where they need to go then we're gonna bring the press system down so now we have the press system down the RAM the plates everything's touching the steak yeah I can't move the plates so you don't need to kill pressure you don't need to squeeze it like you're pressing the biggest thing in the world you just want the plates flush and to know where they're flat and at that point we can start tightening the set screws and now I use a hex hex or allen wrench screws for these just because you know when you're torquing something against anything a little more secure but if you if you just happen to use your Phillips or whatever it doesn't doesn't particularly matter but we're just pinching the RAM that's all we're doing we're just pinching the ram and the fact that it's already pressed press down in there so nicely it's nice and sick here now watch we're gonna release pressure and the plate will come right up damn so perfecto I guess it's time to see if all our wiring was correct and plugged this baby in look at that fires right up apparently it's 80 degrees in here already so what you have here on your PID display is you have in green underneath that's your target temperature all you need to do is use the up arrows and down arrows to get to the desired temperature and then press set and at that point any time you unplug or replug in your machine or turn it on or off it'll go back to that setting now you don't need one of the biggest questions I get asked is do I need to program it what settings do I use if you get the ink bird the 106 that I showed you it comes preset and most ink bird pids do and you don't need to mess with any of the settings if you want to get really complicated with your with your overshoot and undershoot you're one of those professionals you probably don't even need me for this video if you if you really need to tweak with your settings the standard PID settings are really really accurate work very very well so the last thing I wanna do is when we're not using the system or when it's heating up I want to to have the plates resting against each other that way the thermocouple well how it works is this plate will interact and these will reach an equilibrium and that'll give the thermocouple the most accurate representation of what's going on because again we're only using 1 PID here see the plates are heating up very very quickly that's that's the whole idea of this double heater per plate system we have almost instantaneous heat up it has been less than 2 minutes and we're already at 160 360 for climbing very very fastly so with a system that heats up this quickly we're gonna want to give it just a little bit of time once it does reach temperature to kind of find some equilibrium get to that true temperature but nonetheless look at this baby go flying plates been sitting here heating up doing their thing really just staying at temperature for the last 15 minutes or so so giving them time to kind of hit an equally equally briam there and you can see I have it at 180 point 5 degrees here for my desired temperature and it is like bouncing right up and on that perfectly for the what the thermocouple of the PID is saying and I can tell you by my hands it's pretty it's pretty hot but to be even more accurate I have a secondary thermocouple hooked up here and this is hooked up in the back right basically where a ground would go and one of those holes I had to I'd kind of accidentally put an extra hole in there so we have the thermocouple back in there and this is an unjacketed thermocouple so it's just raw through my couple inside a hole and it's reading a hundred and eighty-five hundred and eighty-six with just under there and so that's basically it's about a five or six degree difference between what I'm seeing here to what's actually going on and that's pretty good you know we're not going to be perfect and like I said maybe there's an air pocket if we could get our taps or our threads down farther we could get that thermocouple to pinch up the metal itself I just didn't quite have the correct tap to do it I guess but nonetheless fairly accurate here we can totally work with this so for me I know I have about a five to six degree difference so if I want to press at 195 I'll press I'll set my temperature to 190 but that's about that's really it we have we have nothing left to do then retire this and what you're looking at here is a completely functional PID controlled heated plate system so whatever you want to use it for go ahead and do that but thank you guys for falling along like I said I know this was one of the most requested videos to be made or re-uploaded or every so I hope this answers all your questions get you guys back on track for your builds for your references whatever you need this for that's what it's here for so thank you guys for supporting me following the channel if you're not following the channel go ahead and give it a fall give this video life really appreciate it helps it on it helps it along we've we've come back a long way since getting deleted originally but we will continue to produce fantastic safe videos

all right so I've pre-loaded in the bag there let's cheat on there just in case you gotta get it right perfectly centered there you let make sure it's centered let it sit there for at least fifteen to twenty seven let's sit there for like fifteen or twenty seconds this is that Keith try seven so we'll see how it turns out so let's sit there for just about they're not getting really direct but I have a feeling that it we're still getting got a little good return there so let's go ahead hold it up let's see what happens oh yeah uh yeah we did get a little bust here but look at what we go so we'll gather all that the brown and we squash it but look at all that gold there not a beautiful bowl thank you so we'll be able to repress us but we at least gathered the gold stuff that has no uh no the materia shed sometimes I feel really really slow low and slow really slow especially we got teeth because really gushes out of there you already have all the heads so the heads just make a lot of juice and sometimes that pressure is too much for the bad so here you go this is the first press of some nice Keith pieced out uncle stoner this so first thing we're going gather off a good shatter nodes getting all the good raza nice insistence in there okay I'm gonna reshat some doubt wow I can't wait till we repress this yeah and it's setting you know if your bag breaks it's okay just gather it gather everything out of the other bag rhe bag it up and you know just go low and slow and you'll still get the rest of your turn it's no loss of you breathe rip break the back little tips ring us a squash off and uncle stoner never gets a nice little yield even on that gorgeous that looks gorgeous so I'm gonna try that before we do the second press on that that's ever smell so gas inspired I got dry a little bit before your they'll press Wow nice really know what I'm talking about [ __ ] put a smile on my face like Fitz you know what some good at hustling all right let's do this yeah we've gathered it now we're gonna put it in a new bag gather all the stuff and do a second thrust on this put it back in there okay so we second press this course she didn't know nothing came out here that doesn't happen we still got something a little darker because we had to Trump to heat a little bit we still got something I still like that first dress though ooh wow really good smell though oh wow really a salary can like a super sour mm-hmm hmm really nice this is uncle stoner now we're about to head over to soma do a little interview with him check that out on my next I G TV post this is

all that rosin 83 grams of rosin I smoked it already by the way it was pretty quick if you didn't know this was all done on the peer pressure rosin press no we didn't max out the pressure I think we hit 66 psi so about half pressure we're only using half of this machine I promise you if you crank this machine full power all you're gonna do is blow out your bags you're gonna watch your rosin poop flower and that's horrible when it starts popping flower anyway I hope everyone's having a good one enjoy put your pants on kick ass peace cannabis love [Music]", "cHHtBTcVXg8": "I'm really gonna try

nice little sack oh that might hold up it's kind of Leaning and I've learned when it leans does that mean it means we're not getting a good flat you just gotta give it a little encouragement see what happens who's gonna wait a minute here not that warm up it's not fully compressed if we have some concern this urgency just can't see what you're saying yeah it looks good good enough to me all right just let sit there like that for like about a minute [Music] Alexa start a timer for six minutes okay I'm gonna sit there for a minute really hoping to has like big I'd like to have big numbers on this one [Music] okay just about there and we'll give it some more pressure we're just still kind of heating it up looks like a slow process now I I keep mine at a hundred ninety degrees so I it's a little bit slower and I'm only using just the one arm I'm not really going extra with the pressure let that sit there for another minute sitting in the basement look at me you go understand I'm looking at the shell across the board cannabis oh no what happened what happened that is looking at everybody they're so pissed don't mean to dis but it's funny looking at these dudes that Colin bummy where I'm from they do everything that looks so damn cool but they forgot to go to the rule that all they want to do is just be cool just be yourself that's all you got to do to stay true to the one fat dude if you just stayed cool too you can underestimate any single game but just keep being cool understand that I'm not trying to be rude just want you to know when you act like an ass home you don't get too far but if you be cool you're a star I mean can you see these bars flowing at your ear seeing Birds that's what your ear does understand it sounds real funny cuz it is seeing words [ __ ] don't you know you ain't on LSD you heard but maybe I'm just tripping out listen to me rum up now yeah that's about max pressure that's better whether you like it or not look at me your little snot-nosed kid I mean you little dirty brat I'll beat you with a two inch bag so we're trying we're trying so a Gris if you're taking a Gris right take one of those straight out straight out the out the box and then you smash it usually you get a great return I'm not saying that we're not gonna get a great return I'm just saying I like to see the difference between 40 and 60 you know like as far as money goes like what's that get you what's a 20-hour difference game between our difference is I gotta get you a chance what are you doing that's kind of what I'm trying to say understandably I see no oil say alternate film well you ain't got nothing to say just say I may be yay round the way you say we're not seeing those girl she curses it's a bit of license we did some gushers fry now that there's a little bit I see some common all right now squirt [Music] oh yeah can you see that right there right I always go extra I can't does never leave anything alone every time I just heard it squirting I just heard a pop I was good I heard a pop squirt it's crazy what it sounds like it sounds like Alexis stop alexis start a timer for one minute Alexa Alexa it set a timer for one minute sometimes it takes longer you know I'm still seeing a little bubbling out someone let it ride he just do you when i'ma do me i'ma do i'ma do you know and if I still see movement after after a minute we're gonna let it go again you know it's when you stop seeing movement doesn't you take off the heat this is really that easy from what someone's learning seen and you know pay attention to so I'm getting all movement down here Alexis stop Alexis start timer for one minute disappoint me the last minute but yeah I'm seeing older than all three yes it's gonna be that's gonna be it right here right so I'm just gonna get this whole set up time all right you can see it Alexis stop relax and stop the timer now there's [Music] [Music] nothing not there just take this right out immediately while it's still hot a couple of bits I'll pull off for the banger the bits that blow out the blow out bits if you will those go in the juggernaut very excited okay so here's our puck okay right here okay right a little bit of all right here right you can see it okay but all in all not bad that's all we had like that was sitting on the outside that's what we're looking at that's pure on a dull serrated or straight out straight up at the moms supple nugget all right hey what are you saying route I'm saying that cannabis the female plan is what we smoke dig it so that's the plate Lee smooth great yeah that's female believe me about this female trying to see me the same that makes me feel I think everything's ok is a female well if you want to apply gender torture all right so shout out to Liberty they produce good oil okay I really believe that aaron has a great flower and I'm gonna prove this to everybody with a see no hydration out the pack we all know that these are like six eight this is sick for its second but whatever no worries starts craving it's just like hot right out - so let it naturally cool light light just keep it light you don't need too much pressure okay super-clean [Music] close to my park of what I wanted to be wanting to be at that half hour you'd be done so I had my ex-mother-in-law asked me if I knew what my my kids graduation was and I was like dude I'm talked to him in like 8 years people on YouTube - how do you know yeah yeah maybe she didn't get a crime maybe she didn't like when I was like nah we haven't spoke like maybe she just didn't think it was like what that is 0.25 amazing already have a quarter gram and we're a quarter of the way done whoa whoa that would be awesome right theoretically we had a quarter we're gonna know what we're gonna get it that's what I was hoping for cuz that would be amazing right point three six point three five looking promising people are you excited can you hear the excitement in my voice can you tell that I am getting fired up oh yeah oh yeah point four three let's go I need to see it let me see it it's about the Terps I'll say it - I'm blue in the face dude red flower sucks bro yeah right you suck hello this flower is amazing come on give it to me I need to see it you know what I want yeah 24 eggs that's okay no ways no worries yeah so that we saw that we still got other parts we haven't explored yet don't worry we've other parts we haven't explored yet right we'll get there okay look open wait 90 micron 62 for same entity right by erisa things that you say don't make sense it's a right the competence nah I just threw that in real quick I know political dude so don't think I give a [ __ ] oh [ __ ] cuz it don't matter look running coming at ya yeah yeah that's what I'm saying then throw them backwards dude can you see the inner and outer rings of Saturn things thing point six eight here we go doing great it's check up into the win get a pinfall and point seven three point seven two point seven eight come on still I'll take a point eight at forty all day eighty two point eight two now let me scrape the rest of this I'm trying to try to clean everything up [Laughter] okay let's see we have someone the outside right now at the end of the day we're calling at a point eight - looks like I'll see you give this up give you one more look okay Seraphin like I said honestly sheriffing for the wind like it's super good I'm like very content with that that is out you know completely wrap the package beautiful I like it so we're gonna just sit and cure so this in retrospect right mm-hmm that was 49 bucks so after my discounts 40 bucks I'm not complaining at all all right peace", "5Dx79e0gIVg": "what's up YouTube it's cannabis love today we're pressing some flour on using the pure pressure rosin press we just picked up this unit and I'm loving it we got the 3 by 10 plate so we got the larger plate we got the dual pressure upgrade kit I believe this is a must-have for all you pressors out there a lot I need to go from a low pressure say 10 psi all the way up to a hundred and twenty with the flick of a switch you can even control that pressure so say increasing your pressure by two to five psi per click I mean it is wonderful this option basically eliminates blowouts allowing you to keep your pressure down while the rosin is still flowing out now we have a whole bunch of different types of flour in this video you're gonna see a bunch of different colors all kinds of different strains I've noticed that anything old material at low quality material you're not gonna get nice colors these beautiful colors that you see here we're using low pressure only around 66 psi and lower temperatures anywhere in the 190 185 range even 180s it depends on the material itself so we're doing a lot of press testing like or we'll take 1/2 ounce we'll test it at certain temperatures we'll see what colors we get we'll see what quality we get we see what return we get I'm finding that with the the lower pressure and the lower temperature you can do a second press and get a really high quality second press return that's almost better than say your if you did like a high temperature one press because so much decarboxylation with these high temperatures now throughout this video you're gonna see all kinds of different colors as I was saying yes we're learning I am NOT a professional rosin squeezer but this is for home use we smoke a lot of rods and so that's why we've got this unit so if you're a professional rosin squirter ed there you got any tips feel free to comment below I know this community wants to know more so share now we are gonna be doing a show on the joint tonight Northwest Jay's channel it's going to be a bunch of people press and rosin we're try to learn from each other share that information to the community I'm hoping it's gonna be a wonderful time like for sure now we're always on hangouts Google Hangouts so if you want to come check me out on hang us look me up I will add you we are always kind of hanging out there a bunch of us just chatting about cannabis chat about all kinds of wonderful things it is a great community now pretty much that's it I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you have any questions feel free comment below I'll hit you up at the end of this video enjoy sit back peace [Music]

around 50 gigs that I had to edit down into this seven-minute video we did delete a lot there's some of our lower temperature pressing as you can see it comes out white anyway Cheers peace cannabis

by the way the microns and that's good nap we'll shut it off close this valve come back here I'm using about a minute there we go zoom out we'll close this one this is your air release valve here 50 micron screen keep the dust out so let's release it all right good to go excuse me one second guys do you do all right there you go focus oh oh come on don't be such a [ __ ] there we go so lemon

couple grams and this baggie here some lemon OG we'll see what happens I'm gonna get this all put in there and forgot to put the plate together but I'll let them sit together for a little while make the temperature even out and then I'm gonna put some parchment paper in and put this in and see what we get out of it alright I just put it in there I don't really have anything for pressure on it right now let me heat up for a little bit let it warm up in there starting to bubble oat um it's now looking too bad for just a couple grams in there gonna have to press her down again to get some more a little more pressure on it it's nice that it's leaking out over to frappe put a little more pressure on it give it just a little bit more time and think I'll be calling it good here all right I think I'm going to take you out all right I gotta pull vote end up off the parchment hey not too bad for like two grams of weed I'm gonna put this on the paper and see we got so here's what we ended up with out of it it anyway yet but not too bad I think it's a pretty decent yield for just 2 grams I put that second I did a little second pass on it see the dark dot in the middle that's a from the second press I didn't have my light on my camera so it's kind of hard to see but I did get a little teeny bit older the second press and a decent amount over the first one it's looking good that was pressed at 200 degrees we'll try maybe a little lower tap next time and see what happens all right everybody thanks for watching please like subscribe to my channel check out my other videos I got all

checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "KLJlrNAmy9E": "ny cannabis come with a review on live rosin by evergreen extracts

anyway take a look at this flower here I'm gonna give you a kind of a close-up of it look of it here look how beautiful it is it's been rehydrated okay just looks gorgeous like that look at that really really nice and we're gonna press it in a 160 micron I'm smashing bag bottle textile as always stuff this thing full stuff rehydrates very very well then warming up to some of our pharmaceutical our axes and strains they're not all the way there yet but they're definitely making strides towards being a top-tier producer in my opinion so I get this thing here we're gonna get an old flat down here as best we can yep trim it off like so and we're gonna fold this in and stick it right under here as I get my parchment paper and please always parchment never wax paper you're gonna have a bad time at the very wise paper I liked her friend rampaging I think it holds up better than most of the other ones I'm used but you know everybody's got their own preferences trim off together clean up this edge here and make a directional four and move the camera up here I'm going to give you a nice nice view of this whole situation here so like this in here there we go I'm going to take her and we're going to load this thing up let me make sure that the valve is closed on the press that is if I get a little closer together because it's to my bag okay so do be a good view what's happening here everybody's standards say stay medicated being good to each other out there hope you're doing something good for a patient so what we're looking at I'm gonna get you in real close on this focus it give you a little more light so you can see it the way I do and we're gonna start adding pressure it should not take long to start producing the moisture we've rehydrated the flour with should start helping the commence the extraction process and look at that it's already starting to seep out we're gonna add a little more pressure right there straighten out this paper so let's see it a little bit easier the color some happy trees right there 160s are more prone to blow out so I gotta be a little more gentle with this than I need the 120th beautiful color is that gorgeous oh yeah bringing the soul of this play out that's what we're doing that's the way I approach this play every plant stirring has a soul my job is to bring it out so people can medicate and I just keep bringing it we'll move it out real gently I need four blowouts if we can avoid them it's not the end of the world but it's also not something you really want to back out that shot but because you see how it's spreading across migrating across the plate there and got a complete picture what it's doing oh god this is just looking gorgeous it's making its way to the front if we can get it I don't think there's enough here to try and trip it looks like it's gonna be pretty stable yes that's that's what I'm that's why I don't want to waste my time having to do that I'm just gonna kind of keep working it okay so the feedback that you get with a one sixty bag is much sharper than it is with a 120 yeah I hit it I get to a point where I can just I know if I go past it we're gonna have a as long as it's still producing and you see the production slowed way down okay it's still a little bit going on over here but for the most part I'm not looking at a tremendous amount of movement I think this would be some of the last stuff we're going to get out of here at this pressure point without risking a blowout for those alligator eyes there's one right there that's showing the last of the moisture is being expelled which means you've moved just about down here again for me it's always quality of a quantity so ready to see it let's see [Music] sugary yes yes gorgeous not really not really but it's it's a crystallization that's that's really really nice to see so let me pull shot back out okay we're gonna turn our camera over here get you another shot of what's going on right here we've refocus everything like dial it up here so you can see what's going on now here it is look at that had a little tiny breach all right there see that little breach it just popped a little bit out of there I just had a slight Club and ain't so I'm gonna go into my head here actually I'm gonna use my tweezers on this because this is easy to get a little bit of contamination out right there so here we go yeah especially when you cold start well here's the thing dispensary concentrates we're all trim runs chemically extracted they can't touch the quality that I just produced right now okay that's that right there you don't get that you know get that from dispensaries let me come look at that next on QVC we have Asher's finest rasa just kidding I don't need anybody coming after me but look at the quality of that now I'm not estimating a huge yield here okay I don't I haven't gotten really gorgeous yields in terms of weight and we're gonna find out what we got right now because I hold nothing back from people you get to see it the way I do I don't know in advance we're gonna find out right now that in there just release him nicely oh this is gonna wax up overnight real nice like yourself I love watching it cure okay here we go Oh point eight three four that's yeah it's not bad the quality huh eight three four I got a calculator on their phone so when eight three four divided by three point five 23.8 23.8% yep 23.8 now that's not a typical yield that most people get Preston awesome it's typical for me precipices yeah okay I I specialize in pressing flour rosin there's guys that press it press other things but this is what I'm really really good at look at that stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody I'll be back tomorrow to unbox my new CRD press you watch it for that I'm going to do it live take care", "mnqSYJhebyQ": "hey this is uncle stoner today we're going to be doing some various pressing we got some nice moroccan blonde hash here right there it's a nice hatch uh we also got there we go we got some cd celtic breath is what it is celtic breath see how that smells real quick oh it smells nice look at that you can see that still some uh water a little bit of a nice little crystalline leaves on there and stuff we're not going to trim it up we're just gonna smash it like that and see how it turns out so we got that celtic breath and then we got this new one that no one has ever seen it's a new one that just came out and it is called dorotheo g right dorothy o g o og dorothy og they say there's some uh water leaves on there stuff there's still some nice all right i don't know that well we're gonna show you how we're gonna take this and plus some old keith keeps you see the color right there from uh gdp from ken's gdp oh gd uh gdp 90 purple yep all right some old school granddaddy purple right there it is of course the color there let me show you is a little a little dark but still has a nice terpene smell to it i mean it is going to turn out a little you know a little dark when we press it so there you go and then of course then as i said the moroccan which also the moroccan because of it the way it's they they make and everything no matter what when you press it you're still going to get some dark rise from it it's going to be dark it's not to come out nice blonde or anything like that it will be dark because well start out dark of course once you put on a microscope you can see the difference you'll see gold beautiful but the thc level of this is that i'm multiplying it's going to go up high we've squashed some stuff like this over in amsterdam and it went up to over 70 percent thc level after squash so that's gonna be good so all right so we're gonna go ahead and get everything ready and loaded up and we'll start doing some squashing here thanks all right so we're gonna load this up in here it's a little sticky in there nice and sticky this is four grams of lebanese blonde hash you know it's a good stuff if you have a gold stamp on the back of they actually stamp it with this gold leaf stuff all right so we got the rosin bag all loaded up there ready to squash we're gonna do doing a 166 temperature right there all right so right now we got the hash loaded up into the press and we're gonna start pressing it in one second all right so we got it loader up there now we're gonna go first lower it down to right when it hits the material right now okay so it's sitting there you want to let it sit there for 10 to 20 seconds the best way to do work with hash i've learned is you push it down once you feel it hit you hold it there and once you can sit there and let it press down a little bit more without resistance you keep on letting it go because if you press it too fast and too quick you can wind up having a blowout okay so you see there we're already getting uh some rosin coming out right there we also got some coming out on the side back here also if you can see right back there where it's dark and stuff that's also the rosin coming out we're gonna go and pull this one because you can always re-press so let's see how this one turned out as i said it's going to come out dark but the potency level on this is going to be very insane and very high pun intended and of course i said you can repress that because you can see that there is still some rosin in there so we'll repress that bag again and get some more yield out of it so there you go there's some squash and some rock and hatch excuse me lebanese hash next because it's the same temperature we're going to be doing this keefe we already started to get it loaded up in the bag there and this is a what 25 micron right here we're using i believe oh 37 micron alright so we got the bag almost all loaded up that we should get a nice return on this as i said i'm not sure if it's gonna be that light it might come out a little darkish because this is some older teeth right here i'm not sure exactly how old it is do you know about half a year about a half a year old so this is about six months old or so all right so the keith and the flower is from celtic cannabis all right and we're going to double bag this because i think this is gonna be a little viscous and it also hopefully it'll keep from having any uh first bag burst we're gonna do this one low and slow same temperature as the ash all right so we got it all load loaded up and let's start to press all right you just want to let it hit there we go let it sit there all right so we're gonna polar up you can see here coming out a little bit there this is the key we did have to turn up the heat just a little bit just to get her oh look at that there we yeah look at that and i said there's still some more more stuff in there that we can press out of this bag all right so check out the next video for us pressing the flower", "KXlWRyGYNPE": "hey what's going on guys Zen premium cannabis kamancheh with a rosin press video so this is my first rosin present and I just built my first DIY rosin press I bought this 12 ton press off of Amazon off the recommended list from Green jeans garden DIY video and I bought all the other parts based on that video list and I put everything together and ended up with a little help from a friend building my own rosin dose I'd been pressing some hash that I had from before some dry ice ash but unfortunately when I made the dry ice ash I actually shook it for too long and some of the plant matter made it through the micron screen so the rosin that I'm getting out of it is kind of dirty and dark and not really what I'm looking for so I ended up finding this jar of space dust that I'd put aside and I was like man I'm gonna make some nice rosin so I got out the trim bin and I cut it all up and I pushed it through the dry sip screen on the trim bin and I ended up taking that hash putting it in a ninety micron screen bag and pressing it out and it came out - some of the best rosin that I've had yet so as you can see here my press is put together but it's not totally complete the top plate is not connected to the arm of the press and that leads to a lot of frustration we're trying to press alone due to the fact that I have to wear an oven mitt and slide the thing in by myself and and pump it down so there's a lot going on for for what I'm trying to do here but basically all the cords are together the plates are there and the press is there so I'm making it work quick shout out to uh North Genetics the breeder of the space dust you see a sticker there on the board also the Carpenters cannabis you can see his sticker up there too he helped me a lot with with information on temperatures and times of pressing so I wanted to press both the hash and the blood that I got the hash from the bud that I got the hash from ended up being about seven grams that didn't press that to anything that's how I'm not going to clue that in this video but the hash did come on to something so it will include that the bud would have been nice to get a nice drip shot on but that's okay next time when I get more bud that's nice like this I got some more space dust growing so probably have some trim or popcorn buds from that grow to put into this press as you saw before the hash weighed about 1.2 grams so we're gonna try to get about at least 15% and and see what we can do a via Slee if it's not 15% it's okay this isn't the perfect setup and I don't expect the perfect results so I believe the press time for this was just over a minute and the temperature was 72 degrees Celsius I'm not sure how to change Celsius to Fahrenheit on my AP ID so leave it at Celsius 72 when I press that and like I said over and it was a little long I don't have any info to tell me that I just know people pressing around 45 seconds so I've been experimenting with times and temperatures and obviously as time goes on I'll have a lot more experience in knowing this obviously I left a little bit of extra rosin bag and some of the oil got caught in there so but that's no big deal plenty of it went out onto the paper and it's beautiful man this is some beautiful oil rosin that I've used here and it's by far the best that I Prius and I say that I can ask you with everything with the product that goes in if you don't have clean hash or clean bud or anything that goes into the press you're gonna get out exactly what you put in so all that bad the plant matter like my dry ice hash from before all that's going to come right back out so make sure that anything you put into a rosin press or any sort of extraction game I guess make sure it's clean you know this tells me that I have to refine my hash baking process my dry ice hash was not as clean as I wanted it to be but this space dust was pretty cleaner so it shows me that I can do it if have the proper equipment and I just got to get myself a nice dry sifts screen I'm thinking - 20 microns I'm just kidding we'll see what happens thank you guys for watching follow my Instagram I post a lot more there guys on Instagram saw the show I was impressed happening almost live so

welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 it's a Florida Medical Marijuana review for Florida medical marijuana patients or those over the age of 18 if you haven't subscribed hit that button it's like I say hi to all the new subscribers if you like the video leave me a thumbs up if you don't leave me a thumbs down tell me why you didn't like it all right I was wrong earlier what I described as dry sift resin was actually live resin I was wrong - skater 539 I hope I'm saying that right told me I was wrong I was I smoked something got a little something here smoke alright it's partially my fault maybe partially true leaves I did said the same thing I said on the video - true leavin there like yep as what it is if you go to Blue River terpenes or whoever they are Blue Ridge some yeah blue river under the rose and it says it's cold they use cold and they use screens so I automatically assume bubble hash it's not what they're actually using is what it looks like to me it's actually dried flower but it's not really flower they're more likely using like the sugar leaves and then they're taking the screen and I guess they get the room cold or the stuff cold but it's already dried product it has cured flower and then they're sifting it through the screens are pressing it through the screens with their hands and because they make it cold the trichomes fall off easier so basically they're taking keef and then pressing it in a rosin press so that's what this is is dry sift is basically a Keef and I guess the other reason I keep it cold is so it doesn't the key for the dry sift or whatever they're calling it doesn't stick together when he gets warm and start oil and uh like I said it was half my fault when I've seen on their website how they made it it said cold and screens I automatically assume bubble hash so it's not this is made with dried flower or dried dry sift so I said they're taking the from what I read online it says they're taking pretty much sugar leaves and rub the nose so now I'm seeing why people say in the seventy-five our price is a little high so this isn't bud this is uh leaves and the leftovers I can't use for nothing else is what it's showing me I could be wrong again you never know but the process to make this is dried flower sipped it through a screen in a cold room but to keep it from clumping back up or whatever and then it's pressed so yes you could make this with Keef at home basically and press it if you press the bud you get regular rose and if you press key if you get dry sift so I hope that helps everybody sorry for missing Foreman everybody like I said I got excited when I seen the website and said it was cold and screams and that explains why it smells more like the dried flower than a green flower because a green flower is gonna have a different flavor so I hope that helps and thank you I hope it's a disc 8:00 or 5:30 I know if I'm saying that right we're pointing that out to me I'm not too big dammit my mistakes we'll take a look at that again in case you didn't see the other video on it there we go it's kind of like a sticky play-doh or something it is a little sticky but it's can whisk it around so as you can see it's kind of sticky but it does smell good so that's gonna be it for this video like I said sorry I misinformed you guys this is dried flower or dried leaves whatever they're using for it and that'll be it for this video guys if you haven't subscribed make sure you hit that button hopefully you guys are all choking on something good I plan on putting a couple more videos

masher XP here's three and a half grams that we're doing we're gonna pack it in the three and a half gram next Smasher under 60 micron bag yes and see that we're gonna pack it Bobby textile and reason we pack it bottle textile is for the surface area of the extraction so by packing it up right so it presses like a coin one that's already pressed we get a consistent surface area meaning this round area that the puck smashes it's the same every time we put it in there rectangular way we have to really know what we're doing in terms of size and whatnot because we can change via strain the difference between this and this from a more denser strain can be 30 40 % surface area difference and what that means is different consistency in your return so that's why we prepare a bottle textile like that now to do that we just invert the corners on the bag you can see that I like to use the end of a little dab tool kinda helps me put them in there invert him turn him inside out so that's what the the bag ends up looking like no we're going to do is we're going to put the material in the bag when we start to put material in the bag and we'll pack in a bottle textile we just put a little of the material and somewhat evenly and then once we get enough in about like that we'll go and just take the bag hold it upright and just apply pressure and just a little pressure just push down by doing this it forms the bottom of the bag and makes it makes it round so you'll get this this effect and then once that's done we can put the rest of the product in at that point we're just trying to dump it in I'm not trying to smash the hell out of the product at this point I'm not trying to mix the Detroits with the plant material that's what I'm I want to separate in the actual extraction here so I'm not gonna do that but rather I'm gonna try to pack the bag evenly so there's not any air voids in it sometimes difficult to do but once I get all three and a half grams in the bag any big stems like that one I'm gonna pull especially as the material gets drier you want to pull the stems out say well tear the bags and when a bag gets tour basically what happens is the surface area changes so the consistency of the pressure on your extraction changes and that's what we like to to keep it to a specific bottle tech pack so once we get three and a half grams in the bag it looks like that and it doesn't matter if you're loading a three and a half gram bag a seven grin or fourteen but all kind of loads the same now once we get the product in there when I take our scissors and cut the excess of the bag off if you all can see that I'm gonna leave about a half inch above the material that's all I'm gonna leave and once we do that we fold it up like a present well each of all four sides in so it's folded up just like a present and then that will press up right just like this so once we get our bag off fold it and ready to go take parchment and I like to use Kirkland parchment works really good even if you packaged in this pad rosin and in this for over a year and it's it package is fine holds fine doesn't soak into the paper so Kirkland parchment we get a Costco it's a seasonal item so stock up on it then we lower the plates to be right about the height of the bag what this will do is will allow us to hold the parchment and everything in on this traction makes it much easier the process now the next fee is nice because it has a gauge on it and we know exactly what we're gonna go to here's a little green indicator yellow orange and red indicator on the gauge that gives you the safe zone in terms of if you pack the bag bottle textile like we did in that surface area it gives you the safe zone to go and pressurize and push your material so at this point we just start applying pressure try to put the load right in the middle of the plates once we have the release handle tight here just slowly apply pressure and you'll want to see the bag coming together it has more of an accordion effect when it comes together looks like accordion looks like an accordion that you're playing kind of folds in it doesn't bold it bulge out against the bag which is very important and on this extraction we're gonna go right about a thousand psi a little less than a thousand right here real low pressure and like I said once again we're coming together to get to that pressure stage very slow and the reason is we want the temperature for all the material to be normalized we wanted to be the 207 208 degrees Fahrenheit by the time we reach our 900-page and that would be my dog barking in the middle of the video so once we have once we come right down to the thousand psi which is right here we have full pressure and you can see the extraction coming so it's starting to juice here starting to make nice Rossum QB it's always good to have a little partner a little partner coupie gives me him keeps me company see beautiful color coming out there take this close up it's coming out there really good-looking material this process lasts about a minute minute and a half at the most we should have so go ahead and take pressure off it's been real close to a minute Matt in half we'll see what the results are once again this was just an 8 1 8 you can see the the bag here and then the results now at this point we'll just go ahead and scrape it right off the parchment and it's really nice looking material see that's the puck and then there's the rosin so stay tuned here I'm going to stick it on my collection plate see this is a seven gram bag here and this is a three and a half grand bag so you can see the difference in the surface area seven grand I'm three and a half gram alright so she's a regular collection tool to collect a little dab tool it's smooth on one side rounded on one side he has this flat edge on the other seems to collect a real nice for me when she stick it on a collection plate get it kind of cool right after the extraction it typically comes off real easy we get a little on the tool and then rub it across and it just really sticks yourself and there it is looks like maybe a little under a gram or somewhere right around the ground we got out of this eight way it though and give it to you but you know what it is you see it close up on the product it's really nice smells amazing wish you guys could smell alright stick that there for a sec away this so yeah pretty nice extraction 1.0 2 grams 1.0 - from 3.5 and i plucked a big stem out of it it's got to be real close to 30% or so that's how we do it 1.1 grams back and thank you for watching [Music]", "FfYKegS4kvU": "welcome back everybody this is dan or washington weed reviews just giving you a look at this Do It Yourself cold dry area whatever you want to call it so I did as I basically took this film I made a box I put the event on the top so that obviously we want to still get some air here I didn't worry too much about you know sealing it off or anything like that I just taped it down to the sides and then I ran this duct okay from that into the room sorry Chuck don't mean to get in your way there bro and you know this is all this is not a permanent thing I want to take it down when I'm done and put it away so everything basically just snips apart you know okay and so I didn't bother putting a lid on it I wanted to see how cool it would get just with this so that I could push the air in right here push it down and then [Music] okay so it blows in very nicely okay and then keeping it at thirty thirty nine percent humidity and sixty-three percent are 63 degrees sorry everybody I've been smoking all day and I'm sure that once the plants go in there that it is absolutely going to raise the humidity so that's kind of why I left the top off too and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take and I'm gonna run some bars from here to here okay and I'm gonna make a trellis net that drops down so that I can hang my my buds on there and then when I'm done hanging the whole thing I can I can do it again and I can fit four of those in here with an eight inch spread and so and then I can't eat that temperature at 63 degrees and I'm hoping for about fourteen days so yeah I just thought I'd share so cried out wasn't very expensive at all these are you know the inch and a half panel boards or like twelve bucks and

guys on the next one man everybody out there stay safe stay lift to stay smoking peace man", "TjA1NEGXif0": "hey it's mad at Rafal stereos and welcome to a special three-part episode of canna basics first we're going to make dry ice cave then we're going to press it into rosin and then we want to convert that to e juice this episode is brought to you by dayz screens glass screens quality reusable glass screens and cleaning supplies are available at parley car Matic calm and we'll talk more about them later now in this first episode we're going to be making our own dry ice Keefe and of course we're gonna start with cannabis flowers to do that so the amount that you use is up to you but we're using about 10 grams and if you're using less than an ounce you'll want a one gallon bucket more than an ounce at a time you'll want 5 gallon buckets and then micron screens I'll put links to where you can find these micron screens on Amazon but they're bubble bags bubble hash bags there's what they're generally called and you'll need at least one about 120 or 93 microns around there and then probably a larger one like 220 you'll also want to make sure that you have some good protective gloves for your hands when dealing with frozen co2 because it's very very cold colder than regular ice and also you'll need about 10 pounds or less you usually have to buy it at 10 pounds at a time and that should be enough to do a couple ounces ok the first thing we're going to do is to load our bucket for this demonstration just to make it easy math we're using 10 grams of cannabis flowers we're going to put that directly into the bucket and then on top of that we're going to add our dry ice the dry ice I broke it into little smaller chunks with the hammer a minute ago and I'm using about pound and a half or so with this 10 grams [Music] and once it in there you want to cover it with your bag and for demonstration I'm using this - 20 microns green bag but you'd want to start with your smallest micron screen probably around 93 or I'm using a 120 micron but then once you have it in there you can just toss it around for 30 seconds to a minute just to make sure that everything is nice and cold before you start actually doing the shaking process okay so now we're going to go with our first run and this one I'm using the 120 micron which are smaller screen so once you have everything cold and children ready you're going to turn it upside down so that the cannabis and the dry ice falls on top of the screen and then you start shaking it gently up and down like a pepper shaker and make sure you have a nice clean surface I have a stainless steel table that's very clean but you could also use parchment paper [Music] and then after you've sifted and you start not getting much the sift coming out when you shake the bag it's time to start collecting it you can use a credit card or just a business card or some sort of flat edged material and then just grape it up and then you can put that on a parchment or into a bag or whatever you wanted to use to store it in we weighed this and we had just about a grand about three-quarters of a gram there so now we're going to switch and we're going to do a second run and then just kind of show you a demonstration of what the difference green sizes will do now we've got a two 20 micron which is almost double not quite double the size holes and you're gonna see now when we're starting the same plant material that we use before we're gonna get a lot more through of course we're getting through a lot now of plant material but this is a good way to make sure you're getting all of it out of your out of your cannabis all your THC [Music] and you'll see on the second run we've got a lot more than we did the first time like about five times more yield but the potency of this is going to be a lot less because you're getting a lot more plant material so for our purposes moving forward we're going to use this for cooking and different things like that and then the first batch that we use before is what we'll be using to press for our EGS in the end we're just showing you what we were able to achieve there we had 3.2 grams there just over three-quarters of a grand there so we had just over four grams of Keef in general which was about a 40% yield [Music] before we move on I would like to talk a little bit more about Daisy screens and thank them for sponsoring this video but Daisy screens are like your classic glass screens I remember these from back in the day and the 90s we used to use these kind of glass screens quite a bit but one thing that's really cool about them is other than they keep your bong a lot cleaner and you know a better way to smoke by using a screen is that they're reusable unlike the mesh screens that just burn through and wear out over time these glass screens as long as you keep up with them you can always bring them back to new put them back into your poll and so you're good so one pack of these our last year a lifetime so again visit polychromatic comm to learn more about their products and cleaning supplies make sure you stay tuned to roughhouse studios because our next video or our next canopy 6 video is going to be pressing this into rosin and then we're going to convert that into EGS so be sure to visit ruffhouse studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from FL studios thank you for watching [Music] you", "7t6K3-5S02g": "I was falling down you two I just wanted to show you show you guys something to share this with you guys different Roz impresses and we're gonna break them on down there were strands the different qualities you get all right you guys these three right here our basic different temps different strands this right here is the one that a punch this is the gelato listen up another punch this right here was actual was sent around by seven grams of bug and we got exactly 1.1 grams back and that was not including the second press we just pretty much wins for the higher quality this right here because the consistency of this or can't touch down along with gloves but the consistency of this is shattered real high and as you guys can opener see look at that close off of you guys now way y'all can actually see all right now this is right here is the actual hash I love the consistency that it came out co\u00f1o the pan border but easy to collect this right here o is the hash of the banana punch now this one here was the hash of a chola go very very hard to press I had to figure out the first on this I try to do a little tempers about at 160 Dean work this is the quality that we got back more of a running consistency not pressed long we did about a three-minute press on these now this right here was at a temp of about a hundred and eighty and we got more of a peanut butter consistency out of Toronto so each time is different you guys are overall yield looking the rare prize are close to about 23 grams [Music] yep just wanted to share it with y'all and show you all the difference and higher quality EPS I get a boy I'm John peace", "QNNUrPctEVc": "okay first to set all of the settings you'd want to go into the coding of it so you hold down set until that comes up press it again to reveal that and you would want it to be on H so you can go cold or hot you'd want to be that so press set go up one to go through the settings D should be at zero zero one l5 should be at actually the low limit doesn't matter so it could be negative 20 and just don't have it anything over zero so this can be at the factory setting which is 22 I think or zero nothing over 0h5 should be at 300 ca should be at five or six PT should be at zero usually it's at one that should be at zero and that's it now press reset and that should set the settings and you press set to adjust your temperature and then just reset to have that save so you go back it'll be a 209 from where you set it to reset and we'll go back to it", "06maWSlZQcM": "hey everyone Eric with pure pressure here just going to help you select which bags you want to use when your press and rosin got a couple different bags down here we have everything that allows you to press from Keith to bubble on the 36 micron end of the spectrum 70 to 90 and then the 115 s better for flour to get started got some gloves and get these ready so I've got our quick flip tool here anytime you're pressing with a bag you always want to turn it inside out so you have this easy little tool you just slide it right on the end here put it through and then press it down I'm going to press out the corners and the reason that you want to turn it inside out is that you don't you don't want any blowouts so now I've got my bag inside out my corners are all pressed I'm ready to go so today we're going to be pressing some Cinderella 99 cross with the white this is a great strain we really think it's going to yield quite a bit put that in my tray you have just about a quarter of an ounce here that we're going to pack up so we get a lot of people talking to us and they're asking should I grind this up before I put it in the bag how do I do that we don't actually recommend that you do because then you're getting trichomes that are in your grinder or wherever you're processing it I'm going to take these Nuggets and I'm going to put them straight in the bag and then break them up so take these put it right in start breaking this up with my hands so again not grinding before I'm putting it in the bag I'm kind of breaking it up with my hands in here already so one thing when you're packing these bags is that you really want to make sure that you don't have any big stems in there so if you're pressing some material that happens to have big prominent stems you're going to want to pick those out what you can see now is I'm actually just working this down to the bottom of the bag and I'm trying to fill it out and make it as even as possible so any gaps or spaces that you have in your bag that's where your oil is going to get trapped so is what I'm trying to do is I'm just breaking this up with my fingers filling it out making sure it's nice and even you could definitely fit more than a quarter ounce in one of these six inch bags and with the nine inch bags you can get just under an ounce its evened out so here we've got our bag it's just about ready to go now one thing that I'm going to do here is I'm going to put down and I'm going to put some pressure on it because you want to pack this as tight as it's going to go ahead of time so that when you actually start pressing all the oil has the right path to come right out of the bag got a little extra space here at the end so is what I'm going to do take a pair of scissors and cut off so I have just about an inch at the top there we go cool so I've got a little bit here at the top a little bit of space and then when we're ready to press is what you're going to want to go ahead and do is flip this over before you slide it in so you have a nice little envelope so here we go here is our bag it is ready to press so this is ready to go as soon as we're ready to press we'll go on over you", "XBtyZL7VlOY": "[Music] first of all we got two cups today - teach the insect and pre-rolls this is cookies the first one

YouTube how's it going hope everyone's doing well we're going to press some flour today and you can't read that I just realized but it's 202 degrees right now we are going to squish some flour let's weigh out this empty bag at the zero 11.5 so let's squish 11.5 and see what happens hopefully I can do this one-handed got that in get this in bring about there alright let's squish her let's give it a little pre squish that if that cooking I've never pressed this strain before it's uh it's called in Zayn and he's listening if that sizzle start happening press the gorilla glue got two point seven back from eleven which I thought was really good and I'm thinking this in zine is gonna be about the same listening for that sizzle and there it is he's sizzling I don't know if you can hear that or not alright let's do it let's press this there she comes I really hope this is a good press this strain a lot of trichomes I'm thinking it's gonna press really well yeah she goes that's beautiful there's another jack that's probably it I don't even need to 12-ton that's pretty nice I'll get just as much off the back of this also so looking nice final Jack that's it soon as she stops bubbling she's done this beautiful color I've never pressed in Zayn before the super super dense huge amount of crystal and very potent the stuff is gonna be fire the beautiful thing alright she's done let's release this baby see what we got [Music] see now that's a healthy press oh my that's at least 2.7 back that's probably more like 30% all right well I'm gonna clean this up and then we're going to wait up and then we're gonna smoke some so let's get to that", "JEc8S-NYomU": "[Music] all right all right guys we're the first to do this 2 000 milligrams so on the nuxmaster mini there's really the unit was designed to do two different size smashes um it's really designed for travel personal use trade shows um to go and set up heat up quick and uh then extract either a gram nug or three quarters to a gram nug in a piece of parchment paper with no [Music] bag that's one of the presses that it's made to do which we have here in the back some dosey dough and then in the front we have some chronic kush it's also made to do a three and a half gram smash in a three and a half gram bag like this bottle loaded bottle textile um we advocate that extraction method so all of our surface area to pressure calculations on all of our units have been done assuming that you load the bags bottle textile like i said the mini was made for two two different smashes a single nug smash and a piece of parchment with no bag or a three and a half gram bag smash loaded bottle textile now both of these different uh ways of extraction the different weight of extraction are going to require the same pressure because at the end you're going to get the overall same surface area on the extracted material so if you're up to a one gram nug with no bag it's probably gonna be a little bigger so it'll be a little less pressure that you're applying you know um if you go closer towards three quarter of a gram nug with no bag uh it's going to be uh more pressure on that surface area because it's going to be smaller so you'll learn that as you get a unit and you start to extract you'll see the different different results in and out from the different product and whatnot especially if you're on the growing side so we're waiting for this oil to melt over here we thought it'd be a great time to read off some of your youtube comments on the latest videos believe it or not we actually read all of your comments so let's try to keep it positive um latest video was the bubble hash let's see what you guys are saying so connor 4k hey what do you guys do with the already pressed flower as you can see this is exactly what we do we like to make potent thc oil with it and it actually comes out really clean and really high quality don't recommend smoking it i would personally do the oil 10 times out of 10 with the pucks let's see what else we've got here shady 580 cop watch nug smasher is by far the best on the market you'll get your money's worth and then some my small one is paid for itself many times over i really need to get a bigger and bigger one now production is up well shady 580 we got the nug smasher pro ready for you here just give us a call and we'll get this sent over whenever you're ready what else we got better than watching porn nick garden i'd agree with that porn for stoners i dig it complete wash 86 i could see there's a some similarities there so jared stallman how much material did you start with to get that much bubble hash at once was it nugs and trim or just nugs um for that i don't know the exact amount because our friends over at 11 11 cannabis company uh provided us with the bubble hash but it i do know that it was a fresh flower trimmed right off the plant it was still live so if that answers your question let's see what else danny thompson it's like watching da vinci paint i'm seriously considering picking up a nug smasher at harvest time this year i used to be into the whole backyard blasting thing but figure now that i'm growing the garden of my dreams with all my favorite strains why half-ass it when it comes to concentrates that keef was beautiful i'll always have a soft spot for keith full melts i definitely agree with you blasting is cool but rosin is a lot cooler all right i think that's enough for now let me know you guys thought of that we can keep reading them off like i said we read all of your guys's comments so try to keep it positive if you can [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com to check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our

whatever it is grab a bud flower what are you gonna call it I'm pretty heating the press now it's at 100 I'm gonna go ahead and put it in there and just let it heat up as it gets to 195 and as it heats up I'll just have idea pressure as I'm as I'm pressing out the oils so we'll see what we get out of this place give me one second all right guys I got the bud sitting about that time I'm gonna go ahead and just add some pressure if I was doing about a quarter ounce I wouldn't have a heater bag or something but this is only for girls I think I'll get a better yield this way but we'll see you never know this is some fire stuff and I'll be back with you guys in just a minute all right guys were getting up to temp I'd been adding pressure then whatever as you see we still got a good little gap in there I haven't applied a lot of pressure yet but now I'm just gonna go ahead and I have pressure just in the way to my hand pulling on the handle and we should start seeing go here in the next 30 maybe 40 seconds ending on the press and the product so much let's heat it up and starting to release it we're hitting about 170 180 you can see the oil starting to come out you know I like pressing it like this is because with the bag sometimes the bag knows when you just put the products in there and rosin justly comes running out depending on which one you're pressing or how much how did the product is at least I don't expect puzzles or anything in 24 grounds but I suspect some good good material to get to get some good product good tasting and good good color tam sir right now 184 181 I just added a lot of pressure we should have a little cuddle time you know we'll just let it sit there for about a good 30 seconds maybe four maybe even 60 we'll see it is coming out of the sides pretty good I guess I'm gonna pull this off of you back in a minute all right guys this is what the product looked like I'll get back with you in a minute just give me a second all right guys this is where I ended up getting off of it so I'm gonna go ahead and put it on the scale give me one second all right guys so four grams of some garlic new number for just a little over half a gram three quarters I guess almost three quarters but the product end is pretty damn good she's real amber real stable not oily at all we're gonna do a dab guys have a good day", "MOJQUR2lAtg": "well what do welcome it's your boy damn tray damn tops about to coming back at you with another Debbie episode and where we got for you today what we got for you today we got camps orange cookie solvent lists

buttons thumb me up you know what to do view those playlists hit the bell so you get notification between the club my dad I said no too", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "lXkDh5Bdigg": "hi i'm julie welcome to my channel today we are going to do super long deep powder nails uh come on [Music] uh okay uh do god i hope you like it subscribe to my channel for new videos every week [Music] you", "j3CRe2-R8Yg": "cheers this film [Music] [Music] yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back - true so I have another training review for you guys in this video actually a concentrate review we're going up with a brand trip and we're going over the the wedding cake chatter so here's the package for you that's pretty simple so I'm really not gonna go over it because it's just just a [ __ ] envelope but if you want um there's our social medias right there so you can go check them out if you want to do some more research on know more but every what I mean so there you go on that um besides for that you guys know what [ __ ] wedding cake is I'm sure like everybody does by now she smoked weed I've got one gram of shatter gold wedding cake that's what it says the harvest eight six twenty seven nineteen which is like two two months ago from the day I'm recording this so not too old they have a size four that there's really just and what I mean so let's it's sealed by like a little sticker right there so I dropped it so let's go ahead and like take that stick with I'll crack the steel and open this [ __ ] up so yes oh I didn't open this thing up so so so we got it open Ned pretty self-explanatory pretty simple packaging I mean it's [ __ ] dope it gets the job done like it definitely gets the job done and it looks [ __ ] dope with it I mean just not really much to say about it like it is what it is you know what I mean so yeah um inside that though he's in parchment paper and your shadow right there so go ahead and open this up oh yeah just looking fire I'll get some close-up shots for you guys in a second here you guys go it right off the bat that's just looking [ __ ] fire so let me get some close-up shots at my phone real quick for you guys and then tell me down below in the comments where you guys think of it like looks-wise on then we'll get the [ __ ] spoke initiate you know what I mean so yeah just give me one second and then we'll get into this [Music] I got like 30 seconds recorded on my phone so I got some close-up shots for you guys but oh but yeah I want to start smoking on this channel I'm trying to get high right there for a second but not for oh I'm trying to focus on this so the TAC you're in though I'll give that sugar rating already I mean like it could it's [ __ ] dope for like for what it is you don't mean like a lot of companies issues like rebel envelopes and like they finally just white and boring you know I mean I always say if they went out of their way like to like put that like whole 3d and not 3d effects but like um what do you call that shiny effect on it and make it look oh I like make their own car inside its cardboard - it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments

whatever you want for it so I'm gonna have to Mimi look at it and see right now I can't really afford it but down the road definitely for sure for sure right now okay baby here she comes starting to leak out and I'm not even that any pressure a little bit of pressures on there but not much so let's start increasing it slowly here still feeling the effects of I mean it's gonna take a while before I'm feeling a little bit better but I am feeling a bit better that I used to us when I was smoking coming out nice oh yeah baby three times right now there's just over five just doing this so I can make some videos and have a bit more rosin and do some cooking with I brought those other brownies up to my Cheung yesterday we had to sit like stupid man used to go to his house all the time have a coffee now we're sitting 20 feet apart out in his backyard on a [ __ ] lawn chair stupid man yeah he's gonna do what you got to do I guess they get that stuff see I was getting darker the weeds a bit older no I think that's how she works all the trichomes are getting aged so they're your oil gets a bit darker that's a nice blob coming out of there I'll tell you yeah baby and she's leaking all the way around oh yeah gonna be some nice edibles out of that stuff I'll tell you what those brownies I mean those are some wicked things that I like I said I put about 3 and 1/2 grams of rosin in it and they're pretty good bad at all I think I'll stick with the 3 grams I'm going to a little bit more pressure not much it kind of drops a bit I maybe even flew it in my some more hydraulic fluid in here maybe I don't know still it works good it seems to lose pressure once in a while anyways look at that baby let's check her out and yeah oh yeah alright people super Lemon Haze in the books I'm gonna

honeycomb inlay you know with the paint 4 by 6 inch plates 20 tons it's got a single controller for both plates I like this handle design better than the earlier ones that were a single piece that had their their CRD that she'd into it this one you gotta have both hands to really move it plus I mean just the thickness of the plate I like the wraparound design of the frame makes it very very strong but the faceplate unlike the many you can service this this pump goes bad I don't have to send this all the way back to California you know they can send me a new one I undo this it comes out a new one goes in with the nut Smasher many if something goes wrong with the pump like happen if mine forgot to send it all the way back to California there's no user way to to fix it and while I do appreciate there's a lifetime warranty it's real expensive to ship it back to them you know I like the fact that if something ever goes wrong with this pump I call it pass say hey I pumps broke need to ship me a pump a lot less expensive to maintain you know that's one of the biggest things I mean even that the size 20-ton press look at the size of this thing it is not big that's why it's called the mini let me get the Trent undo the power cord please those are some big plates okay so there's a little you could do a little clocking okay let's it lets you you know get him fine ten as it moves up and down through here and they're indexed on these long bullets might have a little loose and transport but I'm not sure those are super tight but like I said everything is real real easy to access with this you can't access any of the parts on the nut Smasher because you can only send it back to them I love I mean I haven't cleaned this thing up this is just how you see it as it comes out the box I love that color it's green it's green that bottle Jack might be made in Pittsburgh look at that it is okay we're gonna have to cut this short and we'll get back to get it plugged in and fired up

and because it's cheaper i guess now in my personal experience the way i am doing it i get better color and taste in such off bud but it's not that it tastes bad being made out of hash it's more of just a hachey taste instead of like the essence of a flower so i have two different grades of hash i have some 7373 you and some 120 now though 73 would probably give us a maybe not a better yield but are probably a better end product but its all dusty and i don't want to have to work around melting that down into a feasible tongues to work with is it's just easier that way so earlier i melted down the 120 down into a block like this and i have a hunk separated already so let's uh let's get to doing this most of this was going to be filmed from the top-down perspective and you know this is just kind of an experiment we'll see if it works so these are the things that you were going to need to press yourself some solvent with wax you're going to need a piece of parchment paper preferably unbleached or you can be a heathen like me and just use regular old parchment paper but do not use wax paper I repeat do not use wax paper then you are also going to need obviously your material which you're going to be pressing which is this little hunk of hash right here we can probably expect to get a good sized I've out of this probably with hash you can look anywhere from twenty to fifty percent yield sometimes a bit higher you're also going to want to cut a rectangle out of a coffee filter again you want to use unbleached or you can be even like me and just say [ __ ] your health is screwed anyways now you want to get the hash or your product [Music] consolidated in the bottom of your rectangle that you have obviously folded in half and went basically what we're doing with this is we're making a screen so we want to fold it over and fold it real tight we'll cut off the excess then we'll do the exact same thing this is the hash and we're folding right next to it and again trimming off the majority of the excess now with bud you don't only have to have it in a screen and it won't just squirt everywhere but with hash or Keith you definitely want to have some sort of filter in fact I'm even going to smash this down a little bit and there we go now I want it to have room to kind of expand a little bit so I'm not going to fold it directly on top I'm going to fold it just a smidge above [Music] and again cut off the extra so what we're left with is a little packet with your ball of hash inside set this down right there also I probably should have mentioned you're going to need a hair straightener I prefer I have no idea what brand this is actually have had it forever but i prefer the the ones with the wider plate and it's a must that it has temperature adjust mine the lowest it goes is 300 so i'm going to set mine to 300 right here and let that heat up a bit okie dokie so while that's heating up while that's heating up we want the hash packet or your whatever material you are using to be dead center and at the very bottom so we're going to test to see if our our iron is hot by licking out your finger and touching it and listen for the simple if it sizzles it's hot enough so with hash I'm going to turn this off and let it cool down a second before I press it because I want a temperature under 300 I don't know if you can see that but if you are to be a passing bud right now you'd want it to be around the 300 at least that's what I found in my my experience I could just be this temperatures weird or who knows but let's turn this off and give it just a second to cool down and I'm going to be pressing this little packet in this with all of my pressure using this year dirty sock as to not burn the [ __ ] out of myself okie dokie I'm the truth and all of my weight you should hear some sizzling that means it's [ __ ] working [Music] and voila let's see if it busted open and didn't or good so this is the results of our labors this is the little packet a half and this is what we're after ultra full melt solventless dad so let me get let me get my damn shoe already and let's collection to this first things first I got to clean off my dad tools I don't want to taman 8 that nice oil with a afterburn from my last dab so sometimes this stuff is easier to pick up and collect than others it looks like I'm not going to have much of a long time with this stuff sticky enough that it doesn't look yeah I'm just sweeping it by just rolling right over and it's picking it right up [Music] [Music] that's it she left with I'd say we probably got probably about a forty percent yield got a nice little patty and yeah it is really dark and I probably did it a bit too hot but I made it with hash and it just seems to me that when we make it with hash it this comes out darker so we put all this work into making this nickel actually pretty I don't know if you like yeah Cameron's just making it real dark looking but it definitely is a nice amber color at least through the light but all right now I'm excited to try this oh my god that was [ __ ] close I dropped the whole [ __ ] thing man that was close come on sucka there we go now you can do this with almost any weed any good weed and almost any good hash there's a couple things it needs to have in order to do this it needs to have some moisture in the product Christ originating product doesn't really matter but it needs to have some moisture can't be bone dry that goes for a hash and that also goes for weed I know it's a bit easier to fill when we'd is on rise and hash but just trust me if the hash doesn't bubble at all when you hold a lighter to it it probably won't or at least melt in any way it probably won't make any rocks now that's not saying that what you have is a good or bad it just won't make any rods and same with the weed you can have the dankest weed but if it's too dry and then left out it just won't make rasen because it needs the moisture in there they heat from the depressed from from you pressing down in the heat and iron the pressure and the heat I should say and so what's making all the oils come out it's basically steam evaporating the liquids and steam is just pressing all the oils shooting it out the sides and that's how you get this wonderful little concentrate so this is cooled down a bit let's give our [ __ ] order to try [Music] [Music] [Music] these look at how you get in what you put out to the end material will taste like the beginning material so keep that in mind when you're making it you're not going to put in poop and get out gold you're going to put in flight silver or gold and you're going to get out platinum we know what I'm saying but just going to distill the essence down on whatever you're pressing and make it that much better so I hope this is informational please you guys go out and try this is probably one of the easiest basis methods of making your own down go out and try it see your girlfriend's flat iron your mom's flat iron you know still a female to flat I and get yourself some wax piece off thanks for stopping by stay high", "msT3Uv2C9P8": "yo what is up YouTube with your boy bacon Veit just doing a real quick smoke sesh video just pressed out some more of this really good gorilla blue rosin get about 14 grams and got just about 3 grams back so let me take a paddled out of this and then I've got a sports massage come on back I feel like an old [ __ ] man so it's time to get a little loose [Music] hopefully this pulls off really nice I haven't even tried yet it's a little warm in here but it cut really nicely and pulled off real nice too that thing is beautiful you see right through it [Music] so check the temp on this guy [Music] low temp time [Music] [Music] fire peace out", "IpMPE3UT1cs": "yes yes it is always 4 20 in our world a little it today too ah yes it's always 4 20 and what are we doing today guys well it is sifty sunday so that is exactly what's happening so let's take a look here now what i've done is i put the top screen on the top there that is a 60 screen 60 microns upside down why well i've been doing lots of sifting here right as everybody knows and well let me show you something this is the way i have my screens i normally have them like this excuse me on the top i'm gonna be um making some raws without today all right so you can see that that's on the 110 right there the first one was 110 seconds with the 200 and we still got to take a look at what's under this 304 but what we haven't looked is this is what's going on guys i'm going to switch them around a little bit because look at all of the weed behind here but not only that look at all the dry sift it's even caught in the cobwebs right there full of sift so you can see the sift on the bottom they shift all the way around my stuff here so i'm figuring love you lost bubble man i know you told me to have them this way here but really i'm losing resin so i'm gonna have to turn them upside down i'm going to just finish it off like this here but i kind of want to show you guys this and i'm going to change all these screens around just because i'm sorry i'm coughing today but um there you guys go so we're going to do a whole run here we're going to take all of that resin we've seen underneath of those screens and we're going to make rosin with it today so that's what we're doing we're it's 50 rosin day so it's sifty shift and rousing we're going to take all the different levels we're going to take the 110 we'll take the 200 and the 305 and we're going to make dry sift we're not going to make dry stuff we're going to make rosin out of those but first i'm going to finish cleaning this this this epic right here i'll do a quick little video on what we're doing there as always i'll clean it on the 60 onto the 90 the 90 i'll push through into the 110 the 110 will have one type of head that will stay on top and went under 200 i will then static clean off of the of course the 200. whatever is left on the 200 we'll be broadening that and whatever falls through on that 305 well i have a lot that's been on that 305 so we'll move that all together we'll get one of those new bubble man uh well we're called some raws and bags we'll get those rolls and bags going and we're gonna try that out of course i'm using the hair iron i don't have a d nail press i'm just a small guy then this is all you need so um you know what let's get to this guys let's get to this well guys i figured i might also show you what i'm doing here so first thing i'm doing i'm just kind of breaking off all the stock all you know getting all the stock over here started doing it and as always i gotta turn the camera on because people are gonna ask me you know how did i do this well at first i'm gonna break off get all the stock out of here so make sure there's a bunch of stock in here make my life really really easy now this is just so so terpy it's unreal like really really chirpy and what i've done guys is i've actually put a bag on the side here and i got some og kush down here and i got this lemon lime so i'm going to test this too i'm going to find out the profile here and i'm also going to want to find out more about what i'm doing here right because really what we're after is is those cannabinoids so everything else is really not the medicine that we're looking for we know the terpenes the cannabinoids are going to help us in all the different ways what we're looking for but all this plant matter is really well like mark always says just fiber it's just fiber and i guess you need fiber in your diet but i don't need to smoke it i don't need to smoke it so guys this is just crumbling apart really nicely i love this bone bone bone bone dry so when you're dry sifting you want this nice and dry we get all nice and dry kind of get all of these you know kind of get everything apart i'm gonna grab the new xl so i'm going to say i didn't weigh this and um well you know what maybe we'll do that for once because i never take weight for you guys i never i never even really consider it because i really if this is my medicine i'm consuming it and i don't really care but um we do know that when we did the remote half pound we got roughly about nine grams of pure 99.9 percent gland heads and then from there i have what's left underneath this 304 and what's left on the top here that we're going to rosin so i actually got the mini rosin bags here from bubble man so this is really cool i've been told to turn these inside out so that way the resin doesn't get caught on the stitching so i mean that's really important i'll probably go with these smaller ones and maybe even on the bottom one well i'm using the flat iron right and of course i got my heat gun so we'll talk more about that but we're gonna rolls in the 305 the 200 and the 110. what's even better and more fun about that is well i'm not going to test this round because these are all so mixed so it's really pointless but when we go out and we do the the house outside i'll take those three hosses and i'll take bottom nugs and i'll start doing some more testing to show you guys what i'll be doing but i've been learning the gc and it's a lot of work and hey there's only one of me right so um i'm doing the best i can and of course loving what i do don't don't forget i love doing what i do and that's why i do it right so we have these big ones i probably won't need those i don't have that much resin to squish these might be a little too big for me too but these small ones for for me are golden like my one gallon bubble bags they're my golden anyways guys so we get this going like that it's phone drive oh we're gonna we're gonna weigh this so first thing we're going to do guys is we're going to put this back into its bag so i've got a bag right here now yeah we've already lost some glass heads from taking off that it's probably underneath this screen but you know what we're not perfect and this is just rough i always just want to show you what you know what the guy at home is going to get you know what what are you getting how much how much present [Music] you know just the average because this is all this is you know almost an average guy growing his medicine so just like you just like me let's go grab a scale and weigh this out something i can't believe how much this room reeks like reeks like it's so amazing it's kind of like that went congo the congo for the canadian concentrate open there with remo i laughed because i had my ac unit hooked up to the window and when i went outside the whole neighborhood reached like congo imagine everybody knows that girl so it's okay got good neighbors to look out for me but you know what the guy walking by was like [Music] so here you guys go we have 80.5 grams and uh well there's 80.5 you're taking my word for it that's just how it's gonna happen take it out of the bag we're gonna weigh the bag boom the bag is 13.5 so there you guys go we got 77 grams now now the fun begins so 77 grams how quick can you crush 77 grams go should take this stuff out [Music] so we got 77 grams of weed we gotta bust it up because you got a joint welding contest to do and you got like 15 guys showing up to get ready to grind up roll up all the weeds we should say and for me get a card here best way to get it all guys is just get right down to it get it all ground up oh my god this smells so good this is smelly is nice basically i'm not going to be able to like speed to this because my back's already bugging me sorry gotta take my time no you know what guys the best thing about being able to grow your own stuff like that is doing exactly what i'm doing here right now is i can use the whole plant to get fire fire in to get fire up and and that's kind of it's kind of the same right if you want to really get really nice fire medicine you gotta use fire if you want the best dry sticks you're gonna so when i finish doing all this guys all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna let this sit on the screen for like 20 and i kind of let it all kind of like float through get it all done let it kind of agitate itself naturally i find that when i first do my grind i used to do the sifting and then one time i went up and i had to get i got busy and then i went back a few hours later and there's so much more had fallen through the screen by just sitting on top of the screen and hence i just you know showed me that once again take your time to get the best and if you want the best you got to take your time [Music] and that's the whole idea one thing i'm learning slowly but surely is all the difference there's not all the different there's only one real way i mean it's just you know we you have your mechanical separation and then you have your vho extractions or uh we say solvent extractions and then we have our icing water and of course you have the uni solenoid extraction which is in reality which is going to be our mechanical our bubble and horatio with his uh delay i mean what i'm going to concentrate here guys on is almost soulless it's what works for me it's what works really good for haley rose too because she's a songless bubble hash uh capsule and it's had her caesar free for over 200 days so you know what uh that's another amazing story right there i mean talk more about that but you know what guys said and done how long is it going to take you to uh fully devour and crush up 77 grams you guys timed it for me so i guess we're gonna know so pretty much i'm just gonna do this right now guys i'm going to let this set i'm going to kind of spread it out got a few pieces here that didn't quite get completely grinded now they are because it's so dry you didn't need to use a mountain but actually i did i want to get that even grind nice and round and smooth so that way those tripods aren't being like completely crushed right so wow look at the resin on the gloves just amazing come take a closer look guys show you what we're doing here a little bit of sweat in the hands and there you go that's the start right there and this is how i'm starting to make this little batch here so of course we're on the 60 we're going to go to the 90 mesh now and then down to the 110 200 and 305 so uh yeah there you guys go we're just gonna let this sit maybe turn the cold air on in here and uh we'll uh kind of wait to see what happens it's gonna be cool to show you in between the screens here guys i'm going between the screens [Music] i don't know if we can see the heads dropping or not [Music] sorry guys i'm just trying to give you a little bit of an idea what's going on here see that i mean we're just going to slowly work this resin here there you go that's just okay guys it's been that half an hour actually if you want to be like oh [ __ ] what did i do actually i went outside and i grabbed the outdoors i brought it inside i put tables in there so we could do dry sifting um i started working on the video downstairs for cutting the one that you're going to see before this one actually um i then turned on some metallic because i need a little some metallica to my list today actually um i then had to check on the clones i checked those i checked on the new seeds because i'm popping new beans i got two new genetics coming to you soon i'll tell you all about that um yeah it's a pretty good genetics gonna become a phone out of here guys uh some stuff that's really talked about and uh we did some actually we somebody did some crosses with some uh strains that are out there and uh i get the pollen so that's gonna be some fun so let's see my morning of course dry shifting i have been watching hash church because i don't carry my laptop around it's right here and then it went out so i missed the total end because i was out working on the plants but you know what most importantly guys is uh 50 sunday 60 70 is important to me because you know it's sunday is when you i can make my medicine i can spend time watching half church doing this drive shifting and you know just getting everything ready for my minutes for the next week or so okay i have a bit of a stop you know i do grow my own and you know this is just my personal consumption so this is what i've done though guys i've got this big pile up here we're gonna do some flicking learn that from um the jurassic wizard with the the 60 to 90 give it a 16 flick all that stuff falls there's pretty much nothing falling from there anymore guys yeah it's just like kind of dry so that's good we've got that all cleaned up and what will be really nice is i'm gonna start testing all of this we'll see what's left in here another way to test it is you know find out right so there's no other way of doing it so we will be doing that little trusty lids of medtainers holding up our corners so this is our first um our first run here and uh of course we're gonna bring you right into that just because wouldn't be right if i didn't so you can see what's sitting on top of there right now right guys i'll go a little bit slower sorry you can see how dirty that is you see the contaminants and we can also see the really good you can see the crystals in there too right so underneath that this will probably all go through we can already has anything any fell yet no not really so this is that screen underneath we got that pile so now we're gonna push this through and of course if i'm gonna do that i might as well show you up a little bit closer so i'm going to push this through here guys and i'll just kind of show you what i'm doing here just like that there you go so just a really quick easy grab a card okay let's gather it up first you can see how much we have here and uh i don't know if you guys can see this in that i'm gonna kind of bring it up to you slowly and there you go so that's that's that's what that is right now and that's just the start and as you can see guys we have a lot of it so it's kind of the carving method you know we're carving what we can get through anything that we really want is going to fall through anything that really stays on top well we're going to ross and that i haven't really had anything stay on top of the 90 yet but it looks like um there's always a first right guys so i use a rocking motion just because it's easier for my back everybody's going to find their way [Music] yeah definitely uh i have to say and there we go starting to start to hear the sign running underneath that as the rest is thing going through you probably hear that stereo in the background from downstairs [Music] you can really see how useful these screens are this is a 90s screen and really this is uh i'm happy that i'm using all of the five different strings really important guys i mean like we say if you want the best you got to take the time to get exactly what you want and this is just one of those processes and even if i only get a couple rips from this oh they're the nicest and most rewarding rips that you'll ever have we're gonna get more than a couple but you can see the process as i've been slowly started separating the top layer and we can see underneath what's going on in there that's the second layer there's the next level see that which is really cool guys we'll show the difference in color so definitely a lot of contaminant with this one as i pushed it through it was really dry we did grind it up with the maintainer so of course we got everything through and what's really cool is whatever sitting on top of this 90 well that's another level we'll see if we can raws and if there's anything in here too rosin because what it looks like to me i just will see some heads in there pretty pretty big we'll take a closer look here guys i'm gonna kind of bring you right in here just because you kind of have to do that wouldn't be the same if i didn't show you the the whole thing from up close i'm going to zoom back quickly sorry about that i hope i didn't give you a quick flash then i'm going to walk in with the camera just like this and you can take it take a look at this top screen here and you can still see that there is maybe a few little diamonds in there so so that's what's left on the top of this screen right now and then we're going to go underneath and you can already see what's underneath this screen here so we're going to clean this up next and i'm going to push that through to the next screen so that's the top there first guys and of course you know like i'm just trying to show you this whole little method here i've showed it to you before but this method today is going to add raws into it so it's going to be a little bit more um i hope you enjoy this because i enjoy doing this more than anything it's like how can you not enjoy making your own medicine it's rewarding it works it takes time you know i can pretty much say that wow it's really cool how staticky that is right now you can see that guys it's really staticky which is really interesting i really like that just careful so this is the first little batch and it's actually hmm [Music] wow guys there you go so that there is the first clean on the on this is the 60 screen 90 so we'll put this yeah we're on that we're on the 90 now we already did the 60. now we're working on the 110 and the 110 [Music] there you go here's some 110 for you coming right at you that's the 110. now we're going to clean this you can even see how there's some hair in there and stuff like that next step probably might give me a new card i should grab that it might make my life a little bit easier in one minute yeah i didn't find it so i just grabbed uh it's a great goose curt actually this thing all the cards look a little bit better so you have this little pile of the side here we're definitely gonna get that now that first saw i didn't smell when first then i crushed up i got a really really nice smell and then the second cardigan it smelled like this third party there's no smell to it it's just like all of a sudden this parched fragrance just hit me raise the face again so that's kind of cool because i got the answer wow definitely beautiful smell so like i'm saying in that first when i first crushed it there was a great smell then i'm not there that little bit there there's really no fragrance to it because all the terpenes and all that smelling and those gland heads right so of course it's not in the plant matter it's not all the plant leaves it's in those little speckles so that is why of course at the end there that doesn't smell like anything and this smells so terpy right so um you know just little things that i'm as i'm sitting here working away the first thing i'm going to be doing is rotting this pile right beside us like instantly we're not going to get underneath here we're going to rosin this first pile right here pretty much right away we're going to use um the new bag this feels hot so you know what i can turn that off for a second let's check the temperature on this see we're just getting ready here guys this is like happening we're we're going to rosin to make sift all at the same time i'm going to get my epic 258 probably don't want it 249. and i think we've learned that with rossignon with some with sifting with hash and stuff like that we're using lower temperatures so you know what i'm just gonna press get ready here guys can't wait to see what's under here i'm already looking sorry guys [Music] oh man i love this it's like it's like that sandy beach under there beautiful white sand beach so you can see the different colors we're getting out of here we've got different shades different colors right so i mean even when you see the raw then you see different colors so like some of the rosin is more clearer and something one of them is more darker finding with the lower grades when you get that really 160 and 45 and 25 micron in the hash or even with the like say the sift here which we're gonna call like i'm gonna say probably more like the 110 and the 90 not sitting on these screens here and that leftovers i mean that's it's like we're taking the best of the best out and then we're going to try and get better out of what is left over and what we are but just if we use everything and then we get the best of both worlds but you know what today this is what we're doing story is taking so long but that's just the way things happen with me i want to explain everything fully and i want to kind of want to show you what i'm doing and start right from the start that's crushing full bud over screen using these whole screen systems so we have all of them you can see what i'm doing back and forth don't want to miss any steps because really in reality it's it's it's it's just something that the bubble man showed me and uh it's i've done nothing other than do what he showed me but of course i'm passionate about it and i'm having a lot of fun so i love i gotta do bong rip guys and you know what i'm gonna do damn it just like my neck's just killing me all of a sudden like really bad so i'm just gonna do this to be honest i don't even care if it melts right now and um i'm not gonna go look for bee line either sorry well um i didn't even really clean that and that just went like rape to like nothing well how to do tote guys all right that's why i do this because it's my medicine right because i i need it so [Music] now we're doing this we're doing this whole pile over here like this i got this here like that i got that nice and hot i'm going to grab these baked i'm going to turn this bag inside out just like that don't want to get caught on those seams because i'm using a small iron i'm going to use a small bag now mark did a video on this i started watching it and i didn't have time to finish it but i i'm just gonna i'm just excited i'm just pouring sift in here just like that all right and so all i did was just pour it in there i grab this open it up you don't need a close-up just you know there you go now i'm gonna you only have like a tea bag or anything or don't you kind of want to get it shaking into the bottom that's what i'm doing right now i'm i'm just doing a fast and then i'm rolling this as tight as i can like super super tight i definitely gonna have to get a press at one time because i mean i can already feel that this is um 95 let me turn that back on i'm gonna turn that back on guys i'm gonna grab some parchment paper [Music] so [Music] just like that parchment hash from the 110 i mean it's so on top that's the 110 screen we got that we filled up that bag it's underneath of the gun right there right now got that and we're going to press it right there for you guys so that's what's happening grabbing this and putting this right into the corner like that that's why i like to do things my temperature gauge i like my temp and away i press 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 60 20. well nothing came out of that zero so i'm going to uh one more time full weight yep full weight so it's interesting as we're cleaning it is there really anything left in this top egg well on that second press down right there was we've got it hot now see that so on the third press i got this turned up too right now so so i'm counting in my head on our next press so as it heats up guys you can definitely see that we're getting we're getting rosin so that's beautiful that's beautiful so we know for sure i've been throwing this away for so long so so long i'm definitely going to have to get a rosin press now so hmm there you guys go now we're going to get to work on the next screen so that's what i wanted to see so we went off the 110 we cleaned that we got that rosin right there we're going to let that sit on the side and i'm going to get on to that next screen we're going to need the 200 we're going to clean that and we're going to squish what's on there i'm excited i like i like stuff like this it makes me excited nice little patty in there now oh it's not that sticky i could probably see if i had a harder press i'd probably be able to get a little bit more out of that right so on that note i know for a fact is i can press more what's right there we're gonna get more of that i don't know if i'm gonna press that other stuff but you know what i probably are gonna have to now guys i'm probably gonna have to now aren't i so we're right on to the next screen here and and what better to do is to just show you right up here because i i kind of really want to rolls in that other corner there right away so we'll get on that like right away so here is the next level we're on the 200 screen right there and we're going to uh clean that right now and then rosin of course this exciting put this off to the side i got my other bag right here guys so that's perfect from that card now the brush comes into play guys now we have a brush we have the dvd we have more parchment we're getting this all ready so what i'm going to do here right now guys is i'm just going to kind of pile this up like this and get a nice pile here we have been showing you these piles the whole time [Music] so it's just uh getting her ready guys we're getting her ready and the first thing is showing you this great big pile sift again there you go so that right there happens to be the top of the 200 mesh screen we're going to static cling static clean everything's nice and staticky here right now so first things first guys i'm gonna get my brush this brush is gonna get the screen ready you see it doesn't charge the screen up get it together get it ready for extracting those perfect heads that we're looking for now that's just you know we want that melting and then we're going to take what's left over here and of course we're going to be we're going to be dry sit we're not we're going to be rosing that pile right there this one right here we're going to get to that so first i'm just going to clean a little bit of this but then i'm going to rosin that pile over there and show you how much that work we can still keep now if you haven't um seen the static dry shifting you can down what you can google it static drive sifting i'm sure you're going to find lots of good videos on it because there's lots of people showing how to do this now it's a great easy method and all you're going to need is a is a brush a dvd and some parchment paper some screens are going to help definitely i have this little brush right here too to wipe it off now basically on the dvd go straight across i just do a couple passes like that i'm gonna pull it on an angle two three four and with that guys is that that's the that's that's just the x epic resin that you're looking for so of course i have a little thing here down here to kind of put it on to i'm just going to put it right here on the top trusty materials they always come in handy just like that like that and hopefully i'll be able to show you guys this if you haven't seen this before it's definitely on my channel you'll see lots of it static dry sifting and how we can get the 99.9 percent blonde heads this is the melty stuff that we're looking for i normally clean this a few times just to get that epicness that was so much looking for and what i'm getting at guys is what's left on here is what we're going to put into this pile right here and then that's what we're going to rosin right so just a huge pile of this resin here definitely getting lots off of this nice the same [Music] as you can see guys now what you don't want to do is anything that goes on the back of this right here if anything sticks on this side you don't want to brush that in that's the stuff that i kind of brush off to the side so basically what we have is we have with this this little leftover right here this is what's not going into us going through the screen and sitting on top of the screen but we know there's still a lot left in that right guys like guaranteed so we take this now nice and staticky which is this pile right here same same micro just different different stuff right there of course we're grabbing this trusty little bag now that pile there is the same as the last pile that we just did so you know that this is going to be the same where i'm really curious on this other product so now i can do a little bit more of a close-up if i had a little spoon it'd probably work pretty good too but i don't have a spoon i'm just using this little card i'm just kind of scooping it right into here guys just like that nice little easy bag i just don't hopefully guys you know kind of easy gives you an idea what we're really interested in is is is the melty that we get out of this and how much do we get and really these should be all another head size right getting the bag ready so this is the next rosin bag right here and this is that 110 screen right down there and now we're going back down to the rawson station right here right so we're turning our hair straightener back on the 304 is going to be exciting because i i got so much of it there and i'm curious i might have to go and visit mark and uh bore his uh d nail press so uh of course i'm rolling this right up i like the bags i really like the bags they're easy normally i'm folding and stuff like that being able to roll this up like that it's it's it's just it's so much more easier of course i'm gonna need more parchment paper so like the trusty heat gun get that there got the parchment here you can find that if you just grab the scissors guys you can kind of just kind of run it easily through it like that so it makes like really easy and simple got this large little pressing piece which is perfect now me being the little anal guy that i am i need to make that straight so i gotta do that this just has to happen now once again we got this sift in there all nicely just rolled up so i'm not like pressing it out or anything like it was before i was heating it up making it into little press balls i'm just rolling it tightly inside of the screen bag because of course it's going to press it right away with that heat now when i first do this press i'm going to put it in the corner and then i'll slowly move it out onto the parchment because this corners have to give me that leverage to heat it up and squish it down in the beginning that's just the way i feel now this time around i was thinking what can i use so it's not so hot on my hands [Music] this piece of cardboard right here so guys once again i didn't check the heat on that this time so i want to check the heat 250 turn that down a tiny bit [Music] and away we press and you know what i'm looking at this little sandy over here and i just can't wait to try what's under that 304 and i always believe that it was a smaller head might be like you know like a different different cannabinoid and i kind of really want to test that now so let's see the initial heating up of it i think is what happens that's our first little tiny bit there pulling it out now we got it hot and anybody knows me rosing quite a bit they know that once you get the the package gets hot you kind of get more on the second press i don't like it when it squishes to the side like that but sometimes it does so i don't do that much rosin anymore that's how we get more in the sift and and the bubble again is just because this pressing is killing me and it hurts my neck and stuff like that so it's just like that's why i like pressing the bubble and the dry sift because it's really a lot much easier and really though the cardboard isn't working out for me so basically just pressing away here guys i i can't press anymore so i'm just going to kind of back this up and i'm gonna go back really to cleaning right now i'm gonna take a bit of a break it is um well that's basically what we're doing here we're we're taking the different microns and we're cleaning this and getting this 99.9 but showing that we can all that left behind is all really melty and with the rosin tech you can definitely get get your your star rating melty hashes instantly and you can see we're getting it with everything we're getting them with each different micro level so we're having lots left over gotta get a press for myself i know that so i'll be working on that guys we're gonna get doing the 304 here i'm going to finish cleaning this up because i kind of want to get this clean and then i'll finish off pressing the 304 and uh we'll see what all of these uh smoke like at the end so like the three or four screens what would we do there mike did i pull those out is that what you said it looked like uh it looked like [ __ ] like snow so um yeah this guy showed up please and uh of course mike wanted to know what i was doing and i'm like i'm upstairs doing a video and my video had everything to do with rosin and what i've done is we did this ros video right here and what i'm talking about were the three different screens so the bottom screen in here we're going to look at colors here guys now this is the first screen that was what was on the 60 went on to the 90 screen then we went on to the next screen which is the 110. and then over to the 200 so those are the three different separations of the 77 grams so we'll definitely weigh that out now i did rosin with what would be left on the 110 and rosin with the 200 that was what was left over before not what we have here but we have an idea that this will still give us melty stuff so we have those two piles three piles and then of course we have this pile right here that's what we cleaned out of that so that's the 99.9 percent gland heads we'll weigh that and then there's this 304 screen now mike you were making mention to the different hues and the colors you said because i can't see that yeah so as you can see i did the congo before like this from years and then under the congo there last time so this is probably you know like four or five oxy that i have i've actually have different piles there that i've done something here with that's weird there's some green and some red in here yeah so now this one here we're gonna rosin this too we're gonna give this a shot this will get a ross i'm gonna give this a shot but you know there you guys go we know that guaranteed that's gonna happen so uh well you know what we're gonna have to get with this larger bag i think you haven't seen the bag system have you yet mike so this is really cool so mark brought over these bags and these bags are rosin bags and these rosin bags which are pretty cool is you can actually just dump them to sift right into the bag and then uh i couldn't press on these that hard so it was still like lots of goo in here so i can't get them out right now all right so basically he's putting the raws and then we're just flipping over these bags like that's easier like that than squishing it out like i don't have the pressure so i want to get a clamp now cool so i'm going to get a clamp that's what i'd like to do didn't go down to home depot and get a clamp so i can like squish this thing i was looking at different things and i've always been using the old school i still have the same straightener from day one getting lots of use out of that so that's what we're gonna do i'm gonna go get the clamp we're going to press the last of this and we'll definitely just take a good look and that's what we're doing i'm i'm doing the dry sifting with the 77 grounds and also showing the raws and what we can do with the different separations actually in reality how much yield can we really get so if i have 77 grams or 80 grams of dry material and i just want to harvest just the gland heads we have all different accuracies we have different levels so i mean in reality that's one two three four different medicines guaranteed because we know it all has resin in it and you know i can't test it that's the really crazy part about it so i i'm so busy let's compare each one of these internal clothing looking we got so much work to do so this is going to be a two-part video probably damn yeah it wasn't one in a two-part video so let's roast in this and we'll get into that so we don't we can do with this whole rosin same thing with the five screens and then when we separate and then we rosin in between so that's exciting that's really cool stuff because now we're seeing what we're able to do with it and i'm definitely going to have to come and smoke on some of that so um there you guys go that's what's happening that's what's going on let's rosin the 304 let's go get the clamp i made it back it's actually the next day so good morning again nice to see you so i just went into the garage and grabbed this bad boy i don't know why i've never grabbed this clamp i've been pushing with my arm and my knee and standing on it but i've been watching everybody do this jeff church and everybody's talking about clamps we've seen it all over the walls and tech groups so definitely check it out guys there's so many different ways you can use to squish your iron or grab a press or anything so there's really really a lot of different things but i figured i should grab a clamp because what everybody more pressure and hey you know what it's a smart thing to do so i got my parchment got my clamp got my rosin bag um we got some 304 sift sitting here actually we got quite a bit so i'm just going to do one scoop into one of these bags just one so i mean for this bag this is actually a really big bag i will probably never use a bag this big to be honest like never so i'm just gonna roll one two three times give it a nice roll like that and and i'm pretty much going to cut this bag smaller just because i'm going to have to just because i don't have the big presses right so i'm going to make this one a little bit smaller i've got it like that got it squished in between we got a parchment get this right in the middle here just like that we've got a flat arm that we put right over here like this just like that make sure it's right in the middle you do pressing out some 304 [Music] boom boom clamp just like that guys and i'm actually starting to see the rosin come out which is nice see that and we've got rosin squishing out slowly coming out you're still only seeing it come out of the parchment right there which is really cool and i'm pretty sure if i had even better rosin or even better sift but there is right now pressing up the 304 i'm super super excited for this guys like super excited because i got so much of it so the 304 micron you see it just oozing i'm gonna give it a unclamp now on pop that and voila look at that beautiful that is nice that now there there's some goo nice and clean on the screen you can see i'm happy i've cut that down so we can see how nice and clean that is a little bit of stickiness on the top there on the second fold which is okay so there you guys go pressing up to 304 give you another closer look there's the 304 micron and uh we'll bring you right up here guys so this is what we're doing we did all the different sifs we we pressed out the 304 there's the 304 rosin we got lots of stuff there so all that real fine sift i was super impressed with that of course we have the rosin tech here and then we're going to come down here guys now the 90 screen i never did press out that it doesn't look like there really isn't anything there but then i went over to the 110 so there's a 110 pile there's the 110 rosin there's the 200 pile there's the 200 rosin here's the 304 pile and there's the 304 rosin so ros and sift you can do so much with your medicine you can separate you can clean you can squish it's all about solventless extractions mechanical heat pressure ice and water guys so that's what i love to do i'm super excited to show you this today i've just been wanting to do this for so long we're talking months i just haven't had the time but of course um grab your screens grab your product and get your medicine because that's what i do as always guys puff and pass and share because people really want to see this knowledge which is awesome peace as always it's a 420 from raws from sift to rosin well there we go guys there here here we come in we have the 305 screen that's the first little pile there then we're going to come up to the 200 screen and that there is the pile on the 200 screen beside that is the 99.9 glam heads so the bottom pile is a mix between congo and a few different strains but all of this on top here is going to be that 77 grams so we have two piles there then we move up to the 110 screen for the next pile then we move up to the 90 screen for that other pile and of course on the top screen was the starting of the 77 grams of the lemon lime that we're checking out here right now so overall we've done this complete separation as you can see i have all the screens stacked up i have this all ready to go this is rosin and dry sift our yields what are we getting from 77 grams of we're going to say high grade aaa cannabis crushing it over screens harvesting all the glam heads what is not melty we're gonna rosin and we're gonna determine all the weights and how much resin that we're able to get off of this particular this little particular plant is 77 grams and maybe we got seven grams of resin there in total i don't even know it'd be kind of funny if that worked out to be like a ten percent i would think i mean i will do all the math on that but uh we're just gonna start this off guys and how we're gonna start this off today it's really easy and simple i have my scale here have everything ready and everything ready for dry sift rosin this is fun i always enjoy doing what i do so one thing i have done is i i've been wrapping up this screen here i've already tried these bags and how to wrap these bags up and get them ready for rottening so that's pretty cool so i definitely have a couple different bags here we can try i found i could just like maybe cut these down and roll them up once or twice and squish this out we get all into this whole tech here guys i got my grip i got my revlon hair straightener parchment paper to rise sift from buds that's right we used bud for this run we really want to determine what we're getting put fire in to get fire out it's always the key i'm going to start everything with the bottom not much just a tiny tiny tiniest hit you know what i'm going to go for the 304 why not i got so much of it and you know what i i it is partly clean believe it or not so which is really really cool i'll also give it a shot you know i'm gonna grab my old rush lighter this has been kicking around forever but you've had this later since 2012 2012 leather so guys you know what i wanted to start off a little bit of a 304. look at that guys and on the inside there the resin was just dripping off of that it wasn't melty but it sure just disappeared tasty okay i want to get in here close i want to show you this up close so here's the tools don't forget i got a heat gun because i'm going to determine temperatures on everything i'm going to be pressing a little bit lighter we did our dvd we did a clean we got our piles you can see that pile there looking beautiful little hair right there we can see this pile here that's the clean sift there those are just heads that was what was sitting beside the two of the 200 screen when i cleaned that i took that out of that this is what stayed on top of the screen i'm going to see if all this stuff melts and of course that there we know if you roll those into joints and squish that and get a little bit more maybe so we might as well just get right to this guys i'm gonna probably mount the camera right here so you guys can see it better okay so i think the first thing we should do here is determine some weights it should be kind of like a smart thing to do so chelsea piece of cardboard [Music] and make sure the pen works exactly w-e-i-g-e of resin 90 micron 110 200 we're not measuring the 304 because that's kind of got everything in there right so starting weight was 77 grams of dry from the 90 oh here we go we're going to determine this because you know what we always want to know about weight we're always trying to determine how much yield are we getting what are we really getting from our medicine i don't look at yield i want to look at the trichomeweight because this is truly my medicine right here right so when we look at all this matter like yeah i got like 100 grams 100 grams of what do you have 100 grams of well i know i have 77 grams here to start with and we're slowly going to determine all the different glam heads all the different resin sizes so here we go 2.8 you guys gonna have to just believe me on this because i'm not going to pull up the screen so we've got 2.8 grams 90. now we're going to be actually putting this directly probably into one of these bags let's let's just do that let's just throw this 2.8 you want to weigh that much so we're going to put all of that in there yeah i think we are because there's a lot of contaminants in there and stuff so here we go you guys 2.8 grams into a rosin bag just like that so that's the start that's our 2.8 grams of the of that now i'm gonna of course roll this up really nice i'm gonna set the temperature probably about 190 degrees clap it for about 30 seconds how about that so there's our first one we can actually put this right here because that's where it is coming up next we have the 110 we'll put our piece of parchment on there we'll zero that out we have our 110 maybe i'll use two cards and on a 110 we have three grams [Music] we're gonna 3.1 so on a 110 we have 3.1 guys 3.1 grams and you know what in reality i mean we all know what we're doing here so we're just going to show it to you there there you go so that's that's that screen and i got this other one here so i cut this one down it was just easier for me i'll be playing with these screens quite a bit i should say rosin bags hold that in there we'll squish that down so there's our next one wrote that down and then we got our two piles here what's left over on the 200 uh and then of course the 99.9 which is right there so i'm not going to squish this really no point it's already good but this i'm curious about of course so on the 200 screen on our last little thing there we'll hit the zero again i want to make sure everything's the same oh yeah so what i'm seeing here right now i'm just kind of curious what's going to be left there we've got 2.1 grams there 2.1 grams i'm gonna put that into the smaller one i think or it'd actually be too much to put in there and i don't know if i want to put it in this bag make it too big maybe so we have the 2.1 grams here which we're going to definitely squish this out guys probably to squish the first two bags there now let's determine what we have and pure gland heads so hit the zero the 99.9 percent look i was just staying together in like one big clump i'm like that it's 2.4 grams so on the consistent average when i did the removes uh when i when we did the canadian concentrate open it was 240 grams i got roughly eight grams of epic 99.9 percent resin so this being roughly 80 grams three times 24 times three three two two four six seven hey that's kind of like right on the money so um that was almost very similar to the results that i got so i'm seeing the consistency um just you know i'm just trying to determine a few things here and roughly i'm getting about um i'm gonna say i get about about a good gram of 99.9 percent gland heads from roughly 28 grams 30 grams of weed um that's what i'm averaging but then we have all these different grades and and all these different grades now we can make into melty rosin so um that's the next thing we're going to do here let's do some rosin and this here well wouldn't be the same guys just wouldn't be the same wouldn't be the same if i didn't try so i've tried a few right but i only need that much too which is just so nice just a little bit just a little bit i got no b-line i'm sorry just a little bit just a nice little hit okay guys so next up parchment hot iron just turn this bad boy on so i always turn this on and leave this basically like two i leave this really really really really low you know my nice little workstation here we've we've progressed and moved up to the the clamp of course there's all kinds of different claps you guys can get over there and we know that so definitely check around see which one's gonna work best for you i don't know which is gonna you know is there a better clap than this clamp or your clamp or the other clap probably not um but i guarantee this one's gonna probably have pressures on them so you can determine how much you're pressing on it um this is just what i had in the garage you know went outside and grabbed it what do most people have at home because this is about what the home user can do this this is what i do this is my medicine that's what i always talk about um i'm just a guy who who likes to grow and is passionate about what he is about and what he does and that is looking after myself like you should eating properly um i'm always looking at trying to find different ways to help me with my pain control and everything i'm going through with my condition for my fall um it's it's it's one of those things when you're disabled and you live in severe chronic pain and it's a 24 7 thing you really start realizing what is the best way to deal with certain things and and in reality um me getting up every morning and making my medicine going into my garden distract me and give me a quality life that i'm looking for because it gets me out of bed it it keeps me excited it gets me doing videos for the viewers too so as you can see this is my whole way of dealing with what i go through um and and this is just one more step on how you can learn to help yourself too so once again guys we're going to get right to this i got my heat gun out here so once a while i gotta talk it's not 267 it's like way too hot so i'm going gonna turn it off i'm getting to um probably having to get a new uh hot iron so i'm gonna get this ready i'm gonna get ready to about there so i can see that that's just ready to clamp there we go we've got a clamp ready we've got a temp gun ready says i'm at 163 so you know what i'm 146 187 i'm pretty good to go that's what i want to see and right now like this is so much softer you can feel that that 90 it's just like spongy really really spongy once again these screens are really big for me because i'm never gonna like be pressing that much raws and if i am then i'm gonna go get some new screens so um i'll be able to utilize these small ones probably later oh and like that i cut the corner and hopefully i just didn't um like that okay guys so i'm basically putting this right here i'm getting out my hair straightener to clamp that on there just like that and um one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15. let's count 16 17. 18 19 20 21 22 23 nothing's dripping 24 25 26 27 28 29 30. let's check our heat in there guys we're at 160 right actually it's 205 so we're gonna turn that off and let that sit another couple seconds i'm gonna squish i'm smelling a little bit of stuff right now so and um it doesn't look like really good we're not getting anything from the 90 screen just isn't there good to know i add a little bit of clear stuff there that's pretty hot i'm feeling it but yeah you can see there's really like no resin involved with that one at all so that's kind of like our first one there i'm gonna put that off the side put this here we did with our 90 coming up next turn this back on get this up or 224 let's turn that off a little bit for a second i'd like to press between 190 to 210 so if you can hear that's the kind of the temperature that i'm kind of going for that's what i'm being learning and hearing um i could be wrong everybody's there's different temperatures up there i was talking about that with another friend of mine curt and he came in he had all the temperatures written down on the raws and from 212 the 187 to 163 is really cool in determining which one was harsher and which one was just a little bit different because you know in reality there of course there's a difference because the heat is actually activating cannabinoids and changing its chemistry so you're getting a different effect and how it's burning and it's just all new research we're just learning about let's just say it's not new it's called research but i'm just getting more in depth and learning more and more about how you know everything is working for ourselves and stuff like that so i'm really looking forward to the next press here guys because i know i'm going to get something off of this i'm at 232 173 so as i start there i'm going to get this going here right in the middle just like that i am liking the bags i'm finding it a little difficult to get okay the best way we do this way get more coverage oopsie little more careful with it i'm just doing this with you guys so i'm just kind of learning as we go i mean i figured we're going to do this let's do this all together it's kind of like the best way of doing everything because then we can determine and i'm seeing that maybe just maybe going this sideways might not it's kind of squishing off to the side so i'm not going to go that way i'm going to go my standard this way try to do something a little different and kind of mess it up a little bit i can feel how i screw that up a tiny bit so we always want to make sure that that's all straight right because in reality what we're trying to do is we're trying to squish the resin out of that bag so you don't want it to have too much on one side of the other you want it right directly in the middle so that's kind of important we've got this turned on we got this clamped and it's kind of our next little uh presso here guys turn mine on check my heat 173 okay so determining our next press here and seeing how this works guys just takes time oh it can be counting eight nine ten eleven 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30. a little bit of use coming out of there slowly 32 33 [Music] um kind of move off the side there we're getting a nice little squish in there a little bit as you can see with that one there we're getting some we're getting some rossy guys as we move down i'm going to squish that twice it's always nice to see that we're getting something right that's a little bit easier for you and i can even just kind of like sit here with a timer actually instead of counting so i got my phone we all got cell phones everybody's got a cell phone we all got a timer built into there mine's always set for 40 seconds throw a timer on it that way you can't uh get things up i want to always i always like to keep my vertical just kind of what i do i like to have things this way so that way if there's any moisture in there or maybe drip out um because i was doing the fresh frozen frozen for a little bit but you know everybody's got their own little different ways of pressing and i'm having a lot of fun from drying the house from using the sift or using fresh bud from using dry but doesn't really give me the big big heels i'm always looking for i'm seeing like really nothing and i think moisture has a lot to play in how the resin gets so as we see this is bone dry um and it's squished away we're at 36 37 38 59 40. we're going to release that there let's stop on here guys open that up and it's awesome i don't think there's like a ton of in here but you know what um i think we need to do a third squish because every little bit of that resin counts and that's what we're looking at we're looking at being able to get what we can get out of i mean even after this you could probably eat these little hash little patties and i guarantee it you're still getting medicinal effects from it i don't know the amounts i guess i could pretty much test things now so i can actually give you the amounts but that's going to be another video guys or this video is going to be five hours long so as you can see we're doing each individual one we see we got nothing from the 90 because we did do the same press with the same amount of pressure of what i'm doing here um i'm i'm holding this for roughly about 30 to 40 seconds uh our temperatures are lower so we're temperatures are keeping our temperatures down uh this one right now is at 159. 1 168. i'll turn that back up a little bit turn it on because the temperature went down to 140. um i got this sitting here with another 35 seconds a little tweaked on the side there and i think we're about done with the 110 screen guys take a look at our overall and even that last little press yeah you've got a last little press so that's going to be the 110 rosin press so that's pretty cool to see you guys the 110 robinson press worked out pretty nice we saw that that came in now of course we have our uh our bags we can open this up and uh i wasn't gonna wear some gloves and my hands will get all sticky so let me go get those gloves because you should do that i'm gonna take out the rods and show you how to get the raws and the little hatch out of these bags so i cut this down gloves now there's only a few extra ones here i always have them up here but i've been using them normally i always wear gloves it keeps the hands from getting so sticky and it makes a little bit easier to work with the resin these happen to be just some latex gloves take them out that might pick them up for me actually so i i just kind of made a little kind of corner like that so i can just pop this out i break it in half and i'm able to just kind of pop what's in out of the bag and turn the bag inside out again right onto the dvd here shouldn't be showing you guys sorry but i did explain it up off the bag inside out i turned it inside out again and just really kind of get that hash out of there now you can of course go wash it with isopropanol that's probably the easiest and quickest way to get this like crystal perfectly clean now for me as you can see that's why i needed gloves right but flipping these bags inside out like that to get the hash rate out is probably the easiest way to work with it now i did use another one where actually i cut the side of it because these ones are a little long so i cut the side of it to get the hash out then i can i now put it in the corner i fold it over and i wrap up these are for my small ones because i like to press just small little hits right so that's why i do this one here the original bag was long like this it was folded but i found it difficult because it was so long and i was only putting small amounts of hash that's why i determined maybe cutting down a little bag just so it wasn't as big so it's a little bit easier to work with so uh that's what i did um i don't know i've the new bags are on the market and i know uh bubble man's working on them just so we can actually get what we're looking for because at first i was just cutting apart all of his pressing screens so it's sweet that he's got the bags now we're going to get into our next one here guys so i'm really looking forward to the next little press like i said the next little press coming out here is going to be the 200 and we determine with the 200 bag here uh we have one point 2.1 grams so we got to make sure that that's the good stuff yeah that's the one there because we don't want to press that 99 i kind of want to smoke that i'm gonna put this into the bag and with this bag being sticky now it's actually a little bit easier to work with well maybe a little bit harder depending as you can see i just spilled a tiny bit of sift working away here guys we're talking like minuscules we're talking maybe okay guys so now now that i got my bag rolling this up again determining exactly what i want to do with this i fold it over once fold it over twice now try to get this as tight as possible just so we don't have as much material pushing out just like that got a clamp got our iron it's turned on let's determine the temperature always determine the temperature guys this is that 251 i'm going to turn it off a little hot i find when i burn too hot the rosin comes out like a shatter it's really really hardy without the parchment so the lower the temperature i find it's more gooier and it's easier to work with that's what i've personally found i'm pretty sure a lot of other people have so that would be the reason for always checking the temperature on the hot iron and and having this little heat gun as you can see 209 it's just really easy to be able to you know work with this i got 122 it cools down quite quick turn that back on once again you put this right in the middle just like that you can press out okay see that's why you gotta be a little careful you don't want it to slip like that that's what just happened there i don't want it to slip so always try to ensure that you keep it straight on each side because you don't want to kind of stick on the side and stuff like that all right so now that i've done that i gotta do this quickly guys sorry just the way john works he gets it done [Music] there we go we're gonna do that now i'm putting this on a timer stop reset start putting this on the shoulder just because of my neck we're going to turn this we're holding this and as you can see guys last time we got a little bit of resin now i can't wait to put a bunch in one of these white bags for the 304. i'm going to have some fun i just want to put like a big amount in there and see how much we get so this is of course the next level this is going to be the 200 micron and this is what we clean out of the 200 screen so the 99.9 percent grind has right there is what we got here with 32 seconds and our temperature is going to be guys temper temperature 159 158 171 197 so we see our temperatures rising again we're at 52 seconds and turn the temperature gun off i'm going to hit it at 60 give it a pop because in the beginning we're only holding for seven to ten seconds we're going with a harder heat not really too much came out of that i actually got oh that smells so amazing though wow the smell from that press so now now because the first one was more like it was a dirty smell from the 90. this one here i didn't this is a sweet smell so that's just interesting just for that alone is learning that that's a maybe that little sweet spot [Music] maybe that's why we like that bland head so much is because of the flavor because we are looking at terpenes so much these days guys so we're going to reset and we're going to restart we're going to press this for another 30 to 40 seconds do that um and then of course i'm just going to show you some 304 pressing because i want to show you the whole press through this whole system and what we're doing because uh yeah when i pressed that um it was dripping i was really surprised actually because the three or four you know i've always kept it on the screens actually i gave him some weight ratio so he can make some uh some um lho for mike for when he was fighting his cancer there in the beginning now that he's cancer-free which is awesome well it's in remission they're saying they can't see it canada saved mike's life thumbs up good on the cannabis community for helping out mike and good on mike for for believing in the community and believing in himself that was probably the biggest part is is believing in yourself that you know that this is what's going to help you so once again guys we got that 60 i'm going to pop this over here oh that's popping out and i i really interesting so what's really cool to see is that 110 screen actually gave me frozen and this here is it's really it's it's uh let's say i just flip these bags inside oh that's why i cut it down a little bit just makes my life a little bit easier because of the melts that i knew were not the large amounts and i flipped that inside out and and once again it's like it's there's not really too much resin in there it's this is i'm not that's surprising that's cool so this is really good this is nice to learn because i mean it seems like that those smaller microns are the ones that are pressing out really nicely and then we've got nothing from the 90 we know that you won't know we've got that leftover that's definitely going to press out just beautiful but we're not doing that with that but this 304 guys i found that pretty exciting myself so that's what we got from the 200 really nothing so and we got absolutely fiddly from the 90. it's 200 times it's 304 time guys it's time to do the 304 so now which is really interesting is this bag here well that's the one i cut by accident i might have to resell that that was me just gave me so here's the last bag that we're gonna do so as you can see i've done now second and third press in this bag and it's just like good to go again guys so now with this here do you want to do some determining how much i'm gonna put in there um i guess we should because we're looking at you and we're looking at what we're getting out of everything so we've been on average here about two grams so i'm just going to do that boom that's 3.5 2.7 last one was 2.6 good enough so we got 2.6 no this is 2.7 get a bag ready just like that pour in the sift so a lot of people don't have the three or four but what falls underneath that 200 onto the cardboard if you have anything underneath there to collect collect it that's going to be your what you want to do so never throw away your glass heads right you don't know what you got you don't know what what what what you're going to be able to get out of it i kind of want to pack this one a little bit fuller just because so on the end i want to show you what this 304 did to me the other day i was surprised this is the congo and the lemon lime and we know how good the condo is it's killer and with the screen being a little sticky like this it makes it so much more easier to kind of roll up so in the beginning when they knew they were a little you know this is not difficult they're very easy to use once again in the corner turn this on let's get out the heat gun 133 131 one i went down 126 117 that makes no sense 183 notes as you can see the concentration level of getting this in here good so it squishes nice doesn't come out the other side so that's what i mean see it starts dripping out of this one here like the 304 it just seems to be the one for me i was so surprised guys of the amount of rosin that was coming out of the 304 like really um and i just put a small amount in there if i put more in there it would just be goozing out when i did it yesterday's like so really that smaller micron we're at 35 seconds we'll probably do this a couple times and uh i know this heat's probably getting a little hot right now we'll turn it off and we're at the 40 second mark right now saw a little bit of steam so i'm going to pump that pop it when it's hot pop it when it's hot oh yeah the goo that comes out of the 304 look at that that blew my mind it's just gushing now you want as it's still hot you want to keep pressing this so you don't want to get cold and that's the whole thing because the heat is what's getting the extraction out right guys so let's do it for a second press we got that there we've got the press going with the time here which is kind of nice [Music] some problems guys i'm sweating i'm sitting here sweating away trying to get this done for you and uh as we're seeing [Music] it's not always the easiest especially when you've got a sword so i finally clamp this at 210 hold this up here [Music] [Applause] here's that second clap get it going and um i'm really seeing that this great big pile down here is a thumbs up so what's falling through all of those bigger screens the top there isn't really that much but this bottom screen underneath the 200 thumbs up guys that's a really important screen that i'm saying i always said that those smaller heads are probably more sedative more i always thought they're more of a cbd because i always found that uh even with the cbd strains those gland heads were so much more small and so much harder to get with with bubble bags and stuff like that and with the 304 screen i was like you know i find this resin more sedating that's just me that's what i'm seeing uh how i feel about a few different things but you know what guys i'm gonna give that a pop i really wanted to just show you what was going on with that 304 it's just beautiful and as you can see even better i can pull that right out of it look at that whoa it um it's it comes up pretty pretty damn stable now it's got some hair in it i just got the hair out but um once again i'm throwing resin on the ground so very good resin i wanted to weigh it but we don't really have to now what we need to do right now we have our leftovers right here guys you can see what's going on there we can see our yields up here with uh when we're doing the 77 grams i'm gonna say there's like less than half of that in there with uh the 200 like probably less than a couple points and then of course we have our 3.4 but what's really interesting was the amount of resin we got from that 304 that one underneath that 200 screen so as always guys rosin you're sift because you never know what you're throwing away especially underneath that 200 screen that's where you're going to get your melty that's the stuff you want to keep that's what i'm seeing here right now so as in through all of these one two three four five screens 9 16 90 110 200 305 um of course what we clean on top of the 200 with leftover there wasn't that much but what was what actually we started cleaning out of it was like number one it's like six star full mount if i rose and that it would be underneath the three underneath that on top of the 304 we've got some beautiful rosin so um squish your own guys squish in peace peace puff and passing you", "EOgPlzu0YNY": "[Music] [Applause] what's up the elevators a little hard to everyone that's locked in locked on coming straight to Babylon and from Babylon we shall always escape today I have something for you but it's not the normal it's just me sampling some has frozen that I've had for a while but before I finish it I want to share it with you because basically let me tell you what has frozen is hash frozen is when you take hash put it in a fine screen paper and press it in the machine it's not same difference as if you wants to play press flower cannabis but still oppressing the cannabis you take the trichomes or the part of the THC that has the psychoactive properties and distract it from the Berlin but once you get that extraction you extract it again from the hash and make rosin so it's taking away all the fatty greeny stuff out the rosin has whatever you want to call it that you don't want it makes four per clean-tasting high THC goodness matter of fact just let me show it to you real quick you see that yummy goodness you see the color you see the parenting and the smell is so strong the smell is - smells like Purdy we'd like the best and the finest weed you ever smelled it's really good this one let me see if I can get a better image for you guys that's about it I don't have my camera I'm using my cell phone hey the smell this one I don't know much about this I don't know what strain where I don't know any genetics of this one but I do know it smells vainglorious makes me wanna holler get out the game but too many people already know my name mmm-hmm okay next step let's taste it see what is uh see what the effects are I can't give you the I don't know the genetics but I can't give you the taste in smelling the physical properties okay quick summary has frozen not just regular bouncing has frozen you got to remember that so if you're looking forward and you want to pick some up remember to ask for fresh frozen hash Ronson it has a process to get that color it has to be fresh it has to be frozen it has to be made then it has to be immediately freeze-dried if you want the color and sustainability and taste but anyway let's start with the heating process yeah I know this is a real whack torch is what we have to work with today to get the results we want we get our nice and hot we're gonna taste this hash rising right before your very eyes [Music] I like low temps so the probably almost perfect for me see the flame on there you see who see nice and high anyway let's go and see what she thinks about [Music] take this take this really fresh it's really clean it has almost like no no expansion on the long snow Carson to throw just like a real heavy start filling in your eyes immediately I love everything about hash which is my favorite way to consume cannabis still clean no other particles unwanted chemicals there's like finest of the finest wine Terence of the clearest water tears of the stars at night with the twinkles in the eyes just saw the goodness you love about cannabis you know if you really in the fix are all set immediately I could feel the euphoric sensation just teaming up and down the back side of my body and I'm pretty sure that in 10 to 15 minutes that will produce its final course of helling activity to make sure that all the benefits of having a per hash sample it's going to shine through and shave that the best results come from the finest material", "MJ5nl4YdqMY": "[Music] bizarro outfits so I got three down to this remember he reaps this is the very last bit I'm leaving duty Shelby's

uploading it need to get a video from Bobby still yeah so I thought I'd just do this little video this is some of the 73 grated cheese from HQ from Barcelona this is the best-looking hash they had to be honest and it's still not even like I think maybe three star force star may be taught it yeah they need to start getting a bit better I think but I that were just going to do a little rosen video of all this I'm not sure I feel two ways but I should do that okay point 28 we pretty much just pick this up for like the last minute for all the money I've left in my account at HQ because I didn't think I had at me and then yeah I was just uh [ __ ] it might as well just pick up a gram of some bubble co DS and to be honest much better bubble here or what I've had recently so its fold this up so now I gotta follow up into a little light packet here I'm gonna go press it I'll be back in a second so I'm pretty much as compressed at 140 Rosen okay so pressed it two times is still like a little bit of residue up there so I might be able to fold it one more time for the left and there we go I'll show you this so those the first press still looks like you maybe get a bit more off of that I'm not and then here's the second press so we're just going to click this real quick and then yeah well it looks all right something best could have been better living better yield from it as well but

gotta figure out where to put that but right now I'm trying out the new bags I got 14 grams of utopia haze in here these bags are supposed to be the same size as my other ones but they are nowhere near it the other ones are two and a half by four half I don't know the dimensions on these but it's not truly a half by four it is more like one and a half by three and a half maybe something like that yeah anyways so I got 14 grams in her anyway so I could have got bored but I'm gonna stick with 14 that way I know roughly long when I get from one over Z well here we go she's warming up right now I didn't put my papers weren't that long it's gonna come always gonna come video work only took Amazon an extra week to give you my stuff I think they're punishing me because I just complained right there so they sent it from like I don't want to get into it but anyways here we go let's do this three times four times super sorry I'm so used to saying super lemony it's utopia haze there we go baby there we go my buddy is talking to him again the other day he ordered up some more seeds you got some of the the giggles when he starts those I'm gonna get a couple clones this time from go from there I've always wanted to try that strange skittles this is a giggles however you wanna say it here we go working grams look pretty good this stuff smells awesome it is a potent read not that I know yet I haven't tried it in any of my edibles yet or anything like I said I have got a crap load of rosin and now I'm gonna have a crap a little weed and I'm nothing wrong with that I won't run out for a long time that's another benefit of going to edibles people you got all kinds of stuff and then I got these two I've got the gel capsules so I'm gonna do this and it infuses a thousand of them

for some grapeseed oil or some coconut oil the pierced I don't want the stuff that's you gotta heat up and melt it I'm just gonna get the clear stuff so it stays like that otherwise a little form backed up into the harder stuff but any nice people want to see what the difference is in the yield here from 120 micron to 160 might phone but that's not too bad for 14 grams that in the back - oh

nice good / rasen I decided to use a smaller micron 37 micron stitched on the inside you can order these off of Amazon all day but the main goal is to show you how to pack it it's called our bottle take style you're taking you bend the corners in your bending the corners just like that see that corner right there see that corner right there just basically been in the corners in like that then you pack your bag fill the bag all the way the whole for friends dad just what the finished bag looked like you weren't DUP you want the edges to be round so you get like a round poke at the end see how I force it all down there like that and then you would just take and cut about a half inch above the Prado so that way you have enough room to tuck and fold see my small fold ready to go we also go in about 190 usually about 210 but today we want almost perfection see how with the bag is according I'm going to sit right there for about 32 seconds then sit by there till she starts to make oil

brother this - for you [ __ ] cancer all right here we go Thank You Negron Christian for the [ __ ] warm-up doubts so now let's get down to this this might be why everyone's here right I assume why everyone's here what the name of the fetus sports persuasion rosin so I'm gonna try to be a little more in detail it's not really about me it's more about what I'm doing so I kind of focus the camera to me right now layer in the feet I'm going to give this away to somebody laying it on here this is wasn't a ward of the secret cut believe it or not isn't that heavy as [ __ ] [ __ ] shout-out to the see good cut for the heavy ass Awards oh my god fourteen millimeter clear pipe bubbler what yeah so I'm gonna give this away to somebody here later in the feed I haven't decided however what if you guys have some cool contest ideas but I'm gonna give this away so alright I don't even need this in my way when I'm need here is to show you guys what I'm about to these question oh I thought I only have time because I got I got so two grams of blue GUCH in one gram of karma Kush that's what we're going to be pushing today so I'll pull out all my grams of bubble hash that's the first step I'm just gonna mix them all together it's gonna be one big three grams which how about that that's always talking big having baby love juicy juicy squishes so a lot of people commented about the packaging in parchment some people liked it some people didn't I don't understand why you wouldn't like it personally because you don't lose anything to your jar when it greases up you get a hundred percent of your hash back because it's about from parchment and I personally don't even smoke hash like this sighs [ __ ] rosin it all up anyway so again this is perfect you open it up and it's [ __ ] set for finger pressing right why would you want anything else opinions no right everyone's opinions various like some people would be like why would you want anything but of Thee Oh business yeah so thank you everybody for tuning in by the way it's pretty awesome that sloughing be able to do these line speeds I don't know I don't know who'll be able to do them live when I get to Alaska I'm sure I'll still be lesbian see if they'll be working in SoCal so I'll just do my wife she's down there but for the time being this is probably one of the last of the last live feeds I'll be doing for a while yeah who knows though who knows what the future grant like it's a day-to-day right now for me trying to get it to Alaska it looks like it would be moving everything in my house into a storage unit so back to what I've been doing anyways so I put all three grams of the bubble hash into one parchment okay and that allows me to break it up and make it into more of a top so this is a 3 grams of bubble option here and all my house will have a high enough to melt on it well you shouldn't need a straightener to pluck it out you should be able to literally just hold it in your hands for a couple minutes or whatever like this hold it tight and it's gonna give it enough eat where it's gonna grease up and you'll be able to [ __ ] mold it yes so this is yeah this bubbler will be giving away or I'm warming us up while talking about this bubbler begin with this boa this is a non-spill bubbler it's pretty cool you can literally put it in your pocket whenever and it's not gonna spill it's a [ __ ] it's a pipe boiler I've never used it it's brand new it was an award for invest butter at the 2013 SoCal seeker cup I believe might even clients THC I don't know I got both of those Awards I'm pretty sure this one's better hoo-whee my ribs a little sore right now [ __ ] got into a scuffle last weekend at times cool so I got this opened up and it's definitely in the center you can tell it's still a little house key the outside is really greased up but it's greased up enough okay that's crumbling apart just because the center is still Hashi I'm gonna hold it tight for a little bit longer you can always just put it on your hair straightener too and it'll be a lot quicker but when you do that I preferred not to I'd prefer just having one press against the hair straightener and then having that be enough you know what I mean so I'm just gonna wait to use the hair straightener again until this is enough until I'm actually making rosin I'm just gonna use my hands still compressing it to make a [ __ ] patty no Scotty us I'm still wearing my bra no I had to tip that I read it up you're not supposed to wrap your rib it's actually bad to wrap your rib so I didn't like I'm not wrapped up she's an ice and hot water helps a lot what do I think of flour on fire rosin man I'm not really a fan of it I tasted something it's really good but even then I feel like it doesn't have the effect that the hash rosin house it's all about either good hash rosin or good BHO that's my preference on what the smell if it's not the best of the best hash rosin I would rather [ __ ] smoke bomb DHL all day fly rosin is really Safi that's true I haven't seen any stable fire Azam so this should be impressed that plenty now it's definitely a hash pot solid it's a couple flakes but I can just you know finger press like that and pick them up so what I'm gonna do now is grab my coffee filter Malita coffee [ __ ] there's number four there's all different there's all different numbers really all that matters is the size you can get number two or number six that's just gonna mean it's gonna be bigger or smaller I mean the number six is going to be the same micron it's just gonna be a lot bigger so so what we'll do someone else what's going on in my case and do I have a GoFundMe no I do not have a go farming I would just like to take free [ __ ] you can go to my website peace alone Big Cartel calm there's a farmer Joe care packet and donate for that I've got a lot of [ __ ] merchandise I need to get rid of it I'm liquidating so if you donate to me I'll send you guys the [ __ ] cool [ __ ] and I really could use some donations right now anywhere from ten to a hundred dollars you know you can donate any of that and it would be really really helped it helped me you know I got some seriously expensive legal fees and moving feyza can't afford to [ __ ] move right now and they won't let me in Canada I'm facing some serious issues right now but I could really use your help I've been [ __ ] over and robbed for like 50 grand is actually not like it you hear I've been wrong for 50 grand from my last business partner and then pretty much my whole crop last summer also I was all about my growers and then I was also yeah I was robbed a lot it's [ __ ] but you live and learn right so I'm moving forward and I'm gonna start growing again and everything gonna be great what that what kind of bubble did I use to make the rosin at one Michigan and that was epoxy Tandy I believe I believe it was like half epoxy at half candy soon and it was definitely bow wash like this uh-huh am I still gonna auction a mother ship off that no the mother ships gone I got rid of that mothership I was gonna auction the mother ship off but I had a buyer so I got rid of it I didn't want to put it up for auction room you know I'm just the mother ship is gone it was just a mother ship mini that was donated by a good friend who actually was good bastard we want to shove it out me out there just remain anonymous shout out to you you know who you are buddy down in Portland there's some good people down there so it helped a lot with my [ __ ] Thea that actually put me with what I needed to get my bill paid back and start working towards the lawyer so that's where we're at with that all right now my fold pattern on this so you guys can see this I'm gonna bring this camera down here for this so I'll put my hash in there and fold it over and I like to leave a little pinch little space that way the hash has somewhere to go when you start pressing it doesn't just blow your filter out blow up stuff I'm gonna trim off the tip usually I put it right on the edge to start so let me start over so see how it's right on the edge right there fold that over fold it over again I'm gonna do the same thing and if you cut your filter too big just cut it off this is actually ended up being just the perfect size see that it can even be cut down just a little bit but I'm just gonna leave it and then fold over your edges and a lot of times your edges will be too big and I'll help you with that actually that's not a very clean fold you want a nice a nice pinch on there not want to know what we'll have squeezed it out with you know the whole you know what I'm saying so it's got a nice Clinton pin so I'm going to cut this edge off it seems like a half I have a little bit extra here not much though sweet so that's the pocket that I made and now I'm going to kind of superstring and thank you everyone for tuning in by the way hopefully this helped to maybe put the robber yourself um I am headed to Alaska actually as soon as possible so I'm gonna have myself a living there yet I do i afford to move all my stuff there [ __ ] Canada and supposed to be USA but I'm going to Alaska and with my family did I haven't heard of anything from laughs but I'm looking everybody else has ever seen him around I don't know just mention that because the names in the comments people are bringing them up okay this bad yo okay miss bite it that was some fun people in the room talking about for some reason that can't so when I did I kind of got distracted with all these [ __ ] comments so what I'll do is I'll take my parchment paper here fold it in half and then it's the bottom side I'm going to crease it up so because the way I do my press a lot of the rosin will drip down downwards till a I do i do my pulled this way for a reason so I've slide my pocket into here okay and when I put it on the heat there's nowhere I put it right on the very edge of the plate like that no I don't put it all the way down I just put it right on the very end of the plate and that means there's nowhere for the rosin to run back into the heat no matter what it's gonna squeeze away from the heat I'm going to eat it up or down on the way and most of it usually goes down so that's where this crease is here so then if it dripped down too much it's not going to drip out onto the floor so what I'll do now I'll take my hair straightener it's a Remington wet to straight you can get these at Walmart 30 bucks it's on the lowest setting right now it's on and as soon as I clamp down like that I'm not pressing hard but I'll turn it off right now and I'm not even pressing on it really and then I slowly go in with the vise and I kind of let the heat do the work at first I don't go in right away cuz if you go in right away you're just gonna break your back so I can see it pop up the sides I'm gonna just the parchment this could be pretty good and then you can slowly go into the pressure a little bit more it's all until it all juices out or until your pressure as always we use doing a lot of it's going up not as much as going down it's always different but usually it goes down sometimes it just shoots right off the end and goes down because of gravity you know overhead down let's just see a little better and then I got that all squeezed up and I kind of still see it bubbling juice or now it's a bigger squish no I only did one grants wishes sometimes I'll do acts like seven or eight notes wishes are fun cool it's good to go for that I'll just save the rest it make itto be a second swish on that parchment does it seem like it's still blood would use it all the way up move this back hold on one second it sounds like my son is away one second let me go check to see what my wife is out be right back he wasn't crying at all his he was one chocolate oh she's teasing in the chocolate I didn't make any mistake I'm all about that chocolate you all right so let's open this press it up and check it out sorry about that no way alright so here's the press filter you go save I don't think it fully got press all the way I can still see a little bit of rosin on the edges so what I'm going to do while it's still warm like this that I'm going to break it in half and I'm gonna do another press this is a big probably I want to just at least two grills what I've done actually over here I have a t-shirt press that originally i bought for making rosin but these things [ __ ] stuff I would not recommend ever buying this time I brought them so what I'm going to use it for is making a slab right it's all cool you have bigger sloughed than this if you have like a a 10 gram slab or maybe even else well this thing will work great for that so what you'll do is you'll get your two pieces of parchment about this size and I'm going to take my slab here my my collected rosin right here just like that take this little ball around and I'm going to set it on this parchment and I'm going to take this piece of parchment and put it on there just like that hey right now it's set at 140 degrees so I'm gonna go down and do it I'm not pressing it all apart all the way there there we go probably all we need to do voila snap action turn that off bring this back here let's check it out right so another thing I like to do yeah there's Windham here I'll take my slab and president against the window I'll cool it down rental plan BAM there's this lab all you can slice it up is that soft that's always fun right slice and flip the strip's keep this a little more yeah yeah Razia so this is pretty much the way that I've one secret cut Michigan secret Cup finals I've got second place and chalice I got Milla's favorite rosin and third place and won't solve it so I'm undefeated I haven't lost in competition with this method yet so as long as you're getting a high melt whether the 5 a true 6 star and what I recommend not even a 5 star if you meet yourself a true 6 star doesn't really even matter the strain and raw them that with this method you're [ __ ] unstoppable [ __ ] unstoppable so it's good to me right all sorts of different side of this what do you think you like that look good I think it looks great let's get it from another angle whatever reason close-ups with this thing focus oh [ __ ] not bad cool right because twice out of the way so this table place is nice I like it it's a little early one clamp vise so you can like rabbits any service just take it with you anywhere [ __ ] wine this place alrighty let's take a decent size strength I'm not going to take too big because you know that [ __ ] ribs hurt right now so take that [ __ ] piece out of there I don't got it all balled up someone else will work with dry socks yeah it'll work but it won't be as good I mean it just won't I don't want to say you product this is good or anything cuz I'm [ __ ] can beat the fires to the fire in my opinion it just isn't just good I'm CUBAN so let me tell you a story about hard discovered making this method I would funky go around to you know deliver to patients because that was a lot of you're allowed to do that so I was doing that and I would go around and look in they would give me buttons I think as it gets like here I give them a while they give me but then I was like I'm so I would take it home no Rosie because that way he's batted right and it just didn't really [ __ ] you taste that bomb to me personally I was like never really a firewall so I was like in a brawl it's not all that I'm a Pho thing and I went to the cup and I see cubed and you clearly $120 for a set right which I at the time I thought it was overpriced now I don't I think it's actually a really fair price you know cupid's a great nude and he's turned in fair price for a quality [ __ ] product where else are you gonna get it the one and the yields are light if you know anything about was doing that he's doing low yielding high quality badges very promising wear style so it's very worth it at the time I thought it was a very much Michael honestly so I took mommy's very $20 grams and we get back to this cabin and I was like you know what I'm just gonna draw in these like kind of in spite and so I took the [ __ ] grams from Cuban and I rosin them and it was the best [ __ ] hash I ever smoked in my life up to that point it [ __ ] just blew my mind I was like holy [ __ ] [ __ ] bomb so when I can't go home immediately what I did is I went over to my buddies at [ __ ] green delaying price laughs so he started swishing that and from then on it's been on [ __ ] all about that rosin Cuban girl was a great dude - by the way I got mad respect for human girl I don't even know we never really had any problem like a direct problem with each other these we were just kind of like would snap comments not comments out I'm and ended up blocking me I was out of death I guess and I really [ __ ] die crappy in that because he showed me a lot of [ __ ] respect last time at the Cannabis carnival and I [ __ ] I owe him I feel like they are you guys even Grover and he's not his genetics because you guys showed me a lot of [ __ ] love that I I honestly didn't deserve so thank you guys a lot for that totally respect human grower and these are needs and it's a lot I [ __ ] pin I'll vouch for those guys any day ah [ __ ] yeah the Turks are so

when I started so yeah get it on that things we're turning in these guys", "Wi3Z5Ppi-n4": "how's it going YouTube and welcome to the high life so I got a rosin tech video for you guys today it's gonna be another how-to but this time with bud instead of hash we're gonna go over the differences in the two and you're gonna see why I normally prefer pressing hash now this is gonna be a bit more detailed I'm going to give a little bit more information data than I did last time so hopefully that will clear some stuff up and yeah so well we're gonna be pressing today is some PAHO oh gee it's so some pretty fire that was gifted to me by a good friend today and I'm not hasn't been super big on smoking flour lately so I thought I'd press it into some rosin so first things first before we go over all of the tools we're gonna need let's go over the lead now if you're gonna make rosin weed it has to be good weed it doesn't necessarily have to be top shelf but it cannot be bottom shelf lead that is dry and doesn't have any give to it and it's just bunk you're not gonna get anything out and if you are it's gonna be very little and it's gonna be crappy wax you're not gonna want it I have never pressed this specific strain before or this specific batch so this is a crapshoot I have no idea how much I'm going to get it is definitely definitely gonna be far less than what I got out of the hash but that's to be expected so you know this is a crapshoot but it's a worthy crapshoot because the oil you can get from rosin is just absolutely top-notch so let's go over everything we're gonna need and then let's [ __ ] just get right into it obviously you're gonna need weed now I am going to press about a half gram of this and see about how much I get back so I am gonna need a scale kind of optional you really don't need it but I'm gonna use it just because I want to see what I'm putting in on what I'm getting out parchment paper absolutely necessary you cannot use wax paper it has to be parchment paper preferably unbleached but like I said in my last video I don't [ __ ] with that [ __ ] so yeah there's that a pair of scissors if you want to cut things nice and clean like or you can just [ __ ] rip it it's up to you and your heat source and in this case I'm using a hair straightener you guys can use whatever hair straightener you guys have I prefer these because it's got these nice big plates and yeah it just makes life a whole lot easier so let's Krabs's hardship seizure they should be in about enough to press the half frame we're going to be pressing and they're gonna press it in to smaller spits two quarter gram bits so let's cut these papers and two that way we have our two sheets now if you watch the Rossum tech how-to video with a hash you'll notice I did not mention we need a filter of any kind and that is because we don't unlike hash when you press weed it does not go spraying everywhere contaminating your end product you're in product when pressing we'd normally ends up being pretty clean you'll have some particulate in it but nothing that you really need to worry about and nothing that's really gonna affect in flavor or anything along those lines so I've got everything just about ready plug in the hair clippers our hair straightener Hair Clipper what the [ __ ] am I thinking either way and then I'll set this up here and let's get a different camera angle as we start doing some more and it seems as though I have misplaced my weed but I have found it so first things first let's weigh out some bud I'm looking for about a half gram and that is a bit more than a half gram but that'll do that's a point six let's call it a point six it's a point five nine but that'll do Pig that'll do I gotta get out of here get out of here okie dokie so now that we have weed we want to press let's start with this beautiful mug right here let's give you guys a look at this nice flower we're gonna be pressing it's so good looking bud definitely some top-shelf flowers definitely not the dankest of the dink but it will do so these little N stems you just want to pinch them off cuz you don't want anything to put a hole in your paper let's smash this down you want to create kind of like a little puck with it you want it nice and compact and this will help you get the most return out of it when you're pressing in and in fact you can even take something like this something you don't mind putting a bit of pressure on and just pre smash it with a good amount of your weight let's move this stuff out of the way for now [Music] and then BAM we got ourselves a nice little puck as flat as we can make it without any heat but you will see that this will get much flatter once we actually use some pressure in the heat so I'm gonna turn my hair straightener on I don't know if you guys can see it but my lowest temperature is 300 and I would set yours at the lowest temperature that you can possibly find and I'm dropping lights and we're back had a little bit of light malfunction but that's all fixed and taken care of now while I was taking care of that I left my hair straightener on and heating up and we're gonna try to do all of this right here so you guys could all see the goings on and to test it you just want to get a little bit of water on your finger or spit and touch the plate if they sizzle you are good to go now you might especially since mine is pretty hot 300 that's in the higher range of what people tend to press at so you might want to turn it off and let it cool down but that is up to you it will affect the end product though so what you want to do is you want to put the smashed nug dead Center and at the very base of your parchment then you might want to get something so your hand doesn't burn I'm using this sock I just pulled out of my clean dresser then we're gonna take take the bud package we're going to put it in between the plates then you're gonna slowly add pressure and keep pressing and press and press and press let up a little and then press some more as much pressure as you can the more pressure the better then the more end product you're gonna get okay let's load up oh and that squirted a lot look at all that beautiful beautiful rosin we got out I might have held it in there a bit too long actually it looks pretty nice and clean first things first look how thin that is you can barely see it now and there is our end product oh and I can't tell you how much that smells oh that smells so fire okay and let's clean off the end of this tool so we can collect this stuff but I have a trick because sometimes it can be kind of difficult to get off especially if it's kind of warm out so I will just stretch it over a cold soda and just slide it along being sure to get every last little yellow draw PC you do not want to miss any [Music] and let's cool the end-product off a little bit so it's not as sticky and then we'll show it off BAM now that doesn't seem like a lot and it really isn't and this is one of the reasons where I normally don't press flour but I can tell you that this stuff right here is some of the best oil you'll ever try in your entire life it'll be the most flavorful might not be the most potent but damn sure will be the most flavorful stuff you have ever had so let's try it out I am super [ __ ] stupid to try this [ __ ] I am a rosin fanatic I love rosin the only problem I have though is that I can never find good rosin in the store now Roz and I always find in the stores always this 28 grand [ __ ] that's always [ __ ] dark and nasty and that's just not what rosin should be rosin should be known as some of the dankest wax that you can come across and these people are just giving it a bad name you know because I've talked to a lot of people at Trump's and every time I bring up bras and they always kind of get this look on their face you know that's not that's not good he's with a little a little bit of work I've showed you guys it's not hard at all with with a couple things that you can just go steal from your [ __ ] girlfriend or mom you can have some very easy super safe solvent less wax that is better than anything that you're gonna get in any shop just food for thought and especially if you can make it with hash because then the yields work out right I mean it's definitely really expensive to be smoking rosin the way I'm doing it right here don't get me wrong like okay I'm not pretending that this is some super cheap method I'm probably getting [ __ ] five to ten percent yields at most well I think this thing's finally hot the stupid [ __ ] propane takes ages and a half to [ __ ] do anything but we live with what we got right oh I should probably get this gap on the end of mushroom and I'm [ __ ] the target and I got to eat this [ __ ] up again cuz this dumbass forgot to [ __ ] put the dab on the tool and it's too gooey when it's not cold the [ __ ] not and that's another thing depending on the temperature you press it at you'll get different consistencies as well I did it a bit too hot and I seemed when I do it too hot it seems that I get darker oil which obviously makes sense and I also tend to get a bit runny err consistency I personally have never squeezed out butter or crumble but I have seen it happen so I'm assuming that the possibilities out there so if that happens to you do not be alarmed you did not [ __ ] up you just hit the [ __ ] random Holy Grail I guess well from start to finish probably took about 10-15 minutes at most yeah well it the process will take 10 to 15 minutes at most then when you're done you'll be left with this delicious wax cheers everybody let's get [ __ ] twisted while it's tasting super [ __ ] dank Cheers [Music] [Music] so smooth they taste holder way I can describe it this is exactly how the weed smells exactly it's that it's phenomenal it's like when you were younger I need to smell weed and you're like man I wish this weed tastes of how it smelled it can just make it into rosin and you'll taste how it smells so I hope this was a informational I hope it helps some of you [ __ ] go out and try to make some urine rods and now stop giving the weed guy all your money for some top-shelf wax and make your own safely and without Alton [ __ ] off chemicals well thank you guys for stopping by please like comment share subscribe you [

mouths what up bro I hate that you copy me into the stream yes in a guy every trip yeah from the girl give me something even I presets out hanging out y'all know what it is I'm the homeboys name before 20s always stay play these guys", "QcNGQP2rdcI": "hello how we doing so keep in mind I suck at making videos pretty much of all kindness but what we're gonna do is we're gonna press some rosin so what I have is I have some bud right here so that's that's actually blue dream and then right here I got this little piece of Rick Simpson oil beef hash that I made myself so those are gonna be what we press today this is a Revlon piece of crap $10 hair straightener the box said that the high setting was 400 so it's pretty much what I needed so that's that's what I'm using figured if it breaks 10 bucks who cares so fresh clean sheet of parchment paper I give it a fold right down the middle okay now throughout this talking I'm pretty sure my hair straightener is pretty good and hot probably about ready to use let me grab one more thing so it's also good to try to keep some coffee filters around if you're gonna do that so I just use the standard old mr. coffee coffee filters but we'll get to that in a minute so to start with I'm gonna take the bud and I'm just gonna set it in the full nice and comfortably most of that is gonna get pressed together all right clear and evident what I'm trying to press I'm just gonna put it in there give it a little squeeze not much to start with all right so it hasn't produced anything so we're not quite hot enough yet not a few seconds so we'll be ready to go all right let's see what happens now we're doing a full-on press so want to the partial press kind of just a test to make sure the hot enough but the full-on press you really want to kind of lay them - all right you hear it sizzle once you hear it sizzle back off now I'm gonna pull the pot out for a second it's kind of flat but what we have here those black spots those dab wax spots okay I don't know if I got them in camera or not because I'm on the wrong side but now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the same but I move it a little bit to a clean spot off some more fresh clean dead wax so that's gonna be what you want to do to press your rosin from pot so I'm going to get a fresh clean piece of parchment paper for the hash because it's a whole nother experience altogether now hash is made at a Keith so if you try to press it it's gonna fall apart pretty much what you expect okay so that's why we're using the coffee filter what we're gonna do is we're gonna press the wax through the filter alright so I'm gonna make sure that gets in the fold and then I'm gonna leave a little space again for the wax to have a place to go alright so just like a quarter of an inch between that fold between the hole for the coffee filter and the bolt for the parts of the paper press alright so the first one should flatten it out what you're gonna get some wax pretty quickly alright alright now when you're doing wax or when you're doing hash you get it a massive conversion to wax alright so you see what we got there that's a lot just from one press alright and this thing will just keep pressing and pressing so the coffee filter is keeping all of the contaminants out of the wax something to give it a good couple presses it's not even gonna be enough really I can still keep pressing this after this video is done but it will see you'll be able to see a good bit of what I'm getting out of this so there it's all wax I'm ready for the smoking so you just scrape it off with a blade and you're ready to go put it on something and you're good", "9FFnQhc2sgk": "hello and welcome to today's webinar solvent list extraction explained profiting from rosin my name is Eric sandy and the digital editor of cannabis business times in this exclusive webinar pure pressures director of marketing Eric glass key will give you the tools strategies and key information on how to capitalize on the quickly growing solvent extraction segments of the cannabis market focus on actionable insights this webinar will cover solvent list concentrates across every aspect Eric will explain exactly what saltless concentrates are which eske use are the most popular how to cultivate or source material that yields well for Robins and how to attract customers to your brand just a few quick housekeeping notes before we begin you'll notice on your screening questions box please do feel free to type in your questions as the presentation is going on and I will relay them to Eric at the end and also know that if you have to leave any time we will be recording this presentation both the audio and video and emailing the full archive link to all registrants in a few days here so you will have access to to the whole presentation with that I'm very pleased to welcome today's presenter Eric Blackie thank you Eric appreciate the time in the intro and I also appreciate everyone who's tuned in right now this presentation was designed with you guys in mind and it's going to be really focused on educating everyone about what solvent list is and how you can incorporate it into your business profitably so to get started just going to do a quick intro here and go over what our agenda is so everyone gets an idea of what the cadence just like Eric just said my name also Eric I'm the director of marketing and now business development with peer pressure I joined in 2016 and I'm also the marketing and brand strategist for peer Cannell abs which is our sister consulting agency I've been working in the cannabis industry for just about there is now big passion for what's going on it's awesome to see the growth in the industry so today's agenda first I'm going to be talking about what is solvent list we're going to be going through kind of the layman's overview of solving Wisconsin traits and all concentrates just as they fit into the market in general so the point of this is we're going to be talking both to total beginners intermediate as well as people who have quite a bit of experience here so I believe that anyone who's tuning in no matter how much knowledge you have about concentrates or cannabis in general you'll be able to take some great insights away from this presentation then we're going to start talking about solvent with skews and some of the products that can be made solvent lessly as well as market data that supports where the market fit is what kinds of products these are as well as giving you guys some ideas about who are purchasing these products although some of that information is a little bit more anecdotal then we're going to be talking about material identification this is one of the biggest topics in solvent lists you know how do I get the right starting material to yield well to work well to make those super high-end concentrates then I'm going to wrap it all up with you know really the top key tips and ways to frame your thinking about how to be successful with solvent lists you know high-level points that you can take and implement immediately and then we're going to leave about 15 or 20 minutes at the end for Q&A so that I can make sure that I can get through as many of your guys questions as possible so with that being said the focus of this webinar is going to be on the THC side of cannabis in solvent lists I will be touching on CBD as well but just so everyone knows going into it CBD is going to be a little bit more of a footnote for this presentation so let's get started so what is solvent list there's a lot of terms out there but a solvent was cannabis concentrate is one that is made without any solvents so it's butane co2 or ethanol this extraction method is also known as mechanical separation now there's no governing body dictating which words people are using in the cannabis industry now it's still a bit of a Wild West situation and we're hoping that in the near future there will be a little bit more clarity around this but some people say that water for example is a solvent I would argue that it's not water in the solvent was processed for bubble hash or ice water hash which we'll get to soon you're separating the trichomes from the plant material and trying to keep them intact whereas if you're performing light hydro carbon co2 or other solvent based methods it's actually a process of dissolution so that's an important distinction here that solvent lists for the most part is getting a mechanical separation and then rosin which we're going to get into in a lot of detail here shortly is expressing and filtering those isolated trichome heads so solvent list fits in to the market as the craft beer of the concentrate world it is the high-end artisan level concentrate that the huge brand builder for any business that's processing or manufacturing cannabis products you want to think about this as the same kind of consumer that's interested in organic fruits and foods that's also going to be the type of person that's interested in solvent list because well to give it full credit with butane co2 and other methods you can purge the vast majority of those residual solvents you really can almost get to actual zero percent solvent or having a product that has never touched them in the first place the only way you can do that is with solvent list now another question that we get a lot is what does solvent 3 mean versus solvent list solvent free means that it doesn't contain any solvents when it reaches the customer but that it did contain solvents or solvents were used in the production of it so there's a whole subset of customers that will only buy solvents products and if you are not making a solvent list product of one variety whether it's a dab mobile concentrate an edible or a topical you're not even in their consideration set so that's why it's important to recognize that having us almost concentrate is an important part of any processing or manufacturing business plan so to move on to the next section some people who have been in the industry a long time are going to know all this already but for everyone who's tuning in who's a little bit new to the concentrate world or is really just getting their feet under them about what kinds of concentrates are out there I figured that it would be helpful to throw in this a fairly busy chart about where current concentrates in the cannabis industry fall so on the left side of the chart here you can see what we've got are the solvent list and of concentrates dry sift sometimes also known as Keith bubble hash also known as ice water hash and Robin and those three products of course are going to be what the vast majority of our focus is spent on today but it's also important to know what the solvent based concentrates are and to clear up something about distillate so that distillate can actually be made with solvents or without you can do terpene separations with steam that wouldn't constitute as using solvent and then you can also see at the bottom here all of the different textures and types of oils that these various extraction methods can make now this is the current state of these extraction methods but whatever one should keep in mind is that things are evolving very rapidly across the space innovation is happening as quickly as anyone can keep up with core solvent lists and solvent based so one thing that's not in this graph that people might be wondering is what about flour rosin that's a product I've heard about I've tried I've seen it that is not a separate process necessarily we just lump that into the general category of rosin so one thing that might stand out to people that aren't as familiar with the rosin process or maybe even familiar with the hydrocarbon process is that there is a significant amount of textures and different products which we'll get into a lot of detail on with making rosin you know a lot of people coming into this think well you know I I would like to make a dabble concentrate product it has a high price per gram I've heard you know there's a lot of brands out there that really made a name for themselves with this but what can I really do with rosin and the answer is with minimal post-processing you can come out with an enormous variety of different oil textures and resulting products so live rosin coming from fresh frozen material straight separated terpenes which can be used for all kinds of things a very popular product category right now diamonds also known as diamonds and sauce sauce meaning separated terpenes kind of the street word or the colloquial sense of that you can even make shatter wax butter sugar oil there's all kinds of different textures that can be made now there is some variability in your starting material so that's why we've got dry sift and bubble hash there on the left and that you typically have the most versatility with all of the different kinds of robins that you can make when you are starting with bubble hash and bubble hash really consist of just pure isolated trichome heads and the same goes for dry Civ again really going back just briefly to what mechanical separation means we're trying to isolate trichome heads get rid of the plant debris and plant material that we're capturing the pure essence of the plant the resin which is contained in those trichomes and then that gives you a lot of a lot more flexibility to create all kinds of other products now you'll see one product on here that hydrocarbon can make that rosin can't is crumble which is a popular texture but for the most part rosin is capable of creating just about every texture of oil Under the Sun both in high end a beable concentrate form as well as food grade form four topicals edibles and all kinds of things and then well co2 and ethanol are both extremely popular concentrate and processing methods the actual end resulting products are a little bit more limited now those can be used in all kinds of things as well but the whole point here is to just give everyone a sense of how much variety and how many different textures can be made and that textures are not confined to one processing method or another in virtually all cases so moving along this is going to be for a full disclaimer the only time in this entire presentation that you're going to see anything about the products that we sell or what we do peer pressure is an equipment manufacturer in the solvent with space and this is an overview of the general equipment that's needed to make these kinds of products so not doing sales we're not doing plugs but just wanted to give everyone that disclaimer while I explain the slide this is about the only time you're going to encounter this so for dry sift how it's made is with a sifting machine I've got an example here the green bros alchemist 420 that's got stainless steel screens that trim or flower is put in it's graded against those screens which shears the trichome heads off which are then collected and can be used for a variety of different purposes just like we were talking about all kinds of different boy close in like we'll get into different SKUs and product themselves now there's a little note there plus static cleanup typically if you're trying to make a very high-end dry sip product the keys coming out of your grinder isn't going to fit the bill you're going to need to do some additional static cleanup to be able to get as much of the debris out as possible so that you can have better isolated trichome heads now bubble hash this is the extraction method that we'll spend a little bit more talking time talking about today excuse me because of the versatility that I was mentioning in the last slide and it comes with a little bit more equipment to execute on properly you have to wash it you need a drain vessel that the ice water is being used to go in it's being filtered and then it's ultimately freeze-dried so whereas dry sip is a dry process with dry cured material either trim or flour or popcorn bubble hash or ice water hash is done with ice and water which the cold temperatures and the water and agitation help detach those trichome heads which are then filtered graded and dried and then at the end of all of this unless you're selling just a straight bubble hash product of which there's a couple varieties or a dry security product which again there's different grades and varieties it's all pressed on a Robin press so all of the textures that we were just talking about in the last slide that large kaleidoscope of different products that can come out of solvent list those are all made on one piece of equipment and that is a rousing press so or we get into some data and start talking about them skews I wanted to go over a couple of solvent list facts and myths these are some important points that we get asked about constantly and I'm sure people in the audience right now are already thinking about this or we're potentially already planning to ask these questions so is solvent list less potent than BHO or perhaps other concentrates and the testing answer is no it's not depending on the product coming out the other end with rosin you can get potency ranges anywhere from sixty to ninety nine percent and on that super high end that's a THCA isolate so you can actually isolate thb a with mechanical separation a little bit of a long word there chain of words but the potency is absolutely comparable depending on what the starting material is second thing does CBD play nice with solvent list short answer is sometimes we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about this but for all the people in the audience who are either hemp farmers or are using hemp and are interested in how solvent lists will work with your CBD product it absolutely can it really comes down to the starting quality of your CBD so if you've got field hemp to be perfectly honest with everyone here that tends to not work so well with salt processes if you've got boutique high-end grown CBD it tends to work a lot better the solvent less offer comparable yield this is another one of the biggest myths that we're constantly combating you know with high quality material and we'll talk in depth about this you're going to find that yields are extremely comparable or right up just on top of other popular processing methods such as hydro carbon co2 ethanol things like that now yield is a little bit of a tricky question because it depends so much on what your starting material is what you're trying to get out the other end and really what you're trying to accomplish and that where we've learned a lot over the last couple years in the solvent of space is that with a solvent was product you need to think about it by making your high-end if that's what you're shooting four and then multiple washes or multiple presses to get all of the remaining oil out so that you can have what is more considered a full yield so that you're getting you know using all parts of the Buffalo as it were and then lastly is solvent less expensive to produce so very short answer is no it's not solvent list tends to be significantly less expensive in terms of equipment regulatory needs than hydrocarbon co2 and other extraction methods not only is the equipment quite a bit cheaper objectively you're also going to find that you don't need a C one D one room in your state if that's required for hydrocarbon regulators tend to look a lot more favorably on solvent lists and are more likely to grant it in your lab because the safety aspect of it is not in question due to high pressure or flammable solvents so it tends to be if not the least expensive extraction method to get started with so now none of this would be complete without going through some important market data so first we're going to start with a bunch of data that we've pulled from the MJ biz 2019 Factbook I plug MJ business back book every seminar that I ever do we are not affiliated with MJ biz in any way but they have some of the best data in the entire industry now there's going to be slides throughout this presentation that reference data from headset and other places but for everyone who's tuned in the webinar now if you are interested in really really getting into the nitty-gritty with market data product data every kind of cannabis data that you could imagine the MJ biz back book is probably the best place to find it so again we received zero financial incentives plugging them we just really liked their data and for everyone who's here trying to learn things highly suggest checking them out it's a great source to learn so most of this data I believe was pulled before everything happened with Co vid 19 but with that being said we're still seeing many of these signs happening now and that it seems that people are extremely optimistic in the processing market and we're hearing that for many of our other industry partners as well so cannabis processors in the next 12 months their outlook is saying 92 percent are expecting a better outlook that's a lot that is a major majority and if you even include the 4 percent that's the same you're looking at a vast majority of cannabis processors expecting to encounter better conditions in the next 12 months now that's a little bit open-ended they didn't explain exactly what better means necessarily but that means that a lot of cannabis processors who are already in the space and doing this are optimistic about what's going to happen over the next year now processors that are planning to expand into new markets over the next 12 months 81 percent of them are so that is a pretty telling number that another key figure here is that the vast majority of cannabis processors are planning to expand their operation I struggle to think of any other industry where this kind of thing is happening processors are expanding they are feeling that things are looking good and then this last data point here on the slide it stands out a little bit because it doesn't seem to fit in with the others but wholesale cultivators are indicating that high quality is 40 excuse me 46 percent of wholesale cultivators are going for high-quality as the key differentiating factor for the products that they're selling now that's extremely important because high quality material is one of the key aspects to ensuring that you can create some of the high-end solvent 'less products that we spoke about earlier so it means that access to high-quality material is likely increasing for businesses either entering the space or for businesses that are not fully vertically integrated and have to source material from wholesale cultivators so organic at 23% is also great because organic material tends to be very very good with solvent list and then you see below that low cost grown sustainably terpene content value and other those are pretty minor you know high quality material and organic material seems to be what more wholesale cultivators are focusing on meaning that processors are going to have access to more material and better material hopefully now the next slide and this is the number two executive summary take away in the MJ biz 2019 fact book this is a little bit to take in so a lot of numbers a lot of words I'm going to try and walk everyone through this so that you can really take this nugget of wisdom away so gray unprofitable blue break-even green profitable pretty easy to understand that now this graph is telling us that the number of SKUs produced has a dramatic effect on reported profitability from the businesses that participate pated and answered the survey that mjp is put out to gather this data so that red box at the bottom what you're going to see is a massive increase in reported profitability for businesses that are having 11 to 15 different skews compared to 1 to 3 so if you're a processor and you're only making a handful of different products reported profitability is absolutely tiny whereas businesses that are producing multiple SKUs and again it seems at this time like the perfect range is around 11 to 15 83% of them are reporting profitability again it's hard to overstate how dramatic of a difference that actually is and even you're seeing businesses that produce 7 to 10 different unique products are reporting three three times as many of those businesses are reporting profitable or profitability over businesses that are doing 4 to 6 and then it's 16 plus you start seeing a little bit of a drop-off although it's still a strong increase over the businesses that are only producing tenfold and then at the top of this graph it's really showing that processors that offer products across multiple categories meaning hydrocarbon solvent lists ethanol different areas of extraction almost half of them report profitability so when you combine offering multiple products in different categories with different types of SKUs that's really where you hit the sweet spot of being able to come up with a balanced product line that addresses as many consumers needs in a dispensary as possible there's always going to be consumers that are looking for the cheapest gram of flour they can buy just like there's always concentrate customers that are only going to be looking for the highest end solvent list that's on the Shelf it's important for any business to produce multiple SKUs and to have SKUs across different categories so tying all of these thoughts together with the data that we just reviewed adding solvent list concentrate is one of if not the least expensive ways to add additional SKUs to your product lineup and is one and a set of SKUs that are highly sought after by connoisseurs and influencers so make sure that you are offering enough SKUs to really help give you the best shot at increasing your profitability and becoming profitable and hitting that break-even point if you have not already cool so now to spend some time shifting gears pretty completely going away from market data and giving some more explanations about what kind of popular solvent with SKUs are out there so there's a lot of text on this slide and on the next one I'm not going to read every single one word for word I would highly encourage anyone to go back to the recording and dig through this a little bit more if there are some parts of these SKUs that you're interested in learning a bit more about or simply asking the question here in the webinar and I'll answer those at the end the number one SKU that we're seeing sold in the market right now is ice hash water rosin this has a very high price per gram it's the top sold rosin product and it's a connoisseur grade concentrate that build brands and loyal buyers okay I read off the first one I can do that for all them the big thing about having solvent with products of virtually any variety is that they can win over influencers and brand builders that are going to talk about your products a lot more than some of the more entry-level less expensive products and we've got clients who where perhaps the vast majority of the revenue they generate is off of some of the more entry or budget-friendly concentrates or products but that they really have built their brand on the backs of their ice water hash rods in their bubble hash robin and directly to that hash robin based cartridges becoming extremely popular now takes quite a bit of an RD but these are the most expensive the most sought-after and at this current time a fairly rare product we're seeing those go from anywhere from fifty to eighty dollars a half gram and it really is the ultimate cannabis product for multiple consumers talking about sift there's of course dry sift rosin tends to retail for less than ice water - rosin but it has a lot of versatility with a lot of different grades and quality now solve them with edibles are another area that's really seeing tremendous growth right now and another opportunity that multiple businesses should be thinking about if they're not already the number three edibles in California according to headsets state by state sales database data is a solvable settable in the past it was the number one edible and that's a key book product so these edibles tend to retail for 20% more than standard edibles or more depending on the market and you can use a lower grade starting material to get a food grade oil to make it work additionally there's a couple more SKUs that we're going to talk about here solvent was topicals and bombs the number one through five topicals or bombs in california are made solvent lessly and they're all Papa and Barclays products they're 50 milliliter tincture that goes for about sixty six dollars I believe their products range from you know fifteen dollars but they do command a premium and they are a true full-spectrum quality product made with again solvent list food grade oil that's put into premium topicals now you've also got full melt ice water hash which is something that a lot of people who've been around the industry for a while will be familiar with and this is the ultimate product for connoisseurs this is pure isolated trichome heads that melt without leaving any residue now the actual sales volume for full melt ice water hash isn't terribly high but if you have high enough quality material to create it this is what wins over connoisseurs like no other the bottom left we've got flour rosin this is an entry level robin product more popular in certain markets and others typically less mature or less developed markets because it's such an easy way to get started you can literally just take a dried cured flour put it in a Robin press squish it out and you've got flour rosin it does tend to retail for less than hash and stiff problem however and then finally we've got hash you use pre rolls this is the number five pre roll in Colorado it's been as high as number one in the past I updated all of these numbers this morning just to make sure that I was providing accurate data for everyone but they also command a pretty hefty premium on how much they sell for typically these are pre rolls that are infused with bubble hash sometimes with sift or key to but as you everyone can see there is a lot of variety here in terms of what kinds of different SKUs that someone can make in order to be successful with solvent list so through these this is kind of scratching the surface because underneath topicals and bombs and edibles especially there are so many different varieties from tinker's bone gummies brownies I mean you name it if there's a product that you're particularly interested in that you love that your market loves can be made with solvent list that product can command a premium and that you can do it without having to throw down hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment purchasing okay now we're going to move on to some of the most important parts of this presentation and why I think a lot of people are tuning in in the first place which is to really understand how they can be successful with solvent lists and what they need to be looking for in the first place to do this so one thing before we jump into genetic selection that I just wanted to show everyone real fast as a EndNote on the versatility of rosin is that these eight products were all made from a single bubble hash string one of our consultants that we work with and since Alden was on instagram whoever is on Instagram I'd highly encourage you to follow him he does some of the best work in the industry he took one strain of bubble hash and set out to figure out how many different SKUs how many different products can I just make with bubble hash that are dabble concentrate this says nothing about cartridges or edibles or topicals you can see just a loan this is eight different textures that are being produced from one single strain of bubble hash all at very different you know levels of interest depending on the consumer so just really driving home the point that there's a lot more versatility with solvent list than a lot of people realize you so now how do I take solvent list and make it successful for my business and the most important thing to start with when you're going down this road and really trying to figure this out is how to understand trichome structure you can't just put any strain in with solvent list and have it be successful and the reason for that is because of the trichomes and the resin content because we're not dissolving the resin out of the plant material with the solvent and we're detaching it mechanically the actual size and shape of the trichome that the plant produces are absolutely critical to getting a yield that's going to be profitable for your business and for making a product that consumers are going to be excited about the one that's sitting on the shelf so in this slide and there's going to be two slides talking about trichomes here we see ABC those are all mid-range or below so AC e and F these are tiny you can see that you know 20 microns 50 microns 20 micron 10 10 these are very very very small try trichomes and when you're doing an ice-water hash filter process or a sip process typically the microns below 45 tend to be food grade and they're still very useful but they don't get captured nearly as well as the example D which is the capitate stock trichome that has a large glandular head full of resin a fairly large stock this is a very resinous trichome at the large size it's pretty much the ideal shape and type to process ultimately whether you're making bubble hash flour Robin stick rather than whatever it is so the cheapest way that you can figure this out without spending a ton of money on a microscope or another product is just to get a jeweler's loupe it's not going to have a micron rating on it but it will give you a much better idea of what type of trichomes you're dealing with I mean you could literally buy a cheap one for 10 or 15 dollars on eBay so really getting into your plant or your plant or the strain that you want to put through your solvents process and looking at it at the nearly microscopic level that is what's going to help you first determine if that strain is going to be viable for solvents or not additionally and I just came across this earlier this week and I've got to give credit where it's absolutely do which is to farm house to do genetics they're based in the northwest and this strange sugar coat which is pictured here with bred specifically super saltless now something that you're going to start hearing a lot more about is trichome detach ability because again saying is over and over we're talking about mechanical separation how well do your trichome neatly detach from the plant material so that they could be captured isolated and then processed so the perfect hash trichome has a thin neck a medium length stock and a large glandular head now I think farmhouse coined this term because I haven't heard anywhere else before this is the week next trichome which provides optimal detachment so if you see where the arrow is pointing look at how thin and narrow that little bridge is between the stock and the head that means with even very very gentle agitation that should detach easily and be able to be captured so there's a lot of genetic companies out there that are now breeding strains specifically for saltless which is often to see making it that much more viable and that much more profitable at the same time again it really comes down to understanding what your plants can do before you commit to large runs whereas with a solvent based extraction method you kind of just throw it in and run it and go from there with solvent lists you need to pay a lot more attention not only to the quality of your material but the types of trichomes that your material is actually making so you're probably asking okay this all looks good these trichome examples are really cool but what kinds of strains are we talking about here so I've got good news for you if you want to screenshot this please go ahead again this will be available in the recap that will be sent to everyone but I've come up with a nice healthy list of different strains that people can take advantage of and their own grows and start feeling hunting for now what's important to also understand is just because you go pick up a Ken dog off of one of many seed websites or from a friend that does not guarantee that that strain of Ken dog is going to have that trichome structure or the resin content by raw potency that's going to be a winner with solvent list these are strains however that we see our clients running constantly that we see mentioned on Instagram constantly and are a great place to start for anyone that's either struggling a little bit to get some strains that are really producing well for saltless or if they're before they're even getting started and you're vertically-integrated going to grow your own material these are ones that you can actually look into getting seeds getting cuts talking to people and starting with these you're you're going to see many of the best hash makers across the world are washing drying and pressing many of these strains crosses of these strains these are some of the most popular lineages in the entire cannabis space for solvent was processing now with that being said things are changing all the time there's always new genetics that are coming out and for those of you who are tuning in who are not vertically integrated meaning you're not cultivating your own product you don't have quite as much control over the supply chain of the cannabis that you happen to be processing it's really important to ask the wholesaler that you're buying your cannabis from that you intend to process has this material been washed do you have other customers who have watched this material is this going to be a strain that's going to play nice with solvents we never advise customers or people who are looking to get into solvent list to blindly go out by tens of pounds of fresh frozen hundreds and start washing it and hope for the best you really need to talk to whoever you're buying your cannabis from or whoever your grower is that's responsible for growing strength having a much better understanding of will this strain provides right trichome structure and have the right resin content so that I can be profitable with my solvent with processing methods so really doing a little bit more digging putting a bit more of the onus on the cultivator of the provider to help provide you with some strains and material and some solutions that will be successful for solvent processing so my favorite of all of this list right now is the Tropicana cookies by Oni Seco there are too many genetic companies to name that are excellent but there's so many good profiles and these are some of the top shelf screens just for flour in general that are now being refined into you know what are considered to be the best concentrates perhaps in the entire world and that sugar-coat strain that we were just showing with the weconnect trichome farmhouse genetics farmhouse studios you know excuse me told me that that strain and those seeds will be available pretty soon so I would definitely make sure to follow them on Instagram and get an idea of when those are dropping because we expect that those will sell out very quickly but hard to go wrong with starting with any of these ok so we're going to get into the end here and really wrap this all up for everyone now before we do the full wrap-up it's really important to understand what kind of space you're going to be operating in and for a lot of businesses and the question that we get constantly is how much space do I need to do all this this sounds great I want to make these products this equipment sounds good I've got good material or I know someone because how do I get my space going less than a thousand square feet is very common for saltless operations or divisions you would be surprised to see that some of the best concentrates in the solvent list world and in the world in general are being made in what almost look like closets and very small areas so that a lot of square footage is definitely not necessary unless you're trying to really scale up your operation and do very high volume now the scalability of solvent list is something that has changed a lot recently there's a lot of innovation happening and that this can scale well above that and you've got operations that are saying thousand square feet you know I've got 50,000 square feet to work with how can you help me there short answer is you don't need a lot to get started but as you scale of course you'll need a little bit more space to produce more proper force and ceiling height planning is also important you know getting started with this and this is something that we offer as a service as well is helping with floor plans but that really understanding how all of the pieces of equipment that you need to produce the products that you're trying to bring to market how do they fit into your lab how many of them do you need where do they go these are all very critical things to think about before you put pen to paper and because most regulators demand this information before you're even allowed to open up shop or make any changes anyway and then again wrapping that up developing a predetermined processing space flow will save you time and money and it can always be modified as you grow as you change as you make different products you're not set in stone on these things but just making a point that having some adequate planning ahead of time will really save a lot of headache and increase your profitability long dress now take everything that we just talked about here are the top four ways that your business can succeed with solemn list and the number one way is know your market and what it wants you know people on the west coast in California Colorado very mature market their appetite for 60 to $80 or more grams of hash rosin is a lot higher than it is on the East Coast at least in the illicit markets now what you're going to find is that every market in its stage of maturity or development is going to grow from extreme interest in just raw flour to more concentrates more products more flavor profiles so it's really important to understand you know what are dispensaries that you're trying to work with or already working with what are they saying what are they selling so before you go all-in on trying to get the holy grail of making a robin cartridge there are some steps along the way that you need to make and you want to make sure that your market is ready for that product and that you're going to be successful with it the second is the source or cultivate premium quality material for dabble products only that's the key here is that if you're trying to make a dabble concentrate the quality of your material is tantamount to success or failure out the other end for what you're trying to do make sure to test that material before you commit to a full batch processing you know just like we're talking about jeweler's loupe look at the trichome really understand what you're doing now if you're making a topical or an edible I'm not saying that you can use lower quality material you can you don't have to but that more of a food grade oil a trim anything along those lines can absolutely fit the bill for edibles assuming that of course it passes contamination testing because the solvent 'less process does not offer any sort of remediation the same way that your tain does for example so premium quality material for dab mobile products is absolutely critical additionally environmental controls really are the difference maker for true top-shelf solvents concentrates you know having a cold room when you're making bubble hash ensuring that your room is clean that you have a good process down these are all things that we've got numerous videos and blogs about that you can dig into the details on but environmental control is extremely important to really make those ultra high-end concentrates and then my last big piece of advice for everyone who's taken the time with me so far to get all the way here a be mindful of creating multiple products with your source material don't just make a bubble hash and then sell a full spectrum bubble hash make and pull so make and sell a full spectrum bubble hash and a food-grade you know topical or edible or take the extra leftovers and put it in a pre-roll there's so many different options to get your full yield and to make more money from your solvent products than just coming out with one thing or two things you've got a lot more options at your fingertips so check in see what people in your market are interested in what they're buying and then work from there so that wraps up the presentation I really appreciate everyone coming pretty much right on the dot 15 minutes for QA Eric if you want to start shooting some questions my way I'd be happy to start answering sounds great well thank you so much Eric that was really fantastic and very nicely detailed we do have a number of questions that have come in and I'll just remind it or when you'll see a questions box on your screen so please do type in your questions we've got about 15 minutes here Eric we've got a number of questions about about yield and trichome detach ability I'm going to try to sort of bake them into one question however however they'll probably a couple questions here really but how do you measure yield and how do you in terms of sourcing genetics how do you know what you're getting before taking out the jeweler's loupe and looking closely I guess some what should what should folks be looking for when trying to measure trichomes and trying to plan for yield yeah great question what it comes down to is this selection process that experienced processors have really refined over time you know coming into it as a newcomer where you don't have that ability it's almost a sixth sense where you can look at a bud or fresh frozen plan or a plan even before it's been cut down and say wow this is a very resinous strain it smells really good the blood structure is not super dense or super lar fee you know very light so you know for everyone who's tuned in that doesn't have the sixth sense of the master processor it's really important to know you know has this strain been grown before by this cultivator and what's it testing at if you've got more juice to squeeze you're gonna have a better shot at having a salt most product you know whereas if it's a very low potency strain there's just not as much resin there to expel to extract so that's the first component of it too and then having an honest conversation with your grower with the cultivator whoever is involved and just asking them questions you know do you have any experience excuse me with doing the solvent lessly either with your own business if they're legally allowed to process or do they have they talked to anyone else who's familiar with the strain that process it solvent what it's really a combination of you know using your spidey sense to say is this plant got enough resin to work with and does the person who's producing it have details about whether or not it's been processed solemnly before or do they think that it will process well solvent lessly and then I'm sure you've got a lot of questions about yield so should I just go directly into that or do you have one specifically that I should answer yeah one one question maybe just a frame the conversation about yield here is how can folks know that the yield is deriving from this extraction process is the greatest potential yield meaning how can they know they're not missing or missing out on the program the catch ability we're talking about yep another or another really important question and it's it's really hard to drill down and say that strain X I will get and reclaim 98 percent of the available trichome mass because of the budge structure versus strain Z which I can only expect to get 95 percent total reclamation or something like that but what it really comes down to is taking an experimentation process so if you're washing bubble hash you will wash two or three times until all you're getting anymore is basically just plant material and debris and then you said okay my trichomes are spent or if you're pressing hash or flower essence if Robin you know pressing those first couple bags multiple times to understand like where does where is the road end with this material one can I not get any more out of it and then backing into your math about what are your yields what was your cost to produce it or acquire it and then you know getting into your spreadsheet and trying to figure out did this strain make money for me or before committing to processing a whole bunch of it you know moving on to a different one we have a little story we're talking with a client of ours and they washed at Angie strain that they grew put it all out there boss program to produce that strain was about 135 dollars that was just their production cost and they said whoa you know I can't you know I'm not going to make any money on this so they only did a small test batch figured out the yield wasn't too good and now they just sell that strain either through hydrocarbon processing or is just whole flour it's very successful whereas for some of their other hash strains I think it might have been Tropicana cookies Alain but I was talking about you know their cost per gram to produce that was closer to eight to ten dollars or a little bit more of hash rousing because it made so much hash it had such a good yield that their production cost went way way down and that's one of the winners that they wash and produce and sell constantly so you know you have to take a little bit of a holistic approach but really trying to get as much out of whatever you're doing if possible and then working into the numbers to see if it makes sense yeah we have a couple questions here about just the different factors that go into these products and obviously we've talked a lot about source product and that the genetics that are going into solvent list products but what other factors can kind of folks influence whether that's temperature or pressure what other factors might go into this process and what are some quick tips to really improve those yeah so all along the solvent list processing chain you're going to have all kinds of variables assuming you know if you're either growing the material yourself starting there you know how is the material being grown is it indoor/outdoor there's almost too many variables to mention on the cultivation side of things so I'm going to focus my answer on attraction side which is where I know significantly more about and that's having high variable control is extremely important to be able to come out with a consistent product so that's something that we at peer-pressure really really focus on is having the most precise and replicatable you know variable control with the equipment that we make and sell so that being able to create a consistent product by controlling your time your temperature your pressure how hot or cold the room that you're working in is there's all these different data points that someone is going to want to understand so that they can compare one strain against another in the most scientific way possible in order to better understand you know is this a product that consumers want it's a product that we're producing consistently and is the end result something that we feel that we can replicate consistently so with the extraction process it really comes down to time pressure temperature for rosin and then with ice water hash its water temperature environmental temperature sift a little bit less variable control a little bit more post-processing cleanup so because we don't have a ton of time left here I would again encourage anyone who's interested in getting tips and tricks on pressing rods in on making ice water hatch I'm making sift anything in between our YouTube channel go peer pressure our blog which is on our website go peer pressure com we've got in-depth articles on all of these topics so I would highly encourage everyone to go check those out and do some reading some watching excellent yeah a few folks were asking about additional resources that's great um there could you speak to the impact of freezing the material before say a bubble hash process and whether that might yield better results yeah absolutely and this is a webinar that I gave trying to reach a very broad audience in the future I will give a webinar that's more intermediate and advanced solvent lists we didn't really touch on fresh frozen very much in this now fresh frozen is when you take cannabis and you D fan it take all families off and then you immediately freeze it now doing a fresh frozen product is what can create what's called a live product so you I'm sure you've heard of waif resin made with hydrocarbon or live rosin which is the ice water hash process that's then taking a material that's never been dried or cured so when you don't dry or cure your flour you d pan it and freeze it that tends to give a flavor profile and a terpene profile as well as changes in the cannabinoids because it hasn't been dried or cured that many consumers prefer over a dried and cured starting material for the concentrate now there's a lot of debate about this but for a business owner having fresh frozen material as your starter for bubble hash specifically is one of the smartest moves you can make because not only are you creating a product that the majority of dabble concentrate consumers are looking for anyway but also you don't need the infrastructure or the time to go ahead and dry and carefully cure your material which as many growers and people who have grown who tuned in understand is one of if not the most difficult parts of the entire cultivation process drying and curing your flower perfectly is and more than it is a science and that that can be very difficult to do so by having freezers and freezing your material to make a fresh frozen you are skipping that headache entirely you of course need freezers to store your material in but that the cold temperatures also actually increase trichome detach ability because they are more brittle so for multiple reasons both from a consumer standpoint a business ROI standpoint an equipment standpoint a space standpoint doing fresh frozen makes sense for most businesses excellent we have a question here if without access to specific screens at the moment could you talk about the idea of practicing or optimizing the process using lower quality strains that may have less optimal trichome structure and whether that will whether that practice will will really help the grower or whether that I'd be leading them down maybe an unhelpful ya know that that's a really good question um typically when someone or a business or a group of people are trying to get familiar with the solvent list process using material that they don't necessarily expect to process and then ride all the way home to the bank is a great way to really get your chops under you because you've got a lot more margin for error and you could really get the techniques down a lot better if the stakes aren't quite so high so I would say that you know lower quality starting material mid mid grade and below is actually a very important tool in the solvent was processors arsenal because it can a teach the team teacher extractors how to do all of this very well before your top shelf top cola buds are on the line to be processed perfectly and also a lot of the mid grade and below material is the perfect material to use for food grade oil there's definitely businesses out there that use their top shelf for their food grade as well but if you're not super confident that the material that you've got or that you're working with is going to make a light golden kind of blonde hash robin it's great idea to just turn it into a food grade oil and then put that in a topical or edible excellent we've got a few a few cost questions here and I realize we're bumping up against the hour but any we can end with this one in general terms can you describe the difference in say overhead costs associated with starting with dried or cured product versus fresh frozen product all the equipment that might go into that and how it grow or how a how a manufacturer might keep keep those costs in mind yeah absolutely so it's just tough one to answer because every business has many businesses very different objectives about what their weekly throughput should be what kinds of SKUs and products they're trying to make out the other end um what you're going to find is that with fresh frozen you don't need as much space to do the drying and tearing and you don't need quite as much environmental control in that specific area of your lab because you're filling freezers full but what that does mean is that you have to understand you know what is the electricity requirements for you know drying and curing your material versus running a bunch of freezers you know every business is different and electricity prices are different all over the country some places are off the grid and they're full solar and it's not really much of an issue for them but most businesses don't fall into that category so overhead wise it's hard for me and I'm hesitant to say that well if you do fresh fruit when it's going to be a lot cheaper for you I promise I know that I cannot make that promise because it depends on your area but the vast majority of our customers and we work with labs all across the world many of the biggest solvus processors across North America who make literally be best concentrates in the entire world mmm the vast majority of them are doing fresh frozen and turning that into bubble hash and then making a variety of products as you know maybe their flagship solvent let's concentrate so I apologize for whoever was asking that if that was an exactly to your answer you're looking for but please contact us we would love to help you better understand what this equipment would look like in your operation we take a very hands-on each customer is different approach we'd be happy to run you through an equipment list and show you what things look like that's no cost no obligation we'd be happy to talk you through your needs excellent well yes I would echo that and recommend everyone jot down the contact information here and I'll also remind everyone that a link to this presentation will be hitting your email inboxes very soon here and Eric and everyone at pure pressure I will not thank you for the presentation today this has been really fantastic and really insightful okay hey thank you for having us I really appreciate it and great job moderating thank you so much and once again everyone for attending thank you and have a fantastic day", "a6BMDjoAf_0": "[Music] Peggy's going on YouTube it's your boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "hTejyte13BE": "yoyoyo was popping was cropping we out here we chillin chillin with the mad Russia out here at the spot thought to

his nose to it and he call it out yeah I mean we go to campus clubs they be asking him hey man what strain is is this how my boy got it I'm like wait there I'm halfway there but I'm not gonna be quite as a persistent can precise this word I was looking for as Kelly today she got the nose man he could smell any stray and he knows what it is and he could smell that mildew on it so be careful for all your faulty growers out there oh yeah man we all here we chilling that Presley noobs with t-men see what we squishing right there Jimmy that's his fire rope shout out to mr. rosin you need I appreciate your [ __ ] time to making this little machine right here nice [ __ ] portable functional and portable and like my voice that practical and convenient you already know yep but yeah man we got here we chillin tap back in a little later we out deuces", "gF5c9Rbv-7g": "hey how you doing can of plates here it's just a quick video to show people how easy it is to get rosin off of the paper so basically you just do this when you're collecting it done scatter plates", "eb47Nhm2K2o": "good day YouTube giving you guys another update here I'm a big old urban poison she's getting human and then my super Lemon Haze all nice and dense Rochard I made a mistake on my last one when I said they were in week seven actually week nine I was looking at the wrong thing I'm like I wonder so these are in week 9 now the last ones I had went to just under well week to the end of week 12 they went so I'm gonna give a couple more weeks anyways more rush not going anywhere but that's that those babies in May so rock art - oh yeah baby smells beautiful anyways this is why we're here today again guess what I am good oh here's my yeah my veg tent I gotta take it all down he's done for now anyways let's see I don't know if we're even gonna be able to sell our house right now with all this going on real estate nobody wants to show hoses nobody wants to look at houses yeah it's not a good time so I don't I might just might take this down and then I'm gonna start a couple of plants and then when the people come through [ __ ] tough luck it's legal so whatever I won't have a grow room going but I'm gonna have some plants going I'm not so anyways I have got 18 grams of Crown Royal in here somebody said put in a magnetic magnet on here I'll guess what I'd have to put my paper so it goes all the way up to here this is aluminum this is aluminum non-magnetic anyways that's why I don't use a magnet if you're wondering why no biggie I know I'd like to be able to do this sometimes I'd top papers a pain in the ass anyways she's been warming up here so just waiting to see if I see some stuff poking its head out I got um what was it three three point eight grams off that swish yesterday which is pretty good for out of almost four grams out of 18 I'm not quite sure on the percentage there but I'm sure what are you math heads out there can get it but that's what I got back in it we got 18 grams so that's pretty good I'm not bad at all I'm not bad at all so I'm just doing this you know what I'm figuring I'm not gonna smoke anymore you might as well just press it all into rosin and cook with it so here we go plus I got all this other stuff coming I got that tent I just showed you plus I got my other tent with for plants and flowers so yeah this is the Crown Royal who came Ovid last time I pressed it with not much going on right now and I can see it but yeah it's coming out on the back side not that great but we'll hit it you know so when I'm done this I gather will start my about a big old Turkey for today Easter I hope everybody has a great Easter no family coming but we're eating their dinner I'm gonna put a plate out on the doorstep for my father-in-law that one Gator yeah filthy animals nothing great I wasn't expecting it to anyways I said people I'm just killing time bored out of my tree we're in for yeah I might get to try out my generator tonight and on the column for one hell of a storm up here today there we go some runs going on here looks like a vampire I do not see blah blah blah yes not bad not bad not too shabby and just under six ton I'm gonna put out a video on it but no big deal let me say something about it I play Elder Scrolls online if anyone else is into it I'm on every morning you usually do the PvP thing but I could do dungeons and whatever else so anybody's into it let me know you can hook up but you got to be on the best alliance there is if you are which is Daggerfall government oh I see none of them yellow piss heads are redheads they're the old ebonheart pact I don't care it's only a game some people take it pretty seriously though so I named it there we go people toil sleeping pretty good bad at all I'll take it throw everything I've been looking on what I'm gonna do next I don't know rice krispie squares seems pretty simple you try it out yeah let me check out some more recipes so let's pull this up and see what we got going on here looking good looking good yeah shabby perfect yeah we don't go royal not that alright people can get this back in another one back in the press and get her your

see the Robin we'll see the coloration not the best right now ooh guys you know see right there guys where it's mainly light yeah that's probably the real coloration of it let's see right there where it's all dark that's a lot of rosin right there guys so that's why it's not looking so nice and see these little bags as you can see they busts open I didn't buy no bubble bag dude bags or show bags but be on the lookout I will be buying some show bags and some bubble bag man [ __ ] bags and we're gonna be pressing some cold water again guys give you my review alright so these are just some basic bags I grabbed off of tell you true thing grab them from Michael's I mean probably a little jewelry bags or whatever but this dude you did what it did you know held in the material you mean got my rosin check it out guys you guys see it that's right there that's a big old piece of cold water that bust out though guys so you mean I don't mind it you me but if you're on like a larger scale

smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] hey what's up tgc it's Scottie real hanging out with love for the plant what's up brother hey how's it going it's going really good man it's going really good and we were hanging out love for the plants friends with frosty McNuggets they came up a couple of weeks ago they gave us a little schooling on some solvent lists actually that was just last week wasn't it was last week lizard compliance man time flies when you're having fun man but frosty talked about a solvent hash last time or solvent extracts I should say man I'm dating myself man and I wouldn't love for the plant to talk about solvent lesser or basically what a solvent less water hashes out we're talking yes yes water hash bubble hash is just a form of solvent list okay so and that's what I would you know I'll be focusing on today we could talk for an hour on each kind of solvent list show me that high end you brought a couple high end yeah hashes right you brought like what's it called the six star water hash that I like to make fun of right yep otherwise known as full melt yeah and gooey you can put up a picture of this for us man yeah check it out it's uh it's totally it's like a white powder it's strange Oh I mean and it really it breaks down to being just try cap heads that's what it is just try cokeheads okay so I know that when you're doing your wood dry sift and everything like that you're trying to sift the broken heads from the whole ones and all that right same concept when you're doing water extraction pretty much for the most part yeah except you will come out with if done properly you will come out with a cleaner product been dry shift okay so we were talking before and I remember I went god I think they had like a six bag system bubble bags yeah I don't know if they still make a just bubble bag still a brand man oh yeah yeah they're uh onion brands in fact he has a couple of different tiers of them now excellent yeah they used to have like a three bag system which for somebody like me I was just glad to make something I could smoke out of my [ __ ] leaves trim yeah like right now they have four bag by bag eight bag you know depending on one's needs right will dictate which one you want do you buy them off with calm men no kind of break that down yeah when we're talking about like a 5 or 8 bag system it's having different micron screens so you can have the different grades of trichome heads or treasure talks or just separating your plant material it lets you have different grades of hash and then condoms it's now in it from there do you need six different grades of hash is that how it works so I'll give an example you know just to follow up on what guru said like these bags right here I have a five bag set right not optimal because I go from 120 micron to 73 micron okay there's no ninety in between so qualities are for some cultivars 90 maybe that sweet spot oh wow does a the type of the cultivar the type of cannabis that you're straining makes a difference on the size of the trichome absolutely Oh that'd probably determine yeah in fact even in fact different cultivars even have different shapes of trichome heads Wow and that makes sense why some guys are telling us they're getting crazy big yields off of off of these strains oh yeah the cultivars oh yes there's a huge difference in yield from one cultivar to the next we we've seen yields of over over twenty percent right for like a three ninety eight bubble or there are some others that yield really well and actually so I'll name a few like really girly for obviously that's one that would doesn't surprise them any people that are really well yeah but I'm sour Kush banana Kush those are some little some less known ones that that yield really well really yeah I actually have some Atticus yeah yeah there you go I mean I would put an emphasis on if you're going to watch something lost one that you know I tell you it will produce well in fact we brought we try to bring in like some old or not a little bit like some trendy strains right whenever I was working it at that facility well I'll get into a little bit later when we brought in those Jayne's we were only getting a yield of like three to five percent when we're used to getting like 18 to 22 percent and we did everything the same so that's how much it matters and that's why you often hear some people talk about well I tried bubble has in this case you're sure they may actually be good at making bubble hash and just had the your own cultivar the whole time you know he's they'd be good at making bubble hash it definitely is an art I used to make it I was doing it said I was just psyched to get something smokeable my friend or my hell without one of my growing partners was an artist like a true you know to paint and draw and everything like that we would leave him alone for the night with a six-pack of Budweiser and and a wooden spoon and that's all he would use man but he would grieve would just make the best [ __ ] hash I mean it was like dabble hash in the 90s you know what I'm saying is amazing The Devil's in the details is what you're telling me right yeah absolutely all right so you're gonna hook us up with little details moons are absolutely so all right cool yeah I mean first off just what interrupts I'm sorry if I'm going on Amazon or I'm going online with the [ __ ] do I buy what do I need well so you'll see a wide range in price on the bags right and I that was a mystery that you know I'd always wondered what the real differences between the different qualities of bags different levels of bags right I actually asked one of the more reputable actually the person I respect the most he was probably going through 100 different bags and I was like so tell me break this down for me what what do you what do you not get with the cheaper bags like from you know like a cheap Amazon this is like a bubble man bag yep and he said the screens are pretty comparable actually maybe a slight difference right but what you but what you're going to get with your cheaper bags are little pieces of thread that come off and it gets into your hash and it was funny because that's a big deal yeah so I made something home actually this is one of those cheaper set right and you know I you couldn't see the threads until you put it up in a microscope and you know you're looking at trichome heads if you make really nice bubbly eyes your eyes you're looking at it very closely and we started noticing little bitty tiny like red threads and [ __ ] and when you go for what Bo what who's the bubble man bags right yeah yeah bubble man is okay I'm is what you know that's like you know calling his bags out because that's one of the people I learned from that's what I was gonna say shout-out to that guy because he put so much education out there yup yup that's exactly I'll be back in the old school I mean it's yeah I was watching his videos and Prohibition land just couldn't wait I remember I was in Canada and I saw bubble banks for the first time and I was on vacation with my wife and my girlfriend back then I think I had 200 bucks left on vacation there were $285 I was like empty your wallet I need trust me this'll work but I was so excited to bring those things back for me it was like letting the gold cuz I couldn't figure out what to do with all my trim and 20 lights a trim that's a garbage bag of trim right yeah these were amazing alright so we got the brands now as far as four or five eight you know what do we buy if I'm just its that matter how much of a kind of sir I'm trying to be yeah absolutely okay if you're you know if you're just making bubble hash for Bowl toppers or yep or if you're just going to press it you know if even if you want to press it out into a rosin which we'll get into a little bit later right yeah I mean you can get by with a lot of things it's just a matter of you know as I go through the different things it's just a matter of maybe a 5% difference you know you can still get top-shelf bubble hash by not doing some of these things or you know maybe not having a the best bag system but you're just talking about incremental gains with some of the things we'll be talking about so deal deal all right so it well first off I'm intrigued man big plants big trikes yeah I mean definitely it's the you know when I worked for the oh well just go ahead and say so you know I I have a lot of experience just making bubble hash at home watching all you know watched all the videos read all the forums a lot of trial and error right but shortly thereafter I started working at one of well at the time was the most reputable saw solvent list company and the state of Colorado so yeah you know I kind of took my personal experience in that professional experience right and came up with just a list of tips and tricks you know that I just learned over time and a lot of these tips and tricks you would you won't find in summation all of them and in like a single video how-to video yeah that would be hard-pressed to find you know everything all at once these are these are tips and tricks that I've picked up over time sure they're probably I know there are others that I won't even talk about um but I kind of view these tips and tricks' is like the magic that happens between the main steps okay I'm making about will hash like if you got watch a video on how to make bubble hash right they'll give you those basic steps and you better know those basic steps very well right but there's some magic that happens in between there yeah I mean and there's ways you can screw it up - yeah I beat the hell out of the out of the material before man so yeah so I will get into it man yeah let's get into some of the specifics if we could yeah so take me through the process we got our Bowl bag showed up from bubble man from here you PS man got them what else do I need well first of all you want to work in a cooler environment I prefer like 50 degrees obviously you wouldn't want to work in the freezer we can wrap things are going to start freezing up sure but yeah in in Colorado we're we have very cool weather most of the time so I'm probably just working outside that that's very convenient okay so cool degrees so fun if I'm in Florida or from something you know my buddies in Florida or something like that can you work inside a refrigerator or something do you have yeah think about that no I do not man but that sounds like a decent night yeah okay sounds like something wacky that I would tell my I need to do yeah I need you to work inside the refrigerator okay man yeah trust me it's gonna be dank yeah all right so so we can work outside 50 degree temperatures something like that what do we do with the material now and and what do we mean anything I know you got a couple tricks up your sleeve well the first thing is you know optimally you want to use reverse osmosis water but we all know they draw back first of all RRL water is costly and but and it's also taxing on the environment so you can make a judgment call and whether you want to do that or not but just know that that's what the the top shelf past that you're seeing out on the market right now they're using RL water is that different than distilled water as far as a guru it should be clean right you're just trying to get clean water right in water yeah without minerals in it right with the no minerals in it distills not gonna have that or not gonna have much of that at all okay cool but clean water yeah all right next step what do we do man so you'll just well you harvest your plant yep so we I'm dry it what the [ __ ] is a freeze dryer man why does guru want a freeze dryer do we need one so as we go through this the bubble hash making right the very end the final step well I guess the final step of the bubble hash right would be to put it in there freeze okay sound and you know everyone's talking about that right now because it's a huge investment yeah but okay so we don't need so all we do is we dry our plant normally do we need to cure the plant so so there yes you can do cured flower most of the top shelf bubble hash or rosin that's being made out on the market right now is actually being done with fresh frozen material and that's where most of my experiences fresh frozen so we're trying the work we're not drying the trap so chop the plant you know you can let it set sit for up to two hours people have different opinions on that I like letting some of the moisture out of it right Wow tourette yeah and then put it in the freezer right let it freeze for at least 24 hours yeah and then that's when you can start the extraction process with making bubble hash and now we're not we're not breaking it up or anything we're not using a grinder you don't want to grind it too much but you also don't want too big of colas in there so we are using a grinder no it's just more of a it's just more of a manual manual cut smaller budge honest yeah okay fair enough man all right so come on give me some tips man so how long we soak in this for okay so let's get to get yeah I want the DVC to be at least Bank right off the bat yeah you know yeah so one of the little tips that you know I see out there some whenever I'm just searching around but not everyone and some people have heard it but then they forget it right is too when you put your frozen material into the washer we'll get into washers too but you put your material into the washer you let it soak for 15 minutes okay and that's going to allow your plant material to softened a little bit so it won't become brittle right now you're saying washer hang on a second yeah you're talking about the little bubble later machines man those things are cool I thought I was just being lazy yeah but they came out with them I don't think they're under they used to be under 200 bucks anyhow they're not expensive I thought they were a Chinese washing machines is what I thought they were like for a little tiny apartment to watch like one piece of clothing at a time I don't know anyway their coolest [ __ ] man those things ooh so that's what I call that a bubble later what do they call those things yeah I know there are different names sure but yeah I mean so many people at home will just manually sure maybe with a wooden spoon that works really great especially if you have the really smooth you know really smooth motion and do everything right all right but most of my experience has been using the washer sure and we've done a B test at the at the process at the company that worked out right and it the washer just yields is so much better and it's really the labor - okay I mean it's like start stirring it it's fun at first it's like trimming at first it's hot and then it gets old pretty cool yeah a lot and you could run two or three of those washers man I've went through those washes yeah they were great I mean all the top shelf bubble hash that's coming out they don't have workers in there stirring this no no I'm sure it exists but washers I agree with you man okay so I was just so we got a 15-minute soak yep thirty minutes oh and then we're throwing in in the machine we're turning on the recess for how long how long we running them actually so before we turn on the machine I want to point out that during that so before or after that so good I've seen it done both ways you can actually and what I'm about to say is fairly controversial among solvent less people okay because the moment you say dry ice people want to run because they think in the particulate in the end product right about using it to keep the water cold absolutely right so you you have your you have your 220 micron bag with your fresh frozen material in there right your ice water what you can do is just kind of pepper pepper some small pieces of dry ice and around the outside of the bag okay so we've got an ice water I forgot to explain that we though you've got to fill this bubble later machine yeah I've got to fill it with water with a bunch of ice you know whole trick to do it cold absolutely yep and then you just drop some dry ice in there and you know that what the dry ice does is it'll just take the temperature you know we had one of those infrared and thermometers take the temperature from like maybe 33 34 to to like 31 and since it's always moving it's not freezing so sure you can get it down 30 31 and that matters just getting it down a few more degrees helps in quality absolutely yeah really yeah and since you soak the material you're not going to get much particulate come through and what and what little comes through your catch dude you are [ __ ] detailed now looking at some of your some of your tips here yeah and he says frozen utensils so you're keeping the spoon that you're starting your ass so most people I don't have a sorry about that what you got hook it up you know most people's going to use a spoon similar to this right the easiest tip in the world is just to keep keep it frozen man like you're touching those you're trying to keep everything as cold as possible so you just keep this in the freezer so I'm curious you're and you're like independent research I know you guys have been playing with solvus do you keep your utensils frozen I mean it would makes having thoughts to do that okay see if it definitely makes sense to do that just because you're you're trying to you spent so much time keeping everything riding around 30 degrees then why would you want to touch it with something that's like 50 days in the process yeah so hey so okay so one of your other tips I mean these are kind of sir tips here man they got you really get the ball you know you get like a 2% game from them yeah and you're saying game from that before you know you have like a 10% better product you know I remember my buddy was in the racecars and he was talking about that he was like oh yeah like after 1/2 percent performance increase from that I'm like what a [ __ ] you spend $2,000 on a half percent or whatever but in this case man for if it cost you nothing to freeze the spooning you get a little bit little nudge here in the edge there oh that's how you get that six star man absolutely yeah anyway so one of the other tricks that I never used to do we I used to just take the the sink sprayer spray some water on the sides because what happens when it when the bubbly the bubble air these things bubble up well they used to say if it doesn't bubble it ain't worth the trouble right so it bubbles up and you'll get all sorts of collection.you bubbles all over the side there man so I would spray him with little sink hose but that wasn't very cold water yes what a lot of people are doing now is you get like a pump sprayer like you said like that metal guru would you throw a picture of this metal Chapin sprayer up man it's cool as hell yeah these are always available I would say just use it you can use these things for spraying other things but just use this one for spraying plain water yeah and this is really for kind of spraying and doing like a secondary wash on your homepage you have there to try and like spray through any trichome stalks or anything that might be left over and kind of clean up the trichome heads that are left in there I just thought really cool keeping stuff from sticking to the sides man yeah I know yep and another little tip is don't just use water use ice water all right lady go not throw some ice into that sprayer sure so okay so and now so what do you stack those bags on top of each other yeah yeah you know the the highest micron bag in my case is 220 would be on top right and then you just go down to these smaller bags now the 220 show that one because that's the different bag the 220 is the one that holds all of all the material there's a 220 so actually I'm glad you brought that up so the bag that goes inside the washer two-twenty bag right so that bag is just like you zip it up you know that's Rosa material in it's just a really simple bag that's just nothing but a big screen it's almost like the size of a screen 220 microns is big if the idea is to let it just to let everything wash through there without letting a bunch of plant material go through yep so then you do a second 220 after that again just to make sure that nothing leaked out you know that 220 mine has like a crappy zipper on it so yeah okay so you'll be in the later steps to to go ahead and get some of any any plant matter out yes what we're trying to do there okay so that's our that's our first one now what do we got after that so you know once once you go all the way down you know get you so each bag will have its own collection sure right and you know that's where that sprayer comes into play and then you scoop it out is that yeah yeah yeah how do you prepare that I mean I've done the horrible thing I've actually been like how [ __ ] I want to smoke I squeezed it yeah what do you do and then I've just let it dry before and it comes to kind of comes out is that really kind of strange how do you prepare it you'll scoop it out I mean it's I don't really know what to compare the consistence mud yeah it's a really since we have freeze dryers now you you don't have to get as much moisture out of it as you used to okay back in the day people would put screens on it and like press it with the paper yeah but you're smashing your tractor that's what I always felt like I was doing something wrong but I'm alright yeah so but now you know we can just scoop it out and almost just a very liquid form and just spread it out and then the freeze dryer will we'll pull all the moisture out all right have we gotten to the freeze-dried stage at this point man now is a good time you're talking about right why does guru when a freeze dryer so bad man it's all about turf preservation man yeah every year spending so much time and energy keeping everything cold through this whole process right that why would you want to ruin it ruin it and drying it and not lock in all those terpenes that you've spent so much time to save and collect and the freeze dryer lets you do that because it's just gonna pull out all the water or a frozen temperature so that you I mean so a freeze dryer is basically I dehumidifier inside of a freezer pretty much yeah it's a really simple way of putting it there I mean like the starting just a small at-home one is like three thousand that's what I was gonna say a three thousand dollar these middle fire inside of a freezer mm-hmm that's a hell of an investigator no because goober and frosty are going to create a do-it-yourself I heard something about this man I heard something about this geeking out here I heard the last time they defrost he was here just tell guru not to buy a freeze dryer yeah I talked to him I loved it man alright so as far as the preparations go when we're done what can what can we make out you absolutely yeah so once it comes out of the freeze dryer right so what just get a friend with a freeze dryer find a rich friend and tell him how easy it is to do this [ __ ] yes and let me know when you find there that's why I don't make much myself hey sure freeze-dried lots of other stuff too you don't have to just freeze dry half that's what I've been telling myself lately please try anything in half like food that's good for 20 years just add water so without a freeze dryer we can make basically a basic bubble hash right right so without a freeze dryer you're you are letting it air dry but even with the air dry you're going to have moisture kind of stuck in between those trichome heads that are all in you know I've got a chest yeah so so you know because that moisture is there it almost creates a consistency that you really can't break up those trichomes very well so you know the most common method is the micro planing anyone who's done bubble hashes you're probably done this or at least seen it done on videos yeah just spreading a really clear out so yeah driver you so that freeze dryer not only does it preserve Terps it saves a hell of a lot on labor because there is no micro planing with that I mean you said if you pull it out of the freeze dryer and it just pretty much breaks apart it's right incredible okay so we're getting to the freeze-dried I heard they have easy payment plans gurus have a Facebook targeted you as well yeah you get that in a rosin press from okay oh yeah okay so there's nothing I don't have a freeze dryer can I just take the my bubble hash and press it yeah absolutely so I'm trying to think yes people aren't gonna have access to a freeze dryer I can get I can't wait to get into what we can make if we get our buddy to spend twenty five miles but let's uh so what can we do for five hundred dollar rosin press what can we do with that okay so you can take that bubble hash right and put it in like a thirty six micron screen you can you can do you can do like a 72 micron screen as well cool the place that I work they actually use like a metal it was like a big sheet just huge industrial sheet they just cut pieces off of it okay I really like that metal versus the nylon so yeah you put it in just a really low micron screen right and press it at you know 151 155 and so this is it in terms of like the temperatures with a lot of people press Ross a net this is a pretty cold or low temp press yeah yeah one that's even at 155 just to put it in in perspective sure like I press flower at 185 to 210 you know depending on like quality okay so real so it is that cuz it's the water in it is that what you're doing it for I think it's just because it works better if you don't even mortar P and preservation right okay it's just not pressing at a high temperature just to avoid volatilizing off any of those terpenes that fall into like that temperature range makes sense to me man makes sense to me all right now guess what I got good news brother so I just found somebody with a freeze dryer man oh yeah I roll a brother man yeah oh yeah now what can we make man okay so you know from that point that's where some of the latest product that's on the market with the end product I mean it almost looks like butane extracted live resonator P early in a lot of its will even call it live rosin do we have anything this show see I'm sure I'm sure we can figure something out was all nice okay so there are some techniques in Vault so once you create your rosin you know you press you press that bubble hash out you have this rosin there are some post extraction techniques that even I don't know because I've been out of the game for over a year sure so there have been some new shogi right it's moving fast man yeah so yeah I can't keep up sure and there are some things I don't know yeah I've seen just bits and pieces I know some people are taking the rosin putting it on like 90 degrees I've seen different things but I can't definitively say this is what you do to create I've even seen stuff where people have gotten acid recrystallization solvent Leslie absolutely with rosin that has enough terpenes in it today I was the acid in that reaction where you really get like like diamonds and sauce right but solvent list diamonds and sauce somebody has been reading cannabis anca me I'm telling you man they were there there was like a formula for this in the 70s man there was AD gold made this book cannabis alchemy that was just the most they talked about what the heck was that man recrystallization I remember he had verses acetates he would make man and I was like I remember that [ __ ] that once I bought the gallon of ether I was out man yeah if anyone out if anyone in the DDC knows more about this ok let's talk about it let's start a discussion because it's immunity I think that's one of the benefits of having the DVC you know we can we can share some really good knowledge you know there there are those of us who worked in the industry at times and there are also people who just geeked out at home and focus nothing on nothing but cannabis and the man's an artist yeah yeah we need to pull that knowledge together so some of this post extraction process right if anyone knows a lot about it I know a couple people you know I know a couple of DGC members that do a lot of solvent list extraction and I bet they know quite a bit so let's start it hell yeah but it teach me something man first off is this real are you kidding me man I know what sauce is I know that that exists man sausage I get a little terpene yeah so so what just like with live resin each dispensary is creating a you know trying to create their own brain sir and they're calling a different things you know I see it called Jam sauce like solvent less sauce right you know you have to be like 17 labs here in Denver they're calling there's like a rosin Jam right isn't that what they're calling it yeah I would go to that oh yeah I mean dude so the stuff coming out of 17 labs it's just ridiculous and part of that Falls just to where their garden I mean it's a fear of quality and quality I can get some of these like six-star water hashes in full melt has less you have your garden dialed in to begin with yeah makes it makes so it again I just want to get back to this if I pull my [ __ ] out of the freeze dryer well how can I make what do I mean I can make any of these things I can make sauce I can make jam or you can take that you can take just what comes out of the the freeze dried right you know that we call that you know six star hash is what we've talked about a lot sure it's also just called full melt okay you can you can just drop that full melt right on your dab you know right on your nail and dab it that way and there shouldn't be any right I'm about to do that you know what some of that white stuff yeah me too okay so if I don't want to walk around white powder then man what can I do with it man that gets into the post extraction processing that some of those techniques okay and of course you know I'm talking about after you press it out sure yeah there are many things you can do from there to create different consistencies interesting man interesting all right man I learned something you know I get high yeah you're not a smoke man Stewart let's check out some of these goods survey this is really good appreciate the hell out of it yeah look where you're headed thanks brother yeah look for the plant check them out yeah [Music] [Music] it says to do [Music] true medicine [Music] Oh [Music] today [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "b4SgvzWTHmA": "yo sup guys we out here chillin pressing some cold water hash it's not the prettiest color but it's cool gets the job done it's all too from old harvest you mean I mean like really old but he's good all the rest your boy look at this black tar heroin now this plane it's just call our hatch like I said it's old but yeah and I'll press up another little note just to see what it does but yep this is gonna get me by the week nice little indica temperatures at 218 it's just old cold water but it's good pull out your boy drop the comment let me know what you guys pressing what you guys are dabbing on what you guys extracting and the method and if you guys took a bomb grip today I'm gonna probably come back out here and take a bone root for you guys it's good hit me holla at your boy temperature is at 220 and just let it rock out it's all good it's just cold water hash just lying around oh you guys popping off over there - guys so who are you still doing this thing temperatures at 222 and just let it rock out guys it's his house cold water just trying to milk it for what it is let it go a little bit longer probably about 2:30 it's all good - personal [Music] alright guys see what we got check it out cold water hash in a little little baggie I came across yeah looks like we do this thing it's not a sticky so yeah yeah perfect timing guys and I'll save this residue or plat matter so when I make some can of butter or coconut oil it's all good all right guys I'm gonna press this up this little note - for you guys alright guys I'll check in with you guys a little bit alright we out peace", "L7_pVd30WB4": "how's it going YouTube and welcome to the [ __ ] highlight doing a strain with you today keeping it simple and keeping it [ __ ] show let's go straight into it we are doing the review of company era product from a company called cold as ice extracts and survey me I don't [ __ ] know [Music] but either way it's some live rosin rosin pressed from live material as it were and it's [ __ ] amazing I've been smoking on it for a while and just decided that I need to share it with you guys because this might be the last day that I come across and the world needs to know so let's take a look at it and we'll talk a little bit about it toss this [ __ ] right on up here let's look at the packaging real quick [Music] standard [Music] all right here we go this was the last one they had so I thought I needed to share with y'all take a look at this [Music] stable not sticky beautifully clear let's see what it smells like kind of fruity kind of like a CH I don't know it's just kind of fruity it's really really nice pretty [ __ ] subtle so let's see what Leafly has to [ __ ] say about this [ __ ] shall we it's a collaboration from TGA genetics and aficionados seeds suzay was created crossing space Queen and a clone only Pinot Noir this hybrid plant will hit you fast with a relaxing body high while you taste sweet cherries that's probably what I'm smelling a little bit and chocolate rich flavor paired with copious amounts of resin makes sube a great strain for making cannabis concentrates and I will [ __ ] agree with that this [ __ ] amazing so let's get down to smoking this [ __ ] yeah no unfortunately I'm being a broke bastard and I'm back to using my propane tank so it'll take forever to heat up but let's get a good sized ab I wish you even working with this just heating it up a little bit in your hands oh it just smells so good all right that is a nice healthy chunk [Music] took off a good corner of it [Music] look at this filled guys I literally clean my [ __ ] a week ago I cleaned it probably five days ago actually less than a week ago and this is how far I've devolved sparking my propane torch with my butane torch I feel like I'm back in the [ __ ] Stone Age with this thing it literally just takes ages and ages to [ __ ] heat up I don't know what the difference is molecular ly between is that a word either way between propane gas and butane but it definitely seems like butane burns a whole heck of a lot hotter but I have not [ __ ] put any research into that so don't [ __ ] quote me now I was going through the comments a little while ago and I had ran into somebody who says something about me being the Bob Ross of YouTube or weed too should have me [ __ ] dying for one [ __ ] love me some Bob Ross do you love Bob Ross so to be compared to him in the owe me I got some pretty [ __ ] monotone definitely costs a whole lot more than he did but straight [ __ ] G I would love to do some dabs to the [ __ ] Bob Ross no I'm saying smoke some happy little trees maybe paint a couple happy little trees [Music] paint some happy little trees while we're smoking some little trees who knows possibilities could be endless plus some of them later episodes you those bringing in all kinds of weird [ __ ] animals and [ __ ] I'm saying when I was a little I [ __ ] hated having to wash my costumes and I [ __ ] would put me to sleep now I watch it on purpose either way one last look at this and shoes you know let's get [ __ ] rip [Music] oh man nobody smoking on this stuff for a while so I don't even have to wait for the hi to come on I can just tell you about out automatically takes a little bit to come on what sounds a bit slower always takes a lot of cake but once it gets there totally worth it really really relaxing great for chilling I'm playing some video games taste very much how Leafly described it go ahead and say quite chocolate and cherries but I definitely see where they're coming from there's a richness to the flavor and a sweetness that kind of has some fruitiness so I definitely see the chocolate cherry puck in comparison there oh well only thing left really this stuff is 35:35 I have incredibly great price for rawson of this [ __ ] quality at least out here where I live and I think that's about it so thank you guys for stopping by stay I all", "U-xuwqswNX4": "Razi take videos where else to take

thanks for chillin I'm gonna wait a little bit more and I'm gonna get to the rosin tech and the easy just use it I'm going to show you guys what I'm using just a rebel on little cheap thing and some parchment paper any parchment paper works but this is what I'm using so like if you guys got a parchment paper and a hair straightener go grab it and some buds and you can make some rosin run along with me it's real easy but yeah I'm gonna heat this nail up my crack lighter but off everyone's have an awesome day I am and I'm just out here let me do this video I'm juiced because once you learn how to do this rosin at home uh smoking k yeah everybody in here man um if you everyone in here sub up to each other man stop hump each other man and uh hit that like if you want but make sure you flick that ding-dong this beam oopsie I was doing this and I was putting the heat right here on the neck oh yeah yeah I think that's hot enough for this it's a dick it's a dick yeah there you go suck and they'll sub back to you mad cat that's what's awesome you just picked up seven or six subs that way and it's cool people that's that's a weird you know make sure you flip that ding dong because um

started I think there's enough people in here and if not they could watch it again whoa I'm s plastic one melts it didn't get on my my banger though that's awesome some fire and this is the rig I'm giving away with the contest that's why I'm teaching you guys how to make rosin at home easy so if you wonders rig you'll be able to dev I'm giving a whole dab set up away and not next month but the month after I'm giving a flower set up boy oh yeah and we move this I'm gonna get I'm gonna get to it now okay okay everybody you see can you see it a table okay see I get all this everywhere this is a sugar trim what do I thank you for coming much love everybody much love you know man much love um yeah so we're gonna get down so this is what I picked up today there's some um yeah everybody flick that Deena flick it or just touch it like this you know and you know them sub but you know in their in their squirt likes everywhere just likes everywhere but yeah it's some sour bubble and I picked this up from harbor side because I wanted to I was gonna do the other bus but I want to show you what a good squirt will look like cause if you look at this stuff look man look at the crystals I don't know if you can see the crystals and stuff but it's a little dry but it's some loud some loud loud this what I wanted to squish so you guys could see a good squish and this is what the whole Graham looks like I got one gram it was $16 plus sex text so it came to about 20 dollars but yeah all five you guys yeah thank you now Cassie thank you thank you thank you both have to squish this and what I do you take the parchment okay dad tools and everything everywhere okay um you take the parchment and it has to be partially not wax paper now wipes paper has been parchment paper and this is my favorite if you guys could find this online and stuff I've been to I even had raw parchment paper and it was wasn't as good as this this is some bow impartial paper and it comes in sheets like this it comes in sheets like this that's it one out so I could show you and and you get a lot of them and um and you see I put my oil on it that's how good this parts of paper came with this white that's my reclaim on there but it came in this white bleach stuff but I like the parchment alright but what I did I took one of them sheets and I cut it into this side a whole bunch of them and this is one sheet and you see how many I got right look you only need one at a time and what you do I take old Greg Oh clean rag it's it's a little damp looking that's because I'll be wiping the tools on it for years but it's clean you got to make sure it's clean you don't want to know nothing following any rosin and all right let me turn this on the lowest setting that this goes to is 230 but my ideal pressing is you could go up to 300 I've seen people go up to 300 well my favorite is where I'm 200 but this is only goes to 230 and it works good it works watch you'll see so what you do take your rag see it's heated up now when I little things stop off ya know little things start blinking next to let's heat it up so then um want to blow up the crack later so what you do I'll just take like I'll just squish this whole thing right here right whoa you see how solid it is just some dank put hair I'll take this piece off and then and if you take the stem off the bottom that is soaks up oil so you don't want that stem on there so what you do just compact it like a little a little thing like that right and didn't put in the middle of the parchment and what will really help if you have hey let me clean this I'm sorry right quick I'm just cleaning the tool off right quick you just do that for a few seconds and then take your rag and that's it see a few seconds he gets it all the way clean come on let that cool down because we're going to use that you need light is really it works really good with the flat metal one or if you have a rod with the ball end and you can just take that rod and roll it like that the glass rod and roll it on the rosin it picks it right up but if not you can have one of these and it's easier to scrape you only go one direction like a circle direction when you scrape you don't want to go back and forth in this great because it just you'll just squirt you know it won't come up it was a smear it but if you go in one direction like this when you pick it up it all collects on one side like that then you can just wipe it on parchment but yeah other than that any dad tool anything you just go back and forth across it and if you use this kind of parchment it'll come off really good even real oily stuff but alright we'll take that nut put it in the middle right and fifteen-second squish but we're gonna squish it more than once the first squish you might not get that much but what I'll do you the end I usually step on it I'm just doing this so you guys can see it but I usually step on it with my foot but you just squish it far as you can 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 see now let me see oh I kind of missed the side of the bud but yeah it wasn't it wasn't angled right you see how even I still make mistakes and you see how it's all but what I was going to say what that does it heats up the bud and kind of loosens up the juice in it because you see what I'm doing on full in it and you want to fold it back into another ball but watch this squeeze I mean we got a little bit on there if you can see got a little bit of oil on there but it was the sideways and you see the stem poked a hole in it that's what you got to look out for - you don't want your oil to squirt out but I'm gonna get another piece of the parchment and you see a folder that same one now we should get a pretty good squeeze see look at that stem on the end so you take that out it soaks up the oil to in check it out so you put it in there again in the middle but this one we should get a good squeeze and then you take it and pretty right put it right on the butt I don't know if you guys could see it but it's like you got to put it right in the middle make sure you get it I did in last time and that's where I messed up but watch this there we got thing I got it two three sorry my shirts wrinkled I just got it out the drawer but it's clean now eight nine ten and eleven thirteen fourteen fifteen see him when you step on it to harder press you get more juice out so you got a little I'm gonna step on it and I'll show you guys because this I'm gonna show you the difference in squish but you could do about him like this you see that on there and you see all those little pieces of herb what I do before I even take off the parchment I take a dab tool like this with a point and you take all these little pieces of tree out and then when you do that it'll be clean and it's easier to do that after you do the second step but I'm gonna step on it and show you the difference all right it's a big difference I'm serious because you could put weight on it and get that good press but you see I just took two more than little buds squish them together okay blaziken check this out when you step on it check this out and only use one piece of parchment at this degrees that I figured out that it works good for a 15 seconds I did all of it all the way up to like 60 seconds squeeze and see which one and so I came out with or watch this one I'm gonna step on it and I'll show you the difference I'll put it in there two three see I'm just stepping on 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 look at this see that's what I'm talking about and this is the first squeeze now look at that squeeze when you step on it and look how clear everything is see that's what I was talking about I couldn't do that much of a with stepping on it makes a big difference just put it that way when you put your weight and then and then I take this and uh can you guys still see me what happened it froze up I don't know if you guys could still see me but it froze up because I can't see me but alright I'm gonna take that in Bali back up and take another piece and this is the piece I just squished right and got that fat juice out right I'm putting it back in the middle apartment I'm gonna step on it again I can't see you guys just froze up so let me know two three okay but I'm frozen I can't see it so I'm just gonna keep going I'm gonna dab some of it for you to show you guys I think that's around 7:15 or so I'm just let it go few more seconds you could go up to like 18 20 seconds but I like the terpene profile at that temperature have 15 seconds yeah kinda not that much but because I got that first we see got a cool return and what I'll do I'll take all this little plant material well can you take a flat it and only go one like I said one way don't go back and forth and what you do let me see if I could help you guys see that I got him I got a mirror here right go like this there's a little piece of plant you see that stuff on there and you go like this see how it all this comes out look and look at the color see that in this shatter but if you leave it out for like a week just an open air it will butter up and turn to butter and that's end to my opinion the terpenes for profile come out more it's more dinky tasting lets you see look off that one squish that little bud you got a dab of some pure medicine solvent list and it's so easy I'm trying to tell you is awesome but I'm gonna do these other and this is not even the whole gram guys like and these rods and chips you can still smoke them you only takin like 25 percent of the oil out I think and I still smoke them and it seems like it makes them stronger see I still got this much at the gram lift like 0.3 and I already got this much rods and not even scraped to other tube this squeeze wasn't that good I mean you can see there's a lot of plant material I don't know what happened it might be distrained it's like real oily or something I'm gonna smoke that though I'm gonna throw it on the bowl or medicate that with it ain't nothing goes to waste you know that for me by you know about me by now well yeah you see I took all the plant material or most of it and then um you do the same thing but remember it's on this side right so you want to go this way because it just keep building up look at that golden goodness and the strain was sour bubble from harbour sight if you want to go on their website I don't think he could live to see how much THC does not have that much plant material in it but it's still a lot of medicine see shatters shattering everywhere I gotta like chase the little shards around well yeah see not even uh not even a whole grand maybe 0.7 I got it enough and I'm gonna show you guys watch me do this and look I mean it's stable shatter watch it see that I got that off of 0.7 that's like two dabs if you um you know just uh don't have a high tolerance like me look and it comes off the parchment is stable like you could touch it it's shatter the world pulling snap now well yeah well I'll take this death for you guys and it's pure solvent less yummy goodness and thank you guys for watching man man right on man and see if you guys win this rig now you know how to make the oil all you got to do this have some parchment paper and a hair straightener and yeah and a hair straightener and that's it but I'm gonna take this Deb but thanks for watching I'm gonna sit back down over here my back's starting to hurt now yeah but all right I hope you could see me because I can't see you still froze up but I know you guys could see me so I'm just gonna keep

I'm giving away so this is how they hit dude and if you just do it like I'm doing with the carb cap I'm using this for a car cap but if you don't have one of these I know and you have access to concentrates you can use one of these like a glass a glass jar don't use any titanium on this because you're not supposed to do that only glass on glass and metal on metal but yeah check it out legendary dude that's how you do it I'll let you see the mote Cheers straight flavor City Talent and then after it's done if you could take some q-tips and clean your banger out a little bit that's sitting there CL a black stuff your banger or last year's and long as you heat it up like I did it too man I'll show you like when I'm heating it up right you don't just I mean you can in it but it won't last as long it will start cracking because it stresses its courts so I don't know I could be wrong but instead of just holding it on there like that right you want to like that heat it up real slow and then once you get it where it's starting to smoke a little bit you come at it easy and only heat the bottom and then right where you see this blue so you could go close to the flame right it won't burn you but soon as you go clothes you see how far got my hand okay put that way as soon as you go closer to flame this way it's all the heats there man but where you want to put it on the banger you see this point of blue or I don't know if it's purple on there but uh right at the tip of that point right here that's where you want to hold the bank that's where the most concentrated heat is see just like that you see where I'm holding it that's how you guys do it man and what this banker is so thick once you you don't want it to get it red right before red see not go hold it on it and then right before red like that didn't boo and then you just let it sit for like this is a thick banger so you can't even let it sit for like a minute and a half for real but I guess I'm taking another dive I heat it up to panga but all right I'll get to that boho well I was hitting it but yeah thanks for telling me with me men and learning I hope I helped halo halo halo halo dad if you

hash is pretty cool it allows you to smoke what you are trimming right away so as you can see here we've been trimming and our scissors have really gummed up and they've got a lot of resin and plant material stuck to them now this makes it a lot harder to trim so what we're going to do is just take this scalpel and scrape all of the resin glands and plant material right off of the blade so we're just going to take that scrape it and then roll it into a little ball now we're just going to scrape every single edge of our scissors and that's going to get us the most scissor hash possible and it's also going to make our scissors a lot easier to trim with and you'll be able to trim a lot faster right after you're done doing this so I'm just going to scrape everything off here now the cool thing about scissor hash is you can actually take this right now right off of your scissors flatten it out throw it on top of a bowl and smoke it well you are trimming and you'll get the flavors of your new harvest right away now you can also dab it or you know dry it out and use it later as well so once we're done scraping all of our scissors off we're just going to take some rubbing alcohol and a paper towel get the paper towel wet with the alcohol and just do the same thing basically wipe our scissors off to get any of the remaining resin glands that we weren't able to scrape off off of our scissors and I just like to rub all the sides of it and this will make your scissors not gummed up anymore and you'll be able to trim twice as fast or basically as fast as you were able to before your scissors got all gummed up so go ahead clean your scissors enjoy your scissor hash once again thanks for watching and if you liked our video please like comment share and subscribe you can

this unless you're spending hours modifying things and this is just some high guy in a garage of course I'll be pressing this a second time a little bit all right DIY doesn't work right pass it back to the pressing curl here mister I'm a bad little blob Playa dabbed up pretty soon you know the routine if you liked this please hit that thumbs up subscribe share follow me on Instagram getting told this is unique but I'm not getting as many views as I think or subscribers I'm not in a hurry and I'm not trying to be ungrateful I appreciate every one of you that watches this smells beautiful in here if you've never been around or I was impressed or anything like that it's amazing the terpenes if I wanted it shut it off I do have ideas on a couple other DIY draws and presses some of them will take a little bit of work I think it I might try to film that all separately and then spend the time on computer and try to edit it and show you how it works and how my ideas are that's a second press there you go so let's say that's definitely in the you know around twenty four twenty five percent THC range cuz that is quite a bit coming off of that once again that's Newcombe anyways you know how it is happy healthy hoots everybody don't be a fool clean it up to have a good one", "yew1LDIGi1U": "I okay let's go oh I'll go back to my youth to Jim today we have a Matt we were just can't returned

"6foOf4sH2T8": "yo what up YouTube alright guys I just ran some bubble hash I still got a [ __ ] little more to run this is just a little bit running around right now this is what I came out looking like these one that's the first I'm gonna take it out into some bedding that guys give me one second hopefully you guys can see this alright that right there is the first one that I run and I think that's the 90 micron and that one is this as a 30 micron same first run and that's the second one of the of the 30 and the and the 8 and the the 90 micron mixed together so that's what I ended up getting out of it I haven't weighed here the way that I take my my water out of my half guys there's a couple of different ways to you can just crumble it down and let it dry and put it on some cardboard or you can use a mat like this this is basically just a 25 micron mat and you just get the hash together you squeeze it together I'll show you on this one just squeeze it together and you squeeze out all the water and you can put a towel over it and so got all humidity out of it and what you're left with is the ball of hash and you can do this a few times you can do this as many times until you don't get no more eventually what's gonna happen is gonna get so sticky it's gonna stick to the mat as you can see it's already done in the past it'll get so sticky that it'll start sticking to the mat and it'll be really really really like putty and then from there on you can let it dry 24 to 48 hours depending on how dry you want it I don't like my hat my hair just stays pretty moist because it's pretty sticky it's usually dank I don't really use a lot of trim this is more buds than anything else but you can see how good the quality of the hash is and this is bubble hash guys people always talking about drying their hash out breaking it down there's a lot of different ways to do hash guys not just one way there's hash as part of the oldest concentrate ever I mean like the first concentrate on the oldest so there's so many different ways to use it and so many different ways to dry it and in consume it that people just don't realize how to do it or they just think that they know what they're talking about a lot of people in the world that you know that's fine you like to do it your way but everybody has a different way of doing it it's not just one way of doing it and your way isn't always the right way or the best way you know I'm saying just like this might not be the best way but I'm trying to show you guys the difference is and how to do it because a lot of people out there will give you bad information misinformation they don't know what they're talking about there's a lot of different ways to do it guys it's not just one way and I tell you this because it's not that difficult to make hash guys hash is probably the easiest and the most but the most easiest thing to make the concentrate ways just unless you're making like dry sift or something sorry guys my cats are trying it out you can see the quality of the hash that came out real gold and there's a little bit of plant material in there I got in there but not a lot this is all for personal use anyway I'm gonna probably press this all in the rosin guys I'll let this I'll probably press it out a few more times like I said what I'll do is I'll put it in the map I know it looks dirty that's all the rosin from all the other different types of paste and you can get a towel put one on the top one on the bottom you can push out all of that moisture and then what you're left with is just a block of hash or a couple blocks depending on how you do it I said there's a little bit of plant material in there but that's alright I'm thinking that mmm I'm gonna I'm gonna press this all in the rosin guys I probably have about pounds of that I'm gonna press enter into rosin guys and I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about most of this gonna be pressed into rosin guys you can see it's all buds and I got I got [ __ ] loads of it it's not the best trim in the world but it's a lot of Platt so right now I just this is stuff actually that I had in the freezer it was probably a bag about this size right here it's probably about half the size of this bag right here this is another one I'm gonna do tomorrow this is some other stuff that I have here and like I said all buds [Music] [Applause] and these are pretty contact guys that's all wet still come in the plant that was never dried this one that I just brought it was dry guys I let it dry out for about about four days before I actually froze it it was in between right but right before you got to cure it I guess but I just like I said I ran it made it easier on myself because I got so much material that I have to run it just makes it easier for myself and like I said I run the 25 micron I run the 90 micron and then I run the filter bag along with the work bag that's on the bottom right here and that's how I make my bubble hash case very simple very easy like I said it's one of the first concentrates ever made people like I say it's not hard to do guys and there's no wrong way to do it or to not do it here I'm saying and the only thing you can do wrong this by mixing your material too long because then you'll start getting client matter or the way the ways where I got plant matter of my is because these bags aren't exactly five gallons and they don't slip over the side so I have to leave them and stack like this and when I mix sometimes [ __ ] falls in between the bags and that's why I got material in my hash this is supposed to catch it this this bag here but like I said if it goes in between the top its there's nothing I can do it's gonna go into the next bag over and that's what happened what I'm mixing the the hash and all the buds and the eyes together but next time I'll make a full video guys I just wanted to show you guys the end product and how I put us out the water out of my out of my hash it's really easy guys there's not much to and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make hash if you having to sit there and listen to other people's BS about how they do it and how the right way and the right all this you know I mean hashes oil that's all it is it's just the using ice to extract it from the from the plat matter after you extract it you can press it out like I said you can just put it together in a ball put a rag on the bottom right on the top and you can press on all that moisture and by tomorrow this should be dry enough to press even by tonight even people have different different ways that they do it this is the way I do it and I've never had an issue with you guys if it's still a little moist you want to leave it you don't want to press anything that's wet guys you want to make sure that you're dry enough that that your press isn't gonna because what'll happen is if you if you try to press this wet or if it has moisture in it a lot of moisture yo your oils will come out real funky they'll come out looking either they'll come out mixed with water in it went with the rosin or you'll have a lot of steam and stuff coming off your off your press plates and just a lot of not nothing Goods gonna come from it so like I said people break down their hash they grind it down they put it into a granular that's not necessary you can leave it in a patty you just got to press it out guys that's what the that's where they give you these when you buy your rosin bags you can press out your hash and like I said I've used this thing for years and years and years and years I've actually replaced it this is his party like the third one but you can see all the the hash that gets left behind after pressing it even right now it's pretty sticky as you can see it's a it's gonna stay pretty sticking you can make this into full melt if you really wanted to you can you can press it back down uses some heat and a bottle and you can you can make it even better but that's just the one way of doing it guys and it's not the best way it's not the worst way it just works that's all that matters as long as you're getting what you're what you're looking for in the end see that's what will happen once you press out all the water the hash will start sticking to everything and I mean everything and then that's why I got all this extra [ __ ] on the bag so I usually make sure I pushed a lot of pressure on there and get out as much oil and what will happen is eventually normal water is gonna come out and it's just gonna start sticking to everything and getting rolled like putty like I say and then you'll end up fighting to get it off of the mat so you don't want to be pressing it too too much on this map because you'll have issues later on down the line with trying to get it off the mat like I say and you can use alcohol to clean this if you want to afterwards I just buy a new one but you can do it however you want you can clean it with alcohol when you're done and reuse it again I don't do that I just keep using it and using it too I figure I need a new one and that's it guys that's probably about I don't know five six grams of hash maybe a little more but it still looks a little moisture in there so we'll let it dry out and then we'll go through it away it's May I have two little work guys so have a good one be safe", "xi0c1QudhdM":

of to not my life and definitely didn't taste like tuna or smell fishy which is a good thing as if I would smoke it anyway then but anyways this came an invisible container I don't know the stats I'll see if we can get anything out of this of course I'll do a second press after this first moment [Music] [Music] pretty good for first squish [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah leave some more in there if you're gonna press your grass I don't care if you grow it yourself or buy it putting that Diddy back in and what do you have dental things like you're not you're gonna gain it's gonna bring it to the right humidity somehow and you're gonna get pretty good returns [Music] not as much but definitely something worth feeding up pretty sticky I can't give it all up here I need to get a cooling stoner piece of aluminum like the Phileas Fogg uses [Music] saying I got point one of that tuna cush anyways hope you guys like this video if you do please hit those buttons share subscribe tell people about

hoots and if you're gonna smoke rose on her shattered first empty your bladder", "v7Etg_PqcW4": "four and a half grams of bubble hash all trimmed by the way my temps I'm shooting at 170 today I could have piled around a little bit cooler but I think I did all right I think I got almost all of it back might be a hash brown I'd be four grams in there lost a half gram but not bad for just extra stuff that you weren't expecting again a little bit of law right there for the most part the rest of its clean and a little bit of lower back there that's probably right at the end when I was pressing but all in all not bad of a job next time I'll go a little cooler this is some really really sticky bubble hash I dried it out for about two days two and a half days and it's pretty pretty well dried out so I pressed it and this is what I got pretty quality rosin I'll scrape off the back parts are and just having it with the hash or the X leftover hash that's in there but all along I'll bet and if you guys save your pucks your uh your bags like I save all my bags and all my presses whether it's flour or if it's rosin or whatever it is bubble hash I saved everything and you can throw this in a crock pot and extract all the oil out of it and there's still a lot of oil in these you can just see it just about the looking at the flour here that I didn't press all the way out there's a lot of oil still in there you save those throw throw them all in a crock pot at the end of the month or whatever however long it takes you to collect them I usually do quite a bit so I press quite a bit but throw them in a crock-pot however much oil whether it's coconut oil or a butter and you can make either orang use it to cook with awesome awesome way to make your edibles this is a good way to make edibles too if you're just gonna use the oil out of all your trimmings you can use all this oil and you can use it to make edibles or you can just dab it perfectly fine just dab it but it's up to you this is just some hints I'm throwing at you guys the press I'm pressing today with is the Dada press the 3 by 3 plates mmm this is the actual press itself I got this on Amazon for like 50 bucks I think it's 12 ton press and like I say I'm using dab press plates and heaters awesome awesome products really really well built I like it I've never had an issue with it my temps are always right on my oils always come out an excellent the biggest amount you can press with this 3 by 3 is a half an ounce and that's if you compact it pretty good coat around so that I've noticed out the best as far as yields go and just quality depending on what kind of flour you're pressing for oils like I said you can do up to up to an ounce of oil hash or something like that if you want to press that much I just pressed four and a half grams right here of oil I'm pretty sure I got about 4 grams of rosin there so maybe a little under 4 but right there pretty close to it but all in all looking really good in here guys I like I like this press well a good investment for solvent lifts extracts especially if you don't like be a chose or even want to mess with butane in any way this is a really good way to do it you can buy a smaller press and this is just what I found at the time I was looking and it's a big press isn't all happen to be so that's what I got talk to him press well yeah everything is doing really good the flower tent right here I got the cush time since he started here from outside I brought her indoors and I took the Gorilla Glue out there to let that flower out through the summer he started flowering early which is because they were outside for I put him out there early so but they're pretty decent-sized clients reduce in size - she's in a 15-gallon fabric watch she's about a good three feet tall three and a half feet tall she's ladies got her blood structures really nice and starting to develop I need to feed her today actually she needs to be fed a flower regiment so I'm gonna go ahead and feed her a party transition feed or something like nothing too heavy and then that's it sorry guys my cat likes to go into ten I gotta keep her out but yeah everything is doing really good I got the Mars hydro SP 150 running in here I do have the TS 600 but it's not on at the moment I do run this one as well it just keeps the better light across the entirety of the tent truck is it such a big plant if it was a smaller plant I wouldn't worry about it so much but it's such a white plant that it literally takes up every corner of this tent mmm good buds so I don't want to lose any of this but I'm gonna try to keep it all I know I won't get everything like it would have been outdoors but uh that's why I added the extra light but it's only 240 watts 245 watts total so that's not really a lot for this tent actually that light was designed for this tent for entire coverage but like I said so it's just so wide and so thick I'm gonna run both of them in here and yeah it's from the Mars hydro they filter awesome product the tents also more hydro the two lights in there are Mars hydro really awesome awesome products they make I'm also running co2 tmb gotta have the enhancer in the house because this is a sealed environment no no air exchange at all other than what's in the tent that's why I had to seal two in there it helps the environment especially if you're not running ventilation but yeah all I'm all she's doing really good she smells amazing see how she finishes off all right guys have a good one be safe", "MS6BjTDtiOM": "cap dank here again in the smash lab today we're going to be using the nug smash or mini and we'll be showing you how to do a three and a half gram press on the new nug-nug smash 4 mini first of all what I wanted to show you folks is how to adjust the temperature setting on the mini itself you're gonna come to this particular button here you're gonna hit that button and then it's gonna start to flash and you can move your setting up or down and today we're gonna do this particular press at about 200 and let's say 15 degrees then let's make it to 20 okay once it's it can go over hit our button and we're ready to go now we have to wait for for the mini to heat up to our to our pressing temperature so in the meantime we'll get ourselves a three and a half gram hundred and sixty micron bag again we're gonna load it bottle textile so what we're gonna use today is we're gonna be using some of this key lime pie that was grown by Miller farms in rough-and-ready California just want to give a shout out to them so let's wake up three and a half grams of this beautiful flower I'm on the money okay like I said we're gonna load these this bag bottom textile which what that is it's been a load up and flatten into a coin versus some people just load them in flat and the nut smashers are really made for bottle tech that's how they design these and it's gonna give you maximum yield bottle textile so again what we do bottle textile is we fold in the corners right they use a little tool like this because it definitely helps to get the corners into place once you get the corners in I don't think to adjust it with my fingers yeah once again that's about what we're looking for bottle textile so let's let's lay it up beautiful flower okay bottle textile what we're trying to do is set up ourselves with a really good foundation here and just continue adding to that and what this will allow us to do is if it's packed in here correctly we will be able to you'll get a coin puck at the end of the press out of this and bottle textile should be something like that there okay that's about again what we're looking for once we load it up this point we want to cut the bag till we leave about a half an inch okay and again I'm gonna fold the top like a present and the last corner here it is when we load into the machine itself okay so looks like we're getting close to our temperature here so let me get a piece of parchment paper come down here you're gonna open up our open up our our plate these are 2.5 inch plates start our press what we want to do is slowly bring the plates up see how the bag is kind of accordion in on itself start the extraction process yes and we're gonna let our press go for 2 minutes and 30 seconds during the process with the mini you definitely want to keep it under maximum pressure and I think I see some rosin yes starting to flow they're golden beautiful resin about another minute here on the press [Music] about another 30 seconds or so here looking good ok we got 10 seconds left here paper together release your plates looks pretty good to me once again captain dick here in the smash lab with the nug Smasher mini"}
